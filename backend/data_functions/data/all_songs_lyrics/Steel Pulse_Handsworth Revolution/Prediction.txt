Prediction LyricsPrediction, prediction foretold
Prediction, yeh, from the days of old
Prediction, yeh, from way back when
The years Jah send, years Jah send
Prediction a long, long time ago
Selassie was neglected, tell me when?
Like the tales of the Messiah, yah
All over again
Garvey was rejected tell me when?
Unlike the Baptist he has kept his head
I said vank!
William Gordon and Paul Bogle led
A rebellion cause they used their heads
But had their necks in a noose
Martyrs of freedom, freedom condemned
But Jah Jah cut them loose. Hen heh
Prophesised that, we would suffer by
Those who think themselves superior to
Our colour, yes sah
Descendants of Naiman the Leper
Ask Elisha
Offsprings of Naiman the Leper
Ask Elisha
If a lie, ask Elisha, ask Elisha
If a lie, ask Elisha, ask Elisha
If a lie, ask Elisha, ask Elisha
If a lie, ask Elisha, ask Elisha
If a lie, ask Elisha, ask Elisha
If a lie, ask Elisha, ask Elisha
Tomorrow's what we're on about
Tomorrow's what we're on about
Not yesterday
It's up to man to understand
To have success upon this land
He better have some faith
Have
Some
Faith
Repeat
Have, some, have some, faith!
Have, some, have some, faith!
The impossible have a habit of happening
If you think a lie I atell ask Elisha
Ask Elisha ... ask Ellsha...Embed
