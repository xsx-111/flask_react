Sound Check LyricsIf anything should mash up my head Sah
Play the music me can't dead
Jah in music prolongs gives me life to
Praise Jah
In motion with music getting what we want
Getting what we need
In motion with music getting what we want
Getting what we need
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Dancing, stepping in a ridim fashion
Dancing, go deh, go deh
Dancing, let the music rock me
Dancing away
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
No burdens to haunt me
No pressures to taunt me
Cos Zion is
Cos Zion I
Cos Zion is
Cos Zion I
Destiny yeh
A children rock (like so)
A children skank (like so)
A children rock (like so)
A children skank (like so)
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
I love Jah, I praise Jah
Forget me not, no
No burdens to haunt me
No pressures to taunt me
Cos Zion is
Cos Zion I
Cos Zion is
Cos Zion I
Destiny yeh
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
Rock little children, rock
A children rock (little children rock)
A children roll (little children roll)
A children rock (little children rock)
A children roll (little children roll)
A children rock me can't dead
Play the music me can't dead
Play the music me can't dead
Play the music me can't dead
I love Jah, praise Jah
I love Jah, praise Jah
I love Jah, praise Jah
I love Jah, praise Jah
Motion with music
Motion with music
In motion with music...Embed
