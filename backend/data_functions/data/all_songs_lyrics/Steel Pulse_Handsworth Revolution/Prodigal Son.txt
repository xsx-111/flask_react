Prodigal Son LyricsWoy! Desperation has return
Sodom and Gomorrah no deh yah so!
Woy desperation has return over yonder
Sodom and Gomorrah no deh yah so!
Wild one, you are like the Prodigal Son yeah
And if you're the Prodigal Son, my friend
Then you're the one, you
Left taking your only possession
Your culture
To enter a world known for hacklings
In abundance, yeah
The hustlers of life
Have hooked and drained you from the man
Form the man that you used to be, turn your back on us
Return Rastaman where you came from
The land of your forefathers
Reaching the gates with your two long hands
Searching out for clean water
Wild one...
Prodigal come forth and rejoice with your voice
To the heavens
Chant some song, chant some song
Prodigal come forth and repent
Rastafari sins forgiven
Woy! Desperation has return...
One has returned without one's soul
And has squandered all his possessions
Let us cleanse your body now
From your service to the swine, because
You've been dead and now to anoint your head
With wisdom, knowledge and overstanding
A lesson has been taught unto you my friend
Time for a feast and rejoicing
Wild one...
Chorus
Woy! Desperation has return
Prodigal has returned to his culture
Prodigal has returned give him water
Prodigal has returned, has returned...1Embed
