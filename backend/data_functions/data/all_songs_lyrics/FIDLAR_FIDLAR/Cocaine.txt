Cocaine LyricsYou take Sally and I’ll take Sue
There ain’t no difference between the two
Coke’s for whores, it ain't for men
They say it kills but they don’t know when
Cocaine running round in my
Cocaine running round in my
Cocaine running round in my brain
Woke up this morning had a hunger pain
And all I want for breakfast is my good cocaine
Oh mama! Come here quick!
That old cocaine's about to make me sick
Cocaine running round in my
Cocaine running round in my
Cocaine running round in my brain
Cocaine running round in my
Cocaine running round in my
Cocaine running round in my brain

I’m spending all my cash on cheap cocaine
And I've been wasted almost every day
And I don't know what to do
It kinda sucks being twenty-two
And now I'm back to pissing in my car
I'm back to doing lines in bathroom bars
And I don't know what to do
It kinda sucks being twenty-two
We were high as fuck, on your back porch
And you didn't care anymore
But are you really gonna kick me out, in this rain
And I knew you would
I would've paid the rent, if I could
And I know you do
Mean everything when you're all fucked on booze
I'm spending all my cash on cheap cocaine
And I've been wasted, every day9Embed
