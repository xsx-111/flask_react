Whore LyricsWhy did you go betray me?
You're such a whore
I stay at home drinking
You're such a whore
Why did you go betray me?
You're such a whore
I stay at home drinking
You're such a whore
Why did you go betray me?
You got no soul
You left me in the valley
This ain't my whore
Whore, whore
Whore, whore
This ain't my whore
She ain't yours now
Why did you go betray me?
You're such a whore
I stay at home drinking
You're such a whore
Why did you go betray me?
You got no soul
You left me in the valley
This ain't my whore
Whore, whore
Whore, whore
This ain't my whore
She ain't yours now
This ain't my whore
She ain't yours nowEmbed
