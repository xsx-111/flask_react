Blackout Stout Lyrics
Told my girl I can't see the light
Take my hand and it'll be alright
Should've never gone out tonight

I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home

Walk alone and it's hard to breathe
Take a hit, I'm falling to my knees
Somebody's following me
Brother's laughing at me on the phone
Let's go into unknown
Can't wait to be alone

I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way

Gotta find a place to sleep
Skid row lost a couple of teeth
Somebody's following me
Woke up in my dealer's car
Tattoo on my arm
F-I-D-L-A-R

I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my way home
I can't find my wayEmbed
