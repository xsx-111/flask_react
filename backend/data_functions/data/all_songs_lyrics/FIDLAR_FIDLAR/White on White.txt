White on White LyricsGot no job got no money got no place to be
So they said there gonna make a man outta me
Got no job got go money got no place to be
So they said there gonna make a man outta me (me, me, me)
(Arrrrhh)
Got no job got no money got no place to be
Took me out set me up sent me overseas
Got no job got no money got no place to be
Now its time to serve your country no
(Arrrrhh)
(Arrrrhh)
Got a job got money got a place to be
Running through the desert trying to find the beach
Got a job got money got a place to be
Running through the desert trying to find me (me me) no(Arrrrhh)2Embed
