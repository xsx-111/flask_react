Shitty Jobz (Japanese Version Bonus Track) Lyrics
Well I figured out how to count every time you look around
Staring at your face on the screen of my phone
Tried a line, tricked my mind telling it not to cry
All I really want is for you to go home

And every time you close your eyes
I start to fall and then I die

Well I'm twenty-four, looking for
Someone who'll hold me more
You came around and you gave me a beer
Took my hand and raised it up
Yelling "We don't give a fuck"
And man I really could die right here

And every time you close your eyes
I start to fall and then I die
And all I want is not that hard
To hear you talk about your shitty job
And I get lost, yeah I get lost

Well I figured out what to say
And I think its kinda gay
But I don't give a fuck, I don't wanna be alone
You grabbed my hand and held it tight
And said to me it's alright
And you're reason why I'm not sinking like a stone
And every time you close your eyes
I start to fall and then I die
And all I want is not that hard
To hear you talk about your shitty job
And I get lost, yeah I get lost
All I want is not that hard
To hear you talk about your shitty job
And I get lost, yeah I get lostEmbed
