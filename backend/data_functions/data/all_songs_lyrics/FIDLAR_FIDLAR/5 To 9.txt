5 To 9 LyricsOne, Two, Three
Was three o'clock! (Three o'clock!) in the morning, double vision with my homies
Four o'clock! (Four o'clock!) feeling funny, got no car and we got no money
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh haaaahhhh
Five o'clock! (Five o'clock!) bumming, sunset, drinking forties till we canâ€™t see
Six o'clock! (Six o'clock!) get too bent and ask if Evan's got anything
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh haaaahhhh
Was Eight o'clock! (Eight o'clock!) feeling shitty, coming down off cheap PCP
Nine o'clock!, (Nine o'clock!) drunk and driving, on my way to Culver City
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh haaaahhhh
Ten o'clock! (Ten o'clock!) stuck in traffic, taking bong rips in the backseat
Twelve o'clock! (Twelve o'clock!) get arrested on my way to LA County
Ahhhhhh ahhhhh haaaahhhh1Embed
