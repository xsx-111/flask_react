Awkward (iTunes Bonus Track) Lyrics
Well every time you come on over I just wanna listen
I know you got some issues and I know that you just miss him
I gotta fever just to see her feelin' like a stalker
And didn't know I'm really good at making you feel awkward

I'm at a party and I'm barfin' I can barely see
And every time I talk to you well I can never breathe
I'm gettin' drunker I'm a bummer I should just call her
And didn't know I'm really good at making you feel awkward

And didn't know I'm really good at making you feel awkward
And didn't know I'm really good at making you feel awkward

I got no job, I got no money, got no self-esteem
I take a Xanax every morning for anxiety
I'll take a beer and take another then I'm gonna call her
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and makin' it feel awkward

I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward
I'll probably end up fuckin' up and make it super awkward2Embed
