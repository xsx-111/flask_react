LDA LyricsUsed you when I was lonely since I was 18
You were the one and only guy I would see
Dyed my hair and got skinny, just cause you told me to
People just wouldn’t believe me
When I told them it was you
It was you
Bye, LDA
My life won’t be the same
Dyed my hair and got skinny, just cause you told me to
People just wouldn’t believe me
When I told them it was you
It was you
(Chorus x2)Embed
