Wake Bake Skate LyricsWake! Bake! Skate!
I do a bunch of drugs
I'm a fiend and an addict
I'm all methed up, watchin' television static
And I'm gonna try and make it
For another year
Just to hang out with my best friends
And drink a lot of beer
And I'm so fuckin' cheap
(So fuckin' cheap)
And I'm so fuckin' broke
(So fuckin' broke)
And I don't have a job
And I don't have a home
Don't have a life
And I'm always stoned
Wake! Bake! Skate!
I'm so strung out I can't even see
Skating so hard I can't even breathe
But I gotta bomb this hill
And I gotta shoot this line
Gotta get my King for a dollar 99
And I'm so fuckin' cheap
(So fuckin' cheap)
And I'm so fuckin' broke
(So fuckin' broke)
And I don't have a job
And I don't have a phone
Don't have a life
And I'm always stoned
Wake! Bake! Skate!
And I'm so fuckin' cheap
And I'm so fuckin' broke
And I don't have a job
And I don't have a phone
Don't have a life
And I'm always stoned
So fuckin' cheap
(So fuckin' cheap)
And I'm so fuckin' broke
(So fuckin' broke)
And I don't have a job
And I don't have a phone
Don't have a life
And I'm always stoned
So fuckin' cheap
(So fuckin' cheap)
And I'm so fuckin' broke
(So fuckin' broke)
And I don't have a job
And I don't have a phone
Don't have a life
And I'm always stoned
Wake! Bake! Skate!
And crash!4Embed
