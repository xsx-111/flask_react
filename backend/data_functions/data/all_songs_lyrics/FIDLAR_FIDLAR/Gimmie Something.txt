Gimmie Something LyricsHe’s been wasting his time
Running out of all kinds of luck
He’s been going down the line
Living in the back of his truck
With his all American steel reserve
He puts it in the bag and he sits on a curb
And he says
Hey, come on, give me money
Hey, come on, give me money
You’ve been living your life doing all kinds of drugs
Well I’ve been spending my time trying not to fall in love
When you come over with your dirty spoon
Stay on my couch and you howl at the moon and you say
Hey, come on, give me something
Hey, come on, give me something
Hey, come on, give me something
Hey, come on, give me something1Embed
