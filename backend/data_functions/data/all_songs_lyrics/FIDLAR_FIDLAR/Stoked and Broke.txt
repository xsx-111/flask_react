Stoked and Broke LyricsI don’t care if you think it’s cool
Fucked up and I'm ditching school
I don’t wanna go back to town
With my face to the ground and I’m upside down
I just wanna get really high
Smoke weed until I die
I don’t ever wanna get a job
Cause I'm fucked up today and nothing's wrong
Gettin' pissed and bombin' hills
Cocaine and shitty pills
Get head in a broken car
With the windows up and the lights turned off
There’s nothing wrong with living like this
All my friends are pieces of shit
Busted chin and a bloody nose
And I'm covered in dirt from my head to my toesEmbed
