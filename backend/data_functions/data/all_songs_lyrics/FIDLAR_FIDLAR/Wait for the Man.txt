Wait for the Man LyricsSo you're just a kid
When will you g-g-g-get it?
Always asking questions
When will you g-g-g-get it?
But I wait and I wait
And I wait and I wait
And you're gone, so I wait
And you're gone anyway-way-way-way
Cold cock
And shaky hands
Never get the money
To the man
Make him wait, make him wait
Make him wait, make him wait
And you're gone, so I wait
And you're gone anyway-way-way-way1Embed
