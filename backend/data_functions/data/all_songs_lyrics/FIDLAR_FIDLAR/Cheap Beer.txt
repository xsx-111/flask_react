Cheap Beer Lyrics
Me and my friends in a hundred dollar Volvo
Busting down the street while cruising Alvarado
Getting fucked up on the 101
Shootin' our guns and having fun
Forty beers later and a line of speed
Eight ball of blow and a half pound of weed
Heading down the track to Mexico
Fucked on beer and staying gold

I drink cheap beer, so what? Fuck you
I drink cheap beer, so what? Fuck you

As I was saying all that shit like that Vietnam shit
Beer's always better with a bag around it
Dan's in the back puking on my seat
But he was drinking cheap beer, so it's OK by me
Supposed to be in Santa Monica at 8 a.m
Fuck the clock and drink red again
Twenty three years I've been drinking cheap beer
Sixty one more, but from a liquor store

I drink cheap beer, so what? Fuck you
I drink cheap beer, so what? Fuck you

I drink cheap beer, so what? Fuck you
I drink cheap beer, so what? Fuck you5Embed
