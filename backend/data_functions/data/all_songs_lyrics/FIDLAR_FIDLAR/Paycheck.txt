Paycheck LyricsCold sweat, the summer’s gone
Wake up, nobody’s home
I got trouble my way, I guess I’m here to stay
Somebody told me to leave ‘cause I ain’t looking so great
Somebody’s running out, I’m shooting everything
Did I sell my TV, or did I give it away?
Busted, now it’s on the ground
Making, why you’re coming 'round?
I got trouble my way, I guess I’m here to stay
Somebody told me to leave ‘cause I ain’t looking so great
Somebody’s running out, I’m shooting everything
Did I sell my TV, or did I give it away?Embed
