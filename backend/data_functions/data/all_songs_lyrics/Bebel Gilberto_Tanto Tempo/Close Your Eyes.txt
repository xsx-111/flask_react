Close Your Eyes LyricsYou know you can feel the breeze with patience of a lifetime
Dance above the trees to the rhythm in your mind
Gently touching your skin inside out
Floating on the seas, it carries me around
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
Penso em você, sinto um gosto de mar
Nos grãos de areia, e eu a rolar
Vou rodar o mundo , mas aqui é o meu lugar
Eu vou rodar o mundo mas aqui é o meu lugar
Translation:
Thinking about you, I feel the taste of the sea
In the sand grains, I am rolling
Gonna go around the world, but here is my place
I'll go around the world, but here is my place)
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
Since the day I left, from the start
I can feel megabytes of memories in my heart
Wish I disappear and wake up in some other place
Where there's no pain or fear, is simple like 'Hello'
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be alone
You can close your eyes and never be aloneEmbed
