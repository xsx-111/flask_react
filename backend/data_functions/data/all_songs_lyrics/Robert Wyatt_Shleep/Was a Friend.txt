Was a Friend LyricsYou've been so kind
I know, I know
So why did I hurt you?
I didn't mean to hurt you
But I'll-
Funny kind of greeting, not exactly hostile
Not exactly facing, not exactly turning away
Not exactly frowning, not exactly smiling
Lurking by the door
Without a sign of wanting to move
Though hardly friendly, not an angry gesture
Did it make. Just quite unnerving
It's been a long time
I almost forgot were we buried the hatchet
"Bin a long time no see", (pidgin English
Native to none). After several silences
A cautious head nod. This could take forever
Did it want to come for a dig? It did
Not answer. I was feeling restless at the door
Ashamed of my fears. Where WAS the hatchet?
Suddenly was gone. I woke up
Feeling stupid. No-one else awake
Though dawn was only minutes away
Quietly I rose to fill the morning pee pot
What a silly dream
Not like what really would have occurred
Old wounds are healing
Faded scars are painless â€“ just an itch
We are forgiven
It's been a long timeEmbed
