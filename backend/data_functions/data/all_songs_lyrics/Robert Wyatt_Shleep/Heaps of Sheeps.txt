Heaps of Sheeps LyricsI realised my fists were clenched
I stretched my fingers to relax
Still not sleeping, I tried counting sheep
One by one
They leapt across the fence
Constructed for them
Right to left
Across the fence I had constructed
Having jumped
They refused further direction
Each sheep, where it landed
Refusing to exit, remained
(Creating a vast writhing heap
Growing fast on the left)
Try as I might
I could not stop them entering
Once again
Try as they might
Not one could leave the stage
I realised my fists were clenched
I stretched my fingers
Each sheep were it landed
Refusing to exit, remained
(Creating a vast writhing heap
Growing quickly on one side)
Try as they might
Not one could leave the stage
Try as I might
I could not stop them entering
Once again
No longer daring to close my eyes
Still not sleeping
I realised my goose was cooked
I wandered shipshaped on the shoreEmbed
