September in the Rain LyricsThe leaves of brown dame tumbling down, remember?
At September, in the rain
The sun came out just like a dying ember
That September in the rain
For every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops stopped to sing a sweet refrain
And spring is here, to me it's still September
At September, in the rain
For every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops stopped to sing a sweet refrain
And spring is here, to me it's still September
At September, in the rainEmbed
