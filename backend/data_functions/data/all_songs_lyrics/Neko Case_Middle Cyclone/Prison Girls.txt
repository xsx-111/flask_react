Prison Girls LyricsWhere am I tonight? La da da
My hotel room won't remember me
And this dream will die, die by morning
And this dream will not remember me
Awakened by a droning voice
"I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes"
Is it a lady or is it a man?
Humming helicopters through the blades of a fan
"I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes"
"I love your long shadows and your gunpowder eyes"
On my feet to chase it down
The light switch spooks and runs away
I stumble back and hit the floor
Long shadows crawl beneath the door
To a passage, so poorly lit
There are moths flying away from it
Who am I tonight?
My hotel room won't remember me
From darkness, enter prison girls
Pushing mops and kicking pails
Now's my chance, I clasp my chest
And declare unto my audience
"I love your long shadows and your gun powder eyes"
"I love your long shadows and your gun powder eyes"
The prison girls are not impressed
They're the ones who have to clean this mess
They've traded more for cigarettes
Than I have managed to express
Filing past, miles long
My cheek is frozen to the floor
The prison girls have filled their beds
Their thoughts to dry above their heads
(I'll wear them in the morning)
"I love your long shadows and your gun powder eyes"
"I love your long shadows and your gun powder eyes"4Embed
