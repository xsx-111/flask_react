The Next Time You Say Forever LyricsI hear the tiniest sparks and the tenderest sounds
Diving music, drowning the sound
Waltzing with the hairs upon my arms
Then your fight or flight alarm
And you tremble and you stumble
And you scrape up your palms
I can't stay here to hold your hand
I’ve been away for so long
I’ve lost my taste for home
And that's a dirty, fallow feeling
To be the dangling ceiling
From when the roof came crashing down
Peeling in the heat, vanish in the rain
The next time you say "forever," I will punch you in your face
Just because you don't believe it doesn't mean I didn't mean it
You never know when I’ll show you the never
You never know when I'll show you the neverEmbed
