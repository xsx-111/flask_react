This Tornado Loves You LyricsMy love, I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough
I want you
I carved your name across three counties
And ground it in with bloody hides
Their broken necks will line the ditch
'Til you "Stop it! Stop it! Stop this madness!"
I want you
I have waited with a glacier’s patience
Smashed every transformer with every trailer
'Til nothing was standing
Sixty-five miles wide
But still you are nowhere, still you are nowhere
Nowhere in sight
Come out to meet me, run out to meet me
Come into the light
Climb the boxcars to the engine
Through the smoke and to the sky
Your rails have always outrun mine, so I
Picked them up and crashed them down
In a moment close to now
Cause I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss, I miss
How you'd sigh yourself to sleep
When I’d rake the springtime across your sheets
My love, I am the speed of sound
I left them motherless, fatherless
Their souls dangling inside-out from their mouths
But it's never enough
My love, I’m an owl on the sill in the evening
But morning finds you
Still warm and breathing
This tornado loves you
What will make you believe me?4Embed
