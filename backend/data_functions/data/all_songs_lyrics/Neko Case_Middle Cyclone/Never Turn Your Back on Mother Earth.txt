Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth LyricsWhen she's on her best behaviour
Don't be tempted by her favours
Never turn your back on mother earth
Towns are hurled from A to B
By hands that look so smooth to me
Never turn your back on mother earth
Grasp at straws that don't want grasping
Gaze at clouds that come down crashing
Never turn your back on mother earth
Three days and two nights away from my friends
Amen to anything that brings quick return to my friends
To my friends
I'll admit I was unfaithful
From now I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother earthEmbed
