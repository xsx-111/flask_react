People Got a Lotta Nerve LyricsSo the saying says, "an elephant never forgets"
Standing in a concrete cave, swaying sad and insane
They walked over the ocean in their dreams they dream awake
Until the lights grew dim, until the cop cars came
Everybody tells me, this is crazy, yes, I know it
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater
But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya
You know they call them killer whales
But you seem surprised when it pinned you down
To the bottom of the tank, where you can't turn around
It took half your leg and both your lungs
When I craved I ate hearts of sharks, I know you know it
I'm a man-man-man, man-man-man-eater
But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya
Yes I'm a man-man-man, man-man, man-eater
But still you're surprised-prised-prised when I eat ya
It will end again in bullets fired
It will end again in bullets fired1Embed
