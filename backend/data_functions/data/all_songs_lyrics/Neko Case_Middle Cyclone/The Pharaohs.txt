The Pharaohs LyricsWe were married in the mirrored hall when I was sixteen
You spoke the words, "I love girls in white leather jackets"
That was good enough for love
It was good enough for me
I listened in when you thought you were alone
Calling the Sphinx on a tornado's phone
Who knows what you meant?
I only heard what I wanted
You said I was your blue, blue baby and you were right
You said I was your blue, blue baby and you were right
You wandered the halls all the night time
My body burned, my legs ached
But you never came to bed, you just left me there awake
You kept me wanting, wanting, wanting
Like the wanting in the movies and the hymns
I want the pharaohs but there's only men
I want the pharaohs but there's only men
You said I was your blue, blue baby and you were right
You said I was your blue, blue baby and you were rightEmbed
