Middle Cyclone LyricsBaby, why am I worried now?
Did someone make a fool of me
Before I could show 'em how it's done?
Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na na
I can't give up acting tough
It's all that I'm made of
Can't scrape together quite enough
To ride the bus to the outskirts of the fact that I need love
There were times that I tried
One for every glass of water that I spilled
Next to the bed, retching pennies in a boiling well, in a dream
That, at once, becomes a foundry of mute and heavy bells
They shake me deaf and dumb
Say someone made a fool of me
'Fore I could show 'em how it's done
It was so clear to me
That it was almost invisible
I lie across the path waiting
Just for a chance to be
A spider web trapped in your lashes
For that, I would trade you my empire for ashes
But I choke it back, how much I need love
Na na na na na, na na na
Na na na na na, na na naEmbed
