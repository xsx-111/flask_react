Rainmaker LyricsRainmaker, rainmaker
Rainmaker, rainmaker
Rainmaker, rainmaker
The sky is gray just by the touch of your hand
Rainmaker, rainmaker
Rainmaker, rainmaker
Rainmaker, rainmaker
Make me some rain, make all my crops grow tall
Rainmaker, rainmaker
Rainmaker, rainmaker
Rainmaker, rainmaker
The sky is gray, the ground is so hard
It's been cracked by the sun
Rainmaker, you know my work's never doneEmbed
