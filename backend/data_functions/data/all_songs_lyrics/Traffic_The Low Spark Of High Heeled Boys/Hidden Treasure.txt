Hidden Treasure LyricsTake a walk down by, take a walk down by the river
There's a lot that you, there's a lot that you can learn
If you've got a mind that's open, if you've got a heart that yearns
If you listen to, if you listen to the water
You will hear the sound, you will hear the sound of life
There's a million different voices, there is happiness and strife
Message in the deep, from a strange eternal sleep
That is waiting there, that is waiting there for you
Like hidden treasure
If you listen to, if you listen to the water
You will hear the sound, you will hear the sound of life
There's a million different voices, there is happiness and strifeEmbed
