Driving Through a Dream LyricsStraighter than the flat line freeway
That's the way your hair falls down
We could watch the trains from the tightrope
Chase the dark
Out here on a desert fault line
That's the way the world goes 'round
I'm losing track of time inside this racing heart
Your racing heart
Staring out the window with your, with your head on my shoulder
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving though a dream)
Riding through the heart of the dark that you fought like a soldier
(Staring out the window with your)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
Clinging to your late-night courage
Anything to pass the time
Lying in the back seat trying not to fall apart
Waiting for your life to start
Staring out the window with your, with your head on my shoulder
(Staring out the window with your)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream)
Riding through the heart of the dark that you fought like a soldier
(Staring out the window with your)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
And the night is long, the road is longer
You say, you sleep better when I'm awake
I'll stay awake for you
Staring out the window with your, with your head on my shoulder
(Staring out the window with your)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream)
Riding through the heart of the dark that you fought like a soldier
(Staring out the window with your)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
(Uh oh oh)
Try to get some sleep, we'll be driving through a dream1Embed
