Cecilia and the Satellite Lyrics
I locked myself in a hotel room
Then waited all night for the walls to move
I’ve loved some girls that I barely knew
I’ve made some friends, and I’ve lost some, too
Crashed my car, I was seventeen
My mother in the seat riding next to me
The things I’ve learned from a broken mirror
How a face can change when a heart knows fear

For all the things my eyes have seen
The best by far is you

If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

I’ve café-crawled through Amsterdam
Been around the world with a punk rock band
And I’ve seen London, and I’ve played Japan
I’ve been knocked down; I got up again
For all the places I have been
I’m no place without you

If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky

For all the things my hands have held
The best by far is you

If I could fly, then I would know
What life looks like from up above and down below
I’d keep you safe, I’d keep you dry
Don’t be afraid, Cecilia, I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky
And you’re the sky
I’m the satellite
And you’re the sky
And you’re the sky15Embed
