High Dive Lyrics
I took the train home, facing backwards
Another hopeless chase
Echo Park, Indian summer
I wrote a new song about your new life
Like steps I retrace
Block letters in your little black notebook, yeah

Flashbacks get me close
I'm almost there

Headlight in the driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Out there on the high dive
You dance with your headphones on and I
Could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's

Black jacket, a blue motorbike
Pass the mission in the moonlight
Teenagers in the alley kissing
Smell of gas burn, saw your street sign
I'm doing eighty in a forty-five
Throwing shadows you could hear if you listen, yeah
Flashbacks get me close
I'm almost there

Headlights in the driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Out there on the high dive
You dance with your headphones on and I
Could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Oh, dancing to someone else's

Flashbacks get me close
But I'm staring at someone else's

Headlights in your driveway
You stand in the window waiting
The stars are out tonight
One million fires burning
Meet me on the high dive
You'll dance with your headphones on
So I could watch you all night long
Dancing to someone else's song (song)
Oh, dancing to someone else's song (song)
Oh, dancing to someone else's song
Someone else's song, to someone else's song
To someone else's, someone else's, someone else's song3Embed
