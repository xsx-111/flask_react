See Her on the Weekend LyricsUp around ten with a headache kicking
Guess I fell asleep with a cigarette
My girl's back home with the morning sick
Got a baby on the way, not here yet
And I'm alright, I think we're good
Yeah, I drink more than the doctors say I should
I've been a little hard to reach, but my girl is at the beach
And I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her at the end of the week
Friday comes, lately I'm sleeping
Until the sun fills up my rented room
I pack my things, get my car started
Yeah I've been gone but I'll be home real soon
Cell phone's dead, and she's calling
Message box is full
Up around ten with a headache kicking
Guess I fell asleep with a cigarette
My girl's back home with the morning sick
Got a baby on the way, not here yet
And I'm alright, I think we're good
Yeah, I drink more than the doctors say I should
I've been a little hard to reach, but my girl is at the beach
And I'll see her on the weekend
And I'll see ya on the weekend
I'll see ya on the weekend
I'll see her on the weekend
I'll see her at the end of the week
Friday comes, and she's calling
Message box is full
Up around ten with a headache kicking
Guess I fell asleep with a cigarette
My girl's back home with the morning sick
Got a baby on the way, not here yet
And I'm alright, I think we're good
Yeah, I drink a little more than the doctors say I should
I've been a little hard to reach, but I know you're at the beach
And I'll see ya on the weekend
And I'll see ya on the weekend
And I'll see ya on the weekend
And I'll see ya on the weekend
I'll see ya at the end of the week
I'll see ya on the weekend
I'll see ya on the weekend
I'll see ya at the end of the weekEmbed
