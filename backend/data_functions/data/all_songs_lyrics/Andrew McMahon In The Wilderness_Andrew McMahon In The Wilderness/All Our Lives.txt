All Our Lives Lyrics
I saw this old friend at the Eveleigh bar
Life hadn't treated him so well
A heart so gold, and words so blue
In a body home from hell
He said, "If I could tell you one thing, I would tell you this:
There's only one mistake that I have made
It's giving up the music in my fingertips
By trying to get to heaven through my veins."

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives

I saw this woman with tears in her eyes
Driving beside me yesterday
She turned her head, then I turned mine
And I watched her drive away
I thought, if I could tell her something, I would tell her this
"There's only two mistakes that I have made
It's running from the people who could love me best
And trying to fix a world that I can't change."
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives

I remember being young and staring at my hands
In the middle of the night, the first light of the morning
My room like a church, voices down the hall
I barely made 'em out, but sometimes you don't want to know
Now that I'm older, I can tell you this
The mornings I miss, but I don't really miss the voices
You've got a choice, I've got the hands
Skeletons and plans, you've got to let 'em go
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies

All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our lives
All our lives
I watched you search beneath the fallen skies
This was no path to glory
You always walked before me
But you came back to warn me
All our livesEmbed
