Black and White Movies Lyrics
As the summer came and left with the rain
Pushing shadows down the road
In this old beach town when the sun goes down
All the gray turns into gold
Got no plans just a feeling
I'm no architect at all
There's a fan on the ceiling
And a telephone that you should call

Are you home tonight?
Are you laying in bed watching black and white movies?
All alone tonight
Do you ever rewind to the summer you knew me?
Black and white movies

You were out at dawn with a wetsuit on
That's the picture in my mind
Now the waves still crash on the bonfire ash
That the tourists leave behind
Waves of sound, waves of static
Through the windows in my room
And the seeds that you planted
In a coffee cup that never bloomed
Are you home tonight?
Are you laying in bed watching black and white movies?
All alone tonight
Do you ever rewind to the summer you knew me?
Black and white movies
Black and white movies

Are you home tonight?
Are you home tonight?

Are you home tonight?
Are you laying in bed watching black and white movies?
All alone tonight
Do you ever rewind to the summer you knew me?
Are you home?
Are you laying in bed watching black and white movies?
All alone tonight
Do you ever rewind to the summer you knew me?
Black and white movies
Watching black and white movies
Are you home tonight?
Are you home tonight?Embed
