Rainy Girl LyricsRainy girl
I can't wait to meet you
And I can't wait to hear your name
And sing it to the skies above
Rainy girl
Wash away my memory
Swimming through infinity, for you will be
My love
Sometimes when I'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
I guess we're going everywhere together
Rainy girl
The sun is coming up for me
Black bird on a wire sings a song, so blue
Sometimes when I'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
Guess we're going everywhere together
Rainy girl
Home at last
Following a cloud
Sometimes when I'm falling in my dreams
I can feel you falling next to me
I guess we're going everywhere together
Guess we're going everywhere together
Guess we're going everywhere together
Rainy girl
I can't wait to meet you1Embed
