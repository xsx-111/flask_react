The Hurt LyricsYou say you want to seek the truth
But it's hard to find, no one to help you
Your friends don't have the time
So you ride around in your car
Switch on the radio, you want to relate to
Something you once read in a book
What kind of a way to try to take a look
Until I got hurt I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I painted my face gray
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, why didn't I, I didn't think of this
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is
You say you want to learn to laugh
'Cause music makes you cry
But the tears you shed are only in your eye
So you turn to any phony mouth
With a tale to tell, but he's just a hoaxer
Don't you know selling peace and religion
Between his jokes and his karma chewing gum
Until I got hurt, I was looking, I was the same as you
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I did not know what to do
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, why didn't I, I didn't think of this
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is
Young son, don't let me down, young son
I'm trusting you to keep on, never turn away now
Hold on, never let go, now hold on
Turn your heart to the bright sun
Love will come your way
'Cause till you make that final show
You'll never know what love you've been missing, missing
You say you want to seek the truth
But you work alone, no one to help you
And nobody to push you on
So you sit at home drinking your wine
Television on, you wait for a miracle
Cause you say one day one will come along
But wishful thinking, boy any minute now you might be gone
I'd like to help you brother but that would be wrong
So until I got hurt, I was looking, I was on my way
Until I got hurt, until I got hurt, darling I didn't know which way
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, why didn't I, I didn't think of this
Until I got hurt, till I got hurt, baby, I didn't know what love is, oh no
Until I got hurt, oh I didn't know what love isEmbed
