All Summer Single Lyrics
What should I do baby, a-what should I do
Where should I go, what should I do?
Yes, I got blues, the summertime blues

Eight o'clock in the morning
Eight o'clock, it's a New York day
Eight o'clock in the morning, babe
Gonna wipe that dirt, shake that scent
Wipe that, shake it, lose the blues right now, yeah

All summer single
All summer single, you can't touch what you can't see
Now all summer single, went away, away from me
All summer single, yes, I don't care, you know
I want a good time, for you and me
All summer single, yeah

Yeah, there's a shot in the dark now, babe
I reach out to touch the New York skyline
Oh yes, I am free, baby, it's you I want
So shake them loose, the blues right now
Ah ah ah ah ah
All summer single
All summer single, I wanna be what I wanna be
Yeah, all summer single, I'm gonna have
What I can see
All summer single, yes, I don't mind, ya know
All I want is a good time

(Somebody tell the truth.)
Lost my baby 'fore the summer sun was through (Somebody tell the truth)
Hurt and jealous friends fighting over you (Somebody tell the truth)
I lost my baby 'fore the summer sun was through (Somebody tell the truth)
Yeah, I don't mind, you know, that all I want is a good time, good time

All summer single, I want to have you near me. Ow!
All summer single, I wanna good time
And I wanna be free
All summer single, that's the way
That's the way I feel
All summer single, well, I don't mind
I wanna good time for you and me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
All summer single
All summer single, oh
All summer, all summer, all summer
All summer single
All summer single, away from home
All summer, all summer, all summer
All summer singleEmbed
