One Night, One Chance Lyrics
One night, one chance, she do me 'most anything
One night, one chance, she do and dream
Sweet dreams for you

Woke up this morning, I said, "Boy, wake up
Nothing will be done if you don't get up
Silence is guilty, and the truth can talk
If you got the legs, boy, come on, let's walk"

One night, one dream for you
She'd dream sweet dreams for me and you

Take me out this morning, come on, let me sleep
Been hard pressed to keep it, better hold on me
But silence is guilty, and the truth be told
If you got the legs, boys, come on, let's walk

Is it over? One night she dreamed for you
One night, one chance for you
One day, one night
She dreamed sweet dreams for you
Woke up this morning, and now the dream was out of sight
Prison walls are breakin' down, and my threadbare back is whipped right
Silence is guilty, and the truth can talk
Well yes, I got the legs, boys, and I, yes, I walked
And it's over, I'm glad it's over
Are you glad it's over? It's over for one night

One chance for sweet dreams, oh, for you
For one night, for one chance of success
She'll scream and scheme for you
Oh, oh, one night, oh, one chance
She'll dream sweet dreams for you
One night, one life too
Her whole existence has fallen in twoEmbed
