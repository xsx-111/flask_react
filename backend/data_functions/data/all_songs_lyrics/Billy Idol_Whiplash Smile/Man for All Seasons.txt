Man for All Seasons Lyrics
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah

Time on my side, are you ready to learn?
Said baby, are you ready to burn?
Oh, burning desire, I'm a soul on fire
And, baby, it's higher and higher

Don't get in my way, no way
Well, you'd be a fool, baby; well, that's true, baby
It's the time for my season right now
Well, is it true, baby? Oh yeah, baby
Ow

I'm a man for the season
Yes, I love you for a reason

Time on my side, now you understand
Oh, baby, my time is at hand
Oh, it gets higher and higher
It's a divine given power
Those love lickin' lips take me higher and higher!
Don't get in my time, no way
Ooh, you'd be a fool now, baby, such a fool now, baby
Oh - Can't change my way, ooh, what I say
You'd be a fool, baby, such a fool now, baby
Oh!

I'm a man for the season
Oh, I love you for a reason
Oh, I love you for a reason
I'm a man for the season
1,2,3,4!
Wow! Yeah! Come on, yeah! Whoa!
Burn me up!
Burn me up now! Yeah
Guitar!

Oooh, yeah
Got all the time in the world, baby
Oooh, feels good, ow
I'm gonna...
Ow!
Yeah yeah! Ow!
Ooh!

Time on my side, and now you understand
I said, baby, are you ready to burn?
Baby, are you ready to burn?
Man, yeah! It's gettin' higher and higher
Come on, burn, baby. Come on, burn, baby
Oh, oh baby, oh baby, oh babyEmbed
