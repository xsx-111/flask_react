Soul Standing By Lyrics
Oo, babe
Oo, babe
Oh, moon light, cool angel, be on us tonight
Oh, baby, pretty baby, I'm wild for you all right  (Rowar)
You want sunlight, you get moonlight
Splendor in the past
Kiss of lip, oh baby, conceive your passion
Oo, born to us tonight, oh
Hold me tight, babe, treat me right, babe
So deep and hot tonight, yeah
Oh, baby, pretty baby, I'll make it last all night

Soul standing by
I'm gonna be there anytime
I'm gonna be there if you cry
Anytime, any way, any how, right now!
Are you ridin' high? Well, I'm ridin' high
Soul standin' by, soul standin' by
Ooh, I'm ridin' high, well, I'm ridin' high
Soul standin' by, soul standin' by
Soul standin' by, yeah, I'll never die. Guitar!

Yeah, baby, she said
Oo baby, oo love me, come on and love me, yes
Invade me
Row your boat, baby, through my water, oo
Out into my light, oh
Hold me, sunlight; come on me, moonlight
So deep and so wide
Seek you here, baby
Be-ah-uh baby, in my arms all night

Soul standing by
Yes, I'll be there anytime
Yes, I'll be there if you cry
Anywhere, any how, anytime, right now!
Are you ridin' high? Well, I'm ridin' high
Soul standin' by, soul standin' by
Ooh, I'm ridin' high, well, I'm ridin' high
Soul standin' by, soul standin' by
Ooh, I'm ridin' high, well, I'm ridin' high
Soul standin' by, soul standin' by
Yeah, ridin' high
Soul standin' by, soul standin' by
Soul standin' by. Ow! I'll never die
Soul standin' by, oh yeah
Soul standin' by, no tears you cry
Oo yeah, oh yeah
Oo oo oo oo baby, oo, love me
Oo baby, oh, inside me
Come on, come on baby, come on, love me
We splendor in the night
Oo, yeahEmbed
