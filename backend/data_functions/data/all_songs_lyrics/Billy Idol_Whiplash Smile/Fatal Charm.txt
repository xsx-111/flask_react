Fatal Charm Lyrics
There may be trouble ahead, baby, yeah
There may be teardrops to shed, uh huh
I'm comin' in from the cold, baby
Yes, I'm in and I'm warm
You don't forget that, baby, hey

Well, I'm comin' in from the storm, uh huh
Believe me, mama
Yes, I'm in from the storm, okay, forget it, mama
And there's a skin and bone, teardrop too
Down on Maggie's farm
Yes, I lived that life, lived it through and it
Cut me a-with my fatal charm, with my fatal charm
Wow! Shake!

Yeah, I'm gonna stay on the run
I'm gonna have all the very last fun
You see, they're all gettin' ready
Devil may care, and who cares? I care! Waah!
Lady Luck, let the dice stay hot
Lady Luck sure with every shot
Show him, show him, what I got, what they not
Yeah, yeah
I see skin and bone, teardrop too
A-down on Maggie's farm
Yeah, I lived that place, I lived it
Through and I cut! Whoo!
Skin and bone and teardrop too
Down on Maggie's farm
Yeah, I lived that life, lived it through, I cut
A-with my fatal charm

I cut them with my fatal charm
They don't forget that, baby
They don't forget that, uh huh
They don't forget that, baby
Heh! Huh! Ah ah ah ah!

Yeah! I'm a-gonna stay on the run
Yeah, I'm gonna have all the very last fun
They're all gettin' ready for the devil may care
But who cares? I dare
Lady Luck lettin' the dice stay hot
Lady Luck sure with every shot
What we got? Nuttin'!
That's what we got, nuttin'! Oh yeah!
Would you yeah, would you yeah, would you yeah?
Ooh well they cut me a-with their fatal charmEmbed
