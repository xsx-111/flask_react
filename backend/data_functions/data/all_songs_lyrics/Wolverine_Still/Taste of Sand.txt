Taste of Sand LyricsI'll be here, waiting for the hours to pass
Watching the days I crave slip through my hands
Caught in here, licked in while my foes raise the glass
Smiling as my empty glass fills up with sand
Wait, don't run from me
Wait, show yourself to me
All I am slowly dies within this cold cell
Guilty of a crime made up, the jury was me
Help, you fade from me
Help, can you throw me the key?
Why, can't I leave? Tell me
Why, do I lock myself in?
I drink the sand, I thought I would walk
And all I ever dreamt dies in a desert
Slowly fading, slowly fading
Caught in a grim world where dreams turn to sand
Everything dies under the sun at noon
Then the dark of evening buries the remains in it's tomb
Help, I fade from you
Help, can you reach me your hand?
Though I drink the sand of indifference
Hope still remains like a vague smell of rain
I drink the sand, I thought I would walk
And all I ever dreamt dies in a desert
Slowly fading, slowly fading
I drink the sand, I thought I would walk
And all I ever dreamt dies in a desert
Slowly fading, slowly fadingEmbed
