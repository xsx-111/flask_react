Liar on the Mount Lyrics
"Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil."
"In the face of this great tragedy ??? join me, words are my first choice, words are my first choice. And I know ??? good to be a spirit. This is my silent pledge. Please take us to heaven."
Through all these years the truth has been a stranger to me
We met many times but never got to know each other
I was used and fed with lies by who I thought were you
I left my way of life to be all you said were true
Now all this sadness washes over me and I feel like I'm drowning
I tried to call for help but the only thing I could feel was misery
I did now want to walk alone through this barren wasteland
You turned your back on me when I reached out
It's all clear to me, it's you who choose to leave us here
There's no use in looking back since I know you won't appear
"The God ??? wisdom, good versus evil. But good ??? over there. God is near. We hope everybody follows. For the lord's ???.  I'm the first to go ??? you. And this is good for ???."
"I am the lord thy God..."
Blindly I would follow you as you preached to me your truth
I climbed your mountain a million times
I was told I needed you to behold your enlightened view
I know now there is nothing there to see
I renounce your divinity
Slowly I woke up, slowly I saw
The lies you told faded away
A water was rising, the water was truth
It washed away the dirt of you as it washed away all that was true
Now all this sadness washes over me and I feel like I'm drowning
I've tried to call for help but the only thing I can feel is misery
I hope that sadness washes over you and you find yourself drowning
And when you call for help from the ones you hurt the answer will be one of silence
"Thank you, good night and God bless America."Embed
