Nothing More LyricsHow come I don't know where to go?
It seems all I've ever knows is gone
My dream has finally ended
After this there's nothing more for me
All my life I've been waiting
But now there's nothing more to wish for
I spent all my years just longing
For this one final dream to come true
Opportunities turned to chains of need
Now it seems I've finally lost my wish for more
All my life I've been waiting
But now there's nothing more to wish for
All my life I've been waiting
But now there's nothing more to live for...Embed
