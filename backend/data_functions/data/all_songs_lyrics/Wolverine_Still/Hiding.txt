Hiding LyricsAll the things we do when no one is watching
All the things we say when no one listens
In times of solitude we find ourselves
I think it's funny, I think it's kind of sad that we lose control
The way that people always seem to fall when they say "hello"
Until "goodbye" ends the lie
All the things we feel with people beside us
All the thoughts we think when someone listens
In times of multitude we hide ourselves
Some people fight it, some people do not care if they lose control
And some embrace it, the way they always fall when they say "hello"
But still "goodbye" ends the lie and fades their smile
We are all in hiding, protecting what's inside
We are all just hiding, afraid to bare ourselves
Afraid to be
A smile won't break me, a cry won't kill me
But still I'm hiding, deep inside me
The strength escapes me, I can't be set free
I'm trapped and feeling lonely
Why can't I just be me?
We are all in hiding, protecting what's inside
We are all just hiding, afraid to bare ourselves
Afraid to be
Afraid to liveEmbed
