This Cold Heart of Mine LyricsIt all just slipped away although I tried so hard to hold on
And all those times we failed echo through this loss of mine
I find it kind of strange that though I've been through this before
The pain is just as great when alone with a just a bleeding heart
Bleeding the blood of the life we shared
Leaving me here with a cold, black stare
This cold heart of mine, once a trusted shrine
Now only holds contempt
All I thought would be turned into debris
Crushed by the weight of a craving need
Thoughts of another me, cut through this cold heart of mine
But the torment of losing me is greater than losing you
I find myself immersed in a weakness that I've feared for so long
An uninvited guest that has stalked me through the alleys of my mind
I need to turn around and fight the man I so despise
I need to heal these wounds and revive this cold heart of mine
Thoughts of another me, cut through this cold heart of mine
But the torment of losing me is greater than losing you
Just a brief leap of air o' moments rest in this frantic quest
Proud to stand but he remains, lurking in the shadows
Waiting for a chance to strike again and to make me pay with myself
Thoughts of another me, cut through this cold heart of mine
But the torment of losing me is greater than losing you
I need to defeat my foe is growing in this heart of mine
For the torment of losing me is greater than losing youEmbed
