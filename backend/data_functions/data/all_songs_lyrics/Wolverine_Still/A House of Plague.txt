A House of Plague LyricsA time, a hope, a place, a love, a start, a work
A mold, a change, a move, a pin, a fight
A loss, a turn, a light, a birth, an end...
Walked into a house of plague
The infection everywhere
At first disguised by hollow warmth
Then unleashed upon us
Save us all your prayers
Save us all your smiles
Save us all your words and hand to us the truth...
Awaiting the answers you chose to turn into vengeance
Without them we'll never turn the page
And forged about you and your house of plague
Amidst the chaos of our wills
You brought an end to all that was
We stared into a void
Fed up with taste of greed
And though we've walked a world since then
The echoes of your deeds remain
Walked into a house of plague
We were never to return
Save us all your prayers
Save us all your smiles
Save us all your words and hand to us the truth...
Awaiting the answers you chose to turn into vengeance
Without them we'll never turn the page
And forged about you and your house of plague
Are we ever to return and leave that cold light behind us?
Will you ever turn the key and let us leave this rotten house of plague?Embed
