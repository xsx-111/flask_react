And She Slowly Dies LyricsWorn out eyes revealing an old and tired mind
Battered through years and years of merciless abuse
Facing this assault of ours is tearing me apart
Watching the soil of her slowly turn to dust
I hear her cries, screams of torment heard by none
I watch her die, signs of death are all around
Everything we dared to hope is lost and so are we
Don't you see that all we had is lost in this search for more?
I stare into a mirror of shame and shattered pride
Feeling the heart of man drain itself of blood
Smash the mirror and try to see the other side
But all that I find is the wall we stand behind
I hear her cries, signs of death are all around
All the years we never cared resound and leave her numb
Ain't no way for her to hide and flee her dying fate
If I could change you
If I could heal your bleeding wounds I should
If I could change you
If I could heal your bleeding wounds I would
But words are not enough
Wake up and face tomorrow now before we find our dream's a nightmare
And she slowly dies
And she slowly dies
And she slowly dies
And she slowly dies
And she slowly dies
And she slowly
And she slowly
And she slowly
And she slowly dies
If I could change you
If I could heal your bleeding wounds I should
If I could change you
If I could heal your bleeding wounds I would
If I could change you
If I could heal your bleeding wounds I should
If I could change you
If I could heal your bleeding wounds I wouldEmbed
