Sleepy Town LyricsThis insecure state, a constant struggle
There's someone inside you staring back at me
Is it this sleepy town, or is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
I'm choking myself inside these walls
A never-ending road as never-ending as me
Is it these concrete walls, or is it just me?
Is it this sleepy town, or is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is it just me?
Is it this sleepy town?
Is it these concrete walls?Embed
