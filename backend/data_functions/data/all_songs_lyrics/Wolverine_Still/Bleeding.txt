Bleeding LyricsThe beast inside you feeds on your insecurity
It thrives on remnants of the fear from behind all alone
You are lost in his dungeon, you stumble and bleed
The smell of blood upon you wakes his need to feed
I'm waiting for the other side while you hide
I'll try to stay here for a while if you like
A single-scented breeze is from where he draws his breath
The richness of her colours incites his need of death
I've waited on the other side for some time
I'll try to stay here for a while if you like
Your wounds are aching, your mind is breaking
The world is changing and you're still bleeding
You'll have to face the fears that led you this far astray
Open your mind and slay the beast inside it's own lair
(No wounds remain... the hurting's gone)
Bring this dream to life and wake up to the light of her colours
(You found the way... your heart is home again...)
Let the hatred go and let me show you the way home again
Caught in that pit of darkness
I fear a never ending wait
Something about your weakness
Leaves you blind of all your bleeding wounds
Your wounds are aching, your mind is breaking
The world is changing and you're still bleeding
Your wounds are aching, your mind is breaking
The world is changing and you're still bleedingEmbed
