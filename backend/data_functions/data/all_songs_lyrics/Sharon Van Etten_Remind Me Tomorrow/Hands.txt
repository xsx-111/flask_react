Hands Lyrics
Putting my hands up and following you
I know what I've done to you, I promise you

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to one another
Put your hands up

I'm feeling the changes
I know it's just like me to say
I wanna make sense of it all
We could handle anything when we were young

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to one another
Put your hands up
Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to each other
I've got my hands up
Right here describes you
I'm hearing your sighs sneaking out
And I wanted to tell you what you wanted to hear
But you told me to let it all out, dear

Put your hands on your lover
I've got my hands up
Mean no harm to each other
I've got my hands up1Embed
