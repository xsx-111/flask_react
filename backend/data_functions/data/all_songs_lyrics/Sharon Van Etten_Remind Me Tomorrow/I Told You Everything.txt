I Told You Everything LyricsSitting at the bar, I told you everything
You said, "Holy shit, you almost died"
Sharing a shot, you held my hand
Knowing everything, knowing everything, we cried
I told you everything about everything
I had no idea, I had no idea
We held hands, we held hands
We held hands as we parted
We knocked knees, we knocked knees as it started
I told you everything about my first time
I told you everything, no change in your eyes
I told you everything, no changing my mind
You said "Holy shit, we almost died"
I had no idea, I had no idea1Embed
