Malibu Lyrics
We held hands as we passed the truck
Just a couple of dudes who don't give a fuck
Tap the brakes and we slow down
Just a couple of jokers on the edge of town
In Malibu

In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the road

I walked in the door
The Black Crowes playing as you cleaned the floor
I thought I couldn't love him any more

In that little red number
Driving down the road
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the road
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the road
In the little red car that don't belong to you
Yeah, that little red number
Driving down the roadEmbed
