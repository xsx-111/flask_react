Stay Lyrics
Have you all of my lifetime
Kinda hard to make light
Imagining when you were inside
When you made those kicks at night

Don't wanna hurt you
Don't wanna run away from myself
Want your whole star to shine on in
One star, one light
The meaning of life

You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way

Find a way to stand
And a time to walk away
Letting go to let you lead
I don't know how it ends

Comes a time when you answer
Do it with heart
Want you to express yourself
Not let it get to your head
You won't let me go astray
You will let me find my way
You, you love me either way
You stay1Embed
