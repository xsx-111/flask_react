Memorial Day Lyrics
Where do you always stay, where do you stay?
When you look, what do you see then?
Come back with your head up
When you barely stand, when you couldn't tell

You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)
You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)

Back, you will stay
You will learn or you will do it again
Will you ever hold your ground?
Will I ever pull your teeth?
If you barely stand
How do I let you leave?

You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)
You, you will run (You will run)
You will run (You will run)
You will (You will)
Standing, I can see
You will run, you will runEmbed
