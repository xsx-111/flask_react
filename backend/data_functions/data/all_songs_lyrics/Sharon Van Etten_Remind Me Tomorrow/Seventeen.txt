Seventeen Lyrics
I know what you wanna say
I think that you're all the same
Constantly being led astray
You think you know something you don't

Downtown hotspot halfway up the street
I used to be free, I used to be seventeen
Follow my shadow around your corner
I used to be seventeen, now you're just like me

Down beneath the ashes and the stone
Sure of what I've lived and have known
I see you so uncomfortably alone
I wish I could show you how much you've grown

Downtown hotspot used to be on this street
I used to be seventeen, I used to be seventeen
Now you're a hotshot hanging on my block
Sun coming up, who's my shadow?

La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know what you're gonna be
I know that you're gonna be
You'll crumble it up just to see
Afraid that you'll be just like me

Downtown hotspot halfway through this life
I used to feel free, or was it just a dream?
Now you're a hotshot, think you're so carefree
But you're just seventeen, so much like me
You're just seventeen, you're just seventeen
