Comeback Kid Lyrics
"Hey, you're the comeback kid"
See me look away, I'm the runaway
I'm the stay-out-late, I'm recovering
Kid at the top of our street
I was somewhat like him, I was somebody

Comeback kid
Comeback kid
Come back, kid
Let me look at you

"Yeah, you're the comeback kid
Let me look at you"
Then look away
Yeah, I'm the runaway, I'm the hardly stay
Let slip away

Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Watch me run away
"Kid came back a real turn around"
Please believe that I want to stay
"Got a job now that my brother found
Working nights just a mile away"
Don't let me slip away, I'm not a runaway
It just feels that way

Comeback kid
Comeback kid
Come back, kid
Let me look at you
Comeback kid
Comeback kid
Come back2Embed
