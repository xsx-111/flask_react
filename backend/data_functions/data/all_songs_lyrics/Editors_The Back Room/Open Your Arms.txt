Open Your Arms Lyrics
Look up, look up, look up now
It's a long way down
Look up, look up, look up now
It's a long way down

You fail, you fail to see now
What you need the most
Making a meal of me now
You're the perfect host

This lot, this lot have messed you around
This lot, this lot have messed you around

Open your arms and welcome people to your town
Look up, look up, look up now
It's a long way down

This lot, this lot have messed you around
This lot, this lot have messed you around
This lot, this lot have messed you around
This lot, this lot have messed you around
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome
Open your arms and welcome

Open your arms and welcome people to your town
Open your arms and welcome people to your town
