All Sparks Lyrics
You're answering questions that have not yet been asked
All sparks will burn out in the end
You burn like a bouncing cigarette on the road
All sparks will burn out in the end

All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
In the end

You're casting opinions at people who need them
All sparks will burn out in the end
Well be careful angel, this life is just too long
All sparks will burn out in the end

All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
In the end

You burn like a bouncing cigarette
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
All sparks will burn out
In the endEmbed
