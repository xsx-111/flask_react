Colours Lyrics
You mean a lot to me
You've got a heart of gold
Everything falls apart
Leaves you in the cold
Purpose is scaring me
What if I can't see mine
Love on the filthy streets is so divine

You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear

You mean a lot to me
You've got a heart of gold
Once I have found the words
I'll loosen my hold

You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
You are the colour my dear
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else baby
Fill your life with something else babyEmbed
