French Disko Lyrics
Though this world's essentially an absurd place to be living in
It doesn't call for total withdrawal
I've been told it's a fact of life
Men have to kill one another
Well I say there are still things worth fighting for

La resistance!
La resistance!

Though this world's essentially an absurd place to be living in
It doesn't call for total withdrawal
It said human existence is pointless
As acts of rebellious solidarity
Can bring sense in this world

La resistance!
La resistance!Embed
