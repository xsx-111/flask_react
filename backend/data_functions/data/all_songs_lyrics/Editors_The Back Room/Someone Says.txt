Someone Says Lyrics
Someone said they saw you in the night and on your own
There's beauty in the lonely
You're the moonlight in this town

Seems like every moment is another from before
Your eyes have nothing behind them
Your arms and legs are sore

Neighbour, you've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you in so little time
Oh neighbour, keep things close to your heart
If no-one can help you, then how can I

Someone said they saw you
Said they saw it as a sign
Well every single second catches up the next in line

Neighbour, you've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you in so little time
Oh neighbour, keep things close to your heart
If no-one can help you, then how can I
Neighbour, you've fallen in with the wrong crowd
I've got so much to tell you in so little time
Oh neighbour, keep things close to your heart
If no-one can help you, then how can I

Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw you
Someone said they saw youEmbed
