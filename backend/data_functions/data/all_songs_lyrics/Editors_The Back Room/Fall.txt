Fall Lyrics
With my eyes closed
I'll look closer
I'll always
Remember

Juggernauts screaming to a stop
Sound like devils are laughing

I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself

These dark pubs
We drink in
Somehow light up
When I'm with you

I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself
I wanted to see
I wanted to see
I wanted to see this for myself

For myself
For myself
For myself
Self, selfEmbed
