Distance Lyrics
Distance, I'll keep my distance
These things I never seem to mean
So I'll leave the murder scene

Honey, what got broken
Won't go back together again
So I'll leave this while I can

Here
Here
Here
Here

Nothing to be scared of
My dreams they keep a hold of me
My guide when I can't see

Come, I will be there
I'm sure you're passing the test
I wish you all the best
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
Here
