Blood Lyrics
This wicked city
Just drags you down
You're with the red lights
Your side of town

Don't say it's easy
To follow a process
There's nothing harder
Than keeping a promise

Blood runs though your veins
That's where our similarity ends
Blood runs through our veins
Blood runs though your veins
That's where our similarity ends
Blood runs through our veins

There's nothing believable
In being honest
So cover your lies up
With another promise
Blood runs though your veins
That's where our similarity ends
Blood runs through our veins, ah
Blood runs though your veins
That's where our similarity ends
Blood runs through our veins, ah
Blood runs though your veins
That's where our similarity ends
Blood runs through your veins, ah
If there's hope in your heart
It would flow to every part
If there's hope in your heartEmbed
