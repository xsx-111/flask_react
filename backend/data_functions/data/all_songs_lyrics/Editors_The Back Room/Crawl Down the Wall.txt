Crawl Down the Wall Lyrics
Cold place, same town
So faced with the same frown
Crawl down the wall like no one at all
Crawl down the track, find your way back

We'll see how this goes
We'll pull love from all lows
And we'll see how this goes now

Cold place, same town
So faced with the same frown
Crawl down the wall like no one at all
Crawl down the track, find your way back

We'll see how this goes
We'll pull love from all lows
And we'll see how this goes now

We'll see how this goes
We'll pull love from all lows
And we'll see how this goes now, now, now, nowEmbed
