Let Your Good Heart Lead You Home LyricsYou let the dark in, somehow
I feel the winter more now, more now
Some things do matter, a price to pay
We will find our own way, always
Sharks swim around your drowning soul
Let your good heart lead you home
Once you've gone, you can't come back
I am worried about you
Once you've gone, you can't come back
I am worried about you
Once you've gone, girl, you can't come back
I am worried about youEmbed
