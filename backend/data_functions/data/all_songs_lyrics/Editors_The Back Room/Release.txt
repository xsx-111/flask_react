Release Lyrics
The city is not that far
Made from the sun, you are
Oh, what a star you are
The city is not that far, that far, that far

Life in black and white
My lord, what a perfect sight
I'll lose this, I always do
I'll lose this, I always do

Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love

Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
My love, my love

Life in black and white
My lord, what a perfect sight
Made from the sun, you are
Oh, what a star you are
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love

Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love

Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love

Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
Release, find your peace, my love
My love, my love

The city, the city, the city, the cityEmbed
