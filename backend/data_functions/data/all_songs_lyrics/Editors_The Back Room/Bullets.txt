Bullets Lyrics
If something has to change, then it always does
If something has to change, then it always does
You don't need this disease, not right now
No, you don't need this disease, not right now

Oh, you don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease

If something has to give, then it always will
If something has to give, then it always will
You don't need this disease, not right now
No, you don't need this disease
Not right now, no, no, not right now

You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease
Would you fall down?
Would you fall, would you fall, would you fall down?
Would you fall down?

Oh, you don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't
You don't need this disease, you don't

You won't fall downEmbed
