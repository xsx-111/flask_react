Fingers in the Factories Lyrics
Easy said and easy done is how we like this
Keep us in our place
You're the night, the dirty night that keeps us going
Nothing left to waste
Pull a sentence from your lips to keep them quiet
What they want to hear
Oh you're the night, the dirty night that keeps us going
No one left to fear

As the sun goes down on a broken town
And the fingers bleed in the factories
Come on out tonight, come and see the sight
Of the ones you love and the ones you love
And you keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me

Smile for once, for a moment, it makes us happy
What we need is here
Oh you're the night, the dirty night, you make us angry
There's everything to fear

As the sun goes down on a broken town
And the fingers bleed in the factories
Come on out tonight, come and see the sight
Of the ones you love and the ones you love
And you keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me
As the sun goes down on a broken town
And the fingers bleed in the factories
Come on out tonight, come and see the sight
Of the ones you love and the ones you love
And you keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me
Keep with me, keep with me, keep with me, keep with me1Embed
