You Are Fading Lyrics
I'll lose this I always have
I'll always let you down
I'll lose this I always have
I'll always let you down

Make your way up to the stars
It's there where you belong
I'll lose this I always have
I'll always let you down

Waiting, you are
Fading, you are
Slowly drift off to sleep
Waiting, you are
Fading, you are
Slowly drift off to sleep
Waiting, you are
Fading, you are
Slowly drift off to sleepEmbed
