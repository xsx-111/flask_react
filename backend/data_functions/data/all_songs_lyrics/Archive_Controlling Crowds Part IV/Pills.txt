Pills LyricsThese days
They’re taking me down
Breakout
With pills in my hand
Freak out
I move with the crowd
You think it’s only you
It really kills me too
You really got me going now
It’s taking me down
You really got me wanting now
You think it’s only you
It really kills me too
How can you tell the truth?
When your heart is bleeding the lies
Feeding the lies
Falling apart
Breaking apart
It really kills me too
It’s really got me hurting now
It’s really got me hurting1Embed
