Remove LyricsFinally, from all I want to see, remove, from the place that I love, the place that I touch, that moves me, their eyes are on me, they’re running for me, remove
Moronic world, I can’t hold on
Silently, they take identity, remove, they take the colours from me and mould the others on me, remove, they take the hurt from me, they take the worth of me, remove
Moronic world
I can’t hold on
No, I can’t hold onEmbed
