Pictures LyricsMoving... so slowly
Wandering... alone with you
Silently... revealed by you
I wish I... could hold your hands
On each side... of my head
So you could feel... my pictures... of you, against... the darker side
Shadows move... in your light
So beautiful... you are
So beautiful... you areEmbed
