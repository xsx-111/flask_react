Lines LyricsHigh, sunlight, drown, high, sunlight, goodbye
As I re-submerge I can barely breathe, lung capacity withering away, hyperventilate, all disintegrating bodies turn to dust, sudden rush of blood, snap me out of moods swinging in the wind, round to hurricane breeze, past damage in the blast more than physical, plain to see upon the visual, feel the impact down deep inside a rattled rib cage, lying shattered there in pieces, fall away wither and decay, cannot keep this anxiety at bay, hellfire spray twisted metal stray, when sparks fly into the naked eye, fools know not to even try, think about it fully, blowing sky high bring a house down, panic all around, blind to the fact silent ones who plan a hijack give with one hand, other takes back one way collision flight path, aftermath, come and feel the wrath laid to waste, steadily with haste, cutting to the chase, drifting off the pace, filling all space and times up for the meanwhile pressure piles down, terror reigns
Runaway, loose, gonna run over you, infected, injected, completely subdued, invasive, foreign entity, unwelcome. High, sunlight, drown, high, sunlight, goodbye
Lines, lines data and lines, confusing nations all data inside, games shame lies to the masses, dead souls all rise on poisonous gasses, lines, lines la la la la la la, lines
Battered and broken hour glass, last thing you see before the light fizzle out, smoke billowing, broken down from the inside by scandalous tension, take hold, gripped by the head, cold harbouring a grudge, closer to the edge, cradling the grave concern, follow leaders in turn, flipside opposition, convey grievance, half a mind to test immortal patience, held down while suffocating, blocking air path, final exhale, vital sign fail, flatline, they would rather do away with our kind, half expected inside, rotten infected, fatally flawed and overawed, biohazardous and contagious, got animal into animal, crushedlike beasts into cages, slow deteriorate body, shutting down, cease and fade, cease then fade
Runaway, loose, gonna run over you, infected, injected, completely subdued, invasive, foreign entity, unwelcome
Lines, lines la la la la la la, lines, lines la la la la la la, lines, la la la la la. High, sunlight, drown, high, sunlight, goodbyeEmbed
