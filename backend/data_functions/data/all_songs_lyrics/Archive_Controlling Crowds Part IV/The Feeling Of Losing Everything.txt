The Feeling Of Losing Everything LyricsI feel strange, covered in waves of confusion and people not looking inside, all the stars all seem to collapse, over the sea of my thoughts and the net comes creeping, over the calm and I’m caught and all is lost in a storm, of something sinister

Slow tides and falling grace, reflections cold in this space, I am floored and can’t return, this winter’s white, its silence burnsEmbed
