Live Wire LyricsWell if you're looking for trouble
I'm the man to see
If you're looking for satisfaction
I'm satisfaction guaranteed
I'm as cool as a body on ice
Or hotter than a rolling dice
Send you to heaven
Take you to hell
I ainâ€™t fooling
Can't you tell
I'm a live wire
Going to set this town on fire
Well if you need some loving
And if you need some man
You've got the phone and the number
And I got no future plans
Oh come on honey you got nothing to lose
You got the thirst and I got the booze
Give you an inch
Take you a mile
I want to make you smile
I'm a live wire
Holy smoke and sweet desire
Like a hot rod baby
Oh stick this in your fuse box
Cooler than a body on ice
Hotter than a rolling dice
Wilder than a drunken fight
You're going to burn tonight
I'm a live wire
And I'm going to set this town on fireEmbed
