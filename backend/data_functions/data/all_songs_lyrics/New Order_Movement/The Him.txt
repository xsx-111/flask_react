The Him Lyrics
Some days you waste your life away
These times I find no words to say
A crime I once committed failed me
Too much of heaven's eyes I saw through
Only when meanings have no reason
They're taken beyond your sense of right (And wrong)

Small boy kneels humble in a great hall
He placed hands to the air above him
White circles, black lines surround me
Reborn, so plain my eyes see
This is the reason that I came here
To be so near to such a person

I'm so tired, I'm so tired3Embed
