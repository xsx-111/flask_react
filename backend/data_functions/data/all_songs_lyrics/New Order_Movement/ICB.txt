ICB Lyrics
Line of force from heaven
A tear in a stranger's eye
Then it goes forever
Where all things never die
People look whenever
These places have been won
Minds just go on breathing
When these moments have begun

It's so far away, and it's closing in
It's so far away, it seems to draw me in

Taken from the killing ground
By an all providing hand
With no sense or reason
Making the final demands
Taking good advantage of
All the things I'm told
I wash my hands in innocence
When you start taking hold

It's so far away, and it's closing in
It's so far away, it seems to draw me in1Embed
