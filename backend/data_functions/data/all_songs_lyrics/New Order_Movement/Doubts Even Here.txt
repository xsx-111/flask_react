Doubts Even Here Lyrics
Those steps which seem to take a lifetime
When eyes just turn and stare
Day begins, collapsing without warning
You fade from sight, there's nothing there

No hope allowed, calls are answered daily
Questions are on your side
Deeply moved, beyond all consolation
You felt the pulse now hear the cry

In my mind thoughts are becoming clearer
I'm watching every move you make
Counting time spent in observation
A single blow, a false mistake
 (Lyrics: Gillian Gilbert)
Then you revealed to me
All that I need to know now
Then please don't turn away
Why can't I talk to you now
(The close went down to times too, too much behind us)
There's nowhere left to go
Where is this taking her and how?
(The number of forgotten years when my honour isn't the deepest
Grows the deepest feeling and it grieved for safety and despair)
There's nothing more I want
To know beyond your trust now
(The torish threats forevermore, over our natural favour
And us and his and I'll fall, far in it, and it sees enough
In our failures and it's not time.)
Don't throw our joy away
Why must you just you leave now?
(I missed his promised time again, for my friend)
Memories are all that's left
I need you near to me now
(Has God forgotten to approach us?
Has He remember'd to not despise us?
There, now, now, don't come to mind my deeds
And call out in defiance of times gone by)3Embed
