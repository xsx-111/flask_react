Learning to Love Him LyricsI'm learning to love him
To love and forgive
I'm learning to trust him
To let the man live
I'm learning to see him
To see who he is
I'm learning to love
The beauty he is
I'm learning to love him
To love and forgive
I'm learning to trust him
To let the man live
I'm learning to hold
His life in my hands
I'm learning to love
Me just as I amEmbed
