City Full of Ghosts (Dublin) LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dublin is a city full of good times
Dublin is a city full of dance
Dublin is a city full of music
Poetry, sex and romance
But what it means to me the most
Dublin is a city full of ghosts
Dublin is a city full of tricksters
Dublin is a city full of priests
Dublin is a city full of rumors
Seventy two thousand at least
But what it means to me the most
Dublin is a city full of ghosts
The ghosts of my joy, the ghosts of my tears
The ghosts of my glorious dissolute years
The ghost of adventure wilder than words
The ghost of the night I first made love to her
Dublin is a city full of humor
Dublin is a city full of wit
Dublin is a city full of buskers
Playing old Waterboys hits
But what it means to me the most
Dublin is a city full of ghosts
The ghost of a fiddle, the ghost of a sax
The ghost of a sound that ain't ever coming back
The ghost of a friendship, curdled and sour
The ghost of a time when I still had the power
Dublin is a city full of magic
Dublin is a city full of light
Dublin is a city full of wonder
Dublin is a city full of shite
But what it means to me the most
Dublin is a city full of, city full of ghosts
City full of ghostsEmbed
