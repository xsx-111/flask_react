Sensitive Children LyricsSensitive children
Seeing things you don't
Sensitive children
Walking where you won't
You can't contain her
Just love her to the bone
Strange little alien
Acting like she don't belong
Strange little alien
Dancing to a different song
You can't control her
Just love her hard and strong
Child of the unseen
Deep as the sea is blue
Child of the unseen
She ain't made like me and you
Just use your heart
And love her through and through
Sensitive children
Wise beyond their years
Sensitive children
Open to a world of tears
Give them your love
Before they disappear
