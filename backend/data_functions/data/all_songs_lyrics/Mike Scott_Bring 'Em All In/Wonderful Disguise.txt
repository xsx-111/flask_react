Wonderful Disguise LyricsThrough the curtains the daylight crept
I looked at my lover as she slept
And as I watched her face I wept...
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
As I was driving into town
The guy in the next car turned around
And as I met his gaze I found
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
Outside the museum I was addressed
By a blind man in his pants and vest
I was most impressed
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
Fat woman, standing in a queue
Her hat, shoes, coat and gloves were blue
And when she turned around I knew
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
I came home and halfway up the stair
A drunk was tearing out his hair
You should have heard him scream and swear
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
The President was on the News at Ten
Looking like he could use a friend
And then I looked again
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguise
Stood in front of the mirror all alone
Examined my features skin and bone
Looked at this face I've always known
It was a wonderful disguise
It was a wonderful disguiseEmbed
