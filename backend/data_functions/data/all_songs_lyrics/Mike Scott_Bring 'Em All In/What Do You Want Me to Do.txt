What Do You Want Me to Do LyricsI've tried to do things my own way
I've tried to do what people say
And I'm going nowhere fast
And I'm turning to you at last
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do Lord?
I can see the lights of home
But I can't get there on my own
I can see the landing strip
But I need you to steer my ship
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do Lord?
I've been a foll and I've been a clown
I let the enemy turn me around
I've wasted love and I've wasted time
I've been rpoud and I've been blind
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do Lord?
I've got a lot of things to change
A whole man to rearrange
And if you show me how
I'll begin right now
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do?
What do you want me to do Lord?
I'm listening...Embed
