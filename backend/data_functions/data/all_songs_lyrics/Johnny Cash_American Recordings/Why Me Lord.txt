Why Me Lord LyricsWhy me, Lord, what have I ever done
To deserve even one of the blessings I've known?
Why me, Lord, what did I ever do
That was worth love from you or the kindness you've shown?

Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your hand

Try me, Lord, if you think there's a way
That I can try to repay what I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I could show someone else
What I've been through myself on my way back to you

Lord help me, Jesus, I've wasted it so
Help me, Jesus I know what I am
Now that I know that I've needed you so
Help me Jesus, my soul's in your handEmbed
