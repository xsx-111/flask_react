Tennessee Stud LyricsBack about eighteen and twenty-five
I left Tennessee very much alive
I never would've made it through the Arkansas mud
If I hadn't been riding on a Tennessee stud
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's pa
One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Fud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
Drifted on down into no man's land
I crossed the river called the Rio Grande
I raced my horse with a Spaniard's foe
'Til I got me a skin full of silver and gold
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree
We got in a fight over Tennessee
We pulled our guns and he fell with a thud
And I rode away on the Tennessee stud
The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee stud
I rode right back across Arkansas
I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa
I found that girl with the golden hair
She was riding on a Tennessee mare
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor
Little horse colt playing 'round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair
And the Tennessee stud loves the Tennessee mare

The Tennessee stud was long and lean
The color of the sun and his eyes were green
He had the nerve and he had the blood
There never was a horse like the Tennessee studEmbed
