Like a Soldier LyricsWith the twilight colors falling and the evening laying shadows
Hidden memories come stealing from my mind
And I feel my own heart beating out the simple joy of living
And I wonder how I ever was that kind
But the wild road I was rambling was always out there calling
And you said a hundred times I should have died
Then you reached down and touched me and lifted me up with you
So I believe it was a road I was meant to ride

I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
I don't have to do that anymore
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
There are nights I don't remember and pain that's been forgotten
And a lot of things I choose not to recall
There are faces that come to me in my darkest secret memories
Faces that I wish would not come back at all
But in my dream's parade of lovers from the other times and places
There's not one that matters now, no matter who
I'm just thankful for the journey and that I've survived the battles
And that my spoils of victory is you
I'm like a soldier getting over the war
I'm like a young man getting over his crazy days
Like a bandit getting over his lawless ways
Every day gets better than the day before
I'm like a soldier getting over the warEmbed
