Redemption LyricsFrom his hands it came down, from the side it came down
From the feet it came down and ran to the ground
Between heaven and hell, a teardrop fell
In the deep crimson dew, the tree of life grew

And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood
From the tree streamed a light that started the fight
'Round the tree grew a vine on whose fruit I could dine
My old friend Lucifer came, fought to keep me in chains
But I saw through the tricks of six-sixty-six

And the blood gave life to the branches of the tree
And the blood was the price that set the captives free
And the numbers that came through the fire and the flood
Clung to the tree and were redeemed by the blood
From his hands it came down, from his side it came down
From his feet it came down and ran to the ground
And a small inner voice said "you do have a choice"
The vine engrafted me and I clung to the tree2Embed
