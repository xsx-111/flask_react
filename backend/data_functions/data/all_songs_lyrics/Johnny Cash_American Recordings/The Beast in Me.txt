The Beast in Me LyricsThe beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bars
Restless by day and by night rants and rages at the stars
God help the beast in me
The beast in me has had to learn to live with pain
And how to shelter from the rain
And in the twinkling of an eye, might have to be restrained
God help the beast in me
Sometimes it tries to kid me
That it's just a teddy bear
And even somehow manage to vanish in the air
And that is when I must beware of the beast in me
That everybody knows
They've seen him out dressed in my clothes
Patently unclear if it's New York or New Year
God help the beast in me1Embed
