Days That Used to Be LyricsPeople say don't rock the boat, let things go their own way
Ideas that once seem so right, now have gotten hard to say
I wish that I could talk to you and you could talk to me
'Cause there very few of us left my friend
From the days that used to be
Seemed like such a simple thing to follow one's own dream
But possessions and concession are not often what they seem
They drag you down and load you down in disguise of security
But we never had to make those deals
In the days that used to be
Talk to me, my long lost friend, tell me how you are
Are you happy with your circumstance, are you driving a new car
Does it get you where you want to go, with a seven year warranty
Or just another hundred thousand miles away
From the days that used to beEmbed
