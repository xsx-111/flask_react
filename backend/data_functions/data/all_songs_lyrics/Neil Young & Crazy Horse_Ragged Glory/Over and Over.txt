Over and Over LyricsAt night when the sky is clear and the moon is shining down
My heart goes running back to you
I love the way you open up and let me in
So I go running back to you
Over and over again
Over and over again my love
Over and over again with you
Over and over again my love
Over and over again with you
Remember the nights of love and that moment on the beach
That wasn't really too long ago
But we paid the price of time, and now it's out of reach
And so the broken circle go
Over and over again
Over and over again my love
Over and over again with you
Over and over again my love
Over and over again with you
Somewhere in a fire of love, our dreams went up in smoke
We danced beneath silver rain
Upon the fields of green, where time was just a joke
And now the feeling's just the same
Over and over again
Over and over again my love
Over and over again with you
Over and over again my love
Over and over again with youEmbed
