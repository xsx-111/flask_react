Mother Earth (Natural Anthem) LyricsOh, Mother Earth
With your fields of green
Once more laid down
By the hungry hand
How long can you
Give and not receive
And feed this world
Ruled by greed
And feed this world
Ruled by greed
Oh, ball of fire
In the summer sky
Your healing light
Your parade of days
Are they betrayed
By the men of power
Who hold this world
In their changing hands
They hold the world
In their changing hands
Oh, freedom land
Can you let this go
Down to the streets
Where the numbers grow
Respect Mother Earth
And her giving ways
Or trade away
Our children's days
Or trade away
Our children's days
Respect Mother Earth
And her giving ways
Or trade away
Our children's days1Embed
