White Line Lyrics
I came to you when I needed a rest
You took my love and put it to the test
I saw some things that I never would have guessed
Feel like a railroad, I pulled a whole load behind
That ol' white line is a friend of mine
And its good times we've been making
Right now I'm rollin' down the open road
And the daylight will soon be breaking

I was adrift on a river of pride
It seemed like such a long easy ride
You were my raft but I let you slide
I've been down but I'm coming back up again
And I'm rolling down the open road
Where the daylight will soon be breaking
Right now I'm thinking about these things that I know
But it's good time that we've been makingEmbed
