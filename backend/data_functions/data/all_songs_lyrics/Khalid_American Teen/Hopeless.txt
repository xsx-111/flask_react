Hopeless Lyrics
Spend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget

Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left

I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Used to lift me higher
But I guess our time's expired
I'm giving you the match
Set our love on fire

Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue

Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left

I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Ooh yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue, oh
Yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue12Embed
