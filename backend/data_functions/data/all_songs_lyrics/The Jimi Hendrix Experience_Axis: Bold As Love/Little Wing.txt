Little Wing Lyrics

Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind

When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing42Embed
