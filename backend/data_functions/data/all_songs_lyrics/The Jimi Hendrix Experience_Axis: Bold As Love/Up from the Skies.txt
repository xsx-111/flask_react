Up from the Skies Lyrics
I just want to talk to you
I won't uh, do you no harm
I just want to know about your different lives
On this here people farm
I heard some of you got your families
Living in cages, tall and cold
And some just stay there and, dust away
Past the age of old

Is this true?
Please let me talk to you

I just want to know about
The rooms behind your minds
Do I see a vacuum there
Or am I going blind?
Or is it just uh, remains from vibrations
And echoes long ago
Things like "Love the World"
And uh, "Let your fancy Flow"

Is this true?
Please let me talk to you
Let me talk to you
I have lived here before, the days of ice
And of course this is why I'm so concerned
And I come back to find the stars misplaced
And the smell of a world that has burned
A smell of the world that has burned

Yeah well, maybe
Maybe it's just a change of climate
I can dig it
I can dig it baby, I just want to see

So where do I purchase my ticket?
I would just like to have a ringside seat
I want to know about the new Mother Earth
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything
I want to hear and see everything

Aw, shucks
If my daddy could see me now
Everything, everything
Everything, everything4Embed
