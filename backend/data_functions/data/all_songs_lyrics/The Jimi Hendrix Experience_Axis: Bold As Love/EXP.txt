EXP Lyrics
Good Evening Ladies and Gentleman
Welcome to radio station EXP
Tonight we are featuring an interview
With a very peculiar looking gentleman
Who goes by the name Mr. Paul Caruso
On the dodgy subject of are there
Or are there not flying saucers or UFOs?
Um, please Mr. Caruso, could you give us
Your regarded opinion on this nonsense
About spaceships and even space people?

Thank you. As you all know
You just can't believe everything
You see and hear, can you?
Now, if you'll excuse me
I must be on my way

Ehh... but, but, but, but
Huh, I don't believe it
