Juicebox Lyrics
Everybody sees me, but it's not that easy
Standing in the light field, standing in the light field
Waiting for some action, waiting for some action over
Why won't you come over here?
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love

Old time grudges will die so slowly
I know you miss the way I saw you

You're cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold

Nobody can see me, everything's too easy
Standing in the light field, standing in the light field
Waiting for some actress, waiting for some actress to say
"Why won't you come over here?"
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Why won't you come over here?
We got a city to love
Old time love song will die so swiftly
You never trust me, for a while it was nice, but it's time to say bye

I'm cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
No-no-no, cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
Oh no-no-no-no, cold, you're so cold
You're so cold, you're so cold
No, no, you're so cold18Embed
