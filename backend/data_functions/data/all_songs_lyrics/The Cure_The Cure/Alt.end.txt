Alt.end Lyrics
Yeah, it's a big bright beautiful world
Just the other side of the door
Six billion beautiful faces
But I saw them all before

No, this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone

And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another go around
I want this to be the end

I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It's for me and you

For all my dreams came true
Yeah, I know I should care if you come with me
Yeah, and I should care if you go
I really should care about your love or your hate of me
Yeah, I should care but I don't
And it's not about giving up on you
It's not a case of do or die
It's simply that it's over and out for me
There's no more room inside

And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another go around
I want this to be the end

I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It's for me and you

For all my dreams came true

Yeah, it's a big bright beautiful world
I just see other side of the door
Six billion beautiful faces
But I saw them all before
No, this is not about running out on you
Not a case of right or wrong
It's only that it's over and done for me
It's already been and gone

And I don't want another go around
I don't want to start again
No, I don't want another go around
I want this to be the end

I want this to be the end
I don't want to start again
I want this to be the last thing we do
It's for me and you

This to be the last we go through
This to be the end
For all my dreams came true1Embed
