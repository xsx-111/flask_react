Taking Off Lyrics
Oww!

Tomorrow I can start again
Back to earth and carry on
The same as I did yesterday
Yeah, I'll pick it up once more
And morning I'll be onto it
From square one start
And push it for a bit
Like I do everyday
I'll get it down for sure

But tonight
I climb with you
Tonight
So high with you
Tonight
I shine with you
Tonight
Oh, I'm so alive with you

Tomorrow I'll begin anew
With heavy head to hold it
As I do it all like yesterday
Yeah, I'll break it out again
And morning I'll be there in time
For clock back move
And make it for awhile
To get through everyday
I'll roll it out the same
But tonight
I climb with you
Tonight
So high with you
Tonight
I shine with you
Tonight
Oh, I'm so alive with you

It's always here and never there
With you
It's always here and never where
With you
It's always here and never how
With you
It's always here and always now

Tomorrow I will start again
Back to earth and carry on
The same as I did yesterday
Yeah I'll pick it up once more
And morning I'll be onto it
Square one start
And bit a for it push
Like I do everyday
I'll get it down for sure
But tonight
I climb with you
Tonight
So high with you
Tonight
I shine with you
Tonight
Oh, I'm so alive with youEmbed
