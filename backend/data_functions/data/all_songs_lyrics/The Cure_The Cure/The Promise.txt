The Promise Lyrics
How time will heal? Make me forget, you promised me
Time will heal, make me forget, you promised me
Love will save us all, and time will heal, you promised me
You promised me, you promised me
How love will save? Make me forget, you promised me
Love will save, make me forget, you promised me
Time will heal us all, and love will save, you promised me
I trusted you, I wanted your words
Believed in you, I needed your words
Time will heal, make me forget
And love, love will save us all

You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time, you promised me another life
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me

So I swallowed the shame and I waited, buried the blame and I waited
Choked back years of memories, I pushed down the pain, I waited
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
Trying to forget
You promised me another wish, another way
You promised me another dream, another day
You promised me another time, you promised me another lie
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me
You promised me

Here I waited, and I waited, and I waited
And I waited, and I waited, and I waited
And I'm still waiting3Embed
