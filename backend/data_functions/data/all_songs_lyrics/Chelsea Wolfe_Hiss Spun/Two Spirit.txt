Two Spirit Lyrics
Two spirit, two spirit
Two spirit, two spirit

Time sped up and slowed down
Without regard for anyone
I called out from the deepest part
I feel concave, inverted for you
I'll be screaming through the afterlife
I'll be hunting for you, buried under flowers

Two spirit, two spirit

I want it back, I want it back
What was taken from me, I want it back

So, stop running
From the weight of existence

Show me your insides
Show me what's underneath
Show me your bruises
Be your own GodEmbed
