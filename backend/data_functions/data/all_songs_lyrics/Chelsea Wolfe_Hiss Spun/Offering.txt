Offering Lyrics
Holy life that you liken to nothing bursts at the seams
All the while stem the tide, I have seen it in my dreams
Here a fount in the desert, it was more than I could be
Human life as a lesson, you will see the mess of me

Hear it there, feel it swarming underneath
Oh, when love came for me, the blue and salton sea
A thousand lives lived in circles, a planet burning at the seams
Skeletal sand as a lesson that became an offering

River nigh, river light, sent us burning out to sea
Holy love, if you let it, never wanted it to be
You and I, you, a lesson, but never offered it to me
Human life gone wild, it was not enough for me

You and I, you and I won't grow
You and I, in our wild, won't listen
It was rife, it was rife with unholy offerings
It was rife, it was rife with the flowers of deceitEmbed
