Particle Flux Lyrics
Though you try to swallow me whole
I succumb to nothing
My shelter come with me
You know in this hell, I am torn

Flux of terrain we've been on before
Made it through oblivion, then they closed the door

Needles of meadow
Houses and rooms of perfumes
I have the same of you, now
What fever you'll have of me, soon
Here, time is endless
The voices I love call me home
Who knows for all distance?
What fuses me into you, now?

Flux of terrain we've been on before
Made it through oblivion, then they close the door
On a lonely road again, we've been on before
Mothers tell their children, "We're going home"
Breathes you away, breathes you away
Breathes you away, breathes you away
Breathes you away, breathes you away
Breathes you away, breathes you awayEmbed
