Twin Fawn Lyrics
Were you sleeping on the other side
Into frozen, monstrous light
It killed you, a stillbirth, anonymous loss
The twin fawns, the roses, nothing lives long
I feel you, phantom touch, although you're far
I hear you, I taste your blood, I haven't had enough

You've gone away on the inside in time
You've gone away on the inside in time

You cut me open, you lived inside
You kill the wonder, nowhere to hide
I held you sober, white smoke and low life
A big pill to swallow, a mountain to climb

True love, twin fawn
Skin crawl, twin fawn

A cold flash, it hurts to stay, but it hurts to stop
Sharpened by gritstone, my heart was shorn
You don't kneel, you don't cry
You'll break the neck of any man who'll try
You've gone away on the inside in time
You've gone away on the inside in time

You cut me open, you lived inside
You kill the wonder, nowhere to hide
I held you sober, white smoke and low life
A big pill to swallow, a mountain to climb

True love, twin fawn
Skin crawl, twin fawn, true love3Embed
