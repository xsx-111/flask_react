Static Hum Lyrics
They gave you to war, gave you away
Garden of stones marks the debt
She wears her horrors like a welt
Glitch of a woman self-destructing

Static hum
Static hum
Static hum
Static

Fuse by the flux, cradle the roots
Shedding of blood glowing like the flaming Sun
Euphoria hiss, love me when I fall apart
Ire restrained, I'm ready to let it go
I'm ready to fall apart

Static hum
Static hum
Static hum
Static
Static hum
Static hum
Static hum
Static
Hum static, twist it, grasp it
Burning planet, stung and rabid
Hum static, twist it, grasp it
Burning planet, stung and rabid
Burning planet, humming staticEmbed
