Vex Lyrics
Hush, ancient purr
I swore off obsidian thoughts
And lay awake on broken glass
I bled out more than once
I drew the poison out

The scavenger feeds in hum of low sea
Cast-off exuviae in fragility
I kept my head down and bit my tongue
Until I tasted love

Rare form at the casement, for which I burn
Perfect psychosis, noiselessly whirrs
Then hear the reflections, the words they demean
(Then come, destroyer, then come, destroyer)
(We'll fight with claws and teeth)1Embed
