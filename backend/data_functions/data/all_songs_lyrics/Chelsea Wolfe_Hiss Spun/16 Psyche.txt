16 Psyche Lyrics
I've spent, in different beds
Many moons
And that's the way I prefer it

"I can't", she said
"I'd save you, but I can't hide"

I feel it crawl up my legs
Let me wrap you up in these thighs
It gets me out of my head, again

"I can't", she said
"I'd save you, but I can't love"

16 Psyche
Coma tail quivering
Knew all along

"I can't"
She said, "I'd save you, but I can't"
She said, "I'd save you, but the world's bent"
She said, "I'd save you, but I can't"4Embed
