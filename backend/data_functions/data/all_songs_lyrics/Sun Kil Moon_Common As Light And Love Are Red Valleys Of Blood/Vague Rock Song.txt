Vague Rock Song LyricsThis is my vague rock song
Everybody sing along
This is my vague rock song
Everybody sing along
This is my vague rock song
Everybody sing along
This is my vague rock song
Everybody's gotta have one
This is my vague rock song
Everybody sing along
This is my vague rock song
Everybody's gotta have one
This is my vague rock song
Everybody sing along
Sounds a little like Biz Markie
Or Cypress Hill with a little bit of me
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Come on now, everybody dance
Watch out right here
You weren't expecting this
Frank Zappa part
This little part's gonna be good, this little part's gonna be good
Let's go to Africa
Rumble in the jungle
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
Ali, boma ye
I hope you like my vague rock song
And that you aren't too terribly bummed
I hope you like this vague rock song
I feel it's one that you can hum
And the words are not too many or too fast
I feel it's something that everyone can grasp
You gotta have a vague rock song
In your catalog that everyone can sing along
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance (Come on)
Come on now, everybody dance
Went on a walk today
Stopped at the gym and I lifted some weights
I'm middle-aged and feeling out of shape
Don't wanna look like a California raisin
It's the natural evolution of life
Gotta lay off bread, pasta, and white rice
Gotta get outta bed sometime and break a sweat
Doc says I need to diet and a steady exercise regiment
On the way to the studio I stop into a store
The woman was staring at a TV that was blaring
I said, "Damn, what's going on?"
She said, "A chlorine attack in Syria. People are hospitalized and four of them are gone."
Then a homeless guy came in begging her for food
He said, "It's hot out here. I'm not a thief. Please, ma'am, can you give me something cool?"
She stepped away from the cash register
I walked over to the refrigerator
She said, "Okay, please pick an ice cream, sir."
He said, "Thank you, ma'am," and carefully selected a mint-flavored Klondike bar
I said, "That was nice of you. Where are you from?"
She said, "Syria
And that's why the glum look on my face"
All of a sudden the world got gray
So quit dancing at least for today
One minute there's life and love
Next minute, red valleys of blood
All of a sudden the world got gray
So quit dancing at least for today
One minute there's life and love
Next minute, red valleys of blood
So there goes my vague rock song
I really tried but there's wars going on
And Syrian grocery clerks with sad looks in their eyes
Having interactions with homeless guys
So there goes my vague rock song
You no longer need to sing along
Try to do something nice today
Send your a lover a nice bouquet
Of flowers and say "I love you"
Though I gave it my best try
I learned that I'm not a vague rock guyEmbed
