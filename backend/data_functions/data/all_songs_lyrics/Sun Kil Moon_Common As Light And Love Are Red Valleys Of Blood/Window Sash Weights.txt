Window Sash Weights LyricsTwo A.M., the birds are chirping outside
And they're keeping me awake
Outside in the backseat of my girlfriend's car, some old rusty window sash weights
Left over from the renovation down below, the old Chinese lady recently died
She's been living in the unit underneath me for 21 years
And has been there since 1975
Gonna take the sash weights to my old house and put them in a circle in the backyard
This winter I'm gonna plant an Italian Pine in the center and let it take root while the rain pours down on it hard
This week, gonna fly to New York and play Sarah Lawrence College
And dust my nylon-string guitar off and play a various selection of songs on it
And something I say will likely be viewed as offensive and cause a student to be alarmed
Or if a college girl is nice to me and I speak to her, it might be misconstrued and I won't be pardoned
Will a nearby voyeuristic blogger read purposefully too deeply into it
Go home, report it on cyber and tug on his dick, and wait for hits
Oh sweet tonight is quiet and the birds outside sing sing sing sing sing sing
And I'm still high from last night, I played with my old friend David J and some nice girls accompanied us on strings
And afterwards we rushed off to see Garland Jeffreys
He sang "New York Skyline," it was one of the most beautiful things that I had ever seen
And after that, gonna record with Nate and Steve in Hoboken
Nate called me yesterday, his wife is pregnant, I told him, "Man, congratulations"
Oh how things change, and that's an interesting part of getting up there in age
Seeing how we all grow older and how our lives and the colors around us change
When I get back, I'm gonna take a trip with my girlfriend down to L.A
Gonna stay at the Cecil hotel for a night, where an alleged girl, allegedly named Elisa Lam, allegedly stayed
It's been on my mind since I think the story of her death was possibly staged
She died at 21 years old in 2013, the height of the internet age
Yet only 2 known photos, plus the one on the elevator with the pixelated face
Not one press conference about how a Canadian's dead body was found on that February day
I once worked at a residential hotel with one fourth the amount of rooms as the Cecil
And the elevators and hallways were always active with hookers and pimps and drug addicts and SSI people
And I'm telling you all that elevator footage of Elisa Lam looks totally rigged
Six hundred rooms and no one walked down the hall and tried to get on that elevator with her
Who in the fuck do you think you're kidding?
Well I'm gonna check it out, I'm gonna ask for the room with the old tenant, Richard Ramirez
I don't spook easy and true crime is fascinating to me and that's my right as an American
My girlfriend said she's totally not into it but she's happy to take me there and drive me home
As long as in the morning we can visit her parents, and I said, great, I liked the bed in the guest room, it's nice and soft
Now lets cut some vague rock lyrics
Please please please please please please please please please please please
La di da di la di da di la di da di la di la di la di la di dii
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I love you too, ghost girl in the elevator, hearing voices in the hall
Bon Jovi's seen a million faces, and he's rocked them all
Those are his words, but I omitted one, and the other two, I installed
You're not quite a million faces, but I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
Though we are imperfect, though we are human, yes, we are all flawed
I see your face and I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I see your face and love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all
Though I am imperfect, though I am human, though I am flawed
I see all your faces and love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all, love you all
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all
I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all, I love you all1Embed
