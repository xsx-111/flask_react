I Love You Forever and Beyond Eternity LyricsCame home from tour, it has been two months, I know
The summer is passing, I'm looking heavier, I know
Lay down on my bed I look down, my god my belly looks like Play-Doh
I'm almost fifty, I guess it's just the way life goes
Yesterday I got back into my better exercise routine
Laid off carbs, walked a few miles, I wanna be healthy and grow old
I wanna look good to you the way you look good to me
But I ain't twenty-five anymore, it's hard, it's just the way life goes
Turned on the TV and I saw on the news that in Japan a man stabbed to death nineteen people who were handicapped
My mind can't wrap itself around these things anymore, it's just the way life goes for some right down the fucking toilet bowl
I love my friends, P.S. friends the ones who love you back and most of all it's my family and you and your dog and your cat
Some have moved on and went down very different paths
I guess it's just the way it's just the way it's just the it's just the way life goes
Fog horns kept me up all night, you were beside me, I laid awake with jetlag and I tried to write
Talked on the phone to my foreign concert promoters, the cyclical way of life is a repetitive motor
When I'm fifty next year, I'm gonna try to pick my punches
Listen to my soul and try to trust my hunches
My body's telling me, that it's time to slow them
My creative calling will never stop going
Got me a house in the mountains and we rarely go
In this summer cause I'm always on the road
If I'm lucky at Christmas time we catch a glimpse to the Christmas snow
It's just the way life goes
It's the best part of the year, the glow of Christmas
The smell of turkey and stuff and watching movies and the candles flickering
I watch The Shining every Christmas religiously and A Christmas Story plays for twenty-four hours on TNT
Next year gonna try to spend some more time with you be the man I like to be and that's a better man to you
What's the year of (?) for once my garden out there in the mountains will stay alive
This point is about where I stopped the song a few weeks ago
Then I left for Buenos Aires, got a bad cough on the flight over
Now I'm laying in bed the hotel classical, got a decent nights sleep and tonight is my show
Gonna kill like I do every time, we're in this life once and when I arrive, Baby, I arrive
Gonna sing my songs and be back to you in a short time but I stop in New Orleans first, but I'm telling you, Baby, when I get home, we gonna be just fine
Sometimes when I'm alone in my thoughts, there is a war going on and my stomach is in knots
A lot of times on stuck on planes alone in my thoughts, wondering what the right thing is and what is not
Today I was alone in my thoughts, walked along the sidewalk, where this year Will Smith was shot
Will Smith the New Orleans saint, stupid, not the fucking actor, who were all times an inch away from playing a disaster
And of course I come back and I turn on the news
Look what happened up in Baton Rouge
The whole city is under the fucking waters as far as my cough and my travel was, gonna quit my bitchin'
Tonight I'm alone in my thoughts and at peace with myself, the choices I made and all the books and CDs on my shelf
Should have spent some hurts and sadness along the way
But I think of my friends, who have passed every single god damn day
And Caroline, your support and your love means so much to me
Every great man has a great woman behind him, who gives him strength and freedom to be the man, he is set out to be being
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternity
I love you baby forever and beyond eternityEmbed
