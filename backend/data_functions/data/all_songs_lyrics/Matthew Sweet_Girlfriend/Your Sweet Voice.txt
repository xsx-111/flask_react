Your Sweet Voice LyricsSpeak to me with your sweet voice
And take me through another night
Speak to me with your soft voice
And I will surely be alright
If I can close my eyes without a fear
Speak to me with your sweet voice (Your sweet voice) near
Hold me in your warm hand
And I could sleep with you tonight
Hold me in your warm hand
And I could sleep with you tonight
And all my earthly cares might fade away
If you hold me in your warm hand that way
It's as close as I get to love, as close as I get to love
Speak to me with your sweet voice (With your sweet voice) again
Speak to me with your sweet voice (With your sweet voice)
And take me through another night
Speak to me with your soft voice
And I will surely be alright
If I can close my eyes without a fear
Speak to me with your sweet voice (Your sweet voice)
Speak to me with your sweet voice (Your soft voice)
Speak to me with your sweet voice (Your sweet voice)
Speak to me with your sweet voice (Your sweet voice)Embed
