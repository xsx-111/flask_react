Superdeformed LyricsThere's something I should tell you
Before I take your blindfold off
I've been twisted and turned
By what I have learned
I'm superdeformed
But my blood is warm
You know I'm superdeformed
My blood is still warm
But I'm superdeformed
You know I'm superdeformed
You can't say you weren't warned
I'm superdeformed, now dig it
Well, as soon as I was living
They dropped me in an open grave
And then as soon as I was dying
They said I was too young to save
Well, I guess I'm superdeformed
My blood is still warm
But I'm superdeformed
You know I'm superdeformed
You can't say you weren't warned
I'm superdeformed, now dig it
So won't you love me tender?
Oh come on, kiss me sweetly
Oh won't you love me tender?
Oh come on, kiss me
There's something I should tell you
Before I take your blindfold off
I've been twisted and turned
By what I have learned
I'm superdeformed
But my blood is warm
You know I'm superdeformed
My blood is still warm
But I'm superdeformed
You know I'm superdeformed
You can't say you weren't warned
I'm superdeformed, now dig it
Dig it
Dig it
Dig it
So won't you love me tender?
Oh come on, kiss me sweetly
So won't you love me tender?
Oh come on, kiss me sweetly
Won't you love me tender?
Oh come on, kiss me sweetly
Won't you love me tender?
Oh come on, kiss me sweetlyEmbed
