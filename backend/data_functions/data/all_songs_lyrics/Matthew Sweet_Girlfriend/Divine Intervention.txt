Divine Intervention LyricsI don't know where I'm gonna live
Don't know if I'll find a place
I'd have to think about it some
And that I do not wish to face
I guess I'm counting on his
Divine Intervention
I cannot understand my God
I don't know why it gets to me
One day my life is filled with joy
And then we find we disagree
All depending on his
Divine Intervention
Does he love us does he love us?
Does he love us does he love us?
I look around and all I see is destruction
We're all counting on his
Divine Intervention
Here comes the sunshine
Here comes the sunshine
Sunshine
The sunshine
Here it comesEmbed
