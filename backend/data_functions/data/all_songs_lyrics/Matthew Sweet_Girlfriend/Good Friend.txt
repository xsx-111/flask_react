Good Friend LyricsI want to love somebody
I hear you need somebody to love
Oh I want to love somebody
I hear you're looking
For somebody to love
'Cause you need to be back
In the arms of a good friend
And I need to be back
In the arms of a girlfriend
I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way
Oh I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way
Don't you need to be back
In the arms of a good friend?
Oh 'cause honey believe me
I'd sure love to call you
My girlfriend
Don't you need to be back
In the arms of a good friend?
Oh 'cause honey believe me
I'd sure love to call you
My girlfriend
'Cause you
Got a good thing going baby
You only need somebody to love
Oh you got a good thing going
You're only looking
For someone to love
'Cause you need to get back
In the arms of a good friend
And I'm never gonna set you free
No I'm never gonna set you freeEmbed
