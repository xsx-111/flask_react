Holy War LyricsI've spent twenty years learning to live
In a world that takes back all that it gives
But I do not want a war
'Cause I'm not in for killing another man
Defending my holy land
As if there's a god who would understand
Feeding the promised land
With your blood by my own hand
At Allah's own command
At Allah's own command
I've spent twenty years learning to live
In a world that takes back all that it gives
But I do not want a war
I don't know what's going on
In the scenes behind
I worry about it some of the time
And I hope there's not a war
'Cause I'm not in for killing another man
Defending my holy land
As if there's a god who would understand
And I would walk across highways
To find my fate
If that might settle your crude debate
But I do not want a war
'Cause I'm not in for killing another man
Defending my holy land
As if there's a god who would understand
Feeding the promised land
With your blood by my own hand
At allah's own command
At allah's own command
I came up from the desert and here I will die
Tooth for tooth and an eye for an eye
Though I didn't want a war
I went in for killing another man
Defending my holy land
As if there's a god who would understand
As if there's a god who would understand
I went in for killing another man
Defending my holy land
As if there's a god who would understand
As if there's a god who would understand
Oh yeah...Embed
