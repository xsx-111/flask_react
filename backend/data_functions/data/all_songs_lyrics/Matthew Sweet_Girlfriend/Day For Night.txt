Day For Night LyricsWhat you gave me
I could feel it
Like the warm rays of the sun
Such a small thing
Took me farther
Then I'd been with anyone
What else can I tell you?
My life was simply very bright
So I traded the day for night
Well I love you
And I want you
You should know that anyway
Well I love you
And I want you
Doesn't mean I'll stay
And how much can I tell you
When my brain is terminally light
And so bright
That I traded the day for
Night
What else can I tell you?
My life is simply very bright
So I traded the day for night
I traded the day for nightEmbed
