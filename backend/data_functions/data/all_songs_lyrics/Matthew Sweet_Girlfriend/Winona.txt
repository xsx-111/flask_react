Winona LyricsI tried to call you but the line was busy
Were you talking to a friend?
And when I tried again much later
I didn't want to let it ring again
So you can see I've got a problem
Back by popular demand
Sometimes I want to keep it from you
Sometimes I think you'll understand
Could you be my little movie star
Could you be my long lost girl
It's true that I don't really know you
But I'm alone in the world
When I think maybe I need you
I don't care if it's not true
'Cause it isn't so much what I need now
As what I want from you
(CHORUS)
(CHORUS)
I feel alone...
I feel alone...Embed
