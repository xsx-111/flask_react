Teenage Female LyricsShe sent me a letter just the other day
She said this is a record that I like to play
Yeah, this is a sound that I'm sure I enjoy
Sadly, though, I am without a boy
Now if I am jealous I hope it doesn't show
Maybe it's something I'm not meant to know
But could I ask you about the ring
That you wore in the video on TV
I am a Teenage Female
I am a Teenage Female
Who ever reads this may not understand
I am not your typical fan
Music is something that I need
So tell me please I don't want to plead
I am a Teenage Female
I am a Teenage Female
If I am jealous I hope it doesn't show
Maybe its something that I'm not meant to know
But could I ask you about the ring
That you wore in the video on TV
I am a Teenage Female
I am a Teenage FemaleEmbed
