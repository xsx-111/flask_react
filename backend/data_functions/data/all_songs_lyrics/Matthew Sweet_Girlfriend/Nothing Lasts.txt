Nothing Lasts LyricsIf one could stop time, or make it up
If two could realize
The best of luck
If I could locate a God above
And you only wanted to be loved
Then I'd try to hang on to the past
But you know that nothing, oh no, nothing lasts
Nothing lasts
It's time to move on
Let the past go
I've waited for you here
But you never showed
Although I asked you
To let me know
I only felt the cold wind blow
While I tried to hang on to the past
But you know that nothing
Oh no nothing lasts
Nothing's in your way
Now you can stand right up and run
Wouldn't even change things
If you took back what you'd done
I have tried to hang on to the past
But I couldn't keep my grasp cause nothing lasts
Nothing lasts
Nothing lastsEmbed
