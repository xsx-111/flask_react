Thought I Knew You LyricsI thought I knew you
I was in for a surprise
I let my love flow
From my heart into your eyes
And then I found out
That there was nothing I could know
Or guess about you
You'd go as far as you could go
And it took me years to figure out
That there was nothing I could give to you
Years to figure out that there was nothing you would take from me
And how can I describe the way you slowly put my hope away
And all of the time
I thought I knew you
I thought I knew you
But I wasn't even close
I had my heart set
On little more than a ghost
And I thought I'd show you
There was no way we could lose
I thought I'd force you
To realize and choose
And it took me years to figure out
That there was nothing I could show to you
Years to figure out that you were never really going to choose
And how can I describe the way I slowly lost my love for you
And all of the time
I thought I knew you
And it took me years to figure out
That there was nothing I could show to you
Years to figure out that you were never really going to choose
And how can I describe the way I slowly lost my love for you
And all of the time
I thought I knew youEmbed
