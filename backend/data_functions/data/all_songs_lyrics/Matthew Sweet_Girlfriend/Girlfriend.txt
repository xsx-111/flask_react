Girlfriend Lyrics
I wanna love somebody
I hear you need somebody to love
Oh, I wanna love somebody
I hear you're looking for someone to love

'Cause you need to
Be back in the arms of a good friend
And I need to
Be back in the arms of a girlfriend

I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way
Oh, I didn't know nobody
And then I saw you coming my way

Don't you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend?
Oh, 'cause, honey, believe me
I'd sure love to call you my girlfriend

Hoooo
(One, two, three, four)
Alright
Don't you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend?
Oh, 'cause, honey, believe me
I'd sure love to call you my girlfriend

'Cause you got a good thing going, baby
You only need somebody to love
Oh, you got a good thing going
You're only looking for someone to love
'Cause you need to
Get back in the arms of a good friend
And I'm never gonna set you free
No, I'm never gonna set you free2Embed
