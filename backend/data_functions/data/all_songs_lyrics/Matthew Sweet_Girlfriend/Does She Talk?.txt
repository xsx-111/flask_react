Does She Talk? LyricsWe're gonna do a sick one
One, two, one, two, three, four
She's just your size, she's sexy she's beautiful
Does she talk?
She's just your size, she's sexy she's beautiful
Does she talk?
'Cause, man, you can't teach a slithering snake how to walk
And did she lick your palm to tell you your fortune tonight?
Did she lick your palm to tell you your fortune tonight?
You know, sometimes it just isn't worth putting up a fight, is it?
Gonna need you a key to open the door to her heart
Gonna need you a key to open the door to her heart
Or are you afraid her body is missing that part?
Or I can— you up the— you can— me up the— alright
I can— you up the— you can— me up the— alright
Because they took channel 23 off the air last night
Down home
You're gonna like it
You're gonna like itEmbed
