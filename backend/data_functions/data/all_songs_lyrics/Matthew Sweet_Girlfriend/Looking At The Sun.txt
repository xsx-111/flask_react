Looking At The Sun Lyrics
Do you really want to run away with me?
Would you really like to run away with me?
I can feel very clearly, no longer see

For oh, looking at the sun, waiting for you to appear
Watched you getting nearer like I knew it in my heart
'Til the damage was already done, looking at the sun
Burned my eyes out, yeah, I'm blind now

Well, I was looking for somebody that you couldn't be
I was looking for somebody you will never be, no
I was so sure that there was nothing wrong with me, no

For oh, looking at the sun, waiting for you to appear
Watched you getting nearer like I knew it in my heart
'Til the damage was already done, looking at the sun
Burned my eyes out, yeah, I'm blind now

And I'm blind

But do you really want to run away with me?
Well, I can feel very clearly no longer
Looking at the sun, waiting for you to appear
Watched you getting nearer like I knew it in my heart
'Til the damage was already done, looking at the sun
Burned my eyes out, now I'm blind
Looking at the sun, waiting for you to appear
Watched you getting nearer like I knew it in my heart
'Til the damage was already done, looking at the sun
Burned my eyes out, yeah, I'm blind now

Yeah, I'm blind nowEmbed
