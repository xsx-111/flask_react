I Wanted To Tell You LyricsDo just what you want to
I think you're right
I do what I want to do, I do what I want to do
I let the world surround me
'Cause I saw no real harm
I didn't stop to think of you
You were already in my arms
I was wrong but I
I wanted to tell you, I wanted to telly you
What I couldn't say
I needed to find mine
But it took me a long time to see
Love. . . Well never mind
I know how you feel about that
Now what do you think about time

I wanted to tell you, I wanted to tell you
What I couldn't say
I needed to find mine
But it took me a long time to see

I do what I want to do, I do what I want to do
I do what I want to do, I do what I want to do
I let the world surround me
'Cause I saw no real harm
I didn't stop to think of you
You were already in my arms
But there was something. . 
I wanted to tell you, I wanted to tell you
What I couldn't say
I needed to find mine
But it took me a long time to see

Love. . Embed
