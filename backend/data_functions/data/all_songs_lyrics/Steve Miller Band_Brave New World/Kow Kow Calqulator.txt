Kow Kow Calqulator Lyrics
Kow Kow Calqulator
Was a very smooth operator
Had himself a pet alligator
Kept it in a chrome elevator, yeah
When the sun began to shine
The alligator come outside
Kow Kow played the chimes
Together they'd go for a ride

As they travelled with a heavy load
They came across a dead horse
At the side of the road
With two generals standing at each end
Fighting over whose fault it had been
And all that's left was this war
And they couldn't get things back together
Like they were before

Well, listen
Turn on your love light
Turn it on
Let it shine inside your heart
Let it shine
Turn on your love light
Turn it on, turn it on
Let it shine inside your mind
So many times, Kow Kow heard it said before
Oh, don't, lord, don't go near that door
The cause of our evil you'll uncover
Because of our misery, you discover
Well, misery seeks its own company
Kow Kow had heard it said
And now he sits there crying
Oh, with his hands across his head

Kow Kow Calqulator
You're a very smooth operator
Get back in your elevator
Kow Kow Calqulator
Turn on your love light
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Let it shineEmbed
