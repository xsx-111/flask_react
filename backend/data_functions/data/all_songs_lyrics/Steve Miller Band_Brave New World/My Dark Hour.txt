My Dark Hour Lyrics
My dark hour
My dark hour
You know it's drivin' me wild

Well, well, I went (To see the doctor)
And I had (My fortune read)
And you know (The doctor told me)
"Son, you better stay in bed"

Who's that comin' a-down that road
Looks like he's carryin' a heavy load
What’s that word that he started to say?
"Wanna come with me on my way?"

My dark hour
Mother nature's child
My dark hour
Oh, it's drivin' me wild

Well, I went (To see the doctor)
Just to have (My fortune read)
Well, well, well, well, well
(The doctor told me)
"Son, you better stay in bed"
So do you think these sinners will fall
Or do you think they'll survive us all?
Well, well, well, well, a-down this road
Won't you help me carry my load?

My dark hour
Mother nature's child
My dark hour
Oh, it's drivin' me wild

Oh, mother nature's child
Oh, yeah
Oh, oh, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, yeah…Embed
