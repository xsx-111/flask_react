Pink Cellphone Lyrics
Belief in the one true power
Belief in the one true power
Belief in the one true power

Can't stop the sound
Can you?
Can't stop the sound
Can't stop the sound
I can't stop you

X your eyes
Let the tape roll

Cause you're gonna get sick
That's right, to move on
Cause you wanna get sex
That's right, move on
Cause you're gonna get sex
That's right, to move on
Cause you're gonna get sex, sex
Move on
X your heart
Let the tape roll

Belief in the one true power

Can't stop the sound
Can you?
Can't stop the sound
I can't stop you

Axe your eyes
Let the tape roll

Cause you're gonna get sick
That's right, to move on
Cause you wanna get sex
That's right, move on
Cause you're gonna get sex
That's right, to move on

X your eyes
I'll tell you it
So your troubles continue to multiply and to grow as a direct result of your being misguided, deceived, misdirected or fooled
All of these are variations of the basic ego-gloried life thing in which you follow the gospel truth
Pursuing the wrong ideals and goals that lead you into sickness, unto (fuck off), and from this sickness springs the belief in the one true power
That cure that promised to erase the symptoms that stood between you and your goal
That's seductive to hear them offer relief and comfort without disturbing the faulty system of your beliefs, the belief in the one true power
Forever and ever, one nation, under (gnikcufttub)
The Father, the Son, and the Holy (gnikcufttub)
In Jesus name
Amen

Greasy filthy handjobs in truckstop restrooms
Hot Carling all over the place
Hot Carling, I turned that into a verb.. I hope you appreciate it
Carling, Hot Carling Academy
It's the school where you go to learn how to buttfuck
It's in England. They don't have blowjobs there because they're uncircumcised, and that is just disgusting
So they have to buttfuck, which also is disgusting because that extra foreskin traps all the germs, and the poop, and the buttfucking residue
It's sin, and that is why British people have bad teeth
Amen2Embed
