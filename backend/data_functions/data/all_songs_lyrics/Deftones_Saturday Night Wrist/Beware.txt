Beware Lyrics
You should know (by now), really
That this could end, really
You should know I could never make it work
(Wake up) It's pretend, really
Really (There)

Do you like the way the water tastes?
It's like gunfire
You knew but you could never say
Then come forth
Do you like the way the water tastes?
('Cause it's coming 'round)
'Round one more

Beware the water

You should know, babe
At least pretend you did know why
It's not like you were warned
So go on take a drink, really (There)

You like the way the water tastes
It's like gunfire
You knew that it was never safe
Take one more
Do you like the way the water tastes?
(Because it's coming around)
'Round one more
Beware the water
Beware the water

Teeth are dry
The wind blows
Fill cup, drink it
There you go

Beware the water
Beware the water
Beware the water

Do you like the way the water tastes?
Do you like the way the water tastes?6Embed
