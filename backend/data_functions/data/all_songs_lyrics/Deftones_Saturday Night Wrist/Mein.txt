Mein Lyrics
I've looked outside
But I never wandered out
I'd like to pull you into me
Intercept you in between
But I never wandered out
Outside

That way I'll always
Stay away from you
That way I'll always
Stay away from you

I've looked inside
But I never wandered in
I'd like to pull it into me
Intercept you in between
But I never wandered in
Inside

That way I'll always
Stay away from you
That way I'll always
Stay away from you
The universe breaking us down
The universe breaking us down

That way I'll always
Stay away from you
That way I'll always
Stay away from you
That way I'll always
Stay away from you

The universe breaking us down
The universe breaking us down
The universe breaking us down
The universe breaking us downEmbed
