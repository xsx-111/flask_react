Kimdracula Lyrics
The earth will see
Our eyes go blank tonight
And the earth will rot away
Go blink tonight

I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind

The earth disguised away
Don't blink tonight
And the earth will see our eyes
Don't blink tonight

I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind
I, I really wish these snakes were your arms
I, I really wish you'd make up your mind3Embed
