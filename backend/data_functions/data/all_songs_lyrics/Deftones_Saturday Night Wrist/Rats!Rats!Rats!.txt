Rats!Rats!Rats! Lyrics
Decide, decide
Is this it, is it? Decide
And it's not your style, is it?
Decide, decide
Is this it, is it just fine?
Things are really fine?

You wanted it
Was it like you dreamed?
You got it and
Was it like it seemed?

Yeah, I wanna say nothing, nothing
Not a fucking thing
I just wanna say something
Something, something

Decide, decide
Is this it, is it? Decide
And it's not your style, is it?
Decide, decide
Is this it, is it just fine?
Things are just fine
Everything is fine
Everything's just fine
Everything is fine
Everything is...

You wanted it
Was it like you dreamed?
You got it and
Was it like it seemed?

No I wouldn't say nothing, nothing
Not a fucking thing
'Cause I just wanna take something
Something, something

Now was it worth it, worth it
Just one fucking thing?
I could've said something
Something, something
Decide, decide
Is this it, is it? Decide
And it's not your style, is it?
Decide, decide
Is this it, is it just fine?
Everything's fine
Everything is fine
Everything's just fine
Everything is fine
