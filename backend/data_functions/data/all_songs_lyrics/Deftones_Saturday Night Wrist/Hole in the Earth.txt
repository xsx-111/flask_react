Hole in the Earth Lyrics
Can you explain to me how
You're so evil, how?
It's too late for me now
There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)
I'm out

There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)
I'm out

Can you explain to me now
If you're still able? Well
It's time I think you know the truth
There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)
I'm out
I hate all of my friends
They all lack taste sometimes

There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)
Please take a bow
This is the end
Somewhere
This is the end
Somewhere

There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)
There's a hole in the earth
(A hole in the earth)

I hate all of my friends
I'm out
There's a hole in the earth
I will wait
Somewhere5Embed
