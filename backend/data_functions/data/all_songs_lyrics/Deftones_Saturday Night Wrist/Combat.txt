Combat Lyrics
This time the finger's pointed right at you
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on!?
I ask you what side since you pointed it out
What side are you on what side are you on?
Yeah!

A waste of time if you don't believe
Can't decide till you've hit the ground
Make your mind 'cause you're holding me
Down (and I wanna get)
Down (and I wanna get)
Down

This time the finger pointed right at you
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on!?
I ask you what side since you pointed it out
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on?
On, on, on

A waste of time if you don't believe
Can't decide till you've hit the ground
Make your mind, though you don't believe
Can't decide till you've hit the ground
Make your mind cause you're holding me
Down (and I wanna get)
Down (and I wanna get)
Down (and I wanna get)
You
And don't think that I don't know
Because I do, but nice try
Cause that's what you're really like
Like, like, like
Let something out
Say something else
Decide whose side you're on

Whose side are you on, whose side are you on!?
(Go on?)
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on!?
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on!?
Whose side are you on?1Embed
