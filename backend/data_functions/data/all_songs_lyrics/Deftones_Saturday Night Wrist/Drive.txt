Drive Lyrics
Who's gonna tell you when
It's too late?
Who's gonna tell you things
Aren't so great?

You can't go on thinkin'
That nothing's wrong
And who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna pick you up
When you fall?
Who's gonna hang it up
When you call?
Who's gonna pay attention
To your dreams?
And who's gonna plug your ears
When you scream?

You can't go on thinkin'
That nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?
Who's gonna hold you down
When you shake?
Who's gonna come around
When you break?

You can't go on thinkin'
Nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?
You can't go on thinkin'
Nothing's wrong
Who's gonna drive you home tonight?

Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?
Who's gonna drive you home?1Embed
