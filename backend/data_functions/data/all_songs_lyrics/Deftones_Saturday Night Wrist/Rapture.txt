Rapture Lyrics
Two different types
The same kind of thread
Different needle sewn on
Hey, hey, hey
It's a rapture
But it's a different style
It's a rapture
The same kind of thread
Go ahead begin

Begin, you'll like it
Again it kills
And it feels like

One's inside of me
The other carves you out from me
Just two different tools, different designs
Can't choose one

With power
I know how you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you're fucking with me
It's a waste of my time
You said "I won't again, I swear to god!"
You said "I swear to god, I won't do it again!"
You said "I swear to god, I won't again!"
You said "I won't again, I swear to god!"

Instead, you just waste
Waste, waste my time
Instead you just waste
Waste my time

If one takes it away
The other one makes up for it
It's just two different views
Different designs
If I could choose one
Which one?

With power
I know how you are now
You twist everything else around
Now you're fucking with me
You're just a waste, waste
You begin
You begin, you like it
Begin, it kills
It feels like

You said "I swear to god, I won't again!"
You said "I won't again, I swear to god!"
You said "I swear to god, I won't again!"
You said "I won't again, I swear to god!"

Instead, you just waste, waste
Waste my time
Instead you just waste, waste
Waste my time

Two different types
The same kind of thread
Just different needles
A whole world, hey
It's a rapture
But it's a different style
It's a rapture
The same kind of threadEmbed
