Xerces Lyrics
Universe surrounds
When you're ready
It waits for us to
To leave this earth
Come on, they're calling your name
Out

I don't know
I could stay or leave
Either way
Cause the comet can take us
All the way through

Goodbye
Safe, Heaven
New, new
I'll be waving
Goodbye
Safe, Heaven
New, new
I'll be waving

Goodbye
Return to see
Everything looks the same
I don't know
If the change made was grave
'Cause the craving remains the same
Goodbye
Safe, Heaven
New, new
I'll be waving
Goodbye
Safe, Heaven
New, new

I'll be waving
