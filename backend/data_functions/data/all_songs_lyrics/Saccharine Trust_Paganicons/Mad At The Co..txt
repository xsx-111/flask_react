Mad At The Co. LyricsI'm tired of being called a production slave
Damaged soul working these hours
They shut us off they're inhumane
They're not our friends laughing at the bosses
Jokes
They couldn't care less
If we tried our best
As long as we put our sweat
Into their nice packages
They try to convince us
That they are not against us
We know they're lying
What's the useEmbed
