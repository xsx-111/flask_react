Community Lie LyricsIt was just the community lie
That's why we never felt any guilt
For the times we ridiculed her
We knew she wasn't any worst than the rest of us
No one ever calls a man a whore
That was the only defense she had
We never took time to hear her out
We were too busy looking for fault
That's when she fell to her knees
Who is it I'm living to please
That's when she fell to her face
That's when she
It was just the community lie
That's really all it was
We never thought she'd take it this far
What does it matter it'll happen again
Of course, it was justiceEmbed
