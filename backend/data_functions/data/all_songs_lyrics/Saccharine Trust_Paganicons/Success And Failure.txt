Success And Failure LyricsDelicate moment
Saw you again
Leap year summer
Presence drew in
Flies of success
Squandered about
Ritual fashion
Leaving no doubt
You were a hit
Plain to see
Busy boulevard
Hidden street
I prayed lightly
Weaved my path
Raise no question
How I survived
The aftermath
But I see no reason to covet
Cause I'm just thinking
It all seems to amusing
Failure and success
Laugh the day
Meet again
End up on the park bench
Exactly where I'm at now
Unnoticed
Wonder how
Bargained your way
Packs that bleed you
No thoughts
What they've made you
Success has sewn
A hand to your back
Paid what price
For the path
We traveled
But I see no reason to covet
Cause I'm just thinking
It all seems to amusing
Failure and success
Success and failure
Failure and success
Success and failure
Failure and success
Success and failureEmbed
