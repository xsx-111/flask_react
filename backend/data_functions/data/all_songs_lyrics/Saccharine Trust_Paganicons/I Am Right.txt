I Am Right LyricsYou were always cunning like the game you'd play
As your mindless kindless friends would say
You got what you wanted but not what you needed
No matter how hard you pleaded
Your eighteen and you know it all
So how in the hell could you ever fall
For such a thoughtless gutless fool
Who taught you about drugs and kept you out of school
Isn't that right
I am right
I am right
I am right
No one no one is gonna tell me otherwise
No one no one is gonna fill this boy with lies
The trash can jazzman really really was a has been
Though you laid him down like he was the last man
Through your family never took it calmly
When they pulled the covers you were in jeopardy
With your back in a brace you arms in a sling
You doctor saying haven't you had your fling
Well you have all your time to the protest line
But what did you get from screaming screaming screaming
I am right I am right
I am right I am right
No one no one is gonna tell me otherwise
No one no one is gonna fill this boy with lies
So forth and so forth you really had a cold heart
Once on your knees you weren't such a bad sport
You started crying when they caught you lying
No one ever said you weren't trying
With your mind on the freeway your mouth on a clich√©
You walked in the party talking like a D.J
You had your rations of middle class fashions
I am right I am right
I am right I am right
No one no one is gonna tell me otherwise
No one no one is gonna fill this boy with liesEmbed
