One Step Forward Lyrics
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na

One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon
One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon

One day you are dreadlocks, well dread!
Next day you are bald head, clean shave!

Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon
Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon

Are you-a commercialized, grabbing at the cash-backs?
This is a time of decision; Tell me, what is your plan? (Yeah)
Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon
Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon

Straight is the road that leads to destruction (Ooh yeah)
The road to righteousness is narrow (Ah, let me tell you say!)

(Onward!) Indictive feelings enter feeling, the truth is a fact, tell me!
Are you a con man, or are you-a dreadlocks, eh?

One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon
Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na
The road is rough and the hill is steep (Ah, let me tell you say!)
The mountain is high and the valley is deep (Ah yeah! Ah yeah!)

Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon
Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon

One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon
One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon

Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!

One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon
One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon
Straight is the road that leads to destruction (Ah, hear me when I say!)
The road to righteousness is narrow (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah!)

Indictive feelings enter feeling; The truth is a fact, tell me!
Are you a con man, or are you-a dreadlocks, oh?

Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon
Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon

One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon
One step forward, two step backward
Down inna Babylon

Onward, forward, don't step backward
Step out of Babylon
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah!
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah!Embed
