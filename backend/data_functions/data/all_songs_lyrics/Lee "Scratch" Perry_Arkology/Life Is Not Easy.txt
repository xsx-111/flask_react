Life Is Not Easy Lyrics
Well, I want, well, I want
With children want to stop crying (Uh-yeah; yeah, uh)

Life is not easy (Woah, no-no-no)
On ya (Woah)
Life is not easy, man (Woah, no-no-no)
On ya (Hear when I say)
It ruff, it tuff (In every way, man)
On ya (Woah)
It ruff, it tuff (In every way)
On ya

First generation comes
Feel it
Then the second generation comes
Feel it (Oh, Jah Jah)
Then the third generation comes
Feel it
No harm is going to happen to di fourth
Generation
Are they gonna feel it the same?
Well
Are they gonna feel it the same? (Oh, Jah Jah)
I feel it so I've got to shout it now (Woah)
But still
We're gonna live it up, nah give it up
We're gonna live it up, nah give it up
We're gonna live it, live it, live it, live it

Now that I realise
What is going on now
We got to ongle nice to stay alive
And without we don't have a nice
Many more will still go down (Uh-yeah, yeah)

Life is not easy (Woah, no-no-no)
On ya (Woah)
Life is not easy, man (Woah, no-no-no)
On ya (You can hear the children crying)

When they gonna stop crying?
Tell me now, tell me why
Oh, Jah Jah
Said, I need you now
Only you can solve this problem (Yeah)Embed
