Vampire Lyrics
Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire
Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire

I have the chalice to light up Jah fire
When I and I catch dem vampire
I and I a go set dem a-fire

I man trod up down a unity lane
See a Dreadlocks running down a Rastaman
Swear that if him catch him, him will kill him down
Di Dreadlocks couldn't catch the Rastaman

Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire
Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire

I have the chalice to light up Jah fire
When I and I catch dem vampire
I and I a go set dem a-fire
A true Rastaman nuh catch up a betting shop
A true Rastaman do not gamble
A true Rastaman do not play card pack
A true Rastaman always humble

Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire
Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire

I have the chalice to light up Jah fire
When I and I catch dem vampire
I and I a go set dem a-fire

A true Rastaman no fire no long gun
A true Rastaman no throw homemade bomb
A true Rastaman him no drink fi drunk
A true Rastaman do not gamble

Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire
Obediah, Obediah
Jah Jah send us here to catch vampire
I have the chalice to light up Jah fire
When I and I catch dem vampire
I and I a go set dem a-fire

Babylon a mash up the scene
And blaming the Rastaman
Babylon a mash up the scene
And blaming the RastamanEmbed
