Mr. President Lyrics
No-no-no
You can't do us so (No!)
No-no-no, you cyaan do (No!)

Oh, Mr. President, listen to me
I've got to tell you about the people's poverty
I know there is a lot that man you can do
Oh, but the pain we bearin' means nothing to you

Mr. President (No-No!)
Oh, Mr. President (No!)

Come off of your big chair
I and I need our share
You sit down like a big bear
Mi say, you full of fear
Driving in your big car
An' you got no spare
You got to come out an' push (You know)
Like any other brother do (You know)

Push, boy (Wicked men)
No horse  on grass

I man a go drive you out your big chair
I and I need our share
You sit down like a big bear
Say, you full of fear

No gwan so, Mr. President, no gwan so (You know)
No gwan so, Mr. President, no gwan so (Hеy!)


Sitting in your big chair
You full of fear
Sit down like a big bear
Say, you full of fеar
Driving in your big car
An' got no spare
Got come out an' push (Push, boy)
I and I need our share, Mr. President
Come out of your big chair
I and I need our share
You sit down like a big bear
Say, you full of fear
Driving in your big car
An' you got no spare (Push, boy)
Push along the wayEmbed
