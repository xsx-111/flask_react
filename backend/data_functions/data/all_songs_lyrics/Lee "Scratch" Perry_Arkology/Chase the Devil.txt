Chase the Devil Lyrics
Lucifer son of the morning, I'm gonna chase you out of Earth

I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase Satan out of Earth
I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase the devil out of Earth
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race

Satan is a evilous man
But him can't chucks it on I-man
So when I check him my lass in hand
And if him slip, I gone wid him hand

I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase Satan out of Earth
I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase the devil out of Earth
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race

Him haffi drop him fork and run
Him can't stand up to Jah Jah son
Him haffi left yah with him gun
Dig off with him bomb
I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase Satan out of Earth
I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase the devil out of Earth
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race

Satan is a evilous man
But him can't chucks it on I-man
So when I check him my lass in hand
And if him slip, I gone wid him hand

I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase Satan out of Earth
I'm gonna put on a iron shirt and chase the devil out of Earth
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race
I'm gonna send him to outer space to find another race
