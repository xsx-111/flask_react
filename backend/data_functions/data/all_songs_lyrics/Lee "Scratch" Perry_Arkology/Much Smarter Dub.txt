Much Smarter Dub Lyrics
Evil men of the past
You think that you're smart
But I will gut you off, man

You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I
You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I

Do you outgrown I?
And get thing call "experience"?
You get all the praise
While they say that I'm disobedient


What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
