Life Is Not Easy Dub Lyrics
Well, I want, well, I want
With children want to stop crying (Uh-yeah; yeah, uh)

Life is not easy (Woah, no-no-no)
On ya (Woah)
Life is-


Feel it
Then the second generation comes


Uh, Jah Jah
I feel it so I've got to shout it now (Woah)
But still
We're gonna live it up, nah give it up
We're gonna live it up

Oh, Jah Jah
Said, I need you now
Only you can solve this problem (But still)
Live it up, nah give it up (Gonna live it up)
Live it up, nah give it up (Gonna live it up)
Live it up, nah give it up (Nah give it up)
