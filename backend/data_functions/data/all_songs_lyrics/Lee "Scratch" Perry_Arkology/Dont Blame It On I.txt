Dont Blame It On I Lyrics
Don't you blame it on I
Don't you blame it on I and I
Don't you blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't you blame it on Rastafari

For, when a guy took a bank out there
They blame it on I and I now
For, when a wolf kill a guy out there
They blame it on Rastafari

Anything di heathen do
I and I a get the blame
Anything di heathen do
I and I a get the blame (Yeah-yeah, wo-ho)

Don't you blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't you blame it on I and I (Yeah)
Don't you blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't you blame it on Rastafari (Wo-ho; uh)

Don't you blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't you blame it on I and I (No!)
Don't you blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't you blame it on Rastafari
For, if a guy took a bank out there
They blame it on I and I now
And when a wolf kill a guy out there
They blame it on Rastafari

Don't you blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't blame it on I and I (No)
Don't blame it on I (I tell you)
Don't you blame it on Rastafari
Don't blame it on I
Don't you blame it on I and I
Don't blame it on I
Don't you blame it on Rastafari

Everything they do, I get the blame, I got the blame
Over what they do, over what they doEmbed
