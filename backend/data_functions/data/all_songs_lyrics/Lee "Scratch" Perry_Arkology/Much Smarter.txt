Much Smarter Lyrics
Evil men of the past
You think that you're smart
But I will gut you off, man

You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I
You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I

Do you outgrown I?
And get thing call "experience"?
You get all the praise
While they say that I'm disobedient

You discriminate I
And call I a clown
Yet you never know
Your old philosophy would fall to the ground

You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I
You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I
Because I grow children now
You thought I would not go
But I open my eyes so widе now
And teach me prophetical

Was you who madе or lost?
And yet you 
A little did you know that Jah children
Would conquer

You discriminate I
And call I a clown
Yet you never know
Your old philosophy would fall to the ground

You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I
You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I

What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
You thought you could go on, in your funny ways
Because man dwelling is your aim
You thought your sister would loss (Oh)

You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I (What did you really think so?)
You think that you're much more smarter
Smarter than I (Can't you see, god open my eyes)
And teach me the truth, yeah
Let me see the truth now

Make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?
What make you think so, think so?Embed
