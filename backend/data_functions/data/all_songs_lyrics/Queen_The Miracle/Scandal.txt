Scandal Lyrics
Scandal
Now you've left me
All the world's gonna know
Hey, scandal
They're gonna turn our lives
Into a freak show

They'll see the heartache
They'll see the love break
They'll hear me pleading
We'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over again

Scandal
Now you've left me
There's no healing the wounds
Hey, scandal
And all the world
Can make us out to be fools

Here come the bad news
Open the flood gates
They'll leave us bleeding
We say "you cheapskates!"
Over and over and over again
So let them know when they stare
It's just a private affair
They'll have us hung in the air
And tell me what do they care

It's only a life to be
Twisted and broken
They'll see the heartache
They'll see our love break, yeah
They'll hear me pleading
I'll say for God sakes
Over and over and over
And over again, yeah


(Scandal) (Scandal)
(Scandal) (Scandal)
Yes, you're breaking my heart again
(Scandal) Yes, you're loving
On out again

Today: the headlines
Tomorrow: hard times
And no-one ever really knows
The truth from the lies
And in the end, the story
Deeper must hide
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside
(Scandal) (Scandal)
