Rain Must Fall Lyrics
I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Honey

Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life
A little rain must fall

No problem, uh
Be cool, now

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
Honey
You found success and recognition
But into every life
A little rain must fall


You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life
A little rain must fall

Be cool
Ha!
Kiss, kiss

Others seem to think
You are over dramatizing
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions, honey

You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cause into every life
A little rain must fall
Be cool, get this
Woo! Alright

Play it nice and cool
Play it nice and cool, yeah
Yes, baby
Ooh, one more time
Uh-huh, I like it
Make it rain5Embed
