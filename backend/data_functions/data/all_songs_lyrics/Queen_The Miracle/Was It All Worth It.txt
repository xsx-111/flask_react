Was It All Worth It Lyrics

What is there left for me
To do in this life?
Did I achieve what I had
Set in my sights?
Am I a happy man
Or is this sinking sand?
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?
Yeah, now hear my story
Let me tell you about it

We bought a drum kit
I blew my own trumpet
Played the circuit
Thought we were perfect

Was it all worth it?
Ooh, giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
A godforsaken life
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it all these years?
Put down our money
Without counting the cost
It didn't matter if we won
If we lost
Yes, we were vicious
Yes, we could kill
Yes, we were hungry
Yes, we were brill


We served a purpose
Like a bloody circus
We were so dandy
We love you madly

Was it all worth it?
Living breathing rock 'n' roll
This godforsaken life
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?
When the hurly burly's done


We went to Bali
Saw God and Dali
So mystic, surrealistic

Was it all worth it? Yeah, yeah!
Giving all my heart and soul
And staying up all night
Was it all worth it?
Ooh, living breathing rock 'n' roll
This never ending fight
Was it all worth it?
Was it all worth it?

Yes, it was a worthwhile experience, hahahaha!
It was worth it!3Embed
