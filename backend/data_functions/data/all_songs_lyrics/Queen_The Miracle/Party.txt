Party Lyrics
We had a good night jamming away
There was a full moon showing
And we started to play
But in the cold light of day next morning
The party was over, uh uh
The party was over
We got love and we got style
And we got sex and I know
I know we got what it takes
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa!
Why don't you come back and play?

Come back and play (hey hey)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come back and play
Come back and play
Come back and play, come back and play
Play, play it, play it
Go get 'em boy, let's party
Yeah

Give it give it
We had a food fight in somebody's face
We were up all night singing (singing)
And giving a chase
But in the cold light of day next morning
Everybody was hung over

Hey, come back and play
(Come back and play)
Come back and play
We got all night, all day
Everybody's gone away
Why don't you come
Back and play (and play)
Come back and play
We got all night we got all day
We got all night and day
Come back, come back, come back
Come back, back and play!

Hey, hey, hey
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
The party is over7Embed
