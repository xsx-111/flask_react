My Baby Does Me Lyrics
Turn it up a bit, please

My baby, baby does
My baby does me good
My baby does
My baby does me
My baby does me good

My lady understands
Understands me right
She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right

My baby cares, she really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat
My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me
That she cares
Another day she tells me
She don't love me
She really, really does me, ooh
Now people do you believe this?
Do you? Ooh, ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Uh, she really, really
Really, really, really, really
Ah, does me, hey1Embed
