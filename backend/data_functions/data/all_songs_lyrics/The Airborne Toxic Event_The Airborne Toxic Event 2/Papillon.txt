Papillon LyricsAll dressed up no place to run
No car, no girl, no pills, no fun
Nothing to do in this empty room
I gotta get my head together soon
Alone again, no plans, no friends
You come around at half past ten
You say, "how are you holdin' up, my friend?
Are you sittin' around getting drunk again?"
And I hear the desperation of those lines
Wasted hours, all this wasted time
Oh, yeah, I've been just fine!
Then we're out the door in an hour more
We stumble down from the second floor
And we're swaying, braying
We don't know what we're saying
And you grab my shirt, your way so curt
I swear to God that this doesn't hurt
When you stare like that, you put on that act
You say somethin', and then you take it back
And I feel as though I've done something wrong
Oh, how I miss you when you're gone
And I wish I had the guts to scream
You know, things aren't always what they seem
When you walk away, I want to stay
Don't leave me here to pace and pray
All these nights I burned
Hours I turned, you'd think that by now I'd learn
That you're only what you pretend to be
I guess that was just lost on me
I can't stand the way you look at me in that dress
Oh, Papillon, I might be alright, I guess
If I wasn't such a mess!
I'm such a mess
I'm such a mess!
I'm such a mess
I'm such a mess!Embed
