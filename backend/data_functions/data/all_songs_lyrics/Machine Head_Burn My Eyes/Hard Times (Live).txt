Hard Times (Live) Lyrics
Hard times are coming your way
You're gonna have to rise above it some day
Organize your life and figure it out
Or you'll go down without a doubt

Hard times! Hard times!
Seems I'm being forced into a mold
Hard times! Hard times!
Forcing me and I'm growing cold

Hard times are coming through
But if you're hard they won't get to you
They're gonna try to drive you into the ground
But never surrender, never go down!

Cro-Mag!
Skinhead!
Breakout!
Now!Embed
