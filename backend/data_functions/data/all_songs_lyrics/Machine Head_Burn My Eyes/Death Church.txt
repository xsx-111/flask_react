Death Church Lyrics
"Is it a conspiracy that the music is telling the youth to rise up against the establishment because the establishment is rapidly destroying things? Is that a conspiracy? The music speaks to you every day, but you are too deaf, dumb, and blind to even listen to the music. . . It is not my conspiracy. It is not my music. I hear what it relates. It says "Rise," it says "Kill." Why blame it on me? I didn't write the music. . . ."

Well, I look at justice in a different light
I been to jail, it didn't make me right
Try and conform, but won't be deaf, blind, dumb
Been beaten down, just harder I've become

Death, death church rising
Hate, hate church rising
Lost, lost church rising
Death, death church rising

Hey Jesus, can you help me with my pain?
Mainline me some religion, keep me sane
Christ suffering upon my TV screen
Send in your money to the faith obscene

Death, death church rising
Hate, hate church rising
Lost, lost church rising
Death, death church rising


Strength, truth and honor, words I strive to live
Your faith's profane, it takes, never gives
'Cause I'm gonna die standing upon my feet
You're gonna die groveling on your knees

Death, death church rising
Hate, hate church rising
Lost, lost church rising
Death, death church risingEmbed
