Old Lyrics
1994
Corruption, racism, hate
The church has failed
If Jesus came down
He'd be shot

I am the man that defends all things profane
6,000 years is the time that I shall reign
And with a grin, drank the blood of holy swine
Impurity made the blood turn into wine

Old man
Dead hand
If only in their insanity
The lie feeds off their greed
Jesus wept

I am the pain that feeds off your weaknesses
A sickening born of hate, not of the blessed
And with that time, I will crush all things you prey
Destroying all from the known to the arcane
Old man
Dead hand
If only in their insanity
The lie feeds off their greed
Jesus wept

Burn my eyes and try to blind me
Bury me so they won't find me
Try to suck my power empty
Got no crown of thorns on me
So burn my eyes and try to blind me
Bury me so they won't find me
Try to suck my power empty
You got no crown of thorns on me
So burn my eyes and try to blind
Bury me so they won't find
Try to suck my power dry
You got no crown of thorns on me!
Me!

Old man
Dead hand
If only in their insanity
The lie feeds off their greed
Jesus weptEmbed
