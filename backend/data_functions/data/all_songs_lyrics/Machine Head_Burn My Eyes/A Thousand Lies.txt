A Thousand Lies Lyrics
Go!

Get up!

What is a man that stays true to the game
But has to cheat a little to get by?
Well, that's a person that I know too well
Don't want to know, but I don't have to ask why
Everyone like a loaded gun
You want some shit? I'll fucking pound you, son
Don't need a reason, pain I'm feeling
I gotta vent, or else I blow inside

Introspection, termination
Can't tell right from wrong
Fed up with this whole system
It's gone on far too long

You tell a thousand lies, been told a thousand times
Your words we hear, but we cannot sympathize
Thousand lies, been told a thousand times
Hard as nails, the power to survive
Get up!

What is a man that stays true to the game
But can't believe some of the things he sees?
Anger's a gift and I won't be kept down
In poverty, there is no democracy
Used needle and a crack vial
A broken bottle and a bullet shell
This urban life is so volatile
An inner city or a concrete hell

Introspection, termination
Can't tell right from wrong
Fed up with this whole system
It's gone on far too long

You tell a thousand lies, been told a thousand times
Your words we hear, but we cannot sympathize
Thousand lies, been told a thousand times
Hard as nails, the power to survive
Go!

So pick it up, pick it up, pick it up! Get up!

What is a man, don't stay true to the game
Don't care for no one, only cares for his greed?
He's playing God, killing thousands of people
'Cause the power is the fix that he needs
Racist goal of the white devil
I watched our souls burning over oil
A politician got no feeling
It makes my motherfucking cold blood boil

Introspection, termination
Can't tell right from wrong
Fed up with this whole system
It's gone on far too long

You tell a thousand lies, been told a thousand times
Your words we hear, but we cannot sympathize
Thousand lies, been told a thousand times
Hard as nails, the power to survive
Slow
Slow
