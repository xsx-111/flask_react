Blood for Blood Lyrics
One, two, three, four, go!

I bite the hand 'cause this hand feeds off me
Devoid of emotion, it lives to cheat
Ignorance is bliss, and respect I gave you
Friend you did claim this, too bad you can't speak the truth

(Give respect!)
'Cause the rule is
(Blood for blood!)

Beatings are what you'll inherit this time
Fist bait, your new name, your pain is my shrine
Pulverize and break, determination
Pleasure I negate, your pain brings me salvation

(Give respect!)
'Cause the rule is
(Blood for blood!)

I was born of tension
Anger came from frustration
I can't back down from aggression
Some hard knocks taught me this lesson


(Give respect!)
'Cause the rule is
(Blood for blood!)
(Give respect!)
'Cause the rule is
(Blood for blood!)Embed
