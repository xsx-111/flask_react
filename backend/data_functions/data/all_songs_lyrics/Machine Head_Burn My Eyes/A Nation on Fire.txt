A Nation on Fire Lyrics
Well, I see, I feel, on my way
You close your eyes, scared to think what you might see
A world that spends more to kill than to cure
Living, writhing, diseased, so unpure

It hardens me, the things I see
But I won't break, it gives me strength
That's right!

Our suffering, won't always be!
We'll dominate, this nation on fire!

The media, it blinds our eyes
A people, divided and force fed lies
The black and white societies corrode
Warring, hating, blind, a rage explodes

So take my hand, across this land
I won't go down, stand my ground
Yeah, that's right!
Our suffering, won't always be!
We'll dominate, this nation on fire!
Go!

This nation's built on fighting war after war
And for my brothers, I will fight and stand for
'Cause I won't break, your truth is fake
If blood ran red, you'd leave me for dead

A nation on fire!
A nation on fire!

You tell me peace, well, I hear gunshots all night
The scars I have, I've earned, 'cause I've had to fight
An endless pain, and it won't change
We just sat by and watched this world die

A nation on fire!
A nation on fire!Embed
