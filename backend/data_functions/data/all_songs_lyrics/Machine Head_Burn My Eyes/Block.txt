Block Lyrics
Block!
Block!
Block!

Hate breeds hate, my eyes they have seen
The decimation of all that is pure, pure
A system that feeds their machine with
The blood, sweat and money of the poor, poor
Corruption gets rich, honesty just exists
'Cause nobody cares anymore, anymore

Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!

Block!
Block!
Block!

White attack black, black attack back
The fucking media keeps us all blind, blind
Children on crack, junkies on smack
You wanna close your eyes to hide, hide
Pollution so dense, sickening existence
New world order, new world decline, decline
Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!

The more intense the sense of ignorance
The more intense then is the pain
The more intense the sense of ignorance
The more intense then is the pain
The more intense the sense of ignorance
The more intense then is the pain

Block!
Block!
Block!

Hate breeds hate, my eyes they have seen
The decimation of all that is pure, pure
A system that feeds their machine with
The blood, sweat and money of the poor, poor
Believe in something if it stops your suffering
'Cause all we have is nothing, nothing

Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!
The more intense the sense of ignorance
The more intense then is the pain
The more intense the sense of ignorance
The more intense then is the pain

Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!
Fuck it all!Embed
