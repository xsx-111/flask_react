Body Shop Lyrics
With all these curves we might need to have the brakes looked at
So pop the hood and see what's good, I need a tune-up bad
My pressure's low, I'm on a roll but my transmission's blown
I heard a thump and then a knock

I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

You can polish the headlights
You can smooth out the fender
You can start the ignition
We can go on a bender

Stuck to the seat, our body heat, what will you do with all this ass?
Let's shift a gears, get outta here, we're stepping on the gas
We gotta bounce, we're going fast, let's let the seat go back
You take the wheel, I'll sit on top
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop

You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

Overheating the engine
Might be blowing a gasket
Tighten up the suspension
And you don't have to ask it

I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop
I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop

I would drive to the ends of the earth for you
Jumpstart my heart, you know what you gotta do
I would ride through the dark of the night with you
Cross my heart and hope to die, it's true
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line
You can keep it overnight
You can do whatever you like
Working overtime
Working on my line

I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop
I, I, I, I hear you work at a body shop
I hear you work at a body shop8Embed
