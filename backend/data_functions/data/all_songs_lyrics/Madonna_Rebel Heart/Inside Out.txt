Inside Out Lyrics
Pull me closer
Full disclosure
Let it out, let me in, yeah
On your knees, confess to me
Every doubt, every sin, yeah
That's how love's supposed to be

I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out (One more time)

Let's discover
One another
Kiss me here, touch me there, yeah
Purest form of ecstasy
Truth or dare, don't be scared, yeah
Let me solve your mystery
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out

Let me love you, let me love you from (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah
Let me love you, let me love you from (One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah

Let's cross the line so far we won't come back
Can't read your mind, I shouldn't have to ask
Cynical smile, time to take off your mask
I'm on your side, so let me love you, let me love you
(Let me love you from the inside out)
(I wanna love you from the inside out)
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out
I wanna know what you're all about
You're beautiful when you're broken down
Let your walls crumble to the ground
Let me love you from the inside out
Every scar that you try to hide
All the dark corners of your mind
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Let me love you from the inside out

Let me love you, let me love you from
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah (One more time)
Let me love you, let me love you from
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah (One more time)
Let me love you, let me love you from
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah (One more time)
Let me love you, let me love you from
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah (One more time)
(One more time)
Let me love you from the inside out, yeah4Embed
