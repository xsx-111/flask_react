The Trouble with Candyhands LyricsI allow you one phone call
I allow you one phone call
I can tell, I can tell
I can tell bad boy
I can tell, I can tell
I can tell bad boy
Then you bring me flowers
Then you bring me flowers
Then you bring me flowers
Then you bring me flowers
I can tell, I can tell
I can tell bad boy
I can tell, I can tell
I can tell bad boy
I allow you one phone call
I allow you one phone call
Then you bring me flowers
Then you bring me flowers
Then you bring me flowers
Then you bring me flowers
I can tell, I can tell
I can tell bad boyEmbed
