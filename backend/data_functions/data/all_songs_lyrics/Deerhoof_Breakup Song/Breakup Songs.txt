Breakup Songs LyricsWhen you say it's all over
When you say it's all over
Hell ya, hell ya, hell ya
Hell ya ya ya
Anyway (x8)
When you say it's all over
When you say it's all over
Hell ya, hell ya, hell ya
Hell ya ya ya
When you say it's all over
When you say it's all over
Hell ya, hell ya, hell ya
Hell ya ya yaEmbed
