Do U Lie? Lyrics
(Les enfants qui mentent ne vont pas au paradis)
(Ok) Ok, Merci

When I lie awake in my boudoir I think of you dear
Do you think of me, or do you lie, do you lie?
When I'm in a sad and lonely mood dear, I cry for you dear (I cry for you)
Do you cry for me, do you cry, do you cry?
When I need someone to talk to, you're not around
When I need another human's touch, I wear a frown
Because you're uptown
Going down, going down, going down
I, I, I don't lie to you (I don't lie)
When I say that I'm in love mama (mama, mama)
I feel so good when you're near (mama, mama)
Tell me do you feel it too
Do you lie, do you lie? (or do you cry)
Do you cry from the inside out dear
Or are they only artificial tears? (artificial tears)
Do you really mean it when you cry
When you cry, when you cry?
When I need someone to talk to, (do you lie)
You're not around (You're not around)
You're not around (I wear a frown)
When I need (tell me why)
Another human's touch
I wear a frown (tell me why you want to go)
Because you're uptown (and leave me all alone)
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down
Going down

When I lie awake in my boudoir (I think of you)
I think of you dear (do you)
Do you all think of me
Or do you lie, do you lie?Embed
