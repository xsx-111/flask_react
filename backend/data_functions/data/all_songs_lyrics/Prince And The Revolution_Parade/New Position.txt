New Position Lyrics
Honey, we've been together
Honey, for too long
Honey, we've got to make it better
Honey, before we go wrong
Got to try a new position, yeah
Something that'll make it all right
New position, yeah
Let's go fishing in the river, the river of life

Honey, we can't last
We can't last
Without a shot of new spunk
Ha!
Honey, forget your past
Forget your past
You've got to try my new funk
You've got to try a new position, yeah
Something that'll make it all right
Oh, a new position, yeah, yeah
Let's go fishing in the river
The river of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Oh, let me do you, come on let me do you, do you
Come on, let me do you
I want, I want to do you, do you
I can make you happy
I can make you H.A.P.P.Y
I can make it real good
So good
Honey, I won't be your papi
P.U.S.S.Y
But I'll do you, I'll do you, do you, do you, like a
Do you, do you like a good man should
I'll do you, do you like a good man should
Honey, let's try a new positionEmbed
