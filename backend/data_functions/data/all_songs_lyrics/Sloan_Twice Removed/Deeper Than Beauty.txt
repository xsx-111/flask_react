Deeper Than Beauty LyricsI suppose I've seen you three times now
And I guess that I'm wondering how
You keep the boys at bay
I have a feeling that they are wondering too
I've seen you with your hair down at least 5 times
I've always wondered what make man commit crimes
But even I would sometimes
If it weren't for the likes of you
And your glasses your hideous glasses
When you remove them I'd rather skip my classes and be caught
Then to entertain the thought
That someday you'll just put them on again
But I can make the best of it until then
Still I know you go deeper than your beauty
You go well above and beyond
The call of duty to your country and your school
But I grew up too cool
Like the rest of us with our thumbs up our asses
If you call I will come
But I'm about as quick as molasses
When I dream of you you're not wearing your glassesEmbed
