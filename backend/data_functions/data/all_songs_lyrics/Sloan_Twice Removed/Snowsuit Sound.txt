Snowsuit Sound LyricsPushed off of the silver swings
I got my braces full of sand
When all I ever wanted to do
Was hold on to your hand
Lost you once
I never had a second chance
Would you have changed your mind
With a second glance?
I think I'll take you down now
And take you down from that shelf
Let you be and set you free
Instead of keeping you for myself
Guess you'll always be the same
And it might be just as well
Let you think and fill your sink
You've already smashed that shell
You're the sizzle teen
And you're older than me
I'm just walkin' around
I make that snowsuit sound
It's not up to me now, la la
Pushed off of the silver swings
I got my braces full of sand
Never got to tell you
That I was your greatest fan
You're the sizzle teen
And you're older than me
I'm just walkin' around
I make that snowsuit sound
It's not up to me now, la la
You're the sizzle teen
And you're older than me
I'm just walkin' around
I make that snowsuit sound
It's not up to me now, la la
You're the sizzle teen
And you're older than me
I'm just walkin' aroundEmbed
