Before I Do LyricsThere's no more fame to address
Did you impress?
In all fairness, yes
So just cancel my game
If it's all the same to you
I've had clear thoughts
Tied in black and blue knots
But you remember that I forgot
To track them down
To track you down
Track me down
Call me if you need my help
To watch you - help me, help you
I've tried it all before
(I've had a good time)
And it's not a lot of laughs
(My best one yet)
And there's a hole in my heart
You carried your vice twice
Like a basket full of roses
And the pearly gate now closes
With you inside
How should I drink to this?
My train's been stalled for ages
And this means me standing still
With a first class ticket
So stick me with it
I'll stick with it
Just call me if you need my help
To watch you - help me, help you
I'm usually in mourning
(I've had a good time)
In the afternoon and night
(My best one yet)
Otherwise I'm asleep
(I never had enough time)
At least I've got a lot of room
And the alarm is set for noon
(To play you my "love you" set)
And it's gonna go off
Before I do
(I've had a good time)
(Speaking during instrumental)
So he was in this, this hospital
Checkin' out the phone he misunderstood
And I was speakin' firmly, very talkatively at the time
And he was walking around with a dress on
Totally dressed with, with his arm down
And he said, I dunno what I'm doing here
I'm a business man
He didn't come and tell me
They totally misunderstood me you know
This is a whole, whole mistake here
This is a whole fuckin' mistake
But I can't explain it and they don't wanna listen to me
You know, you know this
No they didn't, they didn't listen to me
You can't help it
I couldn't explain it, but business is business
And then there's fuckin' this other time
This fuckin' town, they didn't wanna let me out
They didn't wanna let me telephone you directly
These bastards
These bastards stuck me in here and I wanted to talk to my lawyer
Now I'm totally pissed, man
You're the first guy I've met since I, since I got here
Now what, what should I do?
Look, maybe you can help me out here
Maybe you can get me out of here
The hell with the girl
I don't care who you are
I run 10 kilometres a day
And they put me down for a nice, nice long stay
Anyway now I'm here for a while now
You know, I'll just have a good timeEmbed
