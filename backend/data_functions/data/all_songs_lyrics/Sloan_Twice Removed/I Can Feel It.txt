I Can Feel It LyricsShe came running
I hate everything that came before me
Crushed
I'm breaking under the crush
Don't ignore me
Cause you know I can always make it louder
Three
Three's nothing out of ten
But you've got a thing for me
I can feel it, I can feel it
And I've got a thing for you too
You can have it
You can have it
I've been running
Just to get away from what's inside me
Rush
I'm drowning under the rush
Happy Birthday
To the best brother in the world
Hurray
At least I'm still cool to one girl
But you've got a thing for me
I can feel it, I can feel it
And I've got a thing for you too
You can have it
You can have it
You've got a thing for me
I can feel it, I can feel it
And I've got a thing for you too
You can have it
No strings attached
No copy to match
No drift to catch
No plans to hatch
No itch to scratch
Just infatuation is all you need
You could tell a million lies
And I'd think they all were true
Trust
That's my trust in you
It's what I value
And it's what I refuse to lose
You've got a thing for me and I've got a thing for you tooEmbed
