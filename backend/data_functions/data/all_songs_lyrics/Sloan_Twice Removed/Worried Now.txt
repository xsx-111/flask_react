Worried Now Lyrics
I think I've lost my sense of humour
'Cause I can't seem to get a laugh
I keep forgetting all the punch lines
And I can't make them up that fast

Remember the time when you told me not to worry?
I'm worried now
Remember the time when you told me not to worry?
I'm worried now

I think I'm losing all my patience
And I know I'm too quick to judge
I don't give up all that easily, usually
But I'm too relieved to hold a grudge

Remember the time when you told me not to worry?
I'm worried now
Remember the time when you told me not to worry?
I'm worried now

You told me not to care
You told me not to care
So I don't care
Any time that you told me
Told me not to worry, I'm worried now
And any time that you told me
Told me not to worry, I'm worried now, worried now
Remember the time when you told me not to worry?
I'm worried now
And any time that you told me
Told me not to worry
I'm worried nowEmbed
