Loosens LyricsSomehow it grew
Cut me in two
To tell you the truth
I don't know what I'm doing
So this is it
From where you sit
I should be going
Put it back
Into the same place
Where you found it
When you came in
Put me back
Into the same shape
How you found me
Before you broke me
Somehow I knew
You'd tell me soon
To tell you the truth
I thought you'd tell me sooner
Frozen where I stand
Take you by the hand
Your grip just loosens
Put it back
Into the same place
Where you found it
When you came in
Put me back
Into the same shape
How you found me
Before you broke me
This hasn't happened
For the first time
And I know it won't be
For the last time
Somehow I knew
You'd tell me soon
To tell you the truth
I thought you'd tell me sooner
Frozen where I stand
Take you by the hand
Your grip just loosensEmbed
