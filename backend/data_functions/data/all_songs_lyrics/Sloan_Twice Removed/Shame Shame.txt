Shame Shame LyricsShame shame
Because you didn't say your girlfriends name
For sure
I'll say it next time for sure
She has got the saddest handle that I know
No one even holds a candle
Who would blow out her flame
I'm over come with shame
Shame shame
Because you didn't read all of dames dames
You knew
You knew the damage it would do
She is just the brightest candle that I know
Hope her holder has a handle on her though
But keep your head I can't accept your head
I would love to, I would love to
But I'm overcome with shame
Shame shame
Because you couldn't say your girlfriend's name
You knew
Tou knew that problems would ensue
I wrote your name for all to see
I wrote your name for all to see
I would love you, I would love you
But I'm overcome with shame
I never read all of dames dames
I can't identify the change
But something isn't quite the same
And then I couldn't say your nameEmbed
