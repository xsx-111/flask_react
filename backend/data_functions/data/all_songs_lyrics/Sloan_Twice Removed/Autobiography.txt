Autobiography LyricsI'm writing 'young and gifted' in my autobiography
I figure who would know better than me?
I'm certainly the former
But I'm not so much the latter
But no-one's gonna read it
So I'm sure it doesn't matter
When you find that you're the former
Take pride in how you form
And when you find that you're the latter
Don't let those people walk under you
I'm writing 'sharp and adult' with my finger on the steam
On the mirror in my bathroom
And I'm applying shaving cream
Which could suggest that I'm the foamer
But how can I be the lather?
And something tells me it's the opposite I'd rather
When you find that you're the foamer
Be careful what you foam
And when you find that you're the lather
Don't shave too high, you'll regret it later
La la la la la
La la la la la la
La laaa laaaa la la la
La la la la
I stayed in school this long but still no-one will tell me why
They figured 'who would know better than I?'
I know I'm a conformer, but I'm sure it doesn't matter
My new friends are all adults
And my old friends all have scattered
When you find that you're a conformer
Take pride and swallow whole
But if you're trying to climb the ladder
Don't let people walk over you
Because that's just what they'll do
And don't let people walk over you
Because that's just what they'll doEmbed
