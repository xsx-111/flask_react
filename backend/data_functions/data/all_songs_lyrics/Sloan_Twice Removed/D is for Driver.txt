D is for Driver Lyrics
Handsome girl and pretty boy
I'm thinkin' of your love, I can see it as it passes by
Heads inside your helmets, hearts inside my head
Hold on tightly to her shoulders

As she drives around
As she drives
Drives around

He's so sweet and she's so cool
All his toys are in the plastic
Except her, she's not when she's out ridin' around
Pathetic and content

Handsome girl and pretty boy
I'm thinkin' of your love
I can see it then as it passes by
Heads inside your helmets, and your hearts inside my head
Hold on tightly to her shoulders

As she drives around
As she drives around
As she drives around
As she drivesEmbed
