I Hate My Generation LyricsWhat could you both possibly share
-other than the color of your hair
Sean said, we both play guitar
-never even have to say a word
That's the best thing that I ever heard
-you have left a finger print on me
Just dust and then you'll surely see
I've got my reservations
And I hate my generation
If I was born in the forties
I'd be a teen in the fifties
And maybe I watch too much TV
Maybe, maybe it's my fault
I should take it with a grain of salt
I've got my hesitations
Spit on your generations
S-E-A-N S-A-I-D
P-L-A-Y yeah yeah yeah yeah
S-E-A-N S-A-I-D
P-L-A-Y yeah yeah yeah yeah
Maybe, maybe it's my fault
I should take it with a grain of salt
What could you both possibly share
-other than the color of your hair
Sean said, 'we both play guitar!'
-never even have to say a word
That's the best thing that I ever heard
I have got my reservations
As I skate by my generation
