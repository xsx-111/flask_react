Penpals LyricsI write you from a far country
North of Africa
It is Algeria
And my city is Oran
I know you'll find this letter strange
That is because I am strange
My first name is Amal
And I'm a girl, I'm a girl, la la la
My first name is Amal
And I'm a girl, I'm a girl, la la la
My first name is Amal and I'm a girl
I am a Norwegian boy
Which have some question
I am only 13 years
And I am crazy of you
Can I have a souvenir?
And if you can, a wick of hair?
Send me documents
And a photo of you alone
Here's my photo d√©dicace
One of you would be canon
I worship all your handsome words
To me you seem giant
You're so cool but you know that
I hope your letters never stop
You are surely special
I like you, I like you, la la la
You are surely special
I like you, I like you, la la la
You are surely special
I like you, I like you, I like you
You are surely special
I like youEmbed
