Dreamer LyricsIve got a dollar deal
Hidden down in my shoe
So listen friends
I tell you what I'm gonna do
Im gonna run up the road of mystery
Hangin' by a thread to a fantasy
A background black showing my face
Buried in the image of an empty space
I'm back on my feet, getting no sleep
Makin' it all mine
Give me a chance to follow the bands
Waitin' for the sunshine, yeah
Husslin' my will in a bar downtown
And if it don't work out now
Ill keep movin' around and around
Around and around
Till I'm back on my feet, getting no sleep
Makin' it all mine
Give me a chance to follow the bands
Im waitin' for the sunshine, yeah
A dreamer, a dreamer
Hangin' around
A dreamer, a dreamer
Trying to hitch a ride
A dreamer, a dreamer
Hangin' around
A dreamer, a dreamer
When I turn my back, you're by my side
Well, I fought my way
Through the back stage door
Staring at my goal
Till my eyes get sore
And working my way through the little I say
Caring no less just the light of the day
A background black showing my face
Buried in the image of an empty space
I'm back on my feet, getting no sleep
Makin' it all mine
Give me a chance to follow the bands
Im waitin' for the sunshine, yeah
Just a dreamer, dreamer
Hangin' around
A dreamer, a dreamer
Trying to hitch a ride
A dreamer, a dreamer
Hangin' around
A dreamer, a dreamer
When I turn my back, you're by my side, yeah
A dreamer, a dreamer
Hangin' around
A dreamer, a dreamer
Trying to hitch a ride
Dreamer, dreamer
Hangin' around
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
Dreamer, dreamer
