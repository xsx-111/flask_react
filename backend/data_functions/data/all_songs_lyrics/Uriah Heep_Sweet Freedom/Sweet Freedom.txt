Sweet Freedom LyricsSWEET FREEDOM
As you look around you do you like what you see?
Though it sometimes makes you lonely, do you like being free?
And are you sure you'll be OK without my company?
I just want you to be happy even if it's not with me
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet
Will the line between all this and my love ever meet?
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet
What I'm really trying to say is that I will be around
Should you find that after all you can't get by with what you've found
Oh, it wasn't just my heart you took and tossed into the sea
Though it's hard to find the words I need--
I guess it was me
I guess it was me
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet
Will the line between all this and my love ever meet?
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet
Will the line between all this and my love ever gonna meet?
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet freedom, sweet, sweet, sweet. (fade out)Embed
