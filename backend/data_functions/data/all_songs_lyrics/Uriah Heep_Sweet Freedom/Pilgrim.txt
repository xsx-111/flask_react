Pilgrim LyricsA pilgrim at the gray of dawn
Leaving in the mist of morning
On his journey of goodness
Heaven sent, God blessed
Pilgrim laughing at the world
Spreading joy at the touch of his hand
Wiping out all the misery
Making love and history
Those of us who don't know war
We shouldn't try to make it
'Cause so many did and even more died
Do you think you could take it?
'Cause love lies waiting at our back door
Such a beautiful matter of fact
Life's like an apple with love as the core
And I'll tell you 'bout that
Just a man in my prime
Love was there but I had no time
I was cheered and adored
And I thought fame was all the world
Battles won and victory cheers
Were the sounds I'd heard for years
But the woman I really loved
Was losing me to all this blood
I only knew I had to win
And build a world where I was king
But leaders come and leaders go
And that's the truth I came to know
Love or war I could not choose
And so both I had to lose1Embed
