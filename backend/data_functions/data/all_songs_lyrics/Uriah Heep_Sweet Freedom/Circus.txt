Circus LyricsWalkin' around this concrete garden
Viewing all in vain
Thinking why a dream
Is driving everyone insane
Then something will come
And make you feel the master in control
Still you're picking up and screwing
Anyone who's got a soul
I've been here far too long to remember
Sights and sounds from this town of clowns
Makin' up, dressin' up walkin' around
Thinkin' that you're Greta Garbo
I'm sorry my dears but we only sat down
And laughed and laughed in sorrow
But it was you that opened the door
And it's that we thank you for
Walkin' around this concrete garden
Viewing all in vain
Thinking why a dream
Is driving everyone insane
Everyone insane
Everyone insane
Everyone's insaneEmbed
