If I Had the Time LyricsIf I had the time
To re-live my life
I don't think I'd care
To change a thing
As long as I find
Just a little peace of mind
I can dream and laugh and sing
I can have my fun
With the silver stars
I can watch the sun
Fall in the sea
And if it rains
I will smile just the same
For the rain will make the flowers sing
I know how it is to feel sad
I know how it is when things go bad
But I'm sure that I have found the way
I'm happy here and here I'll stay whoa
Here I'll stay
If I had the time
To re-live my life
I don't think I'd care
To change a thing
As long as I find
Just a little peace of mind
I can dream and laugh and I can singEmbed
