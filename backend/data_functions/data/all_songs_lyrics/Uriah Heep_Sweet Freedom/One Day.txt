One Day LyricsOne day, one day
One day, one day
One day, one day
Didn't I tell ya
Everything was gonna be alright
I never doubted
It was just a matter of time
And though I've traveled
Across the desert of despair
I know I'll get there, yeah
One day
How times have changed
I've been a-rea-rearranging everything
But it can't change the love I bring
When I get back home to you
I am the same
It's just a game that I chose to play
But remember I can lose as fast as I won
One day
I still remember the hole in the wall
(I still remember)
Where we all sat though you said we'd fall
The dusty yard and the broken down barn
(The dusty yard)
Where you and me used to share a yarn
But it's gone now
But didn't I tell ya
That everything was gonna be alright
I never doubted
It was just a matter of time
Though I've traveled
Across the desert of despair
I know I'll get there
One day, one day, yeah
Ill get there
One dayEmbed
