Over The Top LyricsShoot, shoot, shoot, hey
Don't be unkind
I'm out of my mind
And I'm telling you
It's not that I'm bad
I'm totally mad
I'm a loser, too
I'm certain
I must be a burden
Completely
Over the top, over the top
Don't know what it means
All I hear is screams
And I don't know whose
The nightmare's for real
I got a raw deal
It's all bad news
I swear it
I can't bear it
Completely
Over the top, over the top
You know it's no lie
My main alibi
It's a waste of time
You know it's the truth
The lyrics' the proof
But at least it rhymes
You can't harm me
'Cause I'm barmy
Completely
Over the top, over the topEmbed
