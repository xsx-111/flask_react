No End in Sight LyricsThe way I see it you must be blind
But can you spare a dime?
Can't you see your son is in too deep
Burning in the final sleep
Wide awake for ninety nine hours
No sleep tonight
He'll be pushing up flowers
Second chance he'll never get
A special high for blazes, burn
Left behind
Left and right
No end in sight
No end in sight
Let behind
Left and right
No end in sight
No end in sight
Running frantic without a clue
In the sand looking straight at you
Nothing straight, the world goes around
No one's safe until they're deep in the ground
Shot in the back, stopped in your tracks
The shifting sands coming over us
A second chance he hasn't got
It all boils down and turned around
Left behind
Left and right
No end in sight
No end in sight
Left behind
Left and right
No end in sight
No end in sight
There's so many times I couldn't bear to watch
Witness the boredom of you thinking all soft
He left his mark, he left you blind
Chasing the dream, left sleep behind
Left behind
Left and Right
No end in sight
No end in sight
Left behind
Left and right
No end in sight
No end in sight
No end in sight
No end in sightEmbed
