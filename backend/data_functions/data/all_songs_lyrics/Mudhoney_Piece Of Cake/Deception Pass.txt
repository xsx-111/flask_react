Deception Pass LyricsWalking in the city
Can see no stars above
I don't need your pity
And I can feel your love
Wish I could
Wish I could
Searching for peace of mind
I took off for the woods
Lost in the forest
Can't find my way home
Can't feel your love
Lost and all alone
It's not so bad
It's not so bad
When your on top of
Deception Pass
Lost track
Of my path
On Deception Pass
Deception Pass
Don't know where I'm going
Can't recall where I've been
Lived a righteous life
And lived a life of sin
Don't know what I've done
Don't know what I've done
If I ever make it out of here
Get back to you
Lost track
Of my path
On Deception Pass
Deception Pass
Well, I seek love for guidance
I know it hurt my friend
Tried to sell my way out
But the Devil wasn't there
Seems my life
Ain't worth a dime
Well I may be lost
But for now all this is mine
Lost track
Of my path
On Deception PassEmbed
