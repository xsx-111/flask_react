Make It Now LyricsMake a hole
Make it wide
Make a hole
Make it wide
Make it now
Make it now
Make it now
Make it now
I'm so far from here
I'm so far from here
I'm so far from here
I'm so far from here right now
Make me whole
Make me right
Make me whole
Make me right
Make it now
Make it now
Make it now
Make it now
Behind these walls
Locked up tight
No more darkness
No room for light
Speak to me
I'm so far from here
I'm so far from here
I'm so far from here
I'm so far from here right nowEmbed
