Take Me There LyricsFeelin' so dull in the middle of action
Out on the prowl lookin' for a distraction
I found you out looking unaware
I knew if you could you'd take me there
C'mon - yeah - oh - take me there
Following you to provoke some reaction
Turning around face to face with satisfaction
Living so cold in a world of care
You know I'd love you to take me there
Today - oh - c'mon - take me there
Take me there
I can tell from the look on your face
You've been thrown around a better place
I can tell from the look in your eyes that things here just ain't right
I can tell from the smile on your lips it must have been one hell of a trip
Take it baby no I don't care
Take me now just take me there
Take me there take me there
Take me thereEmbed
