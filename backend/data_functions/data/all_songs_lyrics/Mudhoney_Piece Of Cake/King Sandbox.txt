King Sandbox LyricsAlways wanted more than he needs
Always wanted more than he can take
Always wanted more than he can handle
Always wanted another piece of cake
King Sandbox says more
King Sandbox wants more
He always gets more than he deserves
He always dresses to suit himself
He always takes so you can't have
He always wants more than anybody else
King Sandbox sees yours
King Sandbox wants yours
Oh
On top of his mountain
Mountain of gold
King of the hill
Has got to have it all
Now he owns the sandbox
And his playmates
Move in the cold
He's a spoiled child
Born to it all
King Sandbox wants more
King Sandbox wants yoursEmbed
