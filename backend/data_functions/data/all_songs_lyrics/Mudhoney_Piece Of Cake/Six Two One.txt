Six Two One LyricsThere's a lot of things that'll do you no good
As you waste away here on the couch
This side of you is doin' no one no good
No good
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
Now I'm not sayin' that I'm alright
And I'm not sayin' I can show you the light
Cuz I see darkness day and night
It's been six long years with the devil at my side, my side
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me in
Confusion reigns
Confusion is king
Confusion is the state you'll find me inEmbed
