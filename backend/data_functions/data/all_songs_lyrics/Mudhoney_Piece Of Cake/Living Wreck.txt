Living Wreck LyricsShoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
C'mon too cool and collected
Claiming how you're so well-connected
With the thousands you've infected
Who turn out to be just as wretched
This living wreck will come to crash again
Time is tight and I just might come back to what you are
Nasty things you're trying to hatch
Snakes and bugs make no kind of match
What the hell you trying to catch
Trading your friends for cold hard cash
This living wreck will come to crash again
Time is tight and I just might come back to what you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
Shoot for the stars
My, my how lucky you are
We got a date, you left your house
To step on up to a higher ground
Shoot for the stars 'cause she's been shown
Good God your ambition's gone
This living wreck has come to crash again
This living wreck has come to crash again
This living wreck has come to crash again
This living wreck has come to crash again
Time is tight and I just might come back to what you areEmbed
