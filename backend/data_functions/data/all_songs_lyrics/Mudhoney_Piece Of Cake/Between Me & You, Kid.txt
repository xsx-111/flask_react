Between Me & You, Kid LyricsWoke up this morning face down on the rug
I said a prayer of thanks to the Lord above
My pounding brain brings out another hard day
And when the sun goes down I go out and play
I did the mission for a long, long time
If I hurt no one, I committed no crime
Well righteous folks say my life is a sin
That can explain the shape I'm in
Now, as far as I can tell
The only thing between me and Hell
Yeah, as far as I can tell
The only thing between me and Hell
The only thing between me and Hell
Is the floor
Is the floor
Woke up this morning face down on the rug
I said a prayer of thanks to the Lord above
My pounding brain brings out another day
And when the sun goes down I go out and play
Seems as plain as the passing of time
Well if you hurt no one, you've done no crime
Well righteous folks claim I'm born in a sin
That kind of thinking shapes this mess I'm in
Listen kid, as far as I can tell
The only thing between me and Hell
The only thing between me and Hell
The only thing between me and Hell
The only thing between me and Hell
Is the floor
Is the floor
The only thing between me and Hell
Between me and Hell
Is the floor
The only thing between me and Hell
Between me and Hell
Is the floor
Is the floorEmbed
