Acetone Lyrics
Good morning dear, I think I'm losing it
Can't find my way and I'm, I'm getting used to it
Sun refused to shine on this side of the street
I'm not recognizing anyone I meet
Try to hide in the shadow of the sun
You're not fooling anyone

Oh, acetone, won't you ever leave me alone?
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetone

Look at me and answer truthful now
Did you drink that last spoonful down?
She drinks from the bitter cup
I'm trying to get her to give it up
Oh, lord, what have we become?
We're not fooling anyone

Oh, acetone, why can' she leave you alone?
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetone
My feet are dragging down on this dusty old road
My throat is dry and I'm all alone
I remember when we walked side by side
When I was parched I would drink in your sight
I never meant to make you run
I never meant to hurt anyone

Oh, acetone, why couldn't you leave us alone?
Oh, acetone
Oh, acetoneEmbed
