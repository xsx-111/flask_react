When in Rome Lyrics
(When it all burns down) What you gonna do?
(When it all burns down) Where you gonna go?
(When it all burns down) How far you gonna run?
When it all burns down

Never thought it'd get down to this
Never thought it'd get down to this

(Deep and sound asleep) And never saw the blaze
(Deep and sound asleep) Couldn't smell the smoke
(Deep and sound asleep) Didn't feel the flames
Deep and sound asleep

We were dreaming while the city burned
We were dreaming while the city burned

(Now it's all burned down) Who can you trust?
(Now it's all burned down) How come you're still alive?
(Now it's all burned down) Where can you sleep tonight?
Now it's all burned down
Got one bullet left
And your time's run out
Better take that last shot
Better make it countEmbed
