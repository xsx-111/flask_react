Let Me Let You Down LyricsLet me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Sittin' pretty like a snake in the grass
Got the world within my grasp
All coiled up, ready to strike
Give me a reason not to bite
It's your world, tryin hard to fit in
Think I would if I could only shed my skin
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Don't let'em tell you that your no fun
Don't let'em tell you that your too young
Don't be afraid now to come a little closer
I'll show you how it's made, I'll make you feel older
I'll give you knowledge beyond your days
Dirty dirty, wash me down with your sweet tears
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you down
Let me let you downEmbed
