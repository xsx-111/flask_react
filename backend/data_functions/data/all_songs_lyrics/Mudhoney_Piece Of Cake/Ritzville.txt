Ritzville LyricsWith my heart on on my sleeve and my head on the curb
Got a sign on my cell that reads do not disturb
Fell asleep in the blizzard sometime last night
Woke up alone freezing awake
Hey, hey mister chicken where have you been
Hunting for trophies mostly every day
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
Have you heard my girl, I mean the other day
Took a ride with the sheriff and a roll in the hay
In the cell stewin' over some bum wrap
They say off with my girl, along with that sap
They say the headless chickens are takin' over
They say I lost mine over a four leaf clover
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
They say you always return to the scene of your crime
Well I'm diggin' the scene but I'm not sure if its mine
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and die
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
Goin' back to Ritzville
Don't ask why
It's a good a place as any to go and die
It's a good a place as any to go and dieEmbed
