Thirteenth Floor Opening LyricsIf I try I could fly right through that window
If I try I could fly right through that window
Just can't find my way to the door
When I land I know I will not be injured
When I land I know I will not be injured
There's no way that I can hurt any more
Got an open mind
Up on the thirteenth floor
Got an open heart
Up on the thirteenth floor
Found an open window
Up on the thirteenth floor
Everything's wide open - oh
On the thirteenth floorEmbed
