Mexican Sun Lyrics
Soon the stares catch
We begin to kill the calm as we
Feed on the facts let's give in
Let's give in to give in more
Still on the knees, such a shame
The cat's up and run away
Scratched at me first, then the boy
Gonna panic for a little more
Watch the tail boy, watch the tail

Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Hey way to go (Can't wait to go)

Closing out all my tabs
Tighten down the pitiful
Leave you a pen, write it down
Or you know what you can do with that
Watch that tail boy, watch the tail
Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Hey way to go (Can't wait to go)

Let's let the panic bloom
Could help us all end up in the clear
Then let the havoc choose
To shape us all, push us to invent
We can feed off shame all day
We could feed off shame all day
Soon the stares catch
We begin to kill the calm as we
Feed on the facts let's give in
Let's give in to give in more

Like to be feeling the sand
Bring color back to both my arms the sun
Let it do damage like they said it
Would if given chance
Had to be shouting your voices
Scheming devils never make it through
Hey way to go lad
Hey way to go (Can't wait to go)Embed
