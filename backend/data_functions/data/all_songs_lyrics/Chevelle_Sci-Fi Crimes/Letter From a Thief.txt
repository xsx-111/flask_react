Letter From a Thief Lyrics
They know what everybody knows
Better sit a letter from a thief says
Why lead when everybody sleeps
So few ways to cover up your wounds
Lost in a finger forced to lie
This sends us medicating through it all

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there

Faceless, so little there to judge
Left wing, let's separate the cold out
Opposites, we never need to tell
One sting I've found I'm having to, I'm having to

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Solitude, waste of a man
This fades as soon as the sun sets
I now own this fatal role that lives
Imagine here's a better feel
Told to dissolve, or choose to fade
Or stay here, you'll live

If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there, you'll live
If you ever enter my mind
Stay there, you'll live
Defend it off and fool them all
Stay there3Embed
