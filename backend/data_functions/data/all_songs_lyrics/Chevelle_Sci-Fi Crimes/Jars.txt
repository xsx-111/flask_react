Jars Lyrics
Hold onto chance
Lest we bleed ourselves
Then save for the pets
They’re the loneliest

Put into jars
We’ll save this earth
Put into jars
We’ll save this earth

We can’t both become the same pawn that's made to fall
Oil that tastes like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you, you're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of this world
We’ll add enough of the world

Steal from yourselves
It never felt so good
And feed from their hand’s
Confuse by opposites
Put into jars
We’ll save this earth
Put into jars
Keep saving the earth

We can’t both become the same pawn that's made to fall
Oil that tastes like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you, you're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of
This world
We’ll add enough of the world

This world
We’ll add enough of the world
Feeling manic for a day
Depends on the trends
Depends on the surface
If the sun never sets

We can’t both become the same pawn that's made to fall
Oil that tastes like
Blood stole the summer scent
From me to you, you're stabbing me through you
You're stabbing you through him
And betting most of this world
We’ll add enough of the world
It's the main thing you shout 'til the bitter end
