Sleep Apnea (Acoustic) Lyrics
There sat a new test
Much harder that you bought in
As for the unseen
Just take care of what you will
Like a silent alarm
We never think that we're missing much so

I gasp and hold my breath
These needs had changed so deep
To face you all and say
I've been awake for

I need a new test
Better I set out to choose one
Light the soul like a kiln
Just imagine us chasing this with
Eyes scorned from sleep apnea
A slight of tongue as the seas are emptying

I gasp and hold my breath
These needs had changed so deep
To face you all and say
I've been awake forever
Ever, ever, everEmbed
