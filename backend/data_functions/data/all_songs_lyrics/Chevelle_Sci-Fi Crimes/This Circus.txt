This Circus Lyrics
What did I have to lose being negative
I bled through the snow then never sat down
It's clear for today, you're sleazy at night
As soon as we hear we will run

Or start swinging, start swinging
For below, there begging for it
I want my way
Never settle, always learning
People, they beg us for it
I'm on my way
Better settle, almost there

This might just feed the mother of all needs
Turning over here

Luck must fight over me and never give in
To weird out the soul, replace it with salt
I live within sight of this medicine man
How perfectly sure of this circus

I start swinging, we start swinging
'Cause this might just feed the mother of all needs
Turning over, heard it all so clear
The mother of all needs
Turning over, heard it oh so

Just run them off
Or grab and hold
Just run them off
Or grab and hold
Run them off
Or grab and hold

Below, there begging for it
I want my way
Never settle, always learning
People, they beg us for it
I'm on my way
Better settle, almost there

This might just feed the mother of all needs
Turning over, heard it all so clear
The mother of all needs
Turning over, heard it oh so, clearEmbed
