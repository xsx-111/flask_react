Shameful Metaphors Lyrics
Fear, it's all the same
Should I evolve to tend to these sights
Said out loud then said again
If fate's so wrong you'll start to feel light-headed

By my admission nothing grows
Just a longer list of unsorted laws

So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

Revolting man, this sacred chain
Brought down to trial
No better man could fail the way
You needed all, keep close the vein of empty thoughts

The finest river, the ravens tend
All along insisting, we're worlds away
So why then has all my life made no sound?
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound
I fear your eyes closing

Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid
Behold the lost
Behold a Band-Aid
These shameful metaphors
Fought it through the teeth
Shameful metaphors
Biting at your heels
Shameful metaphors
Fought it cheek to cheek

So why then has all my life made no sound? (These shameful metaphors)
And are your eyes closing even now?
My life made no sound (These shameful metaphors)
I fear your eyes closing1Embed
