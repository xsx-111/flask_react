A New Momentum Lyrics
Should we ignore?
This was too intense, too awful
Please stand still, to seize them all
His monetary gain equals his monetary mind

Even if the saints gave their all
Like lions in the face of a growing crowd
Too little and too late on the day
When all will fall

So drawing into
One another keeps momentum
Driving forward like a
Torching sun

Could sleep forever
In spite of this look, a look so scared
Sitting here with nothing new to add
And crying out you never seemed forced
It's just the kind of fuel that I need, to feel reborn

Feeding off the chase right before
Is like biting into ankles pulling 'round
To finish one more phase, get the key
When all will fall
So drawing into
One another keeps momentum
Driving forward like a
Torching sun

Learn to choose to breathe
Then stitch your arm to me
Learn to choose to breathe
Then stitch your arm to me
Learn! To choose! To breathe!
Then stitch your arm

So drawing into
One another keeps momentum
Driving forward like a
Torching sunEmbed
