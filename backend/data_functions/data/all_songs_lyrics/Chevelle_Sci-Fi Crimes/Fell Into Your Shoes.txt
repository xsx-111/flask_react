Fell Into Your Shoes Lyrics
Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one

Hoping to be shown a leaner curfew
Hopeful senseless sins
Gathering clues, weaving into
Feeding off the youth

Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one

The skies are overwhelmed
Another teacher heads for higher ground
Gathering clues, weaving into
Feeding off the youth

Closing chapters tell of a final virtue
Pay for healing as eyes go hollow
Weaving into
We bring this to you
Somehow we're sent by fools
No better when we're lost
I fell into your shoes
But only one1Embed
