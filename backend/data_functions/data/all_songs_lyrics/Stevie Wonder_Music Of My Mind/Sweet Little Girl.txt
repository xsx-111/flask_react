Sweet Little Girl Lyrics
Sweet little girl, you know your baby loves you
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Sweet little girl

Sweet little girl, you know your baby Steve is true
Your love is driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
Girl, I'm in love

Hey, my sweet, sweet mamma
You know you drive your baby mad
Oh my sweet, sweet mamma
You're driving me mad

Come on baby, you know your baby loves you
I've given you cookies and candy, and the woofer, and you
Still don't want to be good. Come on now honey-sugar, you know
Your baby loves you, more than I love my clavinet
So baby, do me good, do me good baby
 

Well, you got good loving
You know you make your baby mad
Whoa, you got good loving
The best that I've ever had
Come on now baby, you hear the phone ring
And sometimes you don't even answer and you know
I love you and you just treat me all kind of ways
Come on now, honey-sugar, you know your baby waiting on your love doll
You know you got my load. Can't you hear me talking to you, honey?
I try to treat you good and give you everything you want and sometimes
I see you making love with your love doll
But I still love you more than I love my clavinet
Come on now honey-sugar you know your baby love
You know just the other day I was
Gonna take you to go see a movie
Sweet Sweetback, cause I thought it might
Give you some inspiration
Cause we ain't made love in so long
Come on now sweet little sugar
Honey baby, now what if you knew I was going to put my harmonica down
Just to make love to you
Come on now honey, you know the woofer's waiting on you
Come on now baby, you know your baby loves you
Even more than he loves his clavinet
Don't make me get mad and act like a niggaEmbed
