Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos) LyricsThe crops are all in and the peaches are rotting
The oranges piled up in their creosote dumps
You're flying 'em back to the Mexican border
To spend all their money to wade back again
Good bye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportees"
Some of us are illegal and others not wanted
Our work contract's up and we have to move on
Six hundred miles to that Mexican border
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like thieves
Good bye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportees"
The sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos Canyon
A fireball of lightning shook all our hills
Who are all these friends who are scattered like dried leaves?
The radio said they were just "deportees"
Good bye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportees"
Good bye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita
Adios mis amigos Jesus y Maria
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane
All they will call you will be "deportees"Embed
