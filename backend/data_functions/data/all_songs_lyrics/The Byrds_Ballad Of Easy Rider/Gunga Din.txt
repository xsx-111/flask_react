Gunga Din LyricsI'm writing this here letter
From aboard a DC-8
Heading into Angel Town
I hope it's not too late
It rained in New York City
Mister Rock 'n' Roll couldn't stay
The crowd was mad and we were had
Chasing the sun back to L.A
Have breakfast with me mama
I hope they'll let us in
Got a leather jacket on
I know that it's a sin
Gunga Din
Sitting backwards on this airplane
Is bound to make me sick
Spend your life on a DC-8
Never get to bed, settle down, settle down
Now we're over Kansas
Where the clouds are floating by
The whole wide world looks back at me
Just like a mushroom pie I wonder why
Have breakfast with me mamma
I hope they'll let us in
Got a leather jacket on
I know that it's a sin
