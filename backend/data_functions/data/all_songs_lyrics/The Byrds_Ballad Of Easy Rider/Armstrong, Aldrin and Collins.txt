Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins LyricsMinus 20 in counting...19..18..17..16..15..14..13..12..11..
10..9..8..7..6..5.. we have ignition..3..2..1..
We have lift off
Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins were launched away in space
Millions of hearts were lifted, proud of the human race
Space control at Houston, radio command
The team below that gave the go they had God's helping handEmbed
