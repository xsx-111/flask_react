Tulsa County Blue LyricsMy nights have been lonely since I've been in Tulsa country
And I really don't know what I'm gonna do
I just might take a trip somewhere along the southern border
'Cause I know I've gotta get away from you
I don't know - just where I'll go
I believe I'll ride it down to Mexico
Down to Mexico
Got your note in Charleston, said you needed my assistance
But when I got there you didn't need me then
I may not be a wise man but I know this life you're leading
You learned your tricks from lots of other menEmbed
