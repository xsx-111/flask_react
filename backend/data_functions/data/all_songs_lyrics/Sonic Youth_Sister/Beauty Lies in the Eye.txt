Beauty Lies in the Eye LyricsThere's something in the air there
Makes you go insane
Brings you back to me
It's been so long
All's I have to do is live along
It's coming, coming down over me
Do you want to see the explosions in my eye?
Do you want to see the reflection of how we used to be?
Beauty lies in the eyes of another's dreams
Beauty lies, lost in another's dream
It's coming, coming down over me
Do you want to see the explosions in my eye?
Do you want to see the reflection of how it used to be?
Hey baby
Hey sweetheart
Hey fox, come here
Hey beautiful
Come here, sugar2Embed
