Catholic Block Lyrics
I got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it go to work
Bring it all back home
It serves you right
And I can motor down
You got to earn your freedom
Get it on my own
I just live forever
There just is no end
I just trust the oppression
Like I trust your friends
I got a catholic block
Inside my head
I let it play around
Iron to gold
Come back to me awhile

I got a catholic block
It's around my head
I got a catholic block
And it's blood orange red
I got a catholic block
Do you like to fuck?
I got a catholic block
I guess I'm out of luck3Embed
