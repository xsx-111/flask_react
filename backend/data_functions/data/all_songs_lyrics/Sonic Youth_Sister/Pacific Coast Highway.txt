Pacific Coast Highway LyricsCome on, get in the car
Let's go for a ride somewhere
I won't hurt you
As much as you hurt me
Let me take you there
Before the sun goes down
Come on, give me your love
Come on, baby, all you have
I wanna take your breath away
Come on, baby
"Just like that," you say
You make me feel so crazy
Come on, get in the car
Let's go for a drive somewhere
I won't hurt you
You make me feel so crazy
Come on, get in the car
Let's go for a ride somewhere
I won't hurt you
As much as you've hurt me
Let me take you there
Before the sun goes down
Come on, give me your love
Come on, baby, all you have
I wanna take your breath away
Come on, baby
"Just like that," you say
You make me feel so crazy
Come on, get in the car
Let's go for a ride somewhere
You make me feel so good
You make me feel so crazyEmbed
