Pipeline / Kill Time Lyrics
Stretch me to the point where I stop
Run ten thousand miles and then think of me
I think you know the place we should meet
Don't worry if it's dark and I'm late
Run me out a thin wire
Help me to kill this, love
I'll join you tonight at the bottom of the well
Feel around in the dark until you get the idea

I'm not moving, doesn't mean I can't
Flame on in my head
My best friend sucked his wife's blood and shriveled up
He was mistaken for sane
We move and groove and cut loose from fear
We should kill time, we'll shut it down
I've got a pipeline straight to the heart of you
Opening in my head

Bright glass on a chain being wound around us
The toiling of idle hands
Dripping with guilt
A secret form of punishment
Axes thru skulls, shadow of futility
Endless revolt
The shifting of light and shadows
No-one is right
Nothing is solid
Nothing can be held in my hands for long
We should kill time2Embed
