Hot Wire My Heart Lyrics
Insulation
In my circulation
Emanating rhythm
Sick of that incision
Nazi operation
Got my station?

Wire up the radio
And an emanating rhythm
Fire up the radio
Take the terror and find my limit

Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Like this!

Next thing you know
They're movin' in
Pull the zipper
It's sliding up
I don't have a reason
Honey, bring your best men
Wire up the radio
And an emanating rhythm
Higher up for the radio
Take the terror and...

Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Like this!

Kicking in the night shifts
Greasing up my fingertips
If they can't find us
Anybody's title
Got my eyes on the controls
Hand over, let's go!

Wire up the radio
And an emanating rhythm
Wire on the radio
Turn the treble and find my limit
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Hot wire my heart
Like this!Embed
