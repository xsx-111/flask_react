Party of the First Part Lyrics(Dialogue from "The Devil and Daniel Mouse")
Jan Mouse: Who are you?
B.L. Zebub: My card, pretty lady
Jan Mouse: Devil-May-Care Music Production, B. L. Zebub, President
B.L. Zebub: I like your style, too bad you're not a singer
Jan Mouse: Oh, but I am, I am a singer!
B.L. Zebub: Hmm, no fooling...
Jan Mouse: No, no listen...
B.L. Zebub: Fantastic, different
Jan Mouse: I want to be a star, oh, please!
B.L. Zebub: You've talked me into it. Contract!
Just our standard contract, nothing fancy...
Weez Weezel: Fame, fortune, fans, gold records, concerts, world tours, your name in lights!
B.L. Zebub: Take your time, read it all
Jan Mouse: Oh, I give up. Can I trust you?
Okay, I'll sign!
B.L. Zebub: Right! Pen!
Jan Mouse: Where's the ink?
B.L. Zebub: We always use blood, it's more permanent
Jan Mouse: Oh, I don't know, can't we wait for Dan?
B.L. Zebub: Oh, sure, I'll be back next year. Come on, Weez!
Jan Mouse: Next year?! Oh wait, wait, stop, stop, I'll sign!
What about a band... I know a drummer...
Weez Weezel: Ugh! She can't be bothered kid, she's got an interview!
Peter Murphy (of Bauhaus): The interview circus is so absurd and so silly
Journalist: How do you feel about your sudden success?
Jan Mouse: Well, I feel like being a big star is really great, you know? It's like, fabulous. Of course, it's... lonely, too, sometimes
Journalist: Oh, that's nice
Weez Weezel: This is the biggest thing ever to hit rock!
You're at the top now, sweetie!
Jan Mouse: Yeah, but where do I go from here?
Weez Weezel: Don't worry...
B.L. Zebub: I want you, we have a bargain
Jan Mouse: No, I didn't mean that, wait!
B.L. Zebub: I've been waiting, now it's my turn!
Jan Mouse: No!
B.L. Zebub: According to our contract, at precisely midnight, at the moment of her greatest triumph... the party of the first part, that's you, agrees to render up her soul now and forevermore... to the party of the second part, that's me. Shall we go?Embed
