Silent Hedges LyricsFollowing the silent hedges
Needing some other kind of madness
Looking into purple eyes
Sadness at the corners
Works of art with a minimum of steel
Pure sensation
A beautiful downgrade
Going to hell again
Going to hell again
Self confidence leaks from a thousand wounds
Faults of civilizations
Burning the private paradise of dreams
Minus hands of the electric
Clock (x4)
What happens when the intoxication of success has evaporated?
Following the silent hedges
Following the silent hedges
Going to hell again
Pure sensation
The beautiful downgrade
Going to hell again
Going to hell again
Again (x5)7Embed
