Swing the Heartache LyricsOut of her mouth it came as no surprise
Lipstick stained on whip-cream lies
I feel that if I had been uglier
It would have been easier
There it sat, blinked, and spat
In a black feather hat
And said "the rat"
Like a red bouquet slim swinger
It would have fit her better but no red letter
No red letter
But she wants to be a better singer
Swing the Heartache
Just for her sake
But she wants to be a better singer
Swing the Heartache
Just for her sakeEmbed
