All We Ever Wanted Was Everything Lyrics
All we ever wanted was everything
All we ever got was coal
Get up, eat jelly
Sandwich bars, and barbed wire
Squash every week into a day

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

The sound of the drum is calling
The sound of the drum has called
Flash of youth shoot out of darkness
Factorytown

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh

Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream
Oh, to be the cream12Embed
