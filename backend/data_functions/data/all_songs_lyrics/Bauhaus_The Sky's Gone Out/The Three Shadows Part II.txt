The Three Shadows Part II LyricsOh classic gentlemen
Say your prayers
To the wind, of prostitution
To your faces, and Rex complexes
Riddle my breast
Full of the oppressed puss
Oh gentlemen, with your fish
That you surround, all around
And you man, will always point
Your fishes, at me
But I will always exist
Because I always exist
Damn good too
The rat race begins
The fat face stings
I hold the fresh pink baby
With a smile
I slice off those rosy cheeks
Because I feel so thirsty
And Oedipus Rex complexes
...riddle my closed bloated breastEmbed
