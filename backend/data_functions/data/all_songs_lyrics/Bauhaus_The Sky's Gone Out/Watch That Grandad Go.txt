Watch That Grandad Go LyricsI'm sitting tight
I'm holding still
The flowers bite
The cobweb's still
We walk in file
We stand in line
The drug is in
And we

Scars may not be ugly
A doll's leg fits around you
Why is everybody burning sky
Misfit plug and chicken pie

Lights out fast and sleep at night
Lights out fast and sleep at night
Turn the light out
Get into bed
Cover yourself up
Your head
Your head
Your head
Your head!Embed
