Luber LyricsLuber, I want to hug you
I want to tell your mom to love you
You got your dreams
It's about the Birthday Party
And I've got my dreams
Whatever they used to be
Luber, on your birthday
I will answer your one-thousand questions
Luber, let me help you
It will ease my conscience
What would it be
If you knew were saving my soul?
And what would you think
If you knew you were the toast of my town?
Luber, on your birthday
I will answer your one-thousand questions
Luber, let me help you
It will ease my conscienceEmbed
