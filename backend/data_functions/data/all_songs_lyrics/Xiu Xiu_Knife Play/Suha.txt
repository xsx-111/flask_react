Suha Lyrics
Black lung got you down tonight
Saving it all for work
Suha pins her arms to her side
Watching her twin want to die

I hate my body, I hate the desert
Please let me escape
When will I be going home?
I hate my husband, I hate my children
I'm going to hang myself
When will I be going home?

Black hair got you down tonight
Black love, black cuts from your work
Weep like the busted girl you are
Wash down your hope in that car

I hate my body, I hate the desert
Please let me escape
When will I be going home?
I hate my husband, I hate my children
I'm going to cut my wrists
When will I be going home?
My name is Suha, I'm 25 years old
I'm gonna hump a cop
When will I be going home?1Embed
