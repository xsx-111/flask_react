Hives Hives LyricsPut that gun to my temple
Put that gun to my heart
Always walk off the plank, chicha
All, always, all, always into the dark
A-I-D-S, H-I-V
I cannot wait to die
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
Never finish my degree, chachi
Never played with the Pogues
Throw my head out the window
And cement my feet into the dark
A-I-D-S, H-I-V
I cannot wait to die
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?
Can't you tell?Embed
