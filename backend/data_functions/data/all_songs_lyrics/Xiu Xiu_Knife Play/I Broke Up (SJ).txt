I Broke Up (SJ) LyricsIt was not posed
It messed me up
It was her recording herself whisper
"What is it worth to me?"
Thinking one thought
The advice to be okay
Break into children's hospital crying out
"Don't fuck with me, don't fuck with me!"
And I broke up
Without a note
And I broke up
It's a mess
Go, go, go, go away from here
Food color poured out over her shorts mixed with
I will make a gate you cannot pass
Taped to their loincloth
A sign that says "WHY US?!"
Flip yourself off but say "erase it"
When someone sees you
"This is the worst vacation ever!
I am going to cut open your forehead
With a roofing shingle!"
And I broke up
Without a note
And I broke up
And I broke up
Behind your house
And I broke upEmbed
