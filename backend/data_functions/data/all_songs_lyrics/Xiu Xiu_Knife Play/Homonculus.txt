Homonculus LyricsOh Yvonne, it's true
But I promised not to say
What went down
Oh Yvonne, it's dumb
I don't know why I am turning red
Because I know you don't mind
He'll have set it up to fall
She'll have set herself to wait
Far enough away to know
Far enough
This wedding song's dumb
Oh Yvonne, it's like a wish
When I'd heard that she'd left him
It made me think just for a second
Oh Yvonne, it's dumb
I don't know what to say
She'll have set it up to wait
He'll have set himself to fall
Far enough away to know
Far enough
This wedding song's dumb
He'll have set it up to fall
And she'll have set herself to wait
Far enough away to know
Far enough
This wedding song's dumbEmbed
