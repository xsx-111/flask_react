Dr. Troll LyricsLala holds inside of her
The horrible dream of being somebody
Thinking about her dream makes her feel
Like itâ€™s stupid
A dream whose coming true
Is a must, a must
It would be so much easier
If she was a real girl
The preschool students ask her
What she is
She thinks I don't know
She says, "What do you think?"
Listen to "On Fire"
And pretend someone could love you
Listen to "Birthday"
And dream they knew the half of it
Listen to "Lady Day"
And pretend someone could love you
Listen to Nick Drake
And dream they knew the half of itEmbed
