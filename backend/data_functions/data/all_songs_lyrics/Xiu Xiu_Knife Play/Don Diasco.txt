Don Diasco LyricsGood God, baby
Lady’s high
Baby aping full on high
I cross my heart all the time
It’s always the same
Nothing happened
I cross my wrist, now you shut up
It’s always the same
Nothing happened
Miya, jailbird
Softy sigh
Miya, who cried
Secret sigh
I cross my heart all the time
It’s always the same
Nothing happened
I cross my wrist, now you shut up
It’s always the same
Nothing happened
I cross my heart all the time
It’s always the same
Nothing happened
I cross my wrist, now you shut up
It’s always the same
Nothing happenedEmbed
