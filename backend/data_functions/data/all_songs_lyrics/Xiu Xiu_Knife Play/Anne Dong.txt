Anne Dong LyricsGrab my face
As hard as it's funny to you
While I pretend
I'm your real dad
"How is Anne's cough today, Miss Sheryl?"
I pretend to ask
A daughter who I bug
And can only stand to be around me for about 30 seconds
But whose picture I wear
In a pin, inside my jacket
So, who is this picture?
That's you, Anne
You're not coming to my birthday
Oh, I knowEmbed
