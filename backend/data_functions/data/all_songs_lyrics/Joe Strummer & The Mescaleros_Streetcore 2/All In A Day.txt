All In A Day LyricsHey ho hey!
Its the acid test
Got a busy day, I'm wearing a vest
Hey ho hey
Try not to get bent
Got a busy day, I'm wearing a vest
Hey hey
It's all in a day
Hey hey
It's all in a day
The armor ten, and the I95
Tupuolo Joe honey and his rhumba jive
The look came out, and life broke out
'It must be a hex'
I swear the ---- loaded right on the desk
Hey, let's go do this
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Oh hey hey
Its all in a day
Well hey hey
Its all in a day
Oh hey hey (in Sherwood Forest we had Robin Hood)
Its all in a day
Well hey hey (everybody's rockin here around the hood)
Its all in a day (took me under, or mistunderstood)
Its all in a day
We're gonna show all the crews
How to make that
Rhythm and blues
Rhythm and blues
Darling gardenia markoson senior
Over in Montrose, they say you got hosed
I ain't sayin' I ain't got out you ain't no snitch
Shaky D's talkin' a---- in the ditch
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Oh hey hey
Its all in a day
Well hey hey
Its all in a day
Oh hey hey (in Sherwood Forest we had Robin Hood)
Its all in a day
Well hey hey (everybody's rockin here around the hood)
Its all in a day (took me under, or mistunderstood)
Its all in a day
(the misunderstood)
There is a towing zone
East of Chavez Ravine
Where I met my Queen
Where I met my Queen
Hey hey
Well hey hey
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Don't worry baby, your credit is good
Everybody's clockin' in round the hood
Round the hood
Oh hey hey
Its all in a day
Well hey hey
Its all in a day
Oh hey hey (in Sherwood Forest we had Robin Hood)
Its all in a day
Well hey hey (everybody's rockin here around the hood)
Its all in a day (took me under, or mistunderstood)
Its all in a day
