Silver and Gold LyricsOne, two
A one, two, three K
I'm gonna go out dancing every night
I'm gonna see all the city lights
I'll do everything silver and gold
I got to hurry up before I grow too old
I'm gonna take a trip around the world
I'm gonna kiss all the pretty girls
I'll do everything silver and gold
And I got to hurry up before I grow too old
Oh, I do a lot of things, I know is wrong
Hope I'm forgiven before I'm gone
It'll take a lot of prayers to save my soul
And I got to hurry up before I grow too old
I'm gonna take a trip around the world
Gonna kiss all the pretty girls
Who do everything silver and gold
And I got to hurry up before I grow too old
Heh, I'm gonna go out dancing every night
I'm gonna see all your city lights
I'm gonna do everything silver and gold
And I got to hurry up before I grow too oldEmbed
