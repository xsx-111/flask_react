Day By Day LyricsGive me what you can tonight
Time is all we have to play
Tell me you can't live without me
Tell me every day by day by day
Nothing lasts forever, only fades away
Day by day
Give me what you can tonight
I'm back tomorrow anyway
Show me some appreciation
Show me every day by day by day
The chance you gotta take's the price you gotta pay
Day by day
And if you break down, I will remind you
Of what you were yesterday
You can break down, I'll be behind you
Day by dayEmbed
