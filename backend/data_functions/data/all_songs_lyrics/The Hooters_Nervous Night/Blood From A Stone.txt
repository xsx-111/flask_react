Blood From A Stone LyricsYour buddy Sam's a bit confused
He don't know what to do
Getting tired of hearing your demands
He's got the whole world in his hands
And you can drive the outside lane
Last car on the gravy train
You can scream and you can moan
But you can't get blood from a stone
I'm working hard to pay the rent
And support my government
Built the highways and the railroad tracks
Now we're not giving up 'til they give it all back
You can laugh, but it's no joke
Gotta fix the thing that's broke
There's no meat only bone
And you can't get blood from a stone
The future raises so many doubtsEmbed
