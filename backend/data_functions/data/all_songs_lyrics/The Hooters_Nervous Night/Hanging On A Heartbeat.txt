Hanging On A Heartbeat LyricsYou change your mind like the weather
You promise sunshine but it looks like rain
A simple "no" would be better
But you just keep me hanging on again
Hanging on a heartbeat, its a hot seat
You better give it up and leave it behind
'Cause you can't waste time while you're hanging on a heartbeat
I lay my cards out on the table
But you've got aces hidden up your sleeve
I'm ready, willing, and able
But I'm a joker when it's time to leave
How many nights have I wasted
How many dreams have I lost in vain
Oh, but I like the little I've tasted
Don't leave me hanging on a heartbeat
My heart is lying here naked
All that I ask is you believe in me
We've got the power to make it
We'll say good-night or we can let it be
Hanging on a heartbeat, its a hot seat
You better give it up and leave it behind
'Cause you can't waste time while you're hanging on a heartbeatEmbed
