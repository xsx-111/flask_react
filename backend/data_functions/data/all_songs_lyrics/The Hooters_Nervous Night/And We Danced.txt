And We Danced Lyrics
Hey, hey!

She was a be-bop baby on a hard day's night
She was hangin' on Johnny, he was holdin' on tight
I could feel her coming from a mile away
There was no use talking, there was nothing to say
When the band began to play and play

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced

I met my be-bop baby at the Union Hall
She could dance all night and shake the paint off the wall
But when I saw her smile across a crowded room
Well I knew we'd have to leave the party soon
As the band began to play out of tune

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced, yeah
And we danced

The endless beat, she's walkin' my way
Hear the music fade when she says
Are we getting too close, do we dare to get closer
The room is spinning, she whispers my name

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced

And we danced like a wave on the ocean, romanced
We were liars in love and we danced
Swept away for a moment by chance
And we danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced
And we danced
And we danced
And we danced
Come on, man!
And we danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and danced
And danced and danced and dancedEmbed
