Nervous Night LyricsNervous night, time on my hands
Private invasion of the promised land
Two on the run, that's you and me
Maybe we can make it through this emergency
Oh, nervous night
African queen, we said so many things we didn't mean
Maybe another day, maybe it'd be alright
Oh, nervous night
Right outside, shiny and clean
A million vegetables I must be dreaming
On my window ledge, can I crawl through
Look out, look out below, I'm coming for you
Oh, nervous night
African queen, we said so many things we didn't mean
Maybe another day, maybe it'd be alright
Oh, nervous night
I try to speak, my senses fail
But you're just laughing while the sirens wail
All around the world in the Globe Hotel
If Isabella has her way it's gonna be a nervous day as well
Oh, nervous night
African queen, we said so many things we didn't mean
Maybe another day, maybe it'd be alright
Oh, nervous nightEmbed
