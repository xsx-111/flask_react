She Comes In Colors LyricsA thought in my head (I think) of something to do
Expressions tell everything, I see one on you
When I was invisible, I needed no light
You saw right through me (you said) was I out of sight?
My love, she comes in colors
You can tell her from the clothes she wears
When I was in England town, the rain fell right down
I looked for you everywhere, I could not be found
A thought in my head (I think) of something to do
Expressions tell everything, I see one on you
My love, she comes in colors
You can tell her from the clothes she wearsEmbed
