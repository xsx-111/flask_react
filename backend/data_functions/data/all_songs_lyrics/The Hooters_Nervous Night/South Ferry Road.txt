South Ferry Road LyricsThe night we stole the moon, a pirate's paradise
The light along the ocean was in your eyes
It ended all too soon, it started suddenly
The bridge was almost opened when we arrived
And when I thought I was lost you carried me across
Laughing through the fallout zone
You touched me in a way I'd never known
And in the salt-scented air I followed you there
You taught me everything I know
I'm going down again...
South Ferry Road
We found a place to land, a space-age hideaway
Safe inside the shelter, just you and I
The night we stole the moon you gave it back to me
The light along the ocean was our good-bye
But even still, now and then, I remember you when
Laughing all the way back home
You touched me in a way I've never known
And all the others remain just faces in a game
Remind me of a place I know
I'm going down again...
