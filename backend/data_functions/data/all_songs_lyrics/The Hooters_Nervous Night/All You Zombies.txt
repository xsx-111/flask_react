All You Zombies Lyrics

Holy Moses met the Pharaoh
Yeah, he tried to set him straight
Looked him in the eye
“Let my people go”

Holy Moses on the mountain
High above the golden calf
Went to get the Ten Commandments
He’s just gonna break ‘em in half

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin’ in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you

No one ever spoke to Noah
They all laughed at him instead
Working on his ark
Workin’ all by himself
Only Noah saw it coming
Forty days and forty nights
Took his sons and daughters with him
They were the Israelites

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin’ in high places
The rain’s gonna fall on you


Holy Father, what’s the matter
Where have all your children gone
Sittin’ in the dark
Livin’ all by themselves
You don’t have to hide anymore

All you zombies hide your faces
All you people in the street
All you sittin’ in high places
The pieces gonna fall on you
All you zombies hide your faces
(I know you're out there!)
All you people in the street
(Let's see you!)
All you sittin’ in high places
It's all gonna fall on you2Embed
