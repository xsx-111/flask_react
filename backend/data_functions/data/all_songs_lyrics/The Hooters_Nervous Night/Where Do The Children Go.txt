Where Do The Children Go LyricsSurrender into the night
Silently take my hand
Nobody knows what's inside us
Nobody understands
They handed us down a dream
To live in this lonely town
But nobody hears the music
Only the echo of a hollow sound
Where do the children go
Between the bright night and the darkest day
Where do the children go
And who's that deadly piper who leads them away
Together we make our way
Passengers on a train
Whisper a secret forever
Promises in the rain
We're leaving it all behind
While castles are falling down
We're going where no one can find us
And if there's a heaven
We'll find it somehow
Where do the children go
Between the bright night and the darkest day
Where do the children go
And who's that deadly piper who leads them awayEmbed
