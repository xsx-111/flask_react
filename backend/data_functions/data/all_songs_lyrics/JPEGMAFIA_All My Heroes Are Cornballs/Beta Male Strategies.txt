Beta Male Strategies Lyrics
Hahahahaha, haha
Mmh (Oh), mmh, mmh, mmh
Ain't no details, ain't no conversation
Ain't no real money in rap, nigga
It's all retail, shit, huh
Niggas be talkin' shit (Talkin' shit)
I tell 'em, "Pull up, bitch"
Cease to exist (Alright)
You gon' cease to exist
Don't get exposed, nigga
Keep code, nigga
Only in it for the cash, I'm a gold digger (Uh)
Shitpost, nigga
When I die, my tombstone's Twitter, Twitter
Sayin'

Ain't no details (Nah), ain't no conversations (Nah)
Ain't no real money in rap (Shut up), it's all retail (Facts)
It's all outrage (For real)
Y'all put this pussy in a prime position (For real)
Young Peggy, I'm a false prophet
Bringin' white folks this new religion
My fans need new addictions (Sayin')
Niggas be talking shit (Talkin' shit)
I tell 'em, "Pull up, bitch"
Cease to exist (Exist, man)
Don't get exposed, nigga (Bah)
Huh, keep code, nigga
Only in it for the cash, I'm a gold digger (Ooh)
Shitpost, nigga
Aight, we gon' do it like this
Say what you said on Twitter right now (Right now, exactly, nigga)
You only brave with a board and a mouse (Uh-huh)
You wasn't talkin' when I put you in the ground (Sucker)
Don't leave the house
Don't get capped by a nigga in a muhfuckin' gown

Fuck (Huh, huh)
Fuck
Fuck, fuck (Oh)
Fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck
Ah, ah
Ah (Thank God)

These niggas fragile (Thank God)
Rap been so good to me, I hope it get me canceled (Oh)
Y'all hope that I'll be dead soon (Huh)
Ooh, bitch, I must be scarin' you (Hey, oh)
I packed the fixer in case you bitches want a scandal, I came (Huh)
Glock with the dick, y'all be typin' it (Yeah)
But y'all ain't gon' do shit (Sit)
In your pussy ass life
Fuck
Fuck
Fuck, fuck (Oh)
Fuck
Fuck, fuck, fuck

Hahaha, hahahaha
Ha, bitch
Ha, mmh
Ha, yeah14Embed
