JPEGMAFIA TYPE BEAT Lyrics
You think you know me
No chance to win, that's what I'm tellin' you
My personnel, your purse is mine
Don't defeat nothing any longer
Wow, we're getting stronger
Wow, we're getting stronger (Uh)
Wow, wow, loser (Set)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Hell)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Set)
Wow, wow (Huh)
Wow, we're getting stronger (What?)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Huh)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Uh)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Set, set, set)
Wow, wow (Huh)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Be like oh, shit)
Wow, we're getting stronger (Set)
Wow, wow
Wow, we're, wow, we're getting stronger
Wow, we're getting stronger
Wow, we're getting stronger
Wow, we're getting stronger
Wow, we're getting stronger
Wow
I don't wanna talk about it, I just wanna do it, yo
