BasicBitchTearGas Lyrics
I know, I know, I know, I know (Hahaha)
Shit is just, fuck it (Yeah)
(Long Island shit) Let's do it

A scrub is a guy who thinks he's fly
And also known as a buster (Yeah)
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

No (Whoa), I don't want your number
No (Oh), I don't wanna give you mine and
No (Yeah), I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, I don't wanna none of that, baby

A scrub checkin' me and his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
I'm lookin' like class, and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass, so

I don't want no scrub
Scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
It ain't hard to see, he2Embed
