All My Heroes Are Cornballs Lyrics
One, two
JPEG, because I like JPEGs (Say, say)
Um, for the resolution of color
You think you know me
The only thing about JPEGs I like
It's yours
Alright

Aw, nigga, nigga, nigga, I'm stayin' (Yeah, huh)
Aw, nigga, nigga, I'm just playin' (Playin', playin', playin', yeah)
Walk in the crib with the Glock 19 and a dirty clip
Snuck up in Coachella with a bong, lil' buddy, I ain't Jaden Smith  (No)
Herman, nigga, of course (Of course), I'm flagrant (Facts)
I can't keep no job, I can't commit
Hate goes into these bars, some niggas ain't built for it
I made rap my job, it's sacred
You don't wanna get them guns involved (Doo-doo-doo-doo)
'Cause your wifey gon' be callin' the law, boys (Boys), alright

Fuck
Motherfuckers, man
Fuck, fuck
These niggas out here, man
Gnarly, gnarly
Fuck, fuck
Fuck (Fuck)
Gnarly
Uh, damn, guess who had a big year? (Big year)
No whips, no chains, just a few tears
Pop filter, hopin' that you get the stock (Bah)
When I hit the stage, I hope that my enemies watchin'
Damn, I wonder when they droppin'?
Why these wiggas always showin' up when niggas be poppin'? Bruh
Don't turn yourself into a target (Into a target)
'Cause we can take this shit from beef to somethin' exhaustin'
Glock 43X with the sticky holster (Bah-bah-bah)
Pistol whip 'em, I can't waste the bullet in a poser (Blat)
Incels gettin' crossed 'cause I crossed over
How they go from Anne Hathaway to Ann Coulter?
All that shootin' in the air, that's for posin' (That's for posin')
Fast break, we jammin' it, nigga, no floaters
Lames gettin' bolder, straps on the shoulder
They gon' have to get the chap to console you

You know, everybody wanna say I do this, I do that (Don't play me)
Everyone wanna act like they hard and shitBut just stop, shit
Damn, haha

Let me
Let me get, uh, uh
Let me get a double bacon, a double bacon, double
Nah, not a double bacon, uh, uh
A bacon, a bacon smokehouse meal with no cheese
Mhm
Yeah, with, with no cheese on that thang, and uh

The meal is gon' be large, the meal is
