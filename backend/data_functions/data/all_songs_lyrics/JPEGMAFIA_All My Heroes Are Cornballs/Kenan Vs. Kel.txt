Kenan Vs. Kel Lyrics

Celebration hit, shit
You think you know me
Yo
(Yeah, throwin' it up, ayy)
I wish I had more fuckin' water
Uh, uh

Man, I really, really wish I was Illuminati
Niggas waitin' on the Peg like I'm droppin' Yandhi
Too black, too strong, I'm a lil' thotty (Yeah)
But fuck a big speech
'Cause when I'm rollin'
I'm dressin' up like I'm Prince Peach
And if you sendin' in Marios to defend me
You better make sure to break all the Grammys
Kill all the winners, losers, nominees
Off probation, crackers hatin' accusations
Only on occasions (Yeah)
I don't want relations (Huh), had some thotty phases
Strip, home invasion, fuck with me, man
Y'all better miss me (Yeah)
'Cause if you rollin', I'm stonin' niggas like Rich Keith (For real)
And when I'm whippin' you niggas, it's not slavery (Damn, Peggy)
I'm on a mission to slaughter the competition
And leave you slumpin' on the downbeat, bitch, work
Huh, how we gon' make this bullshit work? For real
How we gon' make this work? Facts (Facts, facts)
But like, how can I make a good beat? (For real)
I get nervous when niggas want features (For real)
How I'm gon' make this work?

I don't know this
I don't know this
I don't know this
Oh
(How can I make a good beat? For real
How I'm gon'... this work)


Skrrt
Run it up
Yeah, buddy, yeah, buddy
Run it up
Run it up, yeah
Run it up
Get 'em, ooh
Yeah, uh
Huh, uh
Bitch, I came back with the Jak and Dax off the shelf
Shoppin' my target, I'm wishin' you well
I don't think prayer can help (Woo)
This feel like Kenan and Kel, these niggas broke like a Dell
Niggas tell, niggas melt, I'ma shoot, you don't sell (Brrt)
I don't think prayers or poems or nothin' can help

Nada, it's nothin'
Haha
Nigga boy, boy
You think you know me8Embed
