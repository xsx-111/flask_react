PTSD Lyrics
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Ah, nigga, don't stop now
Don't stop
Don't stop (Don't do it)
Don't stop
Don't stop (Oh my God)
Don't stop
Don't stop
You think you know me
Don't stop
Don't stop (Huh, uh)
Don't stop, don't stop
Nasty
Don't stop, don't stop, don't stop
Got so motherfuckin' high, my eyes waterin', bruh (J. Cole)
Don't stop
Huh-uh
Don't stop
Uh

Young slut from the bottom of the East Coast (Huh)
Keep the blicky and the money in the mattress (Uh)
Bulldog a nigga like Trish Stratus
Don't stop, the semi spitting like don't flop
No shots, get the picture or you and your niggas both cropped
Pistol whip 'em and put this pussy in a headlock
I hate when niggas talk shit and they scared to get hit
Where in the world was your niggas when you dropped?
Brrat, brrat, don’t stop, huh
Lethal weapon, I hit this nigga with the dead stock
Shit looking like Splinter Cell, special ops (Brrt)
Cops (All that bullshit)
(And when I hit you nigga damn)
Uh, and when I hit you nigga, don't be callin' no cops (No cop)
Not one bar, no clips, no drops (Uh)
Ill niggas, y'all niggas wan' get infected
If I don't call you, nigga, you should get the message (Yeah)
Stop cryin', make something people impressed with
Don't know how that feels, Young Peggy, no deal
Y'all deal look somethin' like Brexit
Bitin' crackers and wonder why you anorexic (Damn, Peggy)
If you can't say it to my face, I don't respect it (Wow)
All black, nigga schemin' like Uncle Fester
You got a show, but you showin' up in a stretcher
Think deep, hit bong, apply pressure, yeah

Don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
Don't stop
Don't, don't, don't, don't stop
And I'm gonna pack another bowl
That's what I'm gonna do today, yeah
Gonna pack this bowl
Gonna pack another bowl today
Hold up
One, two, one, two
(Don't stop)4Embed
