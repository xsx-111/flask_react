Thot Tactics Lyrics
Aw, niggas really done some shit
Stay calm, please remain calm
Apology-zoned
Huh, heat zone
I am alright
I build the room
I rule the room
Don't feel better
Huh, huh, huh, woah
All night, all day, hah
Aw, man (Say)

I wanna rock your world, I wanna be your girl
You wanna take me out yeah, yeah, take me out, huh
They ain't never take me down, bitch (Hell no)
They ain't never take my crown, bitch
(Shut up)
Hate? Never, bitch, where? Uh

Bruh, put the keyboard down, get the MAC out
Blackout, make a motherfucker back out, back (Baow)
G's up, freeze when I put her down
I'm pullin' up on this pussy and I'm pullin' out
Rock bottom when I put... (Alright, hold up)
You it, those clowns
Switch your pitch when I hit the mound
Rap niggas think they so profound
Got 'em lookin' up like who they under now? (Wow)
I ain't underground
Bitch, I'm over who you under now, sucker
Hope you had the time of your life
'Cause it's over for you when I come around (Let's go)
Thot tactics
Your shit don't bump, you was not proactive
Sneak dissin', that is not attractive
I'm in a slump and I'm bouncin' back
Bitch crash whips like burnout
Pussy nigga, how you end up caught in traffic?
Chrome ratchet, case basket
With white shooters like the old Mavericks, it's real
Just in case you thought it wasn't
(That's like so amazing)
I, I, I wanna rock your world, I wanna be your girl
You wanna take me out yeah, take me out, huh
They ain't never take me down, bitch
They ain't never take my crown, bitch, no

I can't compete (What you doin'?)
I'ma do you like **** did me (That's the one, that's the one)
No 'pologies (That's the one, that's, that's the one)
(I like that one, I like it that one, that one, one)
Sucker nigga, put the keyboard down, get the MAC out
Blackout, make a motherfucker back out
G's up, freeze when I put her down
Pullin' up on this pussy and I'm pullin' out
Rock bottom when I'm puttin'...
Nigga (What? What?)4Embed
