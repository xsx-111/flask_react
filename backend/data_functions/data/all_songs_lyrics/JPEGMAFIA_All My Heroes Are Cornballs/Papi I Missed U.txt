Papi I Missed U Lyrics
You think you know me
I-I'm-I'm, I'm pretty sure I coughed on every fuckin' song
Woo, ayy, no lie
Hahahahahaha
Bet, fight
I see you hittin' that shit, you know what I mean
Say, uh, yeah
Said, uh
Big dope

Niggas bold, bitches shady
Records gold, cracker, pay me
'Round here, niggas really think shit gravy
Black M's been got since the mid-eighties
Since a little baby (Sad, yeah)
Left wing Hades (Uh)

Heard white folks like beer (Like beer)
Rich, young swan, I'm a seer (Seer)
Fuck him, he is not top-tier
And he never-ever spit a fuckin' rhyme that made me care (Facts)
Big strap lookin' like a dildo (Like a dildo)
Lookin' like a creep when I kick door (When I kick door)
Young, black male with the .44 (Haha, brr)
Ha, I'm a terrorist (Yeah), I don't spit raps, bitch I spit rhetoric
And I be in your kid's mind, gettin' leverage
I hate old white niggas, I'm prejudiced (Yeah)
But I'ma take you niggas money like a reverend
Better than me, rather than you, I'ma bury it (Right)
Tryna lead these niggas to freedom, Peggy Harriet (Damn, Peggy)
Target practice on an Aryan
Redneck tears, woo, what a beverage (Ha)
Dead cops on my songs, that's hilarious (Yeah)
Are you mad 'cause a nigga done bought a gold tooth? (Yeah)
Are you mad 'cause you see me up in your Whole Foods? (Why?)
Man, these fake Young Dolphs think they bulletproof
Niggas bold, bitches shady
Records gold, cracker, pay me
'Round here, niggas really think shit gravy
Black M's been got since the mid-eighties
Since a little baby (Yeah, nigga)
Left wing Hades (Uh, shit)

Uh, bitch, I'm on your street right now (Yeah)
Creep up, turn lights, then out (Nigga)
I'ma show you what this hype 'bout, I know (Figure it out, ha)
Uh, bowlin' for the Columbine (Yeah), heard he want the nicotine
Sig up on his chin, it make him move like Pistol Pete
Flash the burner in his face and make him pray to me (Haha)
Amen
