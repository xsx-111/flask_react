Rap Grow Old & Die x No Child Left Behind Lyrics

PEGI eighteen
What is this?
I can't hear you, but...
It's a weeb, what it, what is this?
It's, um, it's a weeb song
Say, oh, oh, oh
Weird ass shit, man, huh

It's a cycle
Go in like Bobby, end up like Michael
I guess that it's just a vicious cycle
Go in like Bobby, end up like Mike
(See what I'm sayin', look, look, look)
It's a cycle

Uh, I feel like Sami Zayn, my moves are makin' waves
Tell the writers, "Write in the title," huh
Two guns like Lara Croft
I look like Herman Cain
I dress like Jimmy John
Baby, we gon' pull you apart
Real estate in your skin, I break a hateful heart (Yeah)
I feel these cracker A&Rs think I'm al a carte
They want me Kevin James, bitch, pay me like Kevin Hart (Mmh)
Let the kids crown me king for this art
I can't behave myself, man
It's like a cycle
Heard Peggy sellin' out, he got a whip, a house
I guess it's just a vicious cycle
Go in like Bobby, end up like Michael
Then don't come around, yeah, yeah
I guess that it's just a vicious cycle
Go in like Bobby, end up like Michael
Then don't come around (Said, uh)

They playin' with my name (Yeah)
Young Peggy bring the pain
I click a bitch, I'm Adam Sandler, bringin' major pain
Damian Wayne, I'm the prodigal son
Forced my way in the game
I coulda reached for the pub and ended up like Acclaim (Yeah)
I got booked for Coachella, enemies can't say the same (Yeah)
I been beefin' with bums, I should find healthier game
I skin a fuckin' rapper, perfect pelt, bogus chain
Niggas pretend to be Peggy but can't master the range (Nah)
These boys be **** on Twitter and think they bringin' change (Wow)
I think they full of shit (Full of shit), some people feel the same (Some the same)
Some people need a hero, my niggas need a Bane

Ooh, ooh
You know what?
I just, I just wanna
Hee, hah
Hahahahahaha
Ooh, ooh, like a baby (Baby)
Fresh out the womb, no towel (They never saw it comin')
I'm so feeble, I'm evil
Don't treat me like no child, baby6Embed
