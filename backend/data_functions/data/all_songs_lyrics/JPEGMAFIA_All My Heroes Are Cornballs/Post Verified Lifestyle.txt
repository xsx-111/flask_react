Post Verified Lifestyle Lyrics

I don't even gotta⁠—
Ford F-250, two of 'em
With the WiFi and the nitrous booster
You know how we do
Fuck, ooh
Fuck, fuck, fuck

Fuck
I'm feelin' like fuckin' you up (Fuck)
I still got the sig in the truck (Yeah)
I'm treatin' this bitch like a cuck, brrt, MAC, loadin' it up (Ya)
Hit your neck, and your back, and your blunt
Circle 'round and send you to the sun (Ah)
I don't hide from you bums (No)
I survived through the slums (Yeah)
When you die, they'll adjust (Adjust)
Fuck it, I'm breakin' you off (Uh, uh)
Bitch, I came back with the Hi-Point 'cause I know that you soft (I know it, I know it, I know it)
Never let 'em catch you slippin', kept my eyes wide like Kate Moss
PEGI eighteen

Let's get it
Boy, let's get it (Let's get it)
You know what? Um...
You get put on the spot, and you're supposed to be talking about something
But you don't know what to talk about (Damn)
Like this very moment
That's right, that's what's goin' on right now
Huh?
That's what's goin' on right now
Yeah, um
Don't worry about it, you'll be okay
Hold on, nigga
It's just something I grew up on (Yeah)
We playin' with pencils for fun?

We playin' with pistols for fun
Mama said, "Don't rely on no gun"
That's why I'm fadin' you bums (Bah)
Label say that I'm fatal to fund
When I die, want all my enemies to take a sigh and say, "R.I.P."
And everyone that I don't fuck with, all of a sudden started fuckin' with me
Incredible, took an edible and thought my keyboard muttered to me (Ha)
Oh, you think you up and coming, G?
Nah, up and comers really think they me
Bitch, I'm Beanie Sigel, mixed with Beatles with a dash of DOOM at 98 degrees
So fuck a PO, I won't take a plea
I'm bungie jumpin' to my destiny
Post verified, 'cause these niggas really think a handle could handle me
It's the young, black Ali G (Pa)
Fallin' off before I catch a fee
Hit the Mueller, let me down with ease, baby
How you wanna turn me on?
How you wanna turn me on?
I can never be alarmed
It's all
Your parameters have been set, and shit

Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn-damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn-damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn-damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn-damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn-damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy
Damn, Peggy5Embed
