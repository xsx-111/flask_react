Brightness Falls LyricsBaby, baby
I hate to go
Don't leave me alone with this sorrow
The body's heavy
The getting's slow
Lost in moments
Caught in moments
The night is starless
And stands below
And I need you by my side
Baby, baby
I love you so
Don't leave me alone in this hollow
When brightness falls
Who'll come running?
When brightness falls
Who'll come running in?
Saved by silence
Save by noise
Save by lightning
Saved by joy
Building on emptiness
And all you broken hearted people
Baby, Baby
The hurt heals slow
And who can believe in tomorrow?
When brightness falls
Who'll come running?
When brightness falls
Who'll come running in?
The ticket's exploded
Only one way out
Live in lightness
Lost in lightness
There's nothing left to write about
And time's no longer
The greatest injustice of all
On this new dayEmbed
