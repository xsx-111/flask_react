Darshan (The Road to Graceland) LyricsDarshan
Two birds
One stone
One chance
Is thrown
Don't make
Mistakes
Two thieves
Strung up
One knife
One cut
Two doors
One shut
One light
One way
One road
To take
We stand
And wait
From cool
To warm
From dusk
'til dawn
From flux
To form
Kneeling on the road to graceland
Kneeling on the road to graceland
To graceland
