Window LyricsSlowly I stretch out my arms freely
Shadows of night disappear
Rise from the slough of despond, find the pathway
Guiding us forward through pastures of dream day
Days to enjoy, peace I knew once before me
Dawning to dusk on the hills until morning

Come see me, take my hand
Come see me in my land
Flying invisibly high, watch me
All on a beautiful sky, I'll be
Clear and serene in the love I've discovered
Long search is over, the soul is uncovered
Resting on joy that abounds without ceasing
Bidding farewell to the fears now decreasing

Come see me, take my hand
Come see me in my land
High on a golden crested wave she sits
The little nymphs dance in her hair
The trees all beckon to the sky to bless their empty lives
Horizons come to sip wine there
The veiled mist reveals the wandering ship upon the reef
The albatross flies to the stern
And only jack frost saw the kiss you gave him in return
Crossing the mountains of truth, see them
Soaring majestically high, and then
Stop at the warning light, see it flash brightly
Thunder awakes me; the crashes beside me
Shatters the scene and brings chaos to beauty
Leading us forward where destiny may be

Come see me, take my hand
View from another land
