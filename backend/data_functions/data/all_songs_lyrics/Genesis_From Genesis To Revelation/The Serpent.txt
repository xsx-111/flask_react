The Serpent LyricsDark nights the planets are set
Creator prepares for the dawn of man
You're waking up, the day of incarnation
Said you're waking up to life
Images he made to love
Images of gods in flesh
Man is wonderful, very wonderful
Look at him
Beware the future
Here is my world and it's waiting for me
Paradise before my eyes
I am alive in a new born world
This heaven will always be mine
I'm waking up, the day of man has come
I'm waking up, the day of man has come
And god created man from dust
With a soul inside his mould
And god created womankind
The vessel of satan's hold
Creator made the serpent wise
Evil in his tempting eyes
Man is wonderful, very wonderful
Look at him
Beware the future
Here is my world and it's waiting for me
Paradise before my eyes
I am alive in a new born world
This heaven will always be mine
I'm waking up, the day of man has come
I'm waking up, the day of man has come
Dark nights the planets are set
Creator prepares for the dawn of man
You're waking up, the day of incarnation
Said you're waking up to life
Here I stand a child in a lonely world
Watch the serpent tempting me to evil
The guiding hand will help me on
Guiding hand will help me on
The guiding hand will help me on
Guiding hand will help me onEmbed
