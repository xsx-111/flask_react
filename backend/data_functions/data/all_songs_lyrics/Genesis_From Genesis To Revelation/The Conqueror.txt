The Conqueror LyricsHe climbs inside the looking glass
And points at anything he hates
He calls to you "Hey look out son
That's a gun they're pointing at your pretty face"
And the heads they are a rolling
Cause the conqueror is on his way
And the justice day is coming
For the conqueror is on his way
Five hundred little women are calling
At their hero's door
Yes, their hero is working overtime
He's squirming on an empty floor
And the heads they are a rolling
Cause the conqueror is on his way
And the justice day is coming
For the conqueror is on his way
He's bought the castle on the hill
He's bought it just to knock it down
The local power shout him down
They say he's just an empty-headed clown
And the heads they are a rolling
Cause the conqueror is on his way
And the justice day is coming
For the conqueror is on his way
He's busy building monuments
To hide inside his empty grave
You there, can you find some souls?
He's looking for some people to save
And the heads they are a rolling
Cause the conqueror is on his way
And the justice day is coming
For the conqueror is on his way
And the words of love are killing him
And the conqueror is on his way
And the words of love were lying on an empty floor
Just in the place where the conqueror layEmbed
