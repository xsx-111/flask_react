The Getaway Lyrics
That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight alright
Take me through the future
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
Incision and a suture
You told my friend we would get it on no matter when
A supercavitation
Let's go, you show me something no one will ever know
A love hallucination

Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

Complete repeat sittin' in your car and on your street
Lost in California
Let's steal this wheel, take a spin to find out how we feel
Just around the corner
Slow down for sound, turn it up and no we canâ€™t be found
The body that we transcend
Asleep, you weep, find out that the trick is never cheap
A melancholy girlfriend
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

You don't have to keep it if it's mine
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Another place maybe another time
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried

That's right, you're right, we will do our thing tonight, alright
Drive the constellation
It's time, you're fine, just another color coded crime
The song is fascination

Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Take it much too far
Surrender to the brave inside the lover that another tried
Take it, too my ride

A May-December might not be so smart
Another lonely superstar to getaway inside your car
Arrivals that we wish would not depart
Surrender to the brave inside a lover that another tried
Don't be late 'cause you're my savior
Make it great whatever stays
Golden gate my rearranger
Hold my name inside your rays13Embed
