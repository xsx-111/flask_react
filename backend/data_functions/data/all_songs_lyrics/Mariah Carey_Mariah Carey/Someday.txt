Someday Lyrics
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other

Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score

You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
Because I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll never come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when your down in your time in need
And you're thinking 'bout how you might be coming back to hold me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore

Someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, someday
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score6Embed
