All in Your Mind Lyrics
Come closer
You seem so far away
There's something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes

Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions
If you look in my eyes

Hey, darling
I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind (Yes)
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind (Yeah. Yeah. Ooh)

Believe me
I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer, my darling
Feel the love in my eyes (Yes)
Hey, darling
I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind (Yes)
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind (Yeah. Yes)
I know you feel my love
In your mind, yeah

Hey, darling
Well, I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind (Yes, yes)
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind (Yeah)
Baby, it's all in your mind (Yes, uh, uh, hmm, hmm)
Baby, it's all in your mind (Mind, oh, yeah, baby, ooh, darling)
Got to let you know, baby
Baby, it's all in your mind
You know my love is good now, baby, yes
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind (Yeah, darling)
Baby, it's all in your mind (Wow, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind (Oh)
Baby, it's all in your mindEmbed
