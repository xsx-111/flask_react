Vanishing (Live at the Tatou Club, 1990) Lyrics
If I could recapture all of the memories
And bring them to life, surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me surviving the night?
You're fading out of my sight swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
Ahh, oh

I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're, oh
Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord knows I would

But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside swiftly

You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh
You're vanishing
Drifting so far away
Whoa
You're vanishing
Whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Away
Thank you. This last song was originally recorded by the incomparable Aretha FranklinEmbed
