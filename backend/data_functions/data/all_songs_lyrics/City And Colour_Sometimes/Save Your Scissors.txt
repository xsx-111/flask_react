Save Your Scissors LyricsSo go on
And I will refrain
And I'll keep on running
On this never ending race
And maybe next time
Will be the right time
And maybe next time
Will be your time
So save your scissors
For someone else's skin
My surface is so tough
I don't think the blade will dig in
Save your strength
Save your wasted time
There's no way
That I want you to be left behind
Go on and save your scissors
Save your scissors
So why does it always seem
That every time I turn around
Somebody falls in love with me
This has never been my sole intention
And I have never claimed
To have patents on such inventions
Just save your scissors
For someone elses skin
My surface is so tough
I don't think the blade will dig in
Save your strength
Save your wasted time
There's no way
That I want you to be left behind
Go on and save your scissors
Save your scissors
There is something
That I must confess
To you tonight
And that is
I expect nothing less
From you tonight
Go on and save your scissors
Save your scissors
Save your scissors6Embed
