Like Knives Lyrics
Your words are like knives
They peel my skin and pierce my soul
Your body will burn tonight
Though your heart may still remain cold

And I will blame myself
And I will blame myself
For holding on to what I hoped would keep you by my side
I will blame myself

The sheets are stained with
Memories of your soft kiss
Now this is all I have
And paper and pen to remember you with

And I will blame myself
And I will blame myself
For holding on to what I hoped would keep you by my side
I will blame myself

Can I have you?
Can I have you?
Can I have you?
And can I have you?Embed
