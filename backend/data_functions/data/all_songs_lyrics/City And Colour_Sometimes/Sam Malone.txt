Sam Malone Lyrics
And you can try
To fight this all you want
And I won't be there
I won't be there
When you're all alone
This new season
It brings with it
Signs of hope
Hope
Now you can't leave me
You can't leave me
Waiting all alone
Alone

And I know
There is someplace I can go
Where no one knows my name

And I can still remember
You know I can still hear your voice
Your voice
Although your silence
Your silence still rings so clear
And do you think
Do you think I would call
Just to hear you breathe?
Breathe, breathe, breathe
You always knew
You always knew that just one word Would dry up all my tears

And I know
There is someplace I can go
Where no one knows my name
My name
No one knows my name
Where no one knows my name1Embed
