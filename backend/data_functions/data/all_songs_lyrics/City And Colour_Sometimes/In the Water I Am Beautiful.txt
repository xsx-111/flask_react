In the Water I Am Beautiful Lyrics
And I know its not to get away from me
You just need a change of scenery
So strange how everything went wrong so fast
And I hope that this confusion does not last

'Cause these words might be too little too late
And I'm afraid that I have already lost you
Now three months equals eternity and this will be so hard
And I will long to hold you in my arms

And when you ask "do you love me?"
I should reply with "yes, most certainly"
I always hesitate there's something lingering
I will try harder to be all that I can be

These words might be too little too late
And I'm afraid that I have already lost you
Now three months equals eternity and this will be so hard
And I will long to hold you in my armsEmbed
