Another Woman Lyrics
You leave your home for days and days
And I know, said I know
You leave your home for days and days
And I know, said I know
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You leave your home for days and days
You leave your home for days and days
You leave your home for days and days
You leave your home for days and days
And I know, said I know
You leave your home for days and days
And I know, said I know
You leave your home for days and days
And I know, said I know
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere around
You got another woman somewhere aroundEmbed
