One of These Mornings Lyrics
One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone

One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone

One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be gone

One of these mornings
One of these mornings
Won't be very long
Won't be very long
You will look for me
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me
And I'll be gone
And I'll be gone
You will look for me

One of these mornings
Won't be very long
You will look for me
And I'll be goneEmbed
