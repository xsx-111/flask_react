Signs of Love Lyrics
If I was beautiful
If I had the time
They'd flock to me
Bathe me in the wine
I know that's not the way
I know that's not how things are to be
(My baby left)
(My baby left)
(Gone gone)
(Gone gone)

I was always looking
And I held until the time began
Solo things come at me
I look to see where loss had ran
I can have the sun it come
And touch me on my shoulder
Think of all the things that I could
Wish that I had told her

I fly so high
Then fall so low
(I fly so high)
(I fly so high)
If I was beautiful
If I had the time
They'd flock to me
Bathe me in the wine
I know that's not the way
I know that's not how things are to be

If I was like you
With nothing to get around
Then everything would be beautiful
As far as I can see
You'd be sitting here with me
'Til love's end

I fly so high
Then fall so low
I fly so high
Then fall so low
Signs of love (I fly so high)
Away we could run (then fall so low)

I can see the light come peering through the sky in my mind
Closing people come in but also lying on the floor
I would hold you in my arms until we both are home
I would hold you in my arms until we both are all aloneEmbed
