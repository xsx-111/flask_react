In This World Lyrics
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself

Sometimes I'm up
Now I'm almost level
Sometimes I'm up
Now I'm almost level
Sometimes I'm up
Now I'm almost level

Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
So many time's I'm down
Level
So many time's I'm down
Level
So many time's I'm down
Level
With the ground

Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself

Whoa, in this world
Whoa, in this world
Whoa, in this world

Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself
Lordy don't leave me
All by myself1Embed
