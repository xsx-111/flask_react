We Are All Made of Stars Lyrics
Growing in numbers
Growing in speed
Can't fight the future
Can't fight what I see

People they come together
People they fall apart
No one can stop us now
'Cause we are all made of stars

Efforts of lovers
Left in my mind
I sing in the reaches
We'll see what we find

People they come together
People they fall apart
No one can stop us now
'Cause we are all made of stars
People they come together
People they fall apart
No one can stop us now
'Cause we are all made of stars
Slow slow slow, come come
Someone come come come
Someone's come come
Someone's come
Even love is going round
You can't ignore what is going 'round
You can't ignore what is going 'round
You can't ignore what is going 'round

Slowly rebuilding
I feel it in me
Growing in numbers
Growing in peace

People they come together
People they fall apart
No one can stop us now
'Cause we are all made of stars
People they come together
People they fall apart
No one can stop us now
'Cause we are all made of stars
People they come together
(People they come together)
People they fall apart
(People they fall apart)
No one can stop us now
(No one can stop us now)
'Cause we are all made of stars
(We are all made of stars)
'Cause we are all made of stars
(People they come together)
Cause we are all made of stars
(People they fall apart)
'Cause we are all made of stars
(No one can stop us now)
Cause we are all made of stars
(We are all made of stars)
'Cause we are all made of stars
(People they come together)
'Cause we are all made of stars
(People they fall apart)
Cause we are all made of stars
(No one can stop us now)
'Cause we are all made of stars
(We are all made of stars)
'Cause we are all made, 'cause we are all made
(People they come together)
'Cause we are all made, 'cause we are all made
(People they come together)
'Cause we are all made, 'cause we are all made
(People they come together)1Embed
