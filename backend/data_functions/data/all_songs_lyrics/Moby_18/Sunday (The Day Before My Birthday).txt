Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday) Lyrics
Sunday was a bright day yesterday
Dark cloud has come into the way

They sing to the darkest night
Long before

Why can't I face it
Am I too blind to see
Why did he go
Why did he leave me

Sunday was a bright day yesterday
Dark cloud has come into the way

Why can't I face it
Am I too blind to see
Why did he go
Why did he leave me

Sunday was a bright day yesterday
Dark cloud has come into the wayEmbed
