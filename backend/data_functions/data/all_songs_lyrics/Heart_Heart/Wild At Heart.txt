Wild At Heart LyricsI never cry in front of strangers
How could they understand me?
When in the night I follow rivers
That take me down to the sea
And I walk straight into the water
Let the waves undress me
Dance through the wind until I shiver
Only the moonlight over me
No, don't let me hide
Let me hold you
You know I'm so wild at heart
But so lonely too
And I keep dreaming wide awake
Oh, I keep dreaming wide awake
And I keep dreaming wide awake
I know I'm dreaming wide awake
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
