20K Feet Under Lyrics
Raiding on your heart like a wrecking ball
Just to drag you in the dark in the deepest hole
You’re crawling underground like your legs are numb
And you don’t know what to do and you yell

But it’s radio silence
There’s no one you can touch
You feel radioactive
Imploding in the face of truth
Seems you’re running out of things to lose

But if the world is hard on you
Please let me take you away
It’s just what I’m meant to do
It’ll never change
When it’s too much for you
Remember I feel the same
I know you I know you

Digging in your heart yeah your love is gold
When you can’t make any sense of the things you’re told
You’re diving in the dark in the deep unknown
And you don’t know what you’ll find in the end
Cause it’s radio silence
There’s no one you can touch
You feel radioactive
Imploding in the face of truth
Seems you’re running out of things to lose

But if the world is hard on you
Please let me take you away
It’s just what I’m meant to do
It’ll never change
When it’s too much for you
Remember I feel the same
I know you I know youEmbed
