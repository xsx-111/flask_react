4U LyricsSometimes I wish that I could hide away
The scars and wounds that I got before
Like nothing ever made a difference
For every time I got carried away
I jumped so high to crash on the floor
But I'll start over and over
Oh, for you
I know I'll do it for you
Oh, for you
Sometimes I felt I had to run away
And through the years keeping to myself
I've closed too many doors
Been holding back what I was meant to say
Ignored my heart burning through my chest (But)
I'll try harder and harder
For you
I knew I'd do it again
I know I'll do it for you
For you
I know I'll do it again
I know I'll do it for you
I know I'll do it for you
I know I'll do it again
For you
Do it againEmbed
