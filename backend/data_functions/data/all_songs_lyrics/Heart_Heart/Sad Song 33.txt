Sad Song 33 LyricsTake a chance
Let it pop up like a rainbow
Keep dancing through the rain
And we’ll never be the same no
Look around
Feels like nothing’s ever real
But who can really care for truth
I guess my heart breaks
Every beat comes crashing through
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaks
I guess my heart breaksEmbed
