Sad Song 77 Lyrics
Spend everyday like I’m breathing for you
It can’t be real but I’m bruising for you
And I
Keep it down
Can’t say your name without longing for you
It must be really confusing for you
So I
Keep it down

But my love is real my heart is true
I’ve spent my whole life looking for you
My love is real my heart is true
I’m spending my time hurting for you
My love is real my heart is true
I’d spend my whole life waiting for you
Cause my love is real my heart is true
Oh

Can’t close my eyes without crying for you
With all the sleep that I’m losing for you
But I
Keep it down
Cause you’re running I imaginе
I could stop you now
You’re hiding but I’m thinking
I should hold you now
It’s not a fancy in my mind no
Oh not a phase to put aside no no no

But my lovе is real my heart is true
I’ve spent my whole life looking for you
My love is real my heart is true
I’m spending my time hurting for you
My love is real my heart is true
I’d spend my whole life waiting for you
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is true
My love is real
My heart is trueEmbed
