Over U Lyrics
I knew you would try to get back at me
A look in your eyes and I’m on my knees
Breathing is hard when you’re next to me
Every word that I say seems unnecessary
I’m sorry I gave up tonight
I’m dreaming I’m flying away
The air is cool
The stars so bright
I’m dreaming
I’m dreaming I’m with you

I can’t get over you
Can’t get over you
No I can’t
I can’t get over you
Can’t get over you
No I can’t

Waking up late in the morning
Maybe tomorrow I’ll feel nothing
Changing my ways everyday trying harder
But I keep on looking back at you
Oh, I see your face every morning
I open my eyes but I keep dreaming
Oh-huh-huh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-huh-huh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

I can’t get over you
Can’t gеt over you
No I can’t
I can’t get over you
Can’t gеt over you
No I can’t
