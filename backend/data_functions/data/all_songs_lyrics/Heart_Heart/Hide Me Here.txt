Hide Me Here Lyrics
The coldest tears on my face
They’ll turn to ice real soon
Spend so much time on the chase
Of ideals I can’t hold on to
I see the strangers outside like
Distorted shadows on the walls
And I get overwhelmed when I hear the
Whitewashed words that I’m told

Seems that I can’t get away
Yet I’m moving on
Cry a river everyday
Yet I’m holding on to you
Seems that I should I runaway
Yet I’m keeping on
Try to take another day
As I’m holding on to you
As I’m holding on to you

Can’t stop the fire in my heart
It’ll turn to ash real soon
The noise is tеaring me apart
Please keep mе safe and sound
And hide me here
Just you and me
Oh hide me here
In your heart baby
The world is crazy
Please hide me here
Right in your heart
In your heart baby
And hide me here
Just you and me
Oh hide me here
In your heart baby
The world is crazy
Please hide me here
Right in your heart
In your heart baby

Seems that I can’t get away
Yet I’m moving on
Cry a river everyday
Yet I’m holding on to you
Seems that I should I runaway
Yet I’m keeping on
Try to take another day
As I’m holding on to you
As I’m holding on to youEmbed
