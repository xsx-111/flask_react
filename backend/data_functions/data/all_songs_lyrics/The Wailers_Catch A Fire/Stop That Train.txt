Stop That Train Lyrics
Stop that train: I'm leaving - today!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - anyway!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

All my good life I've been a lonely man
Teaching my people who don't understand
And even though I tried my best
I still can't find no happiness
So I got to say

Stop that train: I'm leaving - any day, now
Stop that train: I'm leaving - don't care what you say!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
Said, it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Some going east; and-a some going west
Some stand aside to try their best
Some living big, but the most is living small
They just can't even find no food at all
I mean, stop it

Stop that train: I'm leaving - leaving, mm-hmm
Stop that train: I'm leaving - I don't mind!
Stop that train: I'm leaving. And I said
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong

Stop that train: I'm leaving â€“ leaving!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - can't take it!
Stop that train: I'm leaving - got to be better!
It won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong
I said it won't be too long whether I'm right or wrong 2Embed
