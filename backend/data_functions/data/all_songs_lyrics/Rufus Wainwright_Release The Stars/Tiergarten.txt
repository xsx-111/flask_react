Tiergarten LyricsWon't you walk me through the Tiergarten?
Won't you walk me through it all, darling?
Doesn't matter if it is raining
Won't you walk me through it all?
Even if the sun, it is blazing
Even if the snow, it is raging
All the elements, we must conquer
To get to the other side of town
I have suffered shipwreck against your dark brown eyes
I have run aground against your broken down smiles
Believe me when I tell you I have no place to go
But to go where the wild flowers grow and the stone gardens bloom
Won't you walk me through the Tiergarten?
Won't you walk me through it all, darling?
Doesn't matter if it is raining
We'll get to the other side of townEmbed
