Release the Stars LyricsWhy do you keep all your stars in
From your studio on Melrose Avenue
You have locked all your assets up
In lifelong contracts to you
Didn't you know
That old Hollywood is over
Oh can't you see all the good that
Celebrity can do for those in the dark
Yes of course I am speaking in
Metaphors for something more in your heart
Didn't you know
That old Hollywood is over
So why not just release the gates and let them all come out
Remember that without them there would be no Paramount
No paramount need to hold on to what isn't yours
Release the stars
The more that you fight then the more
They will scrutinize and realize just your size
And believe me you are no match
For the public that has seen the whites of your eyes
Didn't you know
That old Hollywood is over
Old Hollywood is over
So why not just release the gates and let them all come out
Remember that without them there would be no Paramount
No paramount need to hold on to what isn't yours
Release the stars
Release the stars
Release your love
Release the stars
Release your love
'Cause Hollywood is over
Why do you keep all your stars in
From your studio on Melrose AvenueEmbed
