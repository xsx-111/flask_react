Cowboy Song LyricsSee one thousand eyes forget the starry skies
Leavin' you
Every sunny path's a bitter aftermath
Leavin' you
So would you kindly shut the door
It's strange to think I needed air before
Then shut down the world
And stay within four walls
Please shut down the world
And stay within these four walls
Just one look at you I'm finished wanting to
Challenge God
So I made my heart a home of elements so strong
We'll never feel the cold
And if God should come to call
I'll leave the curtains drawn
Won't make the slightest sound
'Til He's out o' town
And our secret tune remains
And we're done failing death
Then shut down the world
And stay within four walls
Please shut down the world
And stay within these four walls
And stay within these four wallsEmbed
