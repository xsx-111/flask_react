Not Ready to Love LyricsI'm not ready to love
I'm not ready for peace
I'm givin' up the dove to the beast
I'm not ready to surrender
To another glove murderer
I'm not ready to love
I'm not ready to fly
I'm givin' up belief in the sky
So you can take my sin
In up above on high, say goodbye
I'm not ready to love
I'm not ready to love
(Not ready to love, not ready to love
Not ready to love, not ready to love
Not ready to love)
I'm not ready to love
Until I'm ready to love you
The way you should be loved
Until I'm ready to hold you
The way you should be held
You should be held
But I'm not ready to
(Not ready to love)Embed
