Low Grade Happiness LyricsI pray for the power to stay in love with you
I pray for the power to stay in love like you're supposed to be able to
And you may be the cause of this
Yes you may be the cause of this low grade happiness
Thus you must behave when you're faced with the way I operate
Be brave when I'm facing away from you and I don't want to cooperate
'Cause you may be the cause of this
Yes you may be the cause of this low grade happiness
You're a sweet unlikely savior of a human falling star
Yes you are
(spoken)
And it didn't work out
But at least we gave it a shot
You're a sweet unlikely savior
Yes you areEmbed
