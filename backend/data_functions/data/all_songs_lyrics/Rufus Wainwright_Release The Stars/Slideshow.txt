Slideshow LyricsDo I love you because you treat me so indifferently
Or is it the medication
Or is it me
Do I love you because you don't want me to rub your back
Or is it the medication
Or is it you
Or is it true
And I better be prominently featured in your next slideshow
Because I paid a lot of money to get you over here you know
And if I am not prominently featured in your next slideshow
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Do I love you or is this feeling just a little pain
A treasure chest is broken, easily open
And usually I am such a happy prince
Behind the Iron Curtain yeah
The city walls
A southern prison
And I better be prominently featured in your next slideshow
'Cause I paid a lot of money to get you over here you know
And if I am not prominently featured in your next slideshow
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Do I love you
Do I love you
Yes I do
Do I love you
Yes I do
Do I love you
(If you need me to)
Yes I do
Do I love you
Yes I doEmbed
