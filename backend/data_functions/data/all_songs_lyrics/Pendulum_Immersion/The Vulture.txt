The Vulture Lyrics
It's the rise of the vulture
I feed on the panic
All those who are nervous
Who lost the dynamic
If your pride's been poisoned
If your heart is sour
Hear the sound of the war drums

We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)

It's the rise of the vulture
Gonna keep on climbing
No chance of escape
No use in hiding
Through the eye of the storm
With a silver lining
To the point where it breaks
Gonna keep on grinding

(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
(Overboard)
(Under pressure)
(Overboard)
(Under pressure)
(Overboard)
(Under pressure)

We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)
We're taking the power
(We're taking the power)Embed
