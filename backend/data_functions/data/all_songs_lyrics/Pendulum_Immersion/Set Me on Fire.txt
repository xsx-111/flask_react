Set Me on Fire Lyrics
So take me up
We're going on, going on
So take me up
We're going on, going on
So take me up
We're going on, going on
So take me up
We're going on, going on
We're going on without you

Well I met soundbwoy while crossing the border, 'cross the border
Rank and thirsty and blind, you must be out of order, out of order cause
Well I met some boy while crossing the border, 'cross the border
Rank and thirsty and blind, you must be out of order, tell him again
We're going on without you
Rank and thirsty and blind, you must be out of order, tell him again
We're going on without you
