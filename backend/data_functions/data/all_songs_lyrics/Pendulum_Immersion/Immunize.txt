Immunize Lyrics
We go forth and multiply
Nerves are shaking from the daggers and light
We go forth and multiply
Nerves are shaking from the daggers and light

We'll be there on the slope
When you're coming to die
We'll be there getting low
When you're ready to die
We'll be there on the slope
When you're coming to die
We go forth and multiply
Nerves are shaking from the daggers and light
We'll be there on the slope
When you're coming to die
We'll be there getting low
When you're ready to die
We'll be there on the slope
When you're coming to die
We go forth and multiply
Nerves are shaking from the daggers and light

We go forth and multiply
We go forth and multiply
We go forth and multiply
We'll be there on the slope
When you're coming to die
We'll be there getting low
When you're ready to die
We'll be there on the slope
When you're coming to die
We go forth and multiply
Nerves are shaking from the daggers and lightEmbed
