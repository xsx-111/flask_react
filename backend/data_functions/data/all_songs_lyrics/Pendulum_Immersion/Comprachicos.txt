Comprachicos Lyrics
Manipulation doesn't shape me
I am just filling the bottle out
And, even though this glass restrains me
I can't see anything to yell about

Well, I could fight this, but I may die
And all I want is to be the apple in your eye
Well, I could stay here, strap on my face
Listen to the ones that put me in my place

I am a serial fantasy-destroyer
And you wanna know what I'm gonna do about it?
You thought that my hands were behind my back
Thought I didn't have the nerve to

Throw it away
'Cause I've got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go down
Throw it away
'Cause I've got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go down
I am a reality invention-fighter
At war against your constant manipulation
All this time, you thought that I believed you
The more you say, the easier to

Throw it away
'Cause I've got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go down
Throw it away
'Cause I've got the patience
To see that you drown
To watch you go downEmbed
