Watercolour Lyrics
*Beep* *Beep* *Beep* *Beep*

When I'm fallin' down
Will you pick me up again?
When I'm too far gone
Dead in the eyes of my friends
Will you take me out of here?
When I'm starin' down the barrel
When I'm blinded by the lights
When I cannot see your face?
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me out of here
Take me out of here

All I believe
And all I've known
Are being taken from me
Can't get home
Led to a world
Where worlds collide
Let the fear collapse, bring no surprise
Take me out of here
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me

Just stay where you are
Let your fear subside
Just stay where you are
If there's nothin' to hide

(Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me)
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
Feed the fire, break your vision
Throw your fists up, come on with me
