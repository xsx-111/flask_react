Under the Waves Lyrics
I lie still as the water
But my visions are broken
Head caught in the tide as
Cruel as the ocean
Dreams are made in the distance
I will not be among them
The silence is killing me
And I can hardly touch the ground

I am deep in a river
Waves above my head
Held with no spirit
We descend
We reach the end

I am deep in a river
Waves above my head
Held with no spirit
We descend
We reach the end

I am deep in a river
Waves above my head
Held with no spirit
We descend
We reach the end
We descend
We reach the end2Embed
