Self vs Self Lyrics
If I struggle a lifetime
What would my body be?
An empty shell
On which a demon fed
Could be a heavy burden
To stay true to your words
Speak up
I wanna silence everything

If I got no plan
Doesn't mean that I get what I want for free
If I got no meaning
Would you force me to a place where I make sense
Cause nothing lasts forever

How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If I can't find myself?
It's so completely fake
How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If even you can't help?
Dark nights on my soul
I deny failure
I ignite
Woe is on my misery
She wins all their eyes
Realise what defies our fate
This is not me, this is me
So if I struggle a lifetime
What good would that do?

If I got a plan
Doesn't have to stop the feeling inside
If I do make sense
Would you drag me down?
Cause nothing lasts forever

How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If I can't find myself?
It's so completely fake
How do I get home?
Everything revolves around me
If even you can't help?
Dark nights on my soul7Embed
