Crush Lyrics
I was running out in the cold light, wondering where to go
To run away, without you
All my fear is coming home
Handing scripts out for the show
You can't be me, I will become you tonight

I was wandering under black skies
Clutching at what is mine
No control left to lose
Well, I thought that it wouldn't faze me but I'm running like a child
I feel so guilty, I'll make it up to you tonight

Creatures I’ve been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return as abusers

I was breaking out of my old skin, choking upon release
I'm in no state to judge you
Scratching itches best left alone, chasing memories I used to own
I can't wait 'til this is over tonight
The creatures I’ve been dreaming are coming down
They're changing my future
Visions I had buried underground
Return as abusers

Well, the nightmares I've been having have arrived
They're changing my future
Sirens of my creation at my door
How could you do this to her?10Embed
