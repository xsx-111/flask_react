The Thin Line Between Love and Hate Lyrics
When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any costs
At what price life is lost
At what point do we begin?
Fighter spirit, will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road?

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame on society these days
But what kind of good or bad a new generation brings
Sometimes takes just more than that
To survive, be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what, we'll never change
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between being a genius or insane
At what age begin to learn of what way out we will turn?
There's a long and winding road and the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a grey place between black and white
But everyone does have the right
To choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever
The thin line between love and hate
The thin line between love and hate2Embed
