Out of the Silent Planet Lyrics
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are

Withered hands, withered bodies
Begging for salvation
Deserted by the hand of Gods
Of their own creation
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above
You are guilty
The punishment is death for all who live
The punishment is death for all who live

Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation

The killing fields, the grinding wheels
Crushed by equilibrium
Separate lives, no more disguise
No more second chances
Haggard wisdom, spitting out the bitter taste of hate
I accuse you
Before you know the crime, it's all too late
Before you know the crime, it's all too late

Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are


Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation
Out of the silent planet
Dreams of desolation
Out of the silent planet
Come the Demons of creation

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are

Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are
Out of the silent planet
Out of the silent planet we are1Embed
