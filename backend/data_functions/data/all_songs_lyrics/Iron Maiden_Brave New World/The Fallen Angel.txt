The Fallen Angel Lyrics
Azazel's beside you and he's playing the game
Demons are inside you and they're making their play
Watching and they're hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready and take over your mind

You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Beaten, fallen Angel but I've risen again
And the power is inside me, I've decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and it's coming my way
It's an honour to be chosen and I wait for the day

You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the only one
You and only God would know
What could be done
You and only God will know
I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of my world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one

Could it be it's the end of our world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
Could it be it's the end of the world?
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all on my own
'Cause I am the chosen one
