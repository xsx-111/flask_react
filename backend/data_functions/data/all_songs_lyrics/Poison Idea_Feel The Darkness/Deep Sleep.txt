Deep Sleep LyricsClose my eyes a dormant theme
Open my mind i start to dream
In this state i like it best
My escape my precious rest
Sinking deeper
Going down
Somnambulate
Across town
Now i lay myself to sleep
A world of hate at my feet
This is my own privacy
No one comes in here but me
When i’m awake
Wish i were dead
I’m lethergic
Back to bedEmbed
