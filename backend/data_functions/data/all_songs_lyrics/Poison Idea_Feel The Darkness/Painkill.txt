Painkill LyricsSit in my room. Stare at the floor
Sick from the poison, but still wanting more
Daydream delirium. 80 proof sweat
Battle with the bottle, but I haven't won yet -
Have I yet begun to fight
As the day melts into the night
Internal persecuter pulling on my spine
Apologizing for occupying my time
Subhuman operator operating my brain
Liquify confusion pour it down the drain
I feel I'm insane, I must kill the pain
I must dump this load, I feel I'm explode 
Another lost weekend started today
Another painkiller holds my demons at bay
Sit in my room. Stare at the floor
Sick from the poison, but still wanting more
Daydream delirium. 80 proof sweat
Battle with the bottle, but I haven't won yet -
Have I yet begun to fight
As the day melts into the night
Another lost weekend started today
Another painkiller holds my demons at bay
The voice in my head just won't go away
Don't play with insanity cos' it don't playEmbed
