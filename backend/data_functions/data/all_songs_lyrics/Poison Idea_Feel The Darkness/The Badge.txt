The Badge LyricsYoung and dumb, truth and justice fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off, then you look away
Do you think this corruption will ever stop?
What makes a person want to be a cop?
Ran a red light, storm his house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry?
Pick up a hooker, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
Sworn to serve and protect, forget the killing
Badge-wearing fascist villain
Pissed on the street, you bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry?
The badge means you suck, a child lays there dead
As you look back what goes through your head?
Some still call him pig
Some still call him pig
Young and dumb, truth and justice fantasy
Fresh out of the academy
Five-time loser bust his head, make your day
Unless you're paid off, then you look away
He burned a flag, storm the house and bust the guy
Do you like to see his children cry?
Ran a red light, take her for a little ride
But get sucked off on the side
The badge means you suck, a child lays there dead
As you look back, what goes through your head?
Talk to them, you can work it out
You better not even try it
Make a play for his gun
They'll kill you, say it was a riot
Riot!
