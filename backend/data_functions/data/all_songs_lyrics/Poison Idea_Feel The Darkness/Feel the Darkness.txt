Feel the Darkness LyricsYou walk the streets cuz of your bad habits
Wash the past with another hot rinse
Meet a man who'll make your dreams come true
Your worst nightmare has just begun for you
From the fire into the water
Cold nighttime makes my blood get hotter
Steel shines handcuffs in the moonlight
Feel the darkness, now you're one of us
At midnight my blackheart's fading (blue)
A sad description, five feet minus (two)
I can't think about running back to (you)
You started with nothing,but you ended up with less
Feel the darkness
The whip cracks, it stops,but where not through
Tonight haha steel shines just for you
From the fire into the water
Cold nightime makes my blood get hotter
(Guitar solo 8x)
I heard your story and i saw your headline
The details put a chill down my spine
You try to call me, from a long distance phone
I'm out on the dancefloor baby, standing..
I'm standing all alone
At midnight my blackheart's fading (blue)
A sad description, five feet minus (two)
I can't think about running back to (you)
You started with nothing,but you ended up with lessEmbed
