Taken by Surprise LyricsOf all the torment I've been through
I never knew hell till I met you
Your imperious aura, your needs understood
You wouldn't tell me the truth if you could
But in the back room, a garden of delight
Cut through the bar just like a fist fight
For a moment I thought I saw something in your eyes
That's when I was taken by surprise
Soul of washrag, show no sadness
Face of poker, show no fears
Overwhelming, you show no mercy
Mediocre, show no tears
Now this party's crazy, I gotta go
But before I leave, I gotta know
That night in the room full of violent screams
When you whispered me your secret dreams
As we both laid there on the floor
You said it takes two to start a war
For a moment I thought I saw something in your eyes
That's when I was taken by surprise
Soul of washrag, show no sadness
Face of poker, show no fears
Overwhelming, you show no mercy
Mediocre, show no tears
For a moment I thought I saw something in your eyes
That's when I was taken by surprise
Soul of washrag, show no sadness
Face of poker, show no fears
Overwhelming, you show no mercy
Mediocre, show no tearsEmbed
