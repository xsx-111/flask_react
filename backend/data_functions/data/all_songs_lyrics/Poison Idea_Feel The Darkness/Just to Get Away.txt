Just to Get Away LyricsQuit my job, told my boss to stand aside
Grabbed a gun, a fifth of booze, jumped in my ride
I got my girl, she's sixteen and she's really special
I can't slow down, I've got a date with the devil
Two tons of steel, one hundred miles an hour
No looking back, grooving on the power
Responsibility made me quit
I'm sick of this motherfucking goddamn shit
There's a road, beyond it lies, I don't know
I just gotta run, I just gotta go
No looking back,  the power
I, I never sang a love song
And I never owned a car
But I've never met a machine who would drive me this far
I'm not gonna listen to a word you say
I'm leaving in the morning, just to get away
I can't stand myself for just another day
I'm leaving in the morning, just to get away
