Runway Lyrics
The way it feels to fly
The way it feels to fly
Runway, runway, runway

They'll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won't be about who was wrong who was right
Like fireflies emanating the light
Just you and I universally tied
There's truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Cause to fly gotta have no fear

First they love you, like ooo it’s just you
And then they bait you and try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let 'em bring you down
Remember there's only one you
And there's a God up above you
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

Let love be your runway
There is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

There's a band of color that reflects the love you have inside
And you will discover there is solace though you’re terrified
And I promise there is truth for those who really want to hear
If you wanna touch the sky and fly you’ve got to have no fear

First they love you and then they judge you
And try and chain you and then they drain you
You can push through it stay the same you and
Never let 'em bring you down
Remember there’s only one you
And here's a God up above you (True)
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to

Let love be your runway
There is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
(Baby I'm your runway)
Win the race, let love be your runway

Runway, runway...
(Let love be your runway)
Runway, runway...
(Let love be your runway)
Runway, runway...
(Let love be your runway)
Runway, runway...
(Let love be your runway)

Let love be your runway
There is a higher place (higher place)
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
(Feeling when you're rising)
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway
