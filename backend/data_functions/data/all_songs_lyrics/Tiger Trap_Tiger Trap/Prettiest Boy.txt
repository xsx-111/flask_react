Prettiest Boy LyricsOut of my window
I see such a sight
I am watching someone who might see me
He might look at me with those eyes
And then look in once more
Beauty like nothing that i've seen before
He looks like a girl but i know he's a boy
Pretty long eyelashes
I have a pineapple crush on a boy i don't know
Where he came from or how he got skin just like snow
He's the angel i asked for in my prayers last night
He's the only one who can make my wrong life right
'cause i know he was sent here just for me
Beautiful vision is stuck in my heart
I wish i could tell him but don't know where to start
I will remember that face in my mind
Not like another that i will ever find
Watching him drink from his bottle
I'll keep that bottle forever
Pineapple crush and a boy i don't know
Where he came from or how come his angel eyes glow
He's the vision that i saw in my dream last night
He's the only one who can make my wrong life right
I know that he sat there just for me
I know that he sat there just to be with me1Embed
