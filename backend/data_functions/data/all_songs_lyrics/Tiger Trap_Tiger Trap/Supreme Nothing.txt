Supreme Nothing LyricsTired of the things I do so bad at but I do
Lamest thing about it is I don't hear there from you
How come I am trying to recapture your attention
I accept the moment you somehow forgot to mention
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
How can you pretend that I have never been your friend
Worst thing you could do is not to tell me in the end
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
I've got things to say to you, but like you really care
You make me into nothing, floating in the air
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
Supreme nothing, oh yeah
Supreme nothing, oh yeahEmbed
