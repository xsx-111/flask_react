Eight Wheels LyricsBruises and scabs
From my head to my toes
(take you forever  ?) let's go
Eight wheels tonight
Eight wheels are alright
Come to a crack and you fall to the ground
Into the pebbles and that's not ( )
Eight wheels tonight
Eight wheels are alright
Eight wheels tonight
Eight wheels are alright
( )
Dustin' my wheels off
There's no place to go
Eight wheels tonight
Eight wheels are alright
Eight wheels tonight
Eight wheels are alrightEmbed
