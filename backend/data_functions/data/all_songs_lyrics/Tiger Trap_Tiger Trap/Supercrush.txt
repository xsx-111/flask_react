Supercrush LyricsWhen you said you loved me
My eyes lit up like a firefly
I know you meant what you said
And that's enough to get me by
So I say
Would you be with me in my dreams
In my dreams
Be with me in my dreams
When I hear your lovely voice
When you're talking on the telephone
You say you want to be with me
But I know I have to be alone
So I say
Would you be with me in my dreams
In my dreams
Be with me in my dreams
I've got a supercrush on you
Because you take my breath away
I've got a supercrush on you
Because i think about you night and day
So won't you be with me in my dreams
In my dreams
Be with me in my dreams
Won't you be with me in my dreams
In my dreams
Be with me in my dreamsEmbed
