My Broken Heart Lyrics
Not the heart that I wear around my neck
And not the one that I wear upon my sleeve
And not even the one that I drew upon your hand
With a marker around the time I first said I loved you

My broken heart

You made shapes with your fingers in the air
Of your heart which you said belonged to me
It used to be sweet, but now it's bitter to my taste
I loved you, and now that's gone away

How could you do something so ugly when you had
Just said you loved me moments before?

My broken heart

The first time's the hardest is what I've been told but
I wouldn't know 'cause all it feels like to me is
The end of my world and the end of the heart
That I said would never be broken by you
The tears on my face made me even bolder
As I run away from you forever
Do you still have the heart painted red
That I pulled from my pocket and gave with my love

My broken heart
My broken heartEmbed
