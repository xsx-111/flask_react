Words And Smiles LyricsJump so high
Dressed in white
I'd write you letters
But I'm just too shy
Snowy paths on a mountain
Would you throw your penny in my fountain?
I won't tell you
But if you only knew
Words and smiles and
We're like a dream come true
Cutie pie
Seeing white
Look in your eyes
But it's in your mind
Sweet dreams of you when I slumber
I got your P.O. box number
I won't tell you
But if you only knew
Words and smiles and
We're like a dream come true
Words up
And up
So high
Up to the snow
So white like your trousers
Jump so high
Dressed in white
I'd write you letters
But I'm just too shy
Snowy paths on a mountain
Would you throw your penny in my fountain?
I won't tell you
But if you only knew
Words and smiles and
We're like a dream come true
Dream come true
Dream come trueEmbed
