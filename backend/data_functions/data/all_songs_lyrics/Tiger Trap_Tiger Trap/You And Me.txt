You And Me LyricsBees are buzzing up in my head
I'm trying to think of all the things that you have said
Now I'm finding the words to say
But the springtime takes me so very far away
I just might love you
Forever
If it was raining
It would be better
Shade me from the sun
Around the day
Hold me in your arms
And always say
You can be my only one today
'Cause you and me
And me
Bees are buzzing around my head
I'm trying to think of all the things that you have said
Now I'm finding the words to say
But the springtime takes me so very far away
I just might love you
Forever
If it was raining
It would be better
Shade me from the sun
Around the day
Hold me in your arms
And always say
You can be my only one today
'Cause you and me
And me
You and me
You and meEmbed
