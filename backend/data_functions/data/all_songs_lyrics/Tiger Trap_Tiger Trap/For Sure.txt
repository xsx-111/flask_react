For Sure Lyrics
I won't pretend to like her
'cause I'd never lie to you
That's more than I can say for her
And I know that's nothing new
She's lying like a rug
I know that's nothing new
Lying like a rug
Is what I'd never do

I'd rather be without you than be
Anything like her
Someday you'll wake up
And stop loving her for sure
I'd rather be without you than be
Anything like her
Someday you'll wake up
And stop loving her for sure

Until then I'll settle for
Not seeing you alive
'cause I won't do the things she does
I don't want the things she's got
Don't want the things she's got
I'm everything she's not
Don't want, don't want
Don't want the things she's got
I'd rather be without you than be
Anything like her
Someday you'll wake up
And stop loving her for sure
I'd rather be without you than be
Anything like her
Someday you'll wake up
And stop loving her for sure

I'd rather be without you than be
Anything like her
Someday you'll wake up
And stop loving her for sure
I'd rather be without you than be
Anything like her
Someday you'll wake up
And stop loving her for sure
Stop loving her for sureEmbed
