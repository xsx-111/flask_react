In the Mood LyricsI'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
If you want me too
Oh, I can make you dance
I can make you sing
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
If you want me too
Oh, I can make you dance
I can make you sing
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
If you want me too
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Little song that you wanna to sing
Any song will do
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Little song that you wanna to sing
It's up to you
Little song that you wanna to sing
Any little song that you wanna to sing
You're blue
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood
I can write it on the door
I can put it on the floor
I can do anything that you want me for
If you want me to
Do it right, do it wrong
'Cause a matter of fact, it'll turn out to be strong
If you want me to
If you want me to
Oh, if you want me to
If you want me to
If you want me toEmbed
