Lively Up Yourself (live) LyricsLively up yourself and don't be no drag
Lively up yourself, 'cause reggae is another bag
Hey, lively up yourself and don't say no
You lively up yourself cause I said so
Hey, you rock so, you rock so, like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so, dip thru my door
You come so, you come so, oh yeah
You skant so, you skant so, and-a I can assure you
You can lively up yourself and don't say no
Hey, you lively up yourself, can you dig it?
Hey (you rock so, you rock so), like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so, can you dig it?
You lively up yourself and don't be no drag
You lively up yourself, 'cause reggae is another bag
Hey, lively up yourself
Lively up yourself, other bag
Can you dig it? Can you dig it? ...Embed
