Turnaround LyricsWalk around my life
Keep your money in your hand
Look out where you're heading, Momma
Don't go running blind
Shine lights strung out
Keep your ear right to the ground
Watch out now, the strange cats
When the strange cats prowl around
Keep your eyes wide open
Hold your head up high
You are not a stranger here
So much changes inside
Holding out for fortune
She would lend a helping hand
Do not turn your back on the lady
When the lady comes around
Don't turn around
Just look away
Don't turn around
Just look away
They're dancing down Main Street
In the streets, they do the Stroll
There ain't no time to look around
Step inside of every hole
No one cares about the fool
Who likes to find the gold
And sacrificed his soul
Don't turn around
Just look away
Don't turn around
Just look away
Baby, it's up to you
When you know you got it
Baby, it could be true
Babe, you know you lost it

Your mind is in control
Just bide your time a second more
And smile before you go
Stop awhile to count the tears
And view it from afar
The pain of love is put aside
With time to heal a star
Don't turn around
Just look away
Don't
Baby, it's up to you
When you know you got it
Baby, it could be true
Babe, you know you lost it
I've got it
You've got it
We've got it
They've got it
Everybody's got it
Keep your money in your hands
Oh no, I don't know
I don't know
I don't knowEmbed
