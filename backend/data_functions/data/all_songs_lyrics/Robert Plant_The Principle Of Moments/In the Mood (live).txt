In the Mood (live) LyricsI'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood for a melody
I'm in the mood
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
If you want me too
Oh, I can make you dance
I can make you sing
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
If you want me too
Oh, I can make you dance
I can make you sing
I can make you dance
I can make you sing
If you want me too
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Song will do
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Little song that you wanna to sing
Song for you
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Any little song that you wanna to sing
Happy or blue
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood

Do anything that you want me of
If you want me to
Do it right, gonna do it wrong
'Cause a matter of fact it'll turn out to be strong
If you want me to
If you want me to
Oh, if you want me to
If you want me to
If you want toEmbed
