Stranger Here... Than Over There LyricsDown, down, down
Always make the same mistakes again
Down, down, always down
Always make the same mistake
Talk is cheap, but you're talking fast
Never take the time to think of where it will end
Walking tall, don't look back
I don't know which way it's gonna lead me, baby
I try so hard, but I can't understand
Lead me, baby
Just help me get my feet on the ground
Down, down, down
Wanderin' through the places that we both used to go
Round, round, always round
Chase me and sedate me now, but don't let me go
Restless sleep, locked in my lonely room
Empty arms are waiting for the morning to come
In the deep where my dreams come true
Take care now, keep you now, but lead me, baby
I try so hard but I can't understand
Lead, me baby
Oh, but help me get my feet on the ground
Yes, help me
Oh, help me, baby
Oh, help me
I can't stay down for too long now, babe
I can't stay down for too long now, baby
No, yeah, whoa yes
If I'm crying
Well, it's, it's 'cause I'm lonely
You know I'm only ever lonely without you
If I cry well, it's 'cause I'm lonely
'Cause I can be so lonely, I can be, I can be, I can be
Push, push, push, oohEmbed
