Other Arms LyricsLay down your arms
Oh, now baby, let me sleep at night
Lay down your arms, baby
Oh, I'll make everything all right
Words you've been using, hurting me so
Some day you're gonna regret
Way friends are talking, I guess you'll never know
This battle ain't been won yet
Lay down your arms, baby, oh, oh
When the deal is done
Lay down your arms, child
Used to be your only one
Weapon you're using is hurting me bad
What do you hope to achieve?
Fussing and fighting is leaving me sad
That's not the way it should be
So, if I find a love, oh
If I find a way, oh
If I find a dream, oh
If I find a way
You know that I will
Yes, you know
Lay down your arms
Oh, please release me, let me go
Lay down your arms, baby
Now surrender to me, don't you go
If I find a love, oh, oh
If I find a way, oh, oh
If I find a dream, oh, oh
If I find a way
You know that I
You know that I
You know I will, you know
Oh
She's gone, she's gone
I'm not a prisoner of the big parade
She's gone, gone, gone man, gone
I'm not a prisoner on the big parade
She's gone, she's gone
I'm not a prisoner on the big parade
She's gone, she's gone
No I'm not, no I'm not
Oh
Oh, my baby's gone
Lay down your arms
I don't know where I'm gonna find her
'Cause my baby's gone
Lay down your arms
Is she over here?
Is she over there?
Is she any place I know?
Oh, I gotta find her
Is she here?
Is she there?
I really wanna know
I wanna find her
Lay down your arms
Lay down your arms, child
Oh, just lay down your armsEmbed
