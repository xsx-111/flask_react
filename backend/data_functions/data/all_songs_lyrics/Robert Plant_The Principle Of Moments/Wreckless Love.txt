Wreckless Love LyricsNow red is urgent, green's a let-off
And the score shows just another spin off
Orange jolts and brown is old
Grey is weary, don't touch gold
In the fireworks, away from the heat
Behind closed doors, away from the street
No-one is listening, at least that's what you think
There's a slow fuse burning much faster than you think
White, the new look, all that matters
Blue, the last one back in the shadow
Purple reach around, yellow know
Silver is warning, don't touch gold
Dance through the coloured razzamatazz
Spinning along, the desert effect
Wreckless love is creeping on you
Now watch out, wreckless
'Cause wreckless love will drive you crazy
It will wear your mind out
Creeps up on you when you don't know
It will find out
Wreckless love, wreckless love
Wreckless love, wreckless love
Race with my heart to the top of a kiss
Drive my desire, but take care not to risk
Breaking my heart, for it's all that I own
All I command in these times I'm alone
Other arms that held me so tight
Slip through my mind with you in the night
Feelin' wreckless, feelin' wreckless, wreckless loveEmbed
