Horizontal Departure LyricsAnd you said you'd never leave me
In fact, you said you'd be my only one
You said you'd never grieve me, baby
For things you do when you were only having fun, fun
You said you'd cry a river
I thought you'd never cry a river of tears
You'd rather die than live without me, baby
But little girl, you're so insincere
You know you count your blessings
But now I find that you were counting sheep, counting sheep
And then I try to court your feelings
I caught your eye and then you caught my cheek
All the prisoners come to  now
And there you stood so proud, the apple of my eye
You said you'd never leave me, baby
But little girl, that's the reason why
Whoa, that's why I have to leave you all alone
Whoa, that's why you have to leave me all alone
Let's go collect our prize now
So entertaining, we were number one, number one
The judge is hypnotized now
But after all we bought the fool for so damn long
So face the crowd and take a bow now, bow now
'Cause one more time and it will all be done
'Cause I must have been a show to you now, baby
My next performance has just begun
Whoa, that's why I have to leave you all alone
Whoa, that's why you have to leave me all alone
Whoa, that's why I have to leave you all alone
Whoa, that's why you have to leave me all alone
Oh, stop and think for a minute, baby
As they bring the curtain down
Another drink, then another, maybe
A toast to nothing wrong
I chose the style, the duck, and the weaving we were famous for
And here's to him, and here's to yours and
You can thank me for the floor
Whoa, that's why I have to leave you all alone
Whoa, that's why you have to leave me all alone
I don't know, so you turned around and found another fool
I don't know, so you turned around and found another
I don't know, so you turned around and found another fool
I don't know, so you turned around and found anotherEmbed
