Magic Lyrics
I got a coin in my palm
I can make it disappear
I got a card up my sleeve
Name it, and I'll pull it out your ear
I got a rabbit in my hat
If you want to come and see
This is what will be
This is what will be

I got shackles on my wrists
Soon I'll slip 'em, and I'll be gone (Slip 'em and be gone)
Chain me in a box in the river
And I'll rise singing this song
Trust none of what you hear (Trust none of what you hear)
And less of what you see
This is what will be
This is what will be

(Slip 'em and be gone)
(I'll cut you in half)
I got a shiny saw blade (Shiny saw blade)
All I need's a volunteer
I'll cut you in half
While you're smilin' ear to ear
And the freedom that you sought's
Drifting like a ghost amongst the trees
This is what will be
This is what will be
Now there's a fire down below
But it's coming up here
So leave everything you know
Carry only what you fear
On the road the sun is sinkin' low
There's bodies hanging in the trees
This is what will be
This is what will be1Embed
