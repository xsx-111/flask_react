Long Walk Home Lyrics
Last night I stood at your doorstep
Tryna figure out what went wrong
You just slipped something into my palm, and you were gone
I could smell the same deep green of summer
Above me the same night sky was glowing
In the distance I could see the town where I was born

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey, pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
A long walk home

In town, I pass Sal's grocery
Barbershop on South Street
I looked in their faces
They're all rank strangers to me
Well Veteran's Hall high upon the hill
Stood silent and alone
The diner was shuttered and boarded
With a sign that just said, "Gone"

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey, pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey, pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
Here everybody has a neighbor
Everybody has a friend
Everybody has a reason to begin again
My father said, "Son, we're lucky in this town
It's a beautiful place to be born
It just wraps its arms around you
Nobody crowds you, and nobody goes it alone"
"Your flag flying over the courthouse
Means certain things are set in stone
Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't"

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk homeEmbed
