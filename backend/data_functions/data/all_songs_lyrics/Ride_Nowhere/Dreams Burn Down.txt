Dreams Burn Down Lyrics

Lying under sky laughing at everything I say
And pulls me under, there's no time to resist
Lying on the floor the tears are falling down and more
Her eyes speak loud but actions speak the best

Waiting, hoping for a sign
That what's forbidden can be mine
I just want what I can't have
'Til my dreams burn down and choke me every time

She's effortlessly cool but circumstances can be cruel
And sometimes you must accept that you can't get what you want
We fill up our days and nights, we fill up the gaps in our empty little lives
But we know we are doomed the moment we walk out the room

Waiting, hoping for a sign
That what's forbidden can be mine
I just want what I can't have
'Til my dreams burn down and choke me every time1Embed
