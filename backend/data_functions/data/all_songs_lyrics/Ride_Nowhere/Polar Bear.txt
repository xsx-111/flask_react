Polar Bear Lyrics
She knew she was able to fly because when she came down
She had dust on her hands from the sky, she said I touched a cloud
She felt so high, the dust made her cry

She knew she could fly like a bird but when she said
"Please raise the roof higher" nobody heard, they never noticed a word
The light bulbs burn, her fingers will learn

Ah, a-ha, a-ha
Ah, a-ha, a-ha

Why should it feel like a crime? If I want to be
With you all the time, why is it measured in hours?
You should make your own time, you're welcome in mine


She knew she was able to fly because when she came down
She had dust from her hands on the sky, she said I touched a cloud
Her fingers will learn, the lightbulbs burn
Ah, a-ha, a-haEmbed
