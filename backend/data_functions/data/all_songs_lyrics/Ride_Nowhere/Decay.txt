Decay Lyrics

We have short time to stay
Our night is slipping far away
Caught up within bad memories
Our growth seems certain to decay

Now this feeling's so alive
But, as you or anything, we die

We die, we die

Let's stay here for a while
Eyes so round and bright we gently smile
Live for this moment, not the past
Why do we always fall so fast?

Now this feeling's so alive
But, as you or anything, we die

We die, we die, we die, we die
We die, we die, we die, we die
We die, we die, we die1Embed
