Seagull Lyrics
My eyes are sore, my body weak
My throat is dry, I cannot speak
My words are dead

Falling like feathers to the floor
Falling like feathers to the floor, ah

You gave me things I'd never seen
You made my life a waking dream
But we are dead

Falling like ashes to the floor
Falling like ashes to the floor, ah

Definitions confine thoughts, they are a myth
Words are clumsy, language doesn't fit
But we know there's no limit to a thought
We know there's no limits

Now it's your turn to see me rise
You burned my wings, but watch me fly
Above your head

Looking down I see you far below
Looking up you see my spirit glow, ah
