Vapour Trail Lyrics
First you look so strong, then you fade away
The sun will blind my eyes, I'll love you anyway
Thirsty for your smile, I watch you for a while
You are a vapour trail in a deep blue sky

La la la la, la
La la la la, la
La la la la, la
La la la la

Tremble with a sigh, glitter in your eye
You seem to come and go, I never seem to know
And all my time is yours as much as mine
We never have enough time to show our love

La la la la, la
La la la la, la
La la la la, la
La la la love
