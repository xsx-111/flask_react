In a Different Place Lyrics

Blowing bubbles lying down waiting for the rain to fall
Laughing at the people, wonder why they always rush, never slow down

And we're smiling when we're sleeping
And we're smiling when we're waking

Even if the rain falls down and all the sky turns cold I will feel fine
Thunder roared and lightning flashed, but you and I were in a different time

And we're smiling when we're sleeping
And we're smiling when we're waking

Floating in and out of time, in and out of space
No one else can touch us now, we're in a different place
