Kaleidoscope Lyrics
I know that you are thinking 'bout me now
I can feel it but I don't know how
When I'm gone you will see so clear
That I left some words unspoken here

All these words that I have said float around you, fill your head
All the times we laughed and cried, I never thought I'd leave you behind

I don't want you to understand
You will never hold me in your hand
I don't want you to see my face
When I fade away and leave this place

All these songs that fill my head dance around you when I'm dead
All the love I ever knew, kaleidoscopes around to you


All these words that I have said float around you, fill your head
All the times we laughed and cried, I never thought I'd change your mind
All these songs that fill my head dance around you when I'm dead
All the love I ever knew, kaleidoscopes around to youEmbed
