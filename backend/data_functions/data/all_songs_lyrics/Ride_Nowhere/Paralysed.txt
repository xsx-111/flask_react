Paralysed Lyrics

Catch me in another dream, I'm pulled away
Hold me, gently take me through another day

However hard I try, I crawl when I should fly
I wander through my days, pulled a million ways

Help me feel the forces I can't touch, I'm reaching out
Help me to learn until I know too much, I'm still without

These circles pulling near, hold me in my fear
And sleeping I can't hide, I'm paralysed inside

Paralysed, paralysed, paralysed, paralysed
Paralysed, paralysed, paralysed, paralysed
