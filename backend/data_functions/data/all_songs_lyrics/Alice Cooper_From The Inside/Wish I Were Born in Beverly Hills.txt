Wish I Were Born in Beverly Hills LyricsShe looked so sleek and sassy
Rolling down Rodeo Drive
She got her daddy's black Corniche
And her tennis pro by her side
And she wants her mother's lover
To exercise her skill
And if she don't score him fast
She knows that her brother will
Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills
I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills
I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills
Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills
She says that she's an actress
Just never got a part
Now she's a teenage mess
With a burned out Gucci heart
She cracked one day at Cartier
When things came to a head
They put her trinkets away
And wrapped her up instead
Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills
I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills
I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills
Be a gigolo lover and send her the bills
She bit like a dog and she screamed like hell
"You ain't taking me to no padded cell
You better take all your hands off my high priced tail"
Oh I wish I were born in Beverly Hills
I swear I couldn't drink half as much as she spills
I want to live it up get my kicks and thrills
Be a gigolo lover and send her the billsEmbed
