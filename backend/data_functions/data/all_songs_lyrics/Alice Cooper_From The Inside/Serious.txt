Serious LyricsWhen I look back at my time at the track
And I played and I played and I played and I was
Shooting the craps at the back of Fat Jack's
Come on fade me Jake
I'm a Las Vegas dreamer they took to the cleaners
A bath what a bath what a bath I'd take
A fish on a hook I was rattled and shook 'cause I lost my stake
I took that serious
All of my life was a laugh and a joke
And a drink and a smoke
And then I passed out on the floor
Again and again and again and again and again
I'm a gambling fool with a roll and a cue
Wanna play wanna play wanna play with me
Put my ass on the line rubbed my nose in the grime
And they picked me clean
The chance and the game drove Old Silkly insane
What a pain what a strain on my brain it was
A fish on a hook I was rattled and shook 'cause I lost my stake
I took that serious
All of my life was a laugh and a joke
A drink and a smoke
And then I passed out on the floor
Again and again and again and again and again
Serious it was serious oh so serious
Serious it was serious oh so serious
All of my life was a laugh and a joke
A drink and a smoke
And then I passed out on the floor
Or a friend
Again and again and again and again and again
All of my life was a laugh and a joke
A drink and a smoke
And then I passed out on the floor
Or a friend
Again and again and again and again and again and again
And again and again and again and again and again
And again and againEmbed
