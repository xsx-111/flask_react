Nurse Rozetta LyricsI'm a shepherd for the pentecost
I got my scriptures and my wires crossed
I got no kids and I got no home
They want us holy men to live alone
Since I've been here for a little stay
I see Rozetta day by day
She turns my head makes me cough
I want to tear my collar off
I just can't sleep at night
Rozetta dressed in white
She's got the Devil's light
Shining in her eyes
Screamed my sermon damning sin and vice
When underneath I was a regular guy
My pulpit melted like a block of ice
When a bolt of lightning hit me from the sky
From my stretcher when they wheeled me in
I stared directly in the eyes of sin
Nurse Rozetta standing over me
And I was helpless as a man of God could be
Nurse Rozetta I won't let her
Catch me peering down her sweater
Fantasizing silk suspenders on her thighs
Nurse Rozetta make me better
Secretly my eyes undress her
Let me feel your tongue depressor
I'm suddenly twice my size
My pants are all wet inside
She's so creative with a bar of soap
And so inventive with a stethoscope
To check my pulse she gotta hold my hand
I blow the fuse on the encephalogram
Satan sent her from the bowels of hell
I should have recognized old Jezbel
I surrendered to the urges felt
She popped the buckle on my bible belt
I just can't sleep at night
Rozetta dressed in white
She's got the Devil's light
Shining in her eyes
I'd lick her nylon seams
Like a hungry cat with cream
Oh what a vivid scene
And I can't hold back no moreEmbed
