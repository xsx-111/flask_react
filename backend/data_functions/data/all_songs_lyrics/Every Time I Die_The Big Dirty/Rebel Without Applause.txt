Rebel Without Applause LyricsHey
Sound the bells and take to the streets in arms
We're descending fast, a pox on your house of cards
Dry your eyes, your daughters have lost their faith
And started feeding upon the bait that we wear on our sleeve
Promise us you won't tell the public the fury with which we despoil
I've got a wife and kids and a hybrid car
I've got a good life and I can't risk losing
If you can keep it a secret then me and the boys will bring pale hell to this town
We're trouble bound and we summon the devil electric
Prey on the faint of heart
We sing praises of the rebels who went by the book
Gravitate to teenagers' artlessness and sing it aloud
The content is trivial
Its pillow talk plagiarized by the gadgets of lust
Just go to sleep, leave the gestures and customs to us
Cry fraud and let play the anthem of war
Cry fraud and let play the anthem of war
Boys, stand your ground
Keep delicate fingers but wrath in your white knuckled grip
The film is loaded and it's aimed at the whites in their eyes
You put out to get in
And we slipped right past the guards
In the belly of a horse
We sunk our fangs
Into the pulp of a desperate angst
We're powerless just until we're invited inside
If you can keep it a secret then me and the boys will bring pale hell to this town
We're trouble bound and we summon the devil electric
Prey on the faint of heart
We owe thanks to the revels who went by the book
Don't give up the ship
Don't give up the ship
We'd rather sink than admit it
Don't give up the ship
We only have one night in town
We only have one night in townEmbed
