No Son of Mine LyricsWe've drained full confession booths
Polluted drinking wells with our repentances and then stood
Grinning with our arm around shoulders of a rotting child
Hold that pose
Provisional, arrogant little pigs who devour their siblings
Shoot that dog if we can't afford to feed
Shoot that dog if we can't afford to feed
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Famine fathered a moth
Famine fathered a moth that begot our fathers
Keep your voices down, I'm sneaking out
Hey! What's the big idea?
Keep your fucking hands off the insight
That rat has got its mother's eyes
That rat has got its mother's eyes
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Breeding ad nauseam
They are pouring themselves into the sea
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Stop, thief
Leave your drunken accident at the prom
It'll grow to mend your broken heart
Don't sign the dotted line
(Every house is a little bit of Hollywood)
Don't sign the dotted line
(Every house is a little bit of Hollywood)
The world is too incredible
To bring such ugliness into it
The artist is sneaking down the hall
To impregnate the last of its kin
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)
Indiscernible mute
In a swarm of derivatives
I deny any part
I deny any part
Deadbeat Godfather
Deadbeat Godfather
Deadbeat Godfather
Deadbeat Godfather
Bite your tongue
Who taught you those words?
Blaspheme
When you are under my roof
Don't ever say "rock and roll"
Don't ever say "rock and roll"Embed
