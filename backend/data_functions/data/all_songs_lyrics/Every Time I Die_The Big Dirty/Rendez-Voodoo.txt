Rendez-Voodoo LyricsYou'd better shove another piece of what's
Left into your mouth while the gettin's good
'Cause you know the highs are running low
And every new is gettin' old
Lord, I've been down
Since you been seein' another boy
Me and my girl are gonna smoke the cigarettes that we find in another man's tray
We're gonna pick all the meat from the big city bones
Because the hot is gettin' cold
Lord, I'm not proud
Keep your chin up, the water will boil
The comet will come for us all
Make amends with anything you've ever loved
And open your arms to the swarm
We have salted the earth
Raid hell, raid hell
We have salted the earth
Raid hell, raid hell
You'd better drink up, get your sorrows in
'Cause we're coming upon where the ending begins
The nickel city's new church says "no one allowed"
Since all the lights are going out
The end is near, I will be delivered
We've filled our bellies with so much repulsive flare
I'll explode if I'm not forgiven
Make amends with anything you've ever loved
And open your arms to the swarm
We have salted the earth
Raid hell, raid hell
We have salted the earth
Raid hell, raid hell
You'd better get it while the gettin' is good, corner boy
You know the highs are running low
You'd better shove another piece of what is left into your mouth
We need to learn to go without
There is no plan for the dutiful
We dried the county making room for our grave
But my time is sure taking its time running outEmbed
