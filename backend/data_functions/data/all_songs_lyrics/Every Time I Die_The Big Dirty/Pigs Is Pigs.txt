Pigs Is Pigs LyricsOh Lord, I am saved
Judge says I am fit to swing
'Bout time I have prayed
My woman just might wear my ring
Oh, you know I'm no good
You know I'm no good at court-ordered goodbyes
But when I'm gone you'll see I'll be a better man yet
For the disposition, take it back into your arms
Better keep me close to your heart
You better keep me close to your heart
The defiant had me cornered in a store
And it let me walk out the front door
At the scene of the crime
Hang 'em high
Keep your vows brief
Let 'em swing
Make 'em swing 'til it hurts
And if you still believe
That men guilty of love can't survive
Then hang 'em high or not at all
Oh no
(Oh no)
Oh no
Oh, you know it gets hard
It just gets so hard going limp in your arms
I am clutching a smoking gun
There is no chance of me walking out of here alive
This is all very literal
I can't bring myself around to write an excuse this time
We're liberated by the hearts that imprison us
We're taken hostage by the ones that we break
Throw the book
Throw the book
Throw the book
Throw the book
You had me strung up by the tail and you put me back
Hang 'em high
Keep your vows brief
Let 'em swing
Make your swindle an art
And if you still believe
That men guilty of love can't survive
Then hang 'em high or not at all
Where did you get the privilege to pardon me?Embed
