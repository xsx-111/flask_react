Leatherneck LyricsMarched from a burning ship
Into a rained out parade
With a bottle and a Bible
The dregs are armed to the teeth
We trade distinction and praise
For the tedious claim
That we were wed in the trenches
While college boys pine for loveless exchange
And we carry fragments from detonated eyes
Embedded under our bones
We've spilled blood for the sake
Of fitting skin to the frame
But our money is no good here
And our memorial has veered off the road
The locals will bury my wandering eyes
At the docks of the potters field
Where the rifles of ranking men are equipped with twenty-one silencers
At 'em boys
Give 'er the gun
At 'em boys
Give 'er the gun
I'm the richest man in town
I'm the richest man in town
Faith, stand down
Give your wings to the boredom that resurrected my soul
Crash the car
If the motor won't turn over, glory be to God
Jumped from the disloyal waves
Back up to the bridge
Renounced the warmth of the turbulent grave
I found blood on my lips
From a covetous kiss
And I hope that my home tips its glass to itEmbed
