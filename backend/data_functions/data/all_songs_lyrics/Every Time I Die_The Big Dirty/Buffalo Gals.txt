Buffalo Gals LyricsWe're making habits out of vanities and gospel for the stalls
The less you breathe the more you see of it all
The lion's share is courting the teen, one hand holds them back while the other is holding me
We don't connect but we're both disconnected
Woah, oh yeah, we're so in love or else we're waving
Unloaded guns in the air
But it's the same thing, ain't it?
I'm only here to give you someone to leave when you get bored
But the first mistake's so good it'll only ensure another
Woah, oh yeah, you look so good or you're just saving
Your flaws for the tight lipped lover
But it's the same thing, ain't it?
We're lost
Profound
And we are bound by the secrets we keep from each other
We're lost
Profound
And we are bound by the secrets we keep from each other
Pick up your heels or dig them in
It doesn't matter when the void is ravenous
It's too late for us now anyway
It's too late for us now
It's too late for us now
This confession is a lost cause
We are damned before we arrived
We're making habits out of vanities and gospel for the stalls
So grab your old lady and dance into the breach
Yeah, let's dance one more time into the breach
Woah, oh yeah, we're so in love or else we're waving
Unloaded guns in the air
But it's the same thing, ain't it?
Divine light sparks from a severed wire
So we hit the town like our parachutes failed
Divine light sparks from a severed wire
So we hit the town like our parachutes failed
We're lost
Profound
And we are bound by the same dichotomyEmbed
