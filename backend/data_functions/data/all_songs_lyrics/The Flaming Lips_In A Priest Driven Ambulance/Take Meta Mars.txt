Take Meta Mars Lyrics
Yeah, Because when I drive in my car
We put heads in jars
So take me please, take me to mars
I want to go where they are
I want to go

Yeah, and if I'm lost, well I don't care
Because I walk on endless stairs
You say it's me, I think it's you
Who can blame us for thinking the way we do
Because we don't care what we are

Take me please, take me to mars
Take me to marsEmbed
