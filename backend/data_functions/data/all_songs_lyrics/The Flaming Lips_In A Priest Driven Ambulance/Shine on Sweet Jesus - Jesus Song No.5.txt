Shine on Sweet Jesus - Jesus Song No.5 Lyrics
Waiting for my ride
Jesus is floating outside
(shine on, sweet Jesus, on me)
Watching the water rise
I'm getting lost in the tide
(cry all your teardrops on me)
While I'm still myself
Your blankets covered me
Covered me while I was still asleep

Watching the planets shine
Reflecting yourself in the sky
(shine on, sweet Jesus, on me)
Scraping these smiles of mine
Impossible one at a time
(cry all your teardrops on me)
While I'm still myself
Your blankets covered me
Covered me while I was still asleep

Jesus is at my side
Wondering what he will find
(shine on, sweet Jesus, on me)
Watching the water rise
I'm getting lost in the tide
(cry all your teardrops on me)
While I'm still myself
Your blankets covered me
Covered me while I was still asleepEmbed
