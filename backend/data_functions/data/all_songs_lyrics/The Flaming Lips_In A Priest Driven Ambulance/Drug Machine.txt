Drug Machine LyricsEvery time that we fly together
Our plane blows up in the sky
We're working in an explosives factory
Because we don't care if we die
Everything, everything, everything that I wish
Give us a 20th century Jesus guy
And he could make us rich
You've known me for a million years
And I've been chewed up by all your gears
I don't want to be no one else
I like it here, Because I like hellEmbed
