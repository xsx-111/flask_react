Let Me Be It LyricsLet me be it
Show me how you climb the stairs
Let me be it
Let me see it
Show me how you climb the stairs
Let me see it
Show me how you climb and
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your tidal wave
That flows around you like a million
Drops of summer ray
That flows around you like a million
Tears
Let me be it
Show me how you climb the stairs
Let me see it
Show me how you climb and
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your tidal wave
That flows around you like a milion
Drops of summer ray
That flows around you like a million
Tears
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your conscience, knowing
Let me be your tidal wave
That flows around you like a milion
Drops of summer ray
That flows around you like a million
Tears
Let me be your ray
Let me be the sky above you
Let me be your ray
Let me be the sky above you
Let me be your ray
Let me be the sky above you
Let me be your ray
Let me hold the sky up while you tryEmbed
