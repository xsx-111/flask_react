Mountain Side Lyrics
If I'm standing on your mountainside
And I'm flying through your trees
We're all driving our own heads now
And I'm blessing all your screed
And I'm flying through your mountainside
Dying in your plane crash of love

If I'm driving down your highway
And I'm crashing in your dreams
We're all driving our own heads now
All your lights are never green
And I'm driving down your highway
Crashing through your windshield of love

And if I'm standing on your mountainside
And I'm crashing through your dreams
We're all driving our own heads now
And all your bathroom floors are clean
And I hold your electric toaster while
Standing in your bathtub of love
And I'm flying through your mountainside
Dying in your plane crash of loveEmbed
