What a Wonderful World Lyrics
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed days, and dark sacred nights
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world

The colors of the rainbow
Are so pretty in the sky
It's also on the faces
Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands
Saying, how do you do?
Fairies saying, I love you

I hear babies cry, and I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I think to myself, what a wonderful worldEmbed
