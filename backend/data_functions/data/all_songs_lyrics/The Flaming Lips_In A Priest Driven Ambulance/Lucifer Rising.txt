Lucifer Rising LyricsLucifer is standing on a house of love...
Doing all those things I was dreaming of... he's throwing out some with his golden gloves... well he and I was thinking of a thousand more...
Sinners in style, always breathing!
Madame and I now I'm bleeding!
Why else do we love it we still need it
We still love it we still love it yeah!
Lucifer is standing on a house of love... as if I wasn't waiting from worlds above...
He's boxing out women with his golden glove...he's clean and he's thinking he's rising up...
Sinners in style, always breathing!
Where we loved it now we need it!
Why else do we love it we'll still read it
Why else do we love it why else do I love it, yeah!
Hold on to your feelings
Hold on to your feelings
Hold on to your feelings
Hold on to your feelings
Sinners in style, always breathing!
Where we loved it now we need it!
Why else do we love it we still read it
Why else do we love it why else do we love it
Why else do we love it why else do we love it we still love it we still love it!
(Hark the harold angels sing, fa la la la la la la la la, Glory to the new born king fa la la la la la la la la)Embed
