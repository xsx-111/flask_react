God Walks Among Us Now - Jesus Song No. 6 Lyrics
How does it feel to be breaking apart
Breaking down molecules
How does it feel to out of control
Another ring around this ball
Used to be all right
But things got strange

How does it feel to be falling apart
Sinking from the bottom down
It's not so easy holding it up
With everything falling down

Used to be all right
But things got strange
Used to take all night
But things have changed and God walks among us now

Used to be all right
But things got strange
Used to be uptight
But things have changed and God walks among us now
