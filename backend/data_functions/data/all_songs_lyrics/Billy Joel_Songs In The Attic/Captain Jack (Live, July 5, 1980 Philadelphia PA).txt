Captain Jack (Live, July 5, 1980 Philadelphia PA) Lyrics
Saturday night and you're still hanging around
Tired of living in your one horse town
You'd like to find a little hole in the ground
For a while
Mmm mmm mmm

So you go to the Village in your tie-dye jeans
And you stare at the junkies and the closet queens
It's like some pornographic magazine
And you smile
Ohh whoa whoa

'Cause Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
Ohh, ho ho

Your sister's gone out, she's on a date
And you just sit at home and masturbate
Phone is gonna ring soon, but you just can't wait
For that call
Ohh whoa whoa
So you stand on the corner in your New English clothes
And you look so polished from your hair down to your toes
Awww, but still your fingers gonna pick your nose
After all
Ohh whoa whoa

And Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Ahh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
Ohh, ho ho
Ohh, yeah yeah

So you decide to take a holiday
You got your tape deck and your brand new Chevrolet
Ahh, there ain't no place to go anyway
And hat for?
Ohh whoa whoa

And you got everything, aww, but nothing's cool
They just found your father in the swimming pool
And you guess you won't be going back to school
Anymore
Ohh whoa whoa
But Captain Jack can get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
On Captain Jack you can rely tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
Ohh whoa whoa whoa
Ohh, yeah yeah

So you play your albums, and you smoke your pot
And you meet your girlfriend in the parking lot
Ohh, but still you're aching for the things you have not got
What went wrong?
Ohh whoa whoa

And if you can't understand why your world is so dead
Why you've got to keep in style and feed your head
Well you're 21 and still your mother makes your bed
And that's too long
Ohh whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa yeahhhhhhh

Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Oh, Captain Jack will get you by tonight
Just a little push, and you'll be smiling
Well now, Captain Jack will get you high tonight
And take you to your special island
Ohh, Captain Jack could make you die tonight
Just a little push, and youâ€™ll be smiling
Ohh ohhohh
Ohh ohh ohhhEmbed
