Brundisium LyricsThey married, a dandy and a back alley tough
On the foreshore while kids in the needling rough
Stayed low, in, and laid till they'd had enough
Of the somersaulting hot roll of revolting September
By thickets beneath the hot halo above
The plague bodies bathed in their talentless love
It's hot in the town with its back to the sea
O darling don't put your veil over me
From thinking a life was about them when, long
They were the thorn in its side
The hard men got plucked and by measures were gone
At pride it plucked and out, out it pried
Where's the shame in a gentle man? Stand him next to me
It's hot in the town with its back to the sea
O darling don't put your veil over me
Honey we'll go without, honey grow old and thin
I love you like I love my own skin
From thinking a life was about them but stranger
The soft women lowed and came in and were in
To swoon "O welcome hot united sailor"
Welcome from unsteady decks and from danger
Did you see a new sun in the sky?
The sun is blood and blood is a lie
It's hot in the town with its back to the sea
O darling don't put your veil over me...
Honey we'll go without, honey grow old and thin
I love you like I love my own skin
O my bonny lies over the ocean
My bonny grows old and thin
I love her like I love my own skin...Embed
