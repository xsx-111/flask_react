Little Wonder LyricsWell it's my very little wonder and it's one that I will keep
But you can take it with you if it helps you when you're trying to sleep...
And the men who are a cut above today are often not so very deep
Young ladies of means will say "I am, I am, I am, I am, I am"
Sitting on the edges of their seats on the light rail tram
Amongst the could-a-beens, the also-rans -
It's very little wonder if you cry
It's very little wonder you don't cry
The birds were framed, the babies were framed, and so too the black sky
You can't hear the ready laughter in my song
When I was laughing all day yesterday and all night long
Till we shook off the fears, and had us both in tears
O brother don't clean out your ears and you might be amazed
To find the secrets of the city in its alley ways
In the bins behind the swill cafes
Amid the clean-picked chicken bones and cartilage a spirit groans
A small heart beats and a red beak groans
"O pity, where's my little body gone?"
You'll know why, it's very little wonder you don't cry
Don't be ashamed of a guilty little rain, and don't be ashamed
It's just the drink, it's just the drink, it's just the drink
One marks a place, one makes a time
One stops a'living, one goes about a'dying...
Somebody blew their brains out in this room
I can feel it like it happened just this afternoon
On the wall behind some furniture there's a stain in the shape of Africa
O fear walks tall, when it's halfway up the hill with its friend alcohol
I could hear the heavy footsteps in his hollow halls
Little wonder that he soon devised to rid them all in one great gushing fall
The billion tiny devil's feet that nightly walked that bloody beat
- Hi ho, ho hum, Get yourself a gun
Open up your heart and let the bleeders run
Hi ho, ho hum, Move the thing along
Open up your heart and let the evening come
Hi ho, ho hum, Get yourself a gun
Open up your heart and let the bleeders run
Hi ho, ho hum, Think about your mum
Open up your heart and let the evening come darkly inEmbed
