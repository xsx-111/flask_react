Addle Brains LyricsA Tuesday night in Winter, holed up in the city of ravens
The owls in the hills hoo-hooing and eyeing off the field mice down in the cold grey centre
Addle Brains lining up with the dead for the soup spoon
Addle Brains and the legions of the passed for the bread bag
Ladle the soup, pass the rolls
Addle Brains and the many not here and loose souls
One might fly off to the blank heavens and the lead high halls
O the hungry sky aches for blokes without folks and bulges with the bearers of palls
Addle Brains would drink for four days and no eats
And sleep in the glens of botanical parks, and on the humped bus shelter seats
Where it's cold, where it's cold
One morning I woke up in a room in the nation's heart
And couldn't think for the life of me what I was doing, or where to start
Or what rehearsal was required, I was so sad and tired
What does a bird want with money?
Was he made this way?
Do you have to earn the right to find all of this funny?
Nothing's funny today
Addle Brains mixes his powders with his fateful blues
And the wide-eyed bubs of the Parliament couldn't give a hoot, or even two
All it takes, it takes, is a kind look and a word, a word
Some pretty eyes and skin, from your fine family you were given to win
And spill it over into the basin of common sin
Just a drop, a drop of the stuff that makes us kin
- Addle Brains perching way out on a limbEmbed
