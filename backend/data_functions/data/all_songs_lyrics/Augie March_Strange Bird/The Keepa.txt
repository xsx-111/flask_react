The Keepa LyricsWhat's wrong, sad Prince?
The body is soft, the heart is cold
You were tongue-in' for danger, but danger bites back
It only lays down for the reckless and you weren't never bold
- Think of all you'd never do...
Now it sits next to you on the bus, it joins you in the elevator
Nothing good is kept for later
You should never have let it through to the Keepa
In old Brazil there is a breach upon the earth they call "The Sigh"
Where the gods all hang their washing out to dry
Where strange birds fly, and giants go to die
I heard you went there for the quiet
Well I wasn't asking why
- It was all that you could do...
Now it sits next to you on the bus, it joins you in the elevator
Nothing good is kept for later
You should never have let it through to the Keepa
In the afternoon a weary sun beats a pallor too soon
About the broken tooth hell-mouth of your room
You slide into a sleep, O to dreaming of a sweet talk
To wilt beneath a whisper - "No regrets sad Prince"
- Not for all you'll never do...
Now it sits next to you on the bus, it joins you in the elevator
Nothing good is kept for later
You should never have let it through to the KeepaEmbed
