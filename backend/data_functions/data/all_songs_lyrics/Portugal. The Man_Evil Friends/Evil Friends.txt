Evil Friends Lyrics
Your mama's got nothing on me, your daddy's got nothing on me
And the world that sleeps in its lunacy, it's got nothing on me
No stars got nothing on me, your son's got nothing on me
And the fool who sees it's the thief that leads has got nothing on me

You know it's not because the light here gets brighter
And it's not that I'm evil, I got a friend in the devil
But I can't even be your friend, I can't even be your friend
I can't even be your friend

I can get so wound up, but I feel alright
And if I get some rest, yeah, that'd be nice
When I shouldn't do it, I still do it
What you think's got nothing to do with this
Before you were born, I was already sinning
Yeah, yeah, yeah, when I get too worked up, well I work it out
And if I get too down, I just shout it out
I may not have it all, but the rest will do
And it's nothing against or to do with you
Before you were born, I was already sinning

It's not because the light here is brighter
And it's not that I'm evil, I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend
If you don't listen so good, I can hum it out
Na, na, na, na, na, na-na-na
I know I shouldn't do it, I just do it
And what you think's got nothing to do with it
Before you were born, I was already sinnin'

It's not because the light here is brighter
And it's not that I'm evil, I just don't like to pretend
I could be your friend, I could never be your friend
I never needed a friend, I don't wanna be friends

You'll never find a friend like me2Embed
