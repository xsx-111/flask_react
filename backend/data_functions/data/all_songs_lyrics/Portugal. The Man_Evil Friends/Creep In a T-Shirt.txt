Creep In a T-Shirt Lyrics
I'm sorry, Mr. Policeman
If I wanted to talk I would have called a friend
Don't worry when I get back home
I'll just stay in bed, I'm better off alone
I woke up to my glory days
Never was a child, I was born this way
Always there but always out of place
Feels so alien

I don't know what I know, but I know where it's at
Just because I lost it doesn't mean I want it back
I don't know what I know, but I know where it's at
Just because I lost it doesn't mean I want it back

You don't get it (Get it, get it, get it)
Is it the world I'm living in?
You don't get it (Get it, get it, get it)
I'm just a creep in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care
(Get it, get it, get it)
I'm just a creep in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care

Sorry, but I don't recall the crime
My memory has left me behind
May have been a man, maybe a friend
Or maybe aliens
I don't know what I know, but I know where it's at
Just because I lost it doesn't mean I want it back
I don't know what I know, but I know where it's at
Just because I lost it doesn't mean I want it back

You don't get it (Get it, get it, get it)
Is it the world I'm living in?
You don't get it (Get it, get it, get it)
I'm just a creep in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care
(Get it, get it, get it)
I'm just a creep in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care
(Jeans I don't fucking care)

It's not because the light here is brighter
And it's not that I'm evil
I just don't like to pretend
That I could ever be your friend

Is it the world I'm living in?
I'm just a creep in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care
You don't get it (Get it, get it, get it)
Just a loser in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care
You don't get it (Get it, get it, get it)
I'm just a creep in a t-shirt, jeans, I don't fucking care10Embed
