Plastic Soldiers Lyrics
Everything carries weight, everything is the same
Within us, all together
Everything carries weight, everything is the same
And we are all together
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ohh
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ohh

I can't keep my head up
I'd like to stay by my friend, stay by my friend
But I can't keep my head up
I can't seem to keep my head

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

(Tu-ru-tu-tu) Could it be we got lost in the summer?
(Tu-tu-tu) Well, I know you know that it's over
(Na-na-na-na) But you're still there, treading water
(Tu-ru-tu-tu, tu-ru-ru)
(Tu-ru-tu-tu)
(Na-na-na-na) But you're still there, treading water
Can't keep my head
Can't keep my head
I can't keep my head

I'd hate to seem so shallow
I'd like to get deeper in, swim deeper in
But I can't find the water
I can't seem to find my way

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

(Tu-ru-tu-tu) Could it be we got lost in the summer?
(Tu-tu-tu) Well, I know you know that it's over
(Na-na-na-na) But you're still there, treading water
(Tu-ru-tu-tu, tu-ru-ru)
(Tu-ru-tu-tu)
(Na-na-na-na) But you're still there (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

I can't keep my head up, I can't keep my head up
I can't keep my head up, I can't keep my head up
I can't keep up (Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)
I can't keep my head up, I can't keep my head up
I can't keep my head up, I can't keep my head up
I can't keep up
But you're still there, treading water

(Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)

Could it be we got lost in the summer?
Well, I know you know that it's over
But you're still there, treading water
(Treading water)

You can drift along, you've got the time
The rest of us will live and die
Like plastic soldiers
Only growing older
You can drift along, you've got the time
The rest of us will live and die
Like plastic soldiers
Only growing older
You can drift along, you've got the time
The rest of us will live and die
Like plastic soldiers
Only growing older9Embed
