Smile Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I don't need to talk about the world alright
I just want to sleep with a smile tonight
I don't want to talk about the hungry people
People down and out, sleep when the sun goes down
When I wake up early in the morning
I don't watch the news, I just wake up with a smile by you
And I don't want to talk about the war
I just want to smile and smile some more

We watched the sun come up
But take it down, to hide it
Seems like the spring has come and gone
Felt like forever
I don't want to talk about the world alright
I just want to sleep with a smile tonight
I don't want to talk about the hungry people
People down and out, sleep when the sun goes down
When I wake up early in the morning
I don't watch the news, I just get up with a smile by you
And I don't want to talk about the war
I just want to smile and smile some more
Well, I feel fine, I feel good
That's what happy people do, and how are you?
Well, I feel fine, I feel good
That's what happy people do, and how are you?

Let's watch the sun come up
To take it down, and hide it
Seems like the spring has come and gone
It felt like forever
We'll watch the sun come up
To take it down, and hide it
It seems like the spring has come and gone
It felt like forever

Until the summer comes then, you'll find me there

And I'd like to try to forget that times
Have changed and we all live and die
Plastic soldiers
Never growing older
I'd like to try to forget that times
Have changed and we all live and die
Plastic soldiers
Slowly growing older
I'd like to try to forget that times
Have changed and we all live and die
Plastic soldiers
Slowly growing older
And I'm sorry for the love you lost today
But I'll thank you for the love I made today
I'm sorry for the love you lost today
But I'll thank you for the love I made today
I'm sorry for the love you lost today
But I'll thank you for the love I made today
I'm sorry for the love you lost today
But I'll thank you for the love I made today
I'm sorry for the love you lost today
But I'll thank you for the love I made today3Embed
