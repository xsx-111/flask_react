Hip Hop Kids Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I went out to take a walk with my baby daughter
Grabbed her coat from Paris; that one I bought her
And we brought some bread to feed the swans
But they were already gone, they were already gone

Yeah-yeah, the punks are done, fuck those rock n' rollers
All you hip-hop kids think we give a shit, well
We don't, we don't, we don't
We don't, we don't, we don't

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I'm the mother's son, that fuckin' holy roller
And I just stand still
Watch the world grow colder
And I can't change, I can't change
Yeah-yeah, the punks are done, fuck those rock n' rollers
All you hip-hop kids think we give a shit, well
We don't, we don't, we don't
We don't, we don't, we don't

And I got work to do while you
All play with your head in your hands
I'll just lay with my head in my hands
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

I'm not afraid to die
Don't care if I get older
Cry, cry, no, I don't cry
I just take it over, I just take it over

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, you love those rock n' rollers
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, you love those rock n' rollers10Embed
