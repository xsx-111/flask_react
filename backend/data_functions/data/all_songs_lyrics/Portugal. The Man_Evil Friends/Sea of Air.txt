Sea of Air Lyrics
News came today we found a sea of air
When we went back, nothing was there
It towered so tall it nearly left the ground
Still, when we looked, nothing was found
There was nothing out there, no, nothing at all
Nothing but space, nothing but ground
Are the things I want the things I need?
When there's nothing but stars looking back at me

But I'll be brave, I'll be brave, I'll be brave
When the time it comes around
I'll be brave, yeah, I'll be brave
Just let me go now, let me go now

We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world just hangin' out, we got no seed of doubt
We got the whole world hangin' there

When you talk to God about suicide
When you never hear back I hope you're still alive
And the part of you that never cared
You can leave it here, we're in the sea of air
But I'll be brave, I'll be brave, I'll be brave
When the time it comes around
I'll be brave, yeah, I'll be brave
Just let me go now

We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world just hangin' out, we got no seed of doubt
We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world hangin' there in our little sea of air
We got the whole world hangin' there

In our little sea of air, in our little sea of air, in our little sea of air
In our little sea of air, in our little sea of air, in our little sea of air
In our little sea of air, in our little sea of air, in our little sea of air6Embed
