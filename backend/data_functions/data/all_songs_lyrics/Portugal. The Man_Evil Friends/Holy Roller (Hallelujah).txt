Holy Roller (Hallelujah) Lyrics
Another day full of sunshine
Another day in the clouds
Yesterday hit the fork in the road
And that road only leads me home
Another day feeling crazy
I try my best to keep my feet on the ground
I'm always running around and around... alright

You got to divide it if you want to find it
If I can add it you can subtract it

I'm not your holy roller (Yeah-eah-eah)
Hallelujah
I'm not your holy roller (Hell yeah-eah-eah)
Bring a message to ya, hallelujah
My holy roller

You oughta know (Hallelujah)
Yeah, you best believe (Holy roller)
My heart stays at home
But my soul is all alone with me
Another day feeling lazy
Nothing to do I guess I'll do my best
I work all day and sure I get paid
But I could do without the rest, alright

It's harder to find it when everyone hides it
I'm just like an addict, I gotta have it

I'm not your holy roller (Yeah-eah-eah)
Hallelujah
I'm not your holy roller (Hell yeah-eah-eah)
Bring a message to ya, hallelujah
My holy roller

You oughta know (Hallelujah)
Yeah, you best believe (Holy roller)
My heart stays at home
But my soul is all alone with me

I'm not your holy roller (Holy roller)
Hallelujah (Hallelujah)
I'm not your holy roller (Holy roller)
Bring a message to ya (Hallelujah)
My holy roller
You oughta know
Yeah, you best believe
My soul stayed at home
'Cause hell's the only thing in me
Man, hell's the only thing in me
Man, hell's the only thing in me
Holy roller (Yeah-yeah, yeah)
Holy roller, hallelujah
My holy roller, hallelujah
Holy roller, hallelujah

I'm not your holy roller
I'm not your holy roller
Not your holly roller
