Someday Believers Lyrics
Na, na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na
Na, na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na, na

Yesterday has come and gone and we can't forget it
Anyway, we've tried
Take the ride, if we get divided, you and I can't fight it
March along, help me stay in time

We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?
Will you ever learn you're not the only one?
Everybody's got something to hide
Yeah, I got mine


Your love may change, but time will be the only thing you'll save
Don't blame yourself: there's no religion inside them
What can't be learned is trained once you find the end you start again
Just observe the lights that lead the way
We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?
Will you ever learn you're not the only one?
Everybody's got something to hide
And I live with mine

Every day we come along, but it's coming anyway
You can take the wall down, we've still got nothin' on the moon
Everybody knows that no one really knows at all
And that may never change, but I don't mind

Na, na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na
Na, na na na na, na na na na na, na na na na, na na na, na

We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?
We're all just dreamers
Someday believers
Will you, will you ever learn?
Every day we come along, but it's coming anyway
You can take the wall down, we've still got nothin' on the moon
Everybody knows that no one really knows at all
No one really knows at all
That may never change, but I don't mind4Embed
