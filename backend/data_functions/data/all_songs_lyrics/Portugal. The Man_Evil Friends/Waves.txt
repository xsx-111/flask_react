Waves Lyrics
You can't fight a war with nobody to fight back
But if we get to digging to the bottom of the stack
We'll sell it to the youth and you never know, maybe
You'll get back home and you'll see your baby, oh-oh
We'll just act like we care
All we're needing is a reason, it don't need to be clear
Singing songs to the news, it can play to their fears
Someone's got to die and you don't have to love it
But the military's, still, got more in its budget, oh-oh
We always need more next year

No one cares about the waves at the bottom of the ocean
And at the bottom of the ocean it's always blue
No one will remember 'cause nothing lasts forever
And everybody's looking for somebody to use

When you don't bring them home and the war hasn't ended
There's still money there and that money needs spending
The powers that be, we got to do what we do
If they never know it then they'll never feel used, oh-oh-oh
Like I often do
To all the pretty girls out there looking for heartache
Crying, "All I wanted is to be your baby"
And all the pretty girls out there living with heartache
Crying 'cause they're never gonna see their baby, oh-oh
We just act like we care
No one cares about the waves at the bottom of the ocean
And at the bottom of the ocean it's always blue
No one will remember 'cause nothing lasts forever
And everybody's looking for somebody to use

No one will remember 'cause nothing lasts forever
The world is always changing and it's always blue
And it's always blue
