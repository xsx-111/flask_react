Sirens of Your Toxic Spirit Lyrics
What I recall, remember best
Is insanity and the clatter
Misapprehensions are killing you
But not fast enough to really matter

The flume of your struggle is
Flooded with sorrow and it
Poisons everybody near it
I'm not a patron of yours anymore
Don't want to hear it
The sirens of your toxic spirit

Of your addictions and shiftiness
Inherited from your father
I know you struggle to keep them in check
But at this point, why even bother


What friendships you have left do not derive from love
They're just some warped form of charity
I've wounded you and you've wounded you too
At least we can feel good about the parity
