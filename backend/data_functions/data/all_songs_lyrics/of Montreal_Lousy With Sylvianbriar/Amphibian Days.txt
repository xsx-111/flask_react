Amphibian Days Lyrics
In the pen with the mastiffs
Bred to fight rats in the bowels of the arena
I received a kiss without promise
That produced deformities of happiness
The laughter there is viscous
It leaves a residue down the legs of the chairs
Since you lost the will to hear, they
Get your attention grabbing fistfuls of your hair

These amphibian days they will not heel to you
You can't defy the defining flaw of your generation

The heavens vomited the dawn upon us
As we learned how to occupy photographs
She descended a stairway
Composed of silk and flicked her cigarette
As I sweat through my black hex I saw you two climax
In spasms through a frosted window
You both came in electronics, and
Anthemic bursts of unsanitary flames

These amphibian days they will not heel to you
You can't defy the defining flaw of your generation
If this is Tartarus, which of us is Echidna which one Arakiel?
This bastard conveyance of extinct emotions
That we know only in our cells
I labor to tempt you out of your cage and into my patrol
Until this vessel lands I have decided
To ignore all impulse control

These amphibian days they will not heel to you
You can't defy the defining flaw of your generationEmbed
