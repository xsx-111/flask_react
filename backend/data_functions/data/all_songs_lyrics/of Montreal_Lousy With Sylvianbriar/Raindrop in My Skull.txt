Raindrop in My Skull LyricsThere's a raindrop in my skull
I'm too shaky now to get it out
I guess it fell from some far away cloud
Bloated with radiation, ooh
Some people are singing of the birth
Of another soulless drone who'll grow
To leech off the Earth, ooh
My guitar feels strange in my hands
I have almost no tactile perceptions
On the TV there's a Mexican horror film
It isn't dubbed, I'm not really watching, ooh
Some people are singing of the birth
Of another philistine who'll grow
To ravage the Earth, ooh
Last night when you left me
I took a walk through the fog
And the gossamer light of the strawmoon
The haunting strangely humid picture
Of Winter's waning, then my recurring dream of the swarm
There's a raindrop in my skull
I'm too messed up now to get it out
It must've fallen when my mind was somewhere else
Now I'm fixating on itEmbed
