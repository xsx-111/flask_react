Imbecile Rages LyricsYour folks, they are such lovely people
I can't understand where you came from
How long can it possibly take for one to realize that the dream is over?
How many more nights must you just humiliate yourself?

The pollution from your imbecile rages
Is licking at your heels
Blotting red streaks across the desert of my eyes
I have no hope for you anymore
When you said to my woman at the show
That we were just desperately breathing life into a dead ghost
Do you really think these things you say
They won't get back to me?
I guess you feel like you've got this lifetime pass
And you can be a dick and it doesn't matter
But I'm through, yeah, I'm set free
And basically, you're just dead to me
