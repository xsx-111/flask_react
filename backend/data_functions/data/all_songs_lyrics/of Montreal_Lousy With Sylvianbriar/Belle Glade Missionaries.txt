Belle Glade Missionaries LyricsBelle glade missionaries are here to steal your cocaine
You better send your malaria to puncture their brains and
Send them back to where they came from
Send them back to their savannas of disease
From your first psychotic episode
To your drug-induced schizophrenia
It's your dysphoric mania that makes you so likable
And everybody want to save you
Save you just for themselves
They're letting children get blown up in their schools today
So they can get them back into their factories
And though it pains me to see you all being so betrayed
But I guess you'll never know so it doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
My fever must be high because these bitter winter winds
Have made the bones in my jaw go hollow
And there's a sense that there's a prowler on the prairie
Leaving hair on the walls
We helped to flatten the sounds that bound down Delores St
And my greatest fear released into
Someone else's consciousness
And now it's theirs to contend with
Ah, but still there's these razors to pretend with
They're letting children get blown up in their schools today
So they can get them back into their factories
And though it pains me to see you all being so deceived
But I guess you'll never know so it doesn't matter
I have a sense you want to be the female Henry Miller
Cynically referring to your lovers as your pricks and
Exploiting other people's madness
On Nexus you claimed to have called out to me
Telepathically through all archaic mediums
But I never once heard you, so
I think you were just lying again
I feel like I've been Beckett's Molloy-d
Like something nature people avoid
Like all my talent's been destroyed
Like I'm a para-spectral voice
With no choices at the present
Still there's a value in things unpleasant
Well you post naked gifs of your epileptic fits
And keep track of your hits and your friends don't give a shit
And view your fugues with amusement
All the evil in the universe
There are no victims, only participants
They're letting children get blown up in their schools today
So they can get them back into their factories
You know it pains me to see you all being so betrayed
But I guess you'll never know so it doesn't matter
Doesn't matter
Can't trust my instincts lately
They don't feel organic
They feel more synthetic (x2)
More synthetic
Synthetic (x2)Embed
