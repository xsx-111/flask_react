Triumph of Disintegration LyricsThe last ten days have been a motherfucker
I didn't know if I'd survive
The voice with the synapse that calls
Blood bats into action has now entered the tablelands
It's only natural to feel a little imbalanced
It's a symptom of your hysterical need to be understood
You had to forgive your enemy cause it was making you Psychotic to keep fighting him inside of your head
But how could you allow these people that you don't even Respect to rape your self concept and make your
Inner world an ugliness?
Thrashed through the forest like a tormented brute
I had to make myself a monster just to feel something
Ugly enough to be true
And then scratching wildly at the mirror
In my heart to see their doleful faces
What is the flaw in just running away?
Running away fixes everything
How can I, why should I stay?
Just to view the triumph of disintegration?
To live beneath language, or far above
It's really not that different
At least now that the one thing that is good about me
Has begun to express itself in malicious ways
Thrashed through the forest like a tormented brute
I had to make myself a monster just to feel something
Ugly enough to be true
And then scratching wildly at the mirror
In my heart to see their doleful faces
What is the flaw in just running away?
Running away fixes everything
How can I, why should I stay?
Just to see the triumph of disintegration?
Victories of devastation?3Embed
