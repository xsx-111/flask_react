Rivers in Your Mouth Lyrics
Hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know, I've been trying so hard
To keep in time with all of the hours in your day

Hold it in, they wouldn't let you out among the crowd
Not like that these streets will tear you down
How it is, under my skin
Now you are; pictures of all you'll ever be

Oh, I am not myself
Today
I am not feeling
Okay

Hold it in, the river in your mouth is pouring out
Water takes the shape of all that it surrounds
Yeah I know, I've been trying so hard
To keep in time, with all of the sounds that you make

Hold it in they come at you from both sides of your mind
Thick and thin; these walls you'll always stand behind
I'm sick and tired, oh I begged for the world to change
But it don't, it ain't all you and that's the thing
I am not myself today
I am not feeling okay

And you showed me hope amidst the hellequins in spring
And you told me life was learning how to be your friend
