She Treats Me Well Lyrics
Seen fortune in my lifetime
Gave it all to the man instead
Still tomorrow comes, I'm still standing on my own two feet
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Anger, I seen it rise
From a careless word that I said
Well guilt is wasteful, pride is childish
Got a woman at home
She told me that
Got a woman at home
She taught me well

Found sorrow in my mind most times
Gave it all back to the life I led
Well since times change, it all just rolls away
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well

She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now it serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well
Mourning, I've done my time here
Stood here watching my own death
Well a few things going my way this time
Got a woman at home
She treats me well

Slumber, not in my lifetime
Won't spend my days in my bed
Make the whole scene gather round come see it my way
Now I got a woman at home
She treats me well

She's alright
When everyone is wrong
She's alright
Lets me waste another song
Stumble through the years
I'll make it heaven, make it hell
One day to the next for now that serves me very well
Now I've got a woman at home
She treats me well12Embed
