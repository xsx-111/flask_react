Evergreen Lyrics
Christmas flared amongst us
And we called it evergreen
Built a world without your love
And I built it mean
Christmas flared amongst us
And we called it evergreen
Built a world without your love
Now I'm all out at sea

Take me back to the catacombs
I am tempted by her love
Bluest eyes against my own skin
I have never been so caught up
Looking around I see memories
What it was, oh, what it was
There in the crowd you said something
But I can't remember what

And my mother cursed the town
For closing me down
Closing me down
Take me back to the catacombs
I am tempted by her love
Bluest eyes against my own skin
I have never been so caught up
Looking around I see memories
What it was, oh, what it was
There in the lights you said something
But I can't remember what

And my mother cursed the town
For closing me down
Closing me down6Embed
