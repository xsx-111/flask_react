Time Is Dancing Lyrics
Wrapped up in dissonance
I'm sorry that I just walked away
Lost in the insignificance of mine
I had no words to say
Now I am better
I implore you to say it isn't right
But somewhere deep in history
Your father pulled the teeth out of your fight

Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
Me again, all fired up on you

And now she's caught between
What to say and what she really means
Wrapped up in empathy
The chemicals are pushing past my blood
Hold all my cliches
They are tipping my tongue to tell you that it's love

Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again now look who's laughing
Me again, all fired up on you

And now she's caught between
What to say and what she really means
And I am finally coloring
Inside the lines that I live between

Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
You again, all you, all you, all you
Hold it in, let's go dancing
I do believe we're only passing through
Wired again, look who's laughing
Me again, all fired up on you12Embed
