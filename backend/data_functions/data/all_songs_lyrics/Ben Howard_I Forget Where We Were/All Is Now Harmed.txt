All Is Now Harmed Lyrics
As a child it was not there
Not scared of the blood
The creak and the thud inside your chest
Clearly calm I'm keeping terrorised
The ageless thaw of winter
Alone, but by your side
Here in light hung a soft divide
The billowed curtain call
Hold me down
Was I born to lie?
Here at all
Here at all
My fear in lights
All I said comes home
I can't do this alone
Asleep inside
I was born to lie
Now prove me wrong
Prove me wrong

But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harm's way baby
All is now harmed
As a child it was not there
Not scared of the blood
The creak and the thud inside your chest
Clearly calm I'm keeping terrorised
The ageless thaw of winter
Alone, but by your side
My fear in lights
All I said comes home
I can't do this alone
Hold me down
Was I born to lie?
Now prove me wrong
Prove me wrong

But it's in your nature
Blooms inside your blood
Hold me in harm's way baby
All is now harmed10Embed
