In Dreams Lyrics
Always a riddle in the world she said
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing of wonder
The way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me
Yeah it's a big old world indeed
Everyone is killing me and everything conspires

In dreams I have watched it spin
Seen the violent crack of atoms
Where all light comes in
In dreams I have lain in sin
Just to be the cracked and the cared for

How can I ask, ask for more?

Always a riddle in the world she said
Always a riddle inside my head
Always a thing of wonder
The way we come to be
Oh it's a big old place for me
Yeah it's a big old world indeed
Been kicking my heels and wondering how I've been here so long

In dreams I have watched it spin
See a violent crack of atoms
Where all light comes in
In dreams I saw Aesop's kin
Just a carcass of a man now alone inside his skin

Where to, where to begin?

I live alone
I live a lonely life without you
And I may be troubled
But I'm gracious in defeat
And I may be troubled
But I'm gracious in defeat1Embed
