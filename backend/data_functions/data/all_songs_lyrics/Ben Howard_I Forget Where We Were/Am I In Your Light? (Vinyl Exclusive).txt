Am I in your light, babe?
Am I in your light?
Am I forced beside you?
Am I in your heart?

Am I in your light, babe?
Am I in your light?
Am I forced beside you?
Am I in your heart?

All my friends they
Let me know
I've a fickle mind
Before the shows
I've a brittle tongue
It comes and goes
I've a fascination
With all I cannot control

Am I in your light, babe?
Am I in your light?
Am I forced beside you?
Am I in your heart?
All my friends they
Let me know
I've a fickle mind
Before the shows
I've a brittle tongue
It comes and goes
I've a fascination
With all I cannot control

Am I in your light, babe?
Am I in your light?
Am I forced beside you?
Am I in your heart?1Embed
