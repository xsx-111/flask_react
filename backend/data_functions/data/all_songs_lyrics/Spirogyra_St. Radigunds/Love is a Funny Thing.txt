Love is a Funny Thing LyricsI tried so hard
To keep our love alive
To keep you by my side
But the winter and my pride
Dissolved into the Spring
Oh love is a very funny thing
I'm sure you know
And though you lose someone
You keep your soul
The fresh unfaded green
Makes my heart to dream
And the April rain
Washes me clean again
Of the soils that held me down
Oh love is a very funny thing
It lingers on
And a part of me is always here
Love is a very funny thing
It lingers on
And a part of me is always hereEmbed
