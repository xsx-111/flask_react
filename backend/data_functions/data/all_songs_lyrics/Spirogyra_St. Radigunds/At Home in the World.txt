At Home in the World LyricsThough I may whisper words
You don't understand, understand
Though I'm in need of help
You can't lend a hand, lend a hand
To be at home in the world
To be at home in the world
Though I may come and go
It is not from you that I flow
Wild though the world may be
It's inside of me, inside of me
To be at home in the world
To be at home in the world
This is all that a man can need
Cannot you see
This is all that a man can need
Cannot you see
Though I may act unkind
I don't mean to be, honestly
It's just that it's hard to see
The reality, reality
To be at home in the world
To be at home in the world
This is all that a man can need
Cannot you see
This is all that a man can need
Cannot you see
Don't ask me to move away
I will never go
Don't ask me to hide away
I will never leaveEmbed
