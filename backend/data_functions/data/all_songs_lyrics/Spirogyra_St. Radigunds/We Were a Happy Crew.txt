We Were a Happy Crew LyricsHere on our road are gathered we
To see our lives unfolding
Though others stay
We pass away
Just as the tide goes rolling
This is a time of change
A parting of the ways
Though others stay
We pass away
Just as the tide goes rolling
And I'll remember you
Beyond these hopes and these fears
That account for the years
Like the wind in the reeds I will miss you
And I will think of you
When the past comes along
To remind me what's gone
Like the wind in the reeds I will miss you
Can we go back and start again?
Can we go back and start again?
Can we begin where we came in, came in?
Can we go back and start again?
Can we go back and start again?
Can we begin where we came in, came in, came in?
Some travellers passed
As we stopped for a moment in peace
With blood on their fingers
They spoke of a cloud in the East
And we were a happy crew, me and you
We were a happy crew, me and you
Speaking with words
We were sure that the truth had been banned
We'd buried the martyrs
And walked off to work on the land
And we were a happy crew, me and you
We were a happy crew, you and me
Some riders appeared from the sun
As it fell with a blaze
They passed like the wind
And were lost in the dust to the East
And we were a happy crew, me and you
We were a happy crew, you and meEmbed
