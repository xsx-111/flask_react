Cogwheels Crutches and Cyanide LyricsHoly John
Give me food
Tonight I am so hungry
Tonight my eyes are searching for a way
Holy John
Give me shelter
Tonight I am so weary
Tonight my eyes are open wide
Well the first man was a juggler
And his skill was very great
But he said that he was leaving
He said he couldn't wait
And the second came with jewels
That flickered on his hand
As he spoke about tomorrow
As if it were another land
But a lady caught between them
Said she should be free
And they just looked bewildered
And said "Yes, so should we"
"How on Earth," yelled the author
"Does the tale make its sense?
It's alive with a truth
But we must have a proof
How can we open the door?"
Well the next man had religion
It made him very proud
He said he'd found his inner bliss
He said it very loud
But a group of men surpassed him
With science, skills, and speed
They hurled down his conceptions
And dug up all his weeds
The lady, she was worried
She asked if this was wise
"Of course it is
It's logic, brains, and enterprise!"
"How on Earth," yelled the author
"Does the tale make its sense?
It's alive with a truth
But we must have a proof
How can we open the door?"
Well the last man had no number
And didn't say a word
He didn't even answer them
When they said he was absurd
They made him sign a treaty
To give up all he owned
And searched his pockets anxiously
To see if he had gold
The lady was enchanted
And said they ought to see
So they charged her with subversion
And made her watch TV
I'm a man with no future
With no past and no time
And I live for their war
Lord, I live for their war
I won't be back no more
We are fighting a losing battle
No one is winning
No one's beginning
We are looking for something that's missing
Dark all around us
Darkness Surrounding
We are on the doorway of knowledge
Have we the wisdom
Have we the wisdom
La
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
La
La-la-la-la
La-la-la-la
We are fighting a losing battle
No one is winning
No one's beginning
We
Are
Come on  Earth, let me see you smile
You are the ones for me, yeah
You are the ones for me
Come on , let me see you be
You are the ones for me, yeah
You are the one for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
