Tall, Dark Handsome Stranger LyricsI'm so tired of these men trying to impress me with nothing
The same old routine and the smooth fancy talking
Now I know and believe that I found it for real
'Cos you're good and you're kind and you care how I feel
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never satisfied
And I know what I like
And I like what I see in your eyes
You're so beautiful
I've been pushed I've been pulled
I've been put out and trod on
Just by taking my chances I finally caught on
When I see in your eyes all the love shining through
I'm so glad I held out for somebody like you
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never satisfied
And I know what I like
And I like what I see in your eyes
Heaven must have sent you I know
You're so good to me
I feel good with you
I'd be such a fool to let you go
There's something about you
I can't live without you
I've had fast talking good looking men at my door
Now I'm a wiser woman than I was before
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never satisfied
And I know what I like
And I like what I see in your eyes
I had a tall dark handsome stranger
I've had the devil in disguise
I've been attracted to the danger
But I was never satisfied
And I know what I likeEmbed
