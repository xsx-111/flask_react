Cruel Tears LyricsI can't believe you're talking like this
When I still feel your touch and the taste of your kiss
You hang your head down to your knees
With tears in your eyes, you lie through your teeth
Don't you thinking nothing is enough
How can you say, that you're living in love?
Those all cruel tears, to cry now
After all you're the one who is saying goodbye
Cruel tears to cry now
Don't come many closer, I don't wanna look in your eyes
Those all cruel tears
It all was shown the guilty you get
I guess promise is made and not promise is kept
I know now, you're not who you seem
You being a man is just something I have dream
Sweet little tears, sweet little lies
I know you're too well to believe in the skies
Those all cruel tears, to cry now
After all you're the one who is saying goodbye
Cruel tears to cry now
Don't come many closer, I don't wanna look in your eyes
Those all cruel, cruel tears
I just remember, how long the one who was living here
The night is cold and slowly out there
Those all cruel tears, to cry now
Go ahead and walk away, I will survive
Cruel tears, goodbye now
Don't come many closer, I don't wanna look in your eyes, no no
Those all cruel tears, to cry now
After all is you the one who is saying goodbye
Cruel tears to cry now
Don't come many closer, I don't wanna look in your eyes
Cruel tears, to cry now (no no)
After all you're the one who is saying goodbye
Cruel tears, goodbye, goodbye now
Cruel tears to cry nowEmbed
