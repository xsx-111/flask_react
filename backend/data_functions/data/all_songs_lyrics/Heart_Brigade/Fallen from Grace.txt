Fallen from Grace LyricsI pray for the love
That's fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won't wash from my face
I'm left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That's fallen from grace
Every little picture
Hanging on the wall
Every little trace of you
I've found them all
I close my eyes
It's all I can do
Everywhere I look
I see some part of you
Been through every reason
And they all seem to fit
No one's pleaded guilty now
There's nothing to admit
There's no one to blame baby
Once you believe
'Cos people only touch and go
But love will never leave
I pray for the love
That's fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won't wash from my face
I'm left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That's fallen from grace
I'm a little disappointed
I'm a little bit relieved
I feel a little sorry baby
I feel a bit deceived
No no not by you darlin'
I know love's demanding
Live and learning every day
But never understanding
Shattered dream and memories of you
Left hanging over me
A cross to bear
When love cools
A crown of thorns
For the queen of fools
I pray for the love
That's fallen from grace
The tears left behind
Won't wash from my face
I'm left with all these feelings
But nothing fills the space
Of the love that once was
That's fallen from graceEmbed
