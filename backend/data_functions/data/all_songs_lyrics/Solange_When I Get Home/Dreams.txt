Dreams Lyrics
I grew up a little girl with
Dreams, dreams, dreams
Dreams, dreams, dreams
Dreams, dreams, dreams

Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Dreams, they come a long way, not today

Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Dreams, they come a, they come a long way
They come a, they come a long way
They come un-, they come undone
They come a-, they come around

Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Dreams, they come a long way, not today
Sometimes I dream I'm in the four door
Coming down on the slow-mo
Sometimes I dream I go so high by for the ride by
Sometimes I feel I'm going down, down
Sometimes I feel I'm gonna die at times
Got my dreams and my eyes wide6Embed
