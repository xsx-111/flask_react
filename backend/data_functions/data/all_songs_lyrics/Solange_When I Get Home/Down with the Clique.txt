Down with the Clique Lyrics
We were fallin' in the deep
Bathe in the delight
We were rollin' up the street
Chasing the divine, oh

We were down with ya, down with ya
Down, down with ya, down with ya
Down-down-down-down with ya, down with ya
Down, down with ya, down with ya
Down with ya, down with ya
Down, down with ya, down with ya
Down-down-down-down with ya, down with ya
Down, down with ya, down with ya

We were wild and entertained, goin' the whole day
Bound to come undone
Brown and brown
Ooh
What do you take from me?
Will you, will you see? Yeah

We were, we were (Down) down with ya, down with ya
(Down) Down, down with ya, down with ya
Down-down-down-down with ya, down with ya
Down, down with ya, down with ya
(Are you down?)
Down with ya, down with ya
Down, down with ya, down with ya (Are you down?)
We were down
Down-down-down-down with ya, down with ya (Are you down? Are you down?)
Down, down with ya, down with ya (Are you down?)
Down with y-down with y-down
Down with y-down with y-down
Down with y-down with y-down
Down with y-down with y-down
Selling your worth
Down with y-down with y-down
Down with y-down with y-down
Down with y-down with y-down
Down with y-down with y-down
Babe, I come first

Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?
Are you down?4Embed
