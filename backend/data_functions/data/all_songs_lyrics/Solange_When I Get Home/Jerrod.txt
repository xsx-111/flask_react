Jerrod LyricsCall me, baby, say that you want it
Call me, lately, feel that you want it
Give you all the pain that, lately
I've shown you
Give you all the things I've lived through
Fill up, give them the world and
I know you better than them
Give you all the depths of my wanting
Stays to for the rest of the morning
Give you the world that you seem to know
Yeah, I'ma get it
Call me, baby, when you're ready
You got to know that they're not sayin' you can
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know it
You got a lot of static
You've got it in your bones
Call you in your name and you know you gon' get it
Come and say the word and you know you gon' hit it
That's the way that it
That's the way that it
That's the way that it
That's the way that it goes
Give you all the things I want
Give you all the things I want
The, all the
All the, all the, all
I heard a word (Oh, oh)
A word (Oh, oh)
A word (Oh, oh)
A word (Oh, oh)
Oh, baby
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby
Oh, oh, baby3Embed
