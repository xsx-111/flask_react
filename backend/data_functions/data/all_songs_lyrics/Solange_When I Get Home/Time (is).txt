Time (is) Lyrics
Oh, no
No, no
No, no
No, no
No, no

I was getting to feel
All the way (By the way you comb your hair)
Keepin' it real
"Give your all," you would say to me
Only way to know your heart (If I call you now)
And it gives me hope for the trials
And the fear of the unknown that moves too close (Real close)
But we gotta go
Yeah, we gotta go
But the way to do it
Just (Yay)
Do us just
Then you’ll know
Go

You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
You gotta know
Ooh, ooh, know (Tried to let it go)
Ooh, ooh, know (Tell me where you go)
Ooh, ooh, know (Tell me where you are)
Ooh, ooh, know (Tell me where's the storm)
Ooh, ooh, know (Tell me drive this out your mind)
Ooh, ooh, know (I was only yours)
Ooh, ooh, know (I was only yours)

You've got to know (You’ve got to know)
You've got to know (You've got to know)
You've got to know (You've got to know)
You've got to know (You've got to know)
You've got to know (You’ve got to know)
You’ve got to know (You've got to know)
You’ve got to know (You've got to know)
(He's got to know)
You've got to know (You’ve got to know)
You've got to-

Ohh, ohh
Yeah, ohh, ahh5Embed
