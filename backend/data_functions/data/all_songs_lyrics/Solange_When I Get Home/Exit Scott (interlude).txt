Exit Scott (interlude) Lyrics
(Love me, love me, love me, love me)
If it were possible to place you in my brain and let you roam around, in and out my thought waves, you would never have to ask, "Why do you love me?"
Please take the wheel forever
With you I feel forever
Show me the way to never
Down where you'll stay forever2Embed
