Stay Flo Lyrics
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Down, down, down on the floor
Down, down, down on the floor
Down, down, down on the floor
Down, down, down on the floor

Niggas get fade and they feel it on they face (Hold up)
Talking all day, then they feel it on they place (Yeah)
Take it all down, they gon' feel it on the day
Take it all home and they feel it all the way
Takin' all shots and they feel it on they face (Take it)
Ayy, ayy-ayy
Take it all down, make 'em feel it on they faith
Ayy, ayy-ayy
Man get down and they putting on a show (Hold up)
Girls getting down every day (Hold up)
Working out of town on the floor (Hold on)
Making thangs swang on the go
Niggas get down and they feel it on they face
Motherfucker I'm down, down, down, don't you know (Hey)
Ayy, ayy-ayy (Hey, hey)
Ayy, ayy-ayy (Hey, hey)

Ayy, ayy, ayy (Wanted to feel it)
Ayy, yeah (You wanted to get me, ayy)
Yeah (Don't you get mad, to see me)
Ayy yeah, ayy yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy-ayy (Ayy)
Niggas wanna come in the play (Ayy, ayy)
Niggas get all in they feelings (Hey, hey)
Niggas get down every day (Hey)
Niggas play games when you flex
Niggas throw stones, they gon' feel it on they face
Ayy, ayy-ayy
Take it all home, make 'em feel it on they face (Hey, hey)
Yeah, ayy-ayy (Hey, hey)

Ayy, ayy, ayy (Wanted to feel it)
Ayy, yeah (You wanted to get me, ayy)
Yeah (Don't you get mad, to see me)
Ayy yeah, ayy yeah, yeah

Ayy, ayy-ayy (Ayy)
Ayy, ayy-ayy
Ayy, ayy-ayy (Hold up)
Ayy, ayy-ayy (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy-ayy (Hold up)
