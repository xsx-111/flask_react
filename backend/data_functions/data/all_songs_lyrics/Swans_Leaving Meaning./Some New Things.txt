Some New Things Lyrics
And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought
In a sun, in a moon
In a cloud, in the air
In a scream, there's a tear
There's a stab, on a slab
Now the future eats a past
And it's shrinking, and it's fast
There's a mind, there's a hive
There is life, there is not
There's a name I forgot
There's a breath, not a thought
There's a lake, there's a snake
There's a knife giving life
There's a fool reaching up
To a star that erupts
In a flood rising up
To a nothing that is coming!
And it's hungry like a monkey!
There is blood in my eye
There is truth in a lie
There's a dog, ease of mind
There's a wire, there's a bind
I perceive, I don't breathe
I become, I'm undone
In the unseen there is love
There is ruin on the one
There's a rip, there's a drift
Stealing bliss from your lip
I'm insane, you're insane
Cut a vein in my brain
There's a trap, there's a catch
There's a golden shining arrow
There's a cancer in a marrow
There's a flame in a hand
There's a kneeling Glowing Man
There's a rope reaching up
To a sky, to a lie
In a spiral there's a tide
There's a flood, let's give up
There's a hand, there's a mouth
There's a stair winding down
To your chest, to your guts
Hold it in, don't give up
There's a dream, there's a sheen
There's an endless silver stream
There's a song, now there's not
Never caught, never lost
There's a sound coming now
In a cloud hanging down
Never played, uncontained
And it's growing, and it's flowing
And unfolding, and it's showing
In a lung, in a child
There's a fire running wild
In a mind, on a line
Parallel to a cross
There's a place, I forgot
Never seen, never caught
And it's lost in a thought

Let it out, lay it down
Let it out, lay it down
Let it out, lay it down
Let it out, let it out
Of your mouth, let it out
Of your mouth, let it out
Of your mouth, let it out
Of your mouth, let it out
Of your mouth, let it out
Of your mouth, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let it out, let it out
Let him out, let him out
Let him out, let him out
Let him out, let him out
Let him out, let him out
Let him out, let him out
Let him out, let him out
Let him out, let him outEmbed
