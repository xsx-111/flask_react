Leaving Meaning Lyrics
I can see it but not see it
I can feel it but not keep it
I can touch it but not hold it
I can be it but not know it
I can reach it but won't touch it (But won't touch it)
I contain it but release it
I unfold it but won't see it (I unfold it)
I can breathe it but not taste it (But not taste it)
I will lose it but I'll keep it
In the shadow, in the light pool (In the shadow)
In the reason for not being (In the reason)
I won't touch it, I won't hold it (I won't touch it)
I can be it but not feel it (I can be it)
I can steal it but not keep it (I can steal it)
I can break it but not heal it (I can break it)
I can see it but not see it (I can see it)
I can feel it but not keep it (I can feel it)
I can touch it but not hold it (I can touch it)
I can be it but not know it (I can be it)
I can reach it but won't touch it (I can reach it)
I contain it but release it (I contain it)

I unfold it (I unfold it, I unfold it)
Somewhere
No place - let's go! (But don't see it)
(I unfold it, but don't see it)
Nowhere
This place - let's go!
(I unfold it, I unfold it)
Reaching
Not being - let's go! (But don't see it)
(I unfold it)
Glorious
No one, no us - let's go! (I can touch it)
(I unfold it)
Hmm - let's go!
Hmm - let's go!3Embed
