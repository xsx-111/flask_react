The Hanging Man Lyrics
I am the hanging man
I hang, I never land
I steal the space between
The filthy and the clean
Healer, come here soon
Come to fill my spoon
Healer, heal my wound
I am a dog: I eat the moon
Healer, heal my lust
Fill my mouth with rust
Healer, hold my hand
Fill my mouth with sand

Healer, kill this lamb!
I am the hanging man
I am the hanging man
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, vr... vr... vr... vr... not!
I am NOT! I am NOT!
I am NOT! I am NOT!
I am NOT!

Here I lie, abject
Healer, teeth are red
Force my legs apart:
Healer, hold my heart
Healer, cut my spine
Healer, eat my mind
Write it on the sky:
These stars reveal the lie
Hold the glowing sphere
There is no there or here
Healer, hold my hand!
I am the hanging man
I am the hanging man
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am
Vr... vrr.. vrr.. vrr.. vrr, I am not
I am not what I just thought
I am not what I just thought
I am not, I am NOT!
I am NOT!
We are NOT! We are NOT!
NOT! NOT! NOT!

Who is the watcher who's watching this thought
Whose thought is a thought that is not what he thought
NOT! SHOT! KNOT!2Embed
