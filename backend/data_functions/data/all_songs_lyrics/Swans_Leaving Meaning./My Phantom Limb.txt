My Phantom Limb Lyrics
And now I see your face in the mirror
My secret brother, now uncovered
While dissolving into me
I'm breathing into you
Now I'm in you, now I'm injured
Now I'm healing, now I'm clean
Your voice sings inside my mind
Your tongue tastes points in time
We're threading tiny lights across the dome of the sky
We ride a single, endlessly unfurling line
Your love is deep in my bones
Now they're breaking
Now they're shattered
Do their fragments on the floor
Spell out our future, waiting to be told?
With rough hands and tender breast
White hair and tattooed vest
Now you're reaching, ever seeking
Ever watching your mind unwind
You hide beneath my bed
You sing inside my head
Hold my hand, be still now
If there's cancer in your blood
It works its way through me too
We're all the same, uncontained
Boiling flesh, unspoken names
Dissolving, contorting
Reforming, distorting
I see your voice in my mind and I am singing
It works its way through my veins
And my hands reach up to the sky
And they're burning as they're circling
I'm your vessel, I am creaming
I'm the avatar of your semen and I'm screaming
Each one of us is fueled with love
With your love to nourish
As you extinguish, I flourish
I'm inside your particles, your cells, and your molecules:
Each one of them is individually screaming
Poor little ones and zeroes:
They're screaming too
Our consciousness is true: it is physical
It is real. It is divisible, and consumed
I am your child again again, your brothers
I am your sister, you're my sister too
Let the wires unwind
Let's celebrate the disappearing mind
True seeker, hold my hand
There is no sky, there is no land
There is no woman, there is no man
Each pain, each love, each regret is sacred
The wounded child is sacred
The murdering man is sacred
The imbecile is sacred
My spit in the dust is sacred
Your lover's sentient hand is sacred
Fucking is sacred
Music is sacred
To give up is sacred
Silence is sacred
Mindlessless is sacred
Sacred, sacred, sacred, everything is sacred
Nothing's wasted in our secret
Labyrinthine intestines of time
Through you I create myself
You are my one annihilating thought
Clenched in your fist
I happily cease to exist
Every thought is a capsule bursting
Spilling its seeds in space
Each one is sacred
Each one is infinite
Each one dissolves
Dissolving is sacred
Erasing is sacred
I see your voice in my mind and I'm singing
I taste your voice on my tongue and I am flying
You animate my hands and I'm reaching
I see your voice with my eyes, right here
Right now in front of me, misting the air
(There is no man)
And I'm flying, and I'm rising
And I am flying, I am flying
Finally flying, I am flying
Finally flying, yes we're rising
Endlessly rising, and we're flying
Finally flying, and we're riding
Yes we're riding a white lion
And he's flaming, yes he's flaming
And we're flaming, yeah he's flaming
And we're flaming, and we're flaming
And we're flying, and we're flying
And we're riding, and we're rising
And we're riding, and we're rising
Through the sky2Embed
