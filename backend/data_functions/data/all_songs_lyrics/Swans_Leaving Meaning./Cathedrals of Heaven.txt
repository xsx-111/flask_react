Cathedrals of Heaven Lyrics
While drinking your lake, while sucking your star
The closer I come, the further you are
There is no constraint, there is no because
There is no reward, but there's a place just for us
Run your hands through my soil, feed your blood through my skull
I’ll fold back my skin and wash me with oil
White bird in your mouth, chewed powder of time
Now scattered in clouds over fields washed with lime

I am asking you this
I am asking you this
What made us like this?
Who made us like this?

While stealing my dreams, while clawing my skies
Please open my chest, please curl in my nest
Or my tongue will turn black from tasting your spit
From drinking the sweat from the dip in your neck
Infections they spread, they can never be fixed
Now I'm thinking your thoughts, you're wearing my lips
If God is around, ah, it’s him that we kiss
While tying my binds you're asking me this
What made us like this?
What made us like this?
I am asking you this
Who made us like this?1Embed
