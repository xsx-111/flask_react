Sunfucker Lyrics
Surrender, surrender
Go under bright water
The flooding is coming
Give up to Sunfucker
The naked, the crawling
They become us while burning

Surrender, surrender
Sunfucker is calling

We are righteous, we are blighted
We are liquid, ignited
We're stealing your breathing
Your weeping is cleaning
Sunfucker: True Eater!
Sunfucker: True Blinder!

Surrender, surrender
Come home to Sunfucker

I am the one with feathered plume
Who holds your heart, whose light consumes
With arms stretched out, I gather sky
One thought, one mind:
Sunfucker eats the blind
One thought, one mind:
Sunfucker eats the blind
Why am I on this earth?
Why am I on this earth?
Why am I on this earth?
Why am I on this earth?
I worship Sunfucker!
I worship Sunfucker!
I worship Sunfucker!
I worship Sunfucker!
Fuck me...1Embed
