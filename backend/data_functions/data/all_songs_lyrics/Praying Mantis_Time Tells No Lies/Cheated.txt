Cheated Lyrics
Lying here so weary, girl
Just crying over you
The colors in our rainbow
How they've all turned blue

Raindrop in the ocean
That's what you've made of me today
But still I search for the answer
To why you went away

I've seen darkness
I've seen the light
I felt the pain, oh, the pain
In the dead of night (In the dead of night)

Cheated (I've been cheated)
My heart's been bruised
Cheated (I've been cheated)
All my life I've just been used

Let me tell you, darling
If you read the lines upon my face
They're sure enough to tell you
My head's out of place
Maybe tomorrow, girl
You'll come back to set me free
'Cause you know, it's only you, babe
Who holds the golden key

I've seen darkness
I've seen the light
I feel the pain, oh, the pain
In the dead of night (In the dead of night)

Cheated (I've been cheated)
My heart's been bruised
Cheated (I've been cheated)
All my life I've just been used


Whoah... cheated (I've been cheated)
My heart's been bruised
Cheated (I've been cheated)
All my life I've just been
Cheated (I've been cheated)
You bruised my heart, you bruised my heart
Cheated
All my life I've just been used
(I've been cheated)
Cheated, cheated, cheated
I've been cheated!
(I've been cheated)
Cheated, cheated, cheated
I've been cheated!
(I've been cheated)
Cheated, cheated, cheated
I've been cheated!
(I've been cheated)
Cheated, cheated, cheated
I've been cheated!
(I've been cheated)
Cheated, cheated, cheated
I've been cheated!Embed
