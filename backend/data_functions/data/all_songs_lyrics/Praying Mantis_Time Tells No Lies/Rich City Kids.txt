Rich City Kids LyricsAs nighttime falls they come alive
And show their pretty faces
Out come the flash cars
And the girls who wait for longed embraces
The work they do is short and sweet
The money's there for the taking
Well daddy's rich and he don't care
It's all part of junior's making
Stay alive like the rich kids
Stay alive in the city
Stay alive like the rich kids
Don't get shot in the city
The esteem they hold has not been earned
But money talks so loudly
They walk on ground that's shared by stars
Who've climbed their ladders proudly
Society holds this place in our dreams
For those who ain't sitting waiting
While the rest of us stare in vain
It's all part of junior's making
Stay alive like the rich kids
Stay alive in the city
Stay alive like the rich kids
Don't get shot in the city
False friends know how far to go
Before they can be caught
But who knows who the real ones are
For only these have yet to be bought
The work they do is short and sweet
The money's there for the taking
Well daddy's rich and he don't care
It's all part of junior's makingEmbed
