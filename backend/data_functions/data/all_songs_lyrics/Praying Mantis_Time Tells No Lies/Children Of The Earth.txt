Children Of The Earth LyricsWhere are the mountains
Where are the trees
Together with our ashes
They're blown in the breeze
Death and destruction
Has ruined our lives
But now it's the end as mankind truly dies
For we are children of the earth
Orphans of the universe
Children of the earth
But now our mother is dead
God help us open our shuttered eyes
To see what we've done
To this once paradise
Forgive us our sins
For we were blind to the fact
That we were ruining
This land and God's holy pact
For we are children of the earth
Orphans of the universe
Children of the earth
But now our mother is dead
Time has no meaning
Time tells no lies
Man has evolved as a predator in disguise
Collect all our evils, place them side by side
There you have the potion for mass suicide3Embed
