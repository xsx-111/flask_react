All Day & All Of The Night LyricsI'm not content to be with you in the day time
Girl I wanna be with you all of the time
The only time I feel alright is by your side
Girl I wanna be with you all of the time
All day and all of the night
All of the time
All day and all of the night
I believe that you and me last forever
Oh yeah all day and night time yours leave me neverEmbed
