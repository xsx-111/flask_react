Beads Of Ebony LyricsYou're poised there in such radiance
So unclouded, so serene
As other flock around you
Someday you shall be queen
Into the icy wastes you peer
With eyes of scrutiny
But who's to say in this new world
What is your destiny
You're the one my child
You are the chosen one
The one they want in your prime
Farewell my fearful beads of ebony
It's you who is the first this time
Who are those frightening creatures
How they stumble through the snow
Have they come to greet you
You are very soon to know
As he towers high above you with no mercy or no shame
No bullet, there's no scar that way
Oh, those screams of pain
You're the one my child
You are the chosen one
The one they want in your prime
Farewell my fearful beads of ebony
It's you who is the first this time
It's over now for another year
They've done their dirty deed
It's cold once more
But your sister waits to take your brother's seed
I thought I saw you on the Hollywood screen
You were the star of the show
She could not see those beads of ebony
Or the blood now covered by snowEmbed
