Panic In The Streets LyricsOh freedom fighters, out there on the streets
Searching like vampires for the blood of their feast
All the super coll boys their bodies have no soul
They say they have a heart but you know it's made of stone
Fighting for a reason
It's something they call freedom
They stalk the streets like hungry wolves
In the midnight heat
Fighting for a reason
It's something they call freedom
But you know the reason
Is panic in the streets
And you'll always see the heroes retreat before defeat
In talk they breath fire out in action they are cheap
Oh freedom fighter sail on through the night
Ya say you're tough but that ain't enough
Ya gotta try to put it rightEmbed
