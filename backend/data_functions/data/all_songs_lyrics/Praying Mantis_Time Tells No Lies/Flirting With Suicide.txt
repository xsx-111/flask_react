Flirting With Suicide LyricsTo see the light
To see the light
Of the day that may never see night
The lady awaits to open the gates
Today there won't be a fight
And he knows it has to be that way
It's instinct you know not choice
An urge he only feels inside
That can't be expressed in his voice
Flirting with suicide
No return ticket
No place to hide
Flirting with suicide
'Cause this is just a one way ride
Winging his way on a path of pure ecstasy
Her scent draws him closer, a tear
Can he win over her heart, win it just that once
Her object is blatantly clear
Flirting with suicide
No return ticket
No place to hide
Flirting with suicide
'Cause this is just a one way ride
The encounter was usual the feeling was mutual
Now came the hardest part
As they exchanged glances he took no chances
Aiming his song at her heart
But the lady she knows it's been tried before
You've gotta admire her tact
And in the midday sun with no place to run
She commenced her sacrificial act
With a prayer to the Lord ha brandished his sword
Her passion raged like fire
In just a few moments the two had become
A fusion of frenzied desire
Glistening wings entangled limbs buttered just to her link'
If insect were man then he should be proud
He fell to her just like a vikin'Embed
