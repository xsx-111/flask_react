Lovers To The Grave LyricsDaylight giving way to night
Darkness roams the sky
Sinners of the night return to sanguinary cry
A virgin's life falls to the grave
Submitting to the call
Her blood to bathe the devil's needs
Her body has no soul
Lovers to the grave
They give their lives if there's no other way
Lovers to the grave
They've had their games and now it's time to pay
Dancing in the midnight sun
Children of the dark
Players in a game of death
Lovers with no heart
The web of doom may never die
Roots of evil grow
The devil's touch is in the heart
The fury in the soul
Lovers to the grave
They give their lives if there's no other way
Lovers to the grave
They've had their games and now it's time to pay
Oh Lord, oh lord, it's time to payEmbed
