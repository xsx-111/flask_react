Running For Tomorrow LyricsLet the skies darken
So I can see the light
Let the clouds open
To drown my scent of fright
The sounds now all around me
Echo madly in my mind
My life may soon be over
In this game against mankind
Running through the wilderness
Never standing still
Hell is close behind me
Moving in for the kill
A pack of crazy demons
Follow neatly on my train
Will I ever see freedom
Or is this my turn to fail
Running for tomorrow
Hiding for today
Running for tomorrow
Can't look back on yesterday1Embed
