Lithium Lyrics
Lithium
Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium
Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium
I wanna stay in love with my sorrow

Oh
But God, I wanna let it go
Come to bed, don't make me sleep alone
Couldn't hide the emptiness, you let it show
Never wanted it to be so cold
Just didn't drink enough to say you love me

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Lithium
Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium
Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium
I wanna stay in love with my sorrow
Don't wanna let it lay me down this time
Drown my will to fly
Here in the darkness I know myself
Can't break free until I let it go
Let me go
Darling, I forgive you after all
Anything is better than to be alone
And in the end I guess I had to fall
Always find my place among the ashes

I can't hold on to me
Wonder what's wrong with me

Lithium
Don't wanna lock me up inside
Lithium
Don't wanna forget how it feels without
Lithium

Stay in love with you
I, I'm gonna let it go29Embed
