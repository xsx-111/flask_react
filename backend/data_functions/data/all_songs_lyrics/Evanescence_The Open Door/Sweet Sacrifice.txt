Sweet Sacrifice Lyrics
It's true, we're all a little insane
But it's so clear
Now that I'm unchained

Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time, oh

You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me
Don't deny, sweet sacrifice

One day, I'm gonna forget your name
And one sweet day, you're gonna drown in my lost pain

Fear is only in our minds
Taking over all the time
Fear is only in our minds
But it's taking over all the time
You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
And oh, you love to hate me
Don't you, honey?
I'm your sacrifice

I dream in darkness
I sleep to die
Erase the silence
Erase my life
Do you wonder why you hate?
Our burning ashes
Blacken the day
Are you still too weak to survive your mistakes?
A world of nothingness
Blow me away

You poor sweet innocent thing
Dry your eyes and testify
You know you live to break me
Don't deny
