Lose Control Lyrics
You don't remember my name
I don't really care
Can we play the game your way?
Can I really lose control?

Just once in my life
I think it'd be nice
Just to lose control, just once
With all the pretty flowers in the dust

Mary had a lamb
His eyes black as coals
If we play very quiet, my lamb
Mary never has to know

Just once in my life
I think it'd be nice
Just to lose control, just once

Oh oh oh oh. oh oh oh
If I cut you down to a thing I can use
I fear there'll be nothing good left of you

Oh oh oh ohhh! oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh ohhh! oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh ohhh! oh oh ohh!
Oh oh oh ohhh! oh oh ohh!
Just to lose control, just once6Embed
