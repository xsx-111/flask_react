Volte-Face Lyrics

I have spent all my previous life
Waiting for something else to start
Now I see that I have felt so numb
To everything that passed me by, passed me by

Need to go land on my own two feet
Need to change my life this way
Need to free my mind of memories
Watch them how they screw my brain

The time that has come
Convinced what I feel inside
In darkness I float, how far is the light?


The time that has come
Convinced what I feel inside
In darkness I float, how far is the light?
How far is the light?

Inside: fearland
Don't want you to know
Outside: fearless
I do want you to watch, do you mind?

Would you step aside, make way for me?
Can't you see I'm dead set on doing this

Enough of dreamless nights
Enough of sleepless nights
I'm the way I am, get out of my sight
Do you mind?

You can put me in the lion's cage
You can take my soul, give a second name
But I don't intend to stop my fight
And I'm not afraid, not afraidEmbed
