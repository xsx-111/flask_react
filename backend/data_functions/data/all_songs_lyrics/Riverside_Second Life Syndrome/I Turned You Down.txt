I Turned You Down Lyrics
I turned you down so hastily
And it's tearing me apart
In my heart of hearts I'm screaming
In my heart of hearts I cry
And it's cold, so cold

I turned you down, I turned you down so thoughtlessly
And it's tearing me apart
In my heart of hearts I'm screaming
In my heart of hearts I cry
How I wish you told me that

I wish you'd told me that before
I wish you'd told me that before
I wish you'd told me that before

I turned you down
Down, down, down
I turned you down, down, down
I turned you down, down, down
I turned you
(I wish you'd told me that before)


I wish you'd told me that before
I wish you'd told me that before
I wish you'd told me that beforeEmbed
