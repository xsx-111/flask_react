Artificial Smile Lyrics
Hi, my friend, shake my hand
Tell your lie with your artificial smile
Don't be mad, I just want to help you to say these words out loud

I don't like you cause they like you
I hate you cause they love you
I wish you ill cause they wish you well
I'm so happy when they f you

Strike a blow for my fall
Crush me down and just say these words out loud
And just say these words out loud

I don't like you cause they like you
I hate you cause they love you
I wish you ill cause they wish you well
I'm so happy when they f you

Now this is what we do
And this is who we are
Why don't you want to stop
You always see my life up against your life
My life up against your life
I don't like you cause they like you
I hate you cause they love you
I wish you ill cause they wish you well
I'm so happy when they f you

Tell me your lie
Tell me your lie
Tell me your lie
Tell me your lie
Tell me your lie
Tell me your lie
Tell me your lie
Tell me your lieEmbed
