Dance with the Shadow Lyrics
Pull myself together, holding on
Standing at the point of no return
Keeping on the right side of my heart
And the moment of truth is falling on me now

I don't care if what I want is written in my eyes
You can think of me what you feel, I don't really mind
How about laughing at my habits at my needs
I'm afraid I'll stay unmoved, know I have to be

Before you come and tell me who I am
Before you try to make me someone else
Step out of your line, out of line
Step out of your line

I don't care if what I want is written in my eyes
You can think of me what you feel, I don't really mind
How about spitting venom in my face again
I'm afraid I'll stay unmoved, you just waste your breath

Before you come and tell me who I am
Before you try to make me someone else
Step out of your line
Step out of line
Rise
Shall we dance my friend?

Join in the shadow dance
Join in the shadow dance
Join in the shadow dance
Join in the shadow dance

I'm standing on the edge, about to fall
In the middle of the point of no return
Trying to forget those days I failed to act
I'm not going to back out, I've come too far


I'm standing on the edge, about to fall
In the middle of the point of no return
Trying to forget those days I failed to act
I'm not going to back out, I've come too far

I can almost see the light, feel it's warmth
And touch the moment I was waiting for so long
I carried all before me, now the die is cast
With open arms I'm standing out against my pastEmbed
