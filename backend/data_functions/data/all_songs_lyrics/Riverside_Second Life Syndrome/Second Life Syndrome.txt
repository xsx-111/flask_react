Second Life Syndrome Lyrics
From day to day, from hand to mouth
We’re turning around, vicious ritual
Getting used to it all, falling down again
We’re waiting for the decrees of providence

I don’t want to waste any more of my life
Live from day to day, live from hand to mouth
Facing the light, I brush aside your plans
I’m going to have it all my own way

And when that all shattered I felt I’d broken my fall
Couldn’t pretend that I felt strong about us anymore
Without your help I finally started to live my own life
I just want you to know this time
I just want you to know this time

And when that all shattered I felt I’d broken my fall
Couldn’t pretend that I felt strong about us anymore
Without your help I finally started to live my own life
I just want you to know this time

I just want to feel your sigh on my neck
Want to feel your breath, feel your need to stay
You don’t know my name, don’t know my face
Only thoughts I share in my secret place

Secret exhibition, cure for loneliness
I’ve ground to a halt, there’s no turning back
You know there are things I just can’t forget
You’ve helped me so much, to learn to be detached

But when that all shattered I felt I’d broken my fall
Couldn’t pretend that I felt strong about us anymore
Without that help I finally started to live my own life
And I know I don’t need you now

Secret exhibition, cure for loneliness
Life is much too short to be whiled away with tears
Secret exhibition, cure for loneliness

I erase you now, I don’t need you now
I erase you now with all of my past

Day after day
