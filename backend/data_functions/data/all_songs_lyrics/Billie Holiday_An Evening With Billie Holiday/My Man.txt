My Man LyricsSometimes I say
If I just could get away
With my man
He’d go straight sure as fate
For it never is too late
For a man
I just like to dream
Of a cottage by a stream
With my man
Where a few flowers grew
And perhaps a kid or two
Like my man
And then my eyes get wet
I ‘most forget
‘Til he gets hot
And tells me not to talk
Such rot
Oh my man I love him so
He’ll never know
All my life is just despair
But I don’t care
When he takes me in his arms
The world is bright
All right
What’s the difference if I say
I’ll go away
When I know I’ll come back
On my knees someday
For whatever my man is
I’m his
ForevermoreEmbed
