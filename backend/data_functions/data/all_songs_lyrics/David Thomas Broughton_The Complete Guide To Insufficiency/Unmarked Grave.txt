Unmarked Grave LyricsI was a soldier in a far off land
The arrow deep in my side
I'd return one day my love
To the heavens we would ride
My body rots while she is weeping
And I remain forever sleeping
Rest my bones from the daily chores
Rest my bones forever more
My body lies in an unmarked grave
Heart remains with the one I love
She's awaiting my return
I know that will never come
My body rots while she is weeping
And I remain forever sleeping
Rest my bones on a far-off shore
Rest my bones forever more
As I decay 'neath my blanket of earth
My heart is yet to be satisfied
A seedling grows on my burial ground
Just to wither and die
My body rots while she is weeping
And I remain forever sleeping
Rest my bones from the daily chores
Rest my bones forever moreEmbed
