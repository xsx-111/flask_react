Ambiguity Lyrics
How much love can a boy contain in here?
How many contradictions can a girl posess up there?
Well these questions, these questions are too ambiguous
Try to narrow down your search
Somethings I know, it's hard
Somethings I know, it's hard
Somethings I know, it's hard

It's easy to forget where you came from if there's no question of your return
Such selfishnesses trivialise any tenderness as the coffee commands the torture of my bowels
Such selfishnesses
Such selfishnesses
Pronouncing every word with a rigid insensitivity, plus I struggle with the nightshade in my blood
I really shouldn't say it, but I just love what the water does

It's easy
Struggle with the nightshade
It's easy
Easy
And I struggle with the nightshade in my blood. (x2)
Easy
Easy
And I struggle with the nightshade in my blood. (x2)
Easy
Easy
And I-Embed
