Will You Return? LyricsI open my door and here's what occurs
A pretty little gal with pretty little curls
Leans to the side, leans on my mind
I don't want to live, but I sure don't want to die
I'm stuttering again and tellin' her goodbye
Oh m-m-my, Goodb-b-bye
Will you come again? It's hard to say
I surely hope so
Will you come again? It's hard to say
I surely hope so
She walks up to me with something more to say
Then hello and goodbye I hope that you're okay
Well I'm doing fine… I'm doing fine
Will you come again? It's hard to say
I surely hope so
Will you come again? It's hard to say
I surely hope so
I wish you'd see yourself as beautiful as I see you
Why can't you see yourself as beautiful as I see you?
I open my door and this is what I see
The hope inside a girl just looking back at me
Ohh my… Goodbye
Will you come again? It's hard to say
I surely hope so
And will you come again? It's hard to say
I surely hope soEmbed
