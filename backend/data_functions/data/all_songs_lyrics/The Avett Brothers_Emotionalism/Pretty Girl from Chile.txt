Pretty Girl from Chile LyricsI'm no more than a friend girl
I can see that you need more
My boots are on my feet now
My bag is by the door
And the love and the attention
That you need and ask me for
Are weakened by my actions
And lies that I have told
I'm scared to think that I've abandoned you
I'd like to say that I'm a faithful man but it may not be true
And my heart is like a mason's
Hands of weathered skin
Each scar makes it harder
For me to hurt again
I'm scared to think that I've abandoned you
I'd like to say that I'm a faithful man but it may not be true
Gabriella, the things that I tell ya
Are all meant to help ya
Are they working now
Have I gone, have I gone and failed ya
Gabriella, have I let you down
Gabriella, the things that I tell ya
Are all meant to help ya
Are they working out
Have I gone, have I gone and failed ya
Gabriella, have I let you down

Hey what's up, this is Gabriella
How are you
Hey I've read the song you write
You serious, you didn't abandon me, or anything like that
Just people do whatever they need to do
To get going, you know
But I'm fine, I'm actually doing really well lately
So, just that, I hope that you're fine too and everything's great
Ok, thank you, ciao
