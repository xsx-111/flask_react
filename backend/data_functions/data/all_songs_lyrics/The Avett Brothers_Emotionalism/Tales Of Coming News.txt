Tales Of Coming News LyricsI'm so tired of hearing tales of coming news
Telling tales of a changing sky
It's just a shame that I didn't notice you
Till someone I loved had to die
What made us think that this was so different?
Who is driving behind those things you say?
Why do you insult me and my friends?
Who are my friends anyway?
I've spent my life lying now I pay the price
Are these really words of a young man or a worthless human life
I don't mean to scare you with the things I say
I take it back, yes it's a beautiful day
I watched you from the beach when your ship sailed
You made it clear that nothing stays the same
It's getting darker I wonder if you can tell
I wonder when it all had changed
You never used to let me go unveiled
I was so distracted I never saw the rain
You promised you meant every word you said
I wonder when it all had changed
It hurts so bad to hear such pretty words
Coming from somebody like you
I've been looking for so long that I've lost touch
With what's the best something to do
I've got a friend who makes good choices
Everybody likes the way that he sees things
I've got a problem and it walks me daily
Can't you see no one is proud of me
It's a long road alone and I'm not proving
Anything going by myself
When your love life is all that's really moving
Oh sugar girl I do appreciate the help
I had my fun with money gold and diamonds
Both went sour before they got to me
I'll be waiting girl but don't go counting hours
I'm not waiting for any other three
I was just a peasant from the highlands
She said don't you call me your mountain girl
I said don't bother me I'm trying to write and
Don't worry you ain't my mountain girl
I can call you but I'd probably make you cry
These days it's what you often times do
Call the preacher then go call your father
Tell them that the wedding plans have moved
I sent a message, said I'll be gone forever
The letter of reply never came
She said that she'd be true but I wouldn't let her
I wonder when it all had changed
Hell has no fury like a woman
Happy scorned or otherwise
You can do what you want to with your name
But you can bet I'm changing mine
Well I'd give a $100 to get a letter
If at the bottom it said I miss you bad
See but the truth of the matter is no one back home really misses me
See how I talk when I'm sad
Since I was young I've known a lot of women...Embed
