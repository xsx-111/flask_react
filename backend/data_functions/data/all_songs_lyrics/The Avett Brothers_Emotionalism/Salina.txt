Salina LyricsSalina, I'm as nowhere as I can be
Could you add some somewhere to me
Ah Kansas I'm kneeling, ah Kansas please
Cleveland, I ain't never felt nothing so strong
Been believing the words to my songs
Ohio I'm leaving, Ohio I'm gone
From town to town and state to state
There's people everywhere that try to capture us
We stole the cash and left our names
And almost slipped in Indianapolis
The rain it fell, the story went on
The rain it fell, and we got gone
Poughkeepsie, hang up the telephone
Won't answer your phone calls no more
New York quit callin', New York leave me be
I'm changing the plans that I've been setting on
I'm scared by the way that my life is getting gone
Carolina one day I'll, someday I'll come home
Carolina one day I'll, someday I'll come home
