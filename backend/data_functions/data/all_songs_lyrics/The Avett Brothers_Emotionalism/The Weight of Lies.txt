The Weight of Lies LyricsDisappear from your hometown
Go and find the people that you know
Show them all you good parts
Leave town when bad ones start to show
Go and wed a woman
A pretty girl that you've never met
Make sure she knows you love her well
But don't make any other promises
The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town
Cause nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
So when you run make sure you run
To something and not away from
Cause lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you anywhere
I once heard the worse thing
A man can do is draw a hungry crowd
Tell everyone his name, pride, and confidence
But leaving out his doubt
I'm not sure I bought those words
When I was young I knew most everything
These words have never meant so much to anyone
As they now mean to me
The weight of lies will bring you down
And follow you to every town
Cause nothing happens here that doesn't happen there
So when you run make sure you run
To something and not away from
Cause lies don't need an aeroplane to chase you downEmbed
