In The Curve LyricsI've never taken this curve
Drivin' this fast before
A glowing stop sign
But both lanes are mine
No seat belts attached to my door
Well my speed meter don't work
So I'm going to guess ninety-five
Well maybe I'll fix it
And maybe I won't
It depends on my being alive
Well my bottle of bourbon is gone
See it flew away all by itself
So if ever you find it
My photo will go behind it
In memory of me on your shelf
Well it's been raining all day
And it's been raining all night
A slip 'n slide highway
And I'm moving sideways
I'm loose but my steering wheels tight
Well my '63 Ford is a bull
She's four thousand pounds at least
But metal surrenders
When oak trees meet fenders
And engines go through the front seat
Well I lost control in the curve
And a gas line broke in the wreck
I walked from the ashes
With just a few scratches
My crucifix warm on my neck
Well the good Lord was with me tonight
Just ridin' beside me tonight
And now we're just talking
We're hitchhikin' walkin'
We'll see you in Concord tonight
Yeah, now were just walking
We're just hitchhiking talkin'
We'll see you in Concord tonightEmbed
