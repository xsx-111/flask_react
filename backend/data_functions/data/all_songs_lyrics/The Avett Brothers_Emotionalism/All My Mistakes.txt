All My Mistakes Lyrics
Shooting off vicious collections of words
The losers make fact by the things they have heard
And I find myself trying hard to defend them
I made decisions some right and some wrong
And I let some love go I wish wasn't gone
These things and more I wish I had not done

But I can't go back
And I don't want to
Cause all my mistakes
They brought me to you

I have some "friends" they don't know who I am
So I write quotations around the word friends
But I have a couple that have always been there for me
And I missed some fun cause I worked through the dawn
Expecting your praise when I returned home
But I paid the cost cause I got left alone for the songs

But I can't go back
And I don't want to
Cause all my mistakes
They brought me to youEmbed
