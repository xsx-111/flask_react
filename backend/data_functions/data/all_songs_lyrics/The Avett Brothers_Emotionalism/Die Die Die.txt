Die Die Die LyricsShe's fighting with the sky
She thinks she can
Livin' within a lie
She thinks she can
Nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die
She puts her hands against
The life she had
Living with ignorance
Blissful and sad
Nobody knows what lies behind
The days before the day we die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die, die die die die
Die die die
You can try to swim the sea
But say goodbye to you and me-e-e-e
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try to hide the sun
But say goodbye to everyone
You can try to swim the sea
You can try to hold the breeze
You can try through skin and bone
But you will end up all alo-o-oneEmbed
