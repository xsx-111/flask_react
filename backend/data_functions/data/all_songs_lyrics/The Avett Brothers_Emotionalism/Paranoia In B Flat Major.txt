Paranoia In B Flat Major Lyrics
I keep tellin' myself that it'll be fine
You can't make everybody happy all of the time
But I found myself in a place that I've never been
A place that I thought that I would never be
There's people looking back at me

I keep having this dream, I'm at a party
There's people throwing drinks
And screaming telling me that I don't belong
Lately life's been the same
I find this comfortable place
With all my friends
And then my friends start telling me
That I've always been wrong
And I'm so tired of being wrong

There was a time I could move, there was a time I could breathe
The crowded spaces filled with angry faces
It didn't once cross my mind
With paranoia on my heels
Will you love me still
When we awake and you find that the sanity has gone from my eyes?
I got secrets from you, you got secrets from me
Because you're so worried about what I'm gonna  think
Baby, I'm worried too
But if love is a game, girl, then you're gonna win
I'll spend the rest of my life bringing victory in
If you want me toEmbed
