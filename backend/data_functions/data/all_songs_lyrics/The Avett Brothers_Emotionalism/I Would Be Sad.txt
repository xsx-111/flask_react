I Would Be Sad LyricsI would be sad because you left me all alone
I would be sad because the lies that you had told
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adore
I would be sad because the love I’ve had before
I meant what I said when I said I would settle down with you
Although I know it’s not something that you were asking me to do
And I know we are young but we won’t always be so marry me
Let’s not be that predictable young couple changing moving on
But I can tell by watching you that there’s no chance of pushing through
The odds are so against us you know most young love it ends like this
I would be sad because you left me all alone
I would be sad because the lies that you had told
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adore
I would be sad for all the love I’ve had before
I meant what I said when I said I would rearrange my plans and change for you
You know me I’ve always been the kind with easy confidence
Confident enough to honestly believe that nothing out there
Is stopping me especially not someone who’s not loving me
Now listen here I told you I could live on without loving you
I was bluffing then but it seems that just might have been the truth
Well my dad told me one-day son this girl will think of what she’s done
And hurting you will be the first of many more regrets to come
And he said if she doesn’t call then it’s her fault and it’s her loss
I say it’s not that simple see but then again it just may be
I would be sad because you left me all alone
I would be sad for the lies that you had told me
I would be sad because I got left by a girl that I adore
I would be sad for all the love I had before
I would be sad for all the love I had beforeEmbed
