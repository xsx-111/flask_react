Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space

All I want in life's a little bit of love to take the pain away
Getting strong today
A giant step each day
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
Only fools rush in
But I
I can't help
I can't help falling
Falling in love with you

I will love you 'til I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space and drift in time
All the time until I die
We'll float in space, just you and I

I will love you 'til I die
And I will love you all the time
So please put your sweet hand in mine
And float in space and drift in time
All the time until I die
We'll float in space, just you and I
Wise men say
Only fools rush in
Only fools rush in
But I
I can't help
I can't help falling
Falling in love with you

Baby, I love you today
I guess that's what you want
And I don't know where we are all going
Life don't get stranger than this
It is what it is
And I don't know where we are all going to
Everything happens today
And we're out here in space
And I don't know where we are all going
Baby, I love you today
I guess that's what you want
And I don't know where we are all going to43Embed
