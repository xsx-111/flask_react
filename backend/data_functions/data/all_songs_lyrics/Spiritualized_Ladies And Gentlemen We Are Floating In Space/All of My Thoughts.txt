All of My Thoughts Lyrics
Don't know what to do by myself
'Cause all of my time was with you
I just don't know what to do on my own
All of my thoughts are of you
All of my thoughts are of you

Don't know how to sleep on my own
'Cause all of my dreams are of you
I just don't know what to do on my own
All of my thoughts are of you
All of my thoughts are of you

Don't know what to do by myself
'Cause all of my time was with you
I just don't know what to do on my own
All of my thoughts are of you
All of my thoughts are of you4Embed
