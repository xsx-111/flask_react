Cool Waves Lyrics
Baby, when you gotta sleep
Lay your head down low
Don't let the world lay heavy on your soul
'Cause when you gotta sleep, you gotta sleep

Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
'Cause I love you
Love you
Love you

Baby, if you lose your love
Don't take me by surprise
Don't think you're crying
But there's teardrops in your eyes
If you gotta leave, you gotta leave

Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
'Cause I love you
Love you
Love you
Babe, you know you gotta be
And let your light shine through
And don't let anybody tell you what to do
'Cause babe you gotta be, you gotta be

Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
'Cause I love you
Love you
Love you

Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
Lay your sweet hand on me
Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
Lay your sweet hand on me
Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
Lay your sweet hand on me
Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
Lay your sweet hand on me
Cool waves, wash over me
Cool water, running free
Lay your sweet hand on me
Lay your sweet hand on me
Cool waves, wash over me...Embed
