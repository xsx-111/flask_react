Stay with Me Lyrics
Oh babe, I love the way you slide
Stay with me, slide all the time
Don't go, love the way you smile
Stay with me, smile all the time
Don't go, love the way you're mine
Stay with me, hold me all of the time

Oh babe, I love the way you slide
Stay with me, slide all the time
Don't go, love the way you smile
Stay with me, smile all the time
Don't go, love the way you're mine
Stay with me, hold me all of the time

Oh babe, I love it when you slide
Stay with me, I love the way you're mine
Don't go, love it when you smile
Stay with me, I love it when you're mine
Don't go, you make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine
You make it all so fine1Embed
