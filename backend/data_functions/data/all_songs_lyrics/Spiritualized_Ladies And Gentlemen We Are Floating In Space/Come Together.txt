Come Together Lyrics
Little Johnny's sad and fucked
First, he jumped and then he looked
The tracks of time, those tracks of mine
Little Johnny's occupied

Come on
Come together
Come on
Come together

Well, little Johnny had an ache
That hung around the poor boy's neck
Every time that Johnny ate
The little fucker fed the ache

Come on
Come together
Come on
Come together

So little J's a fucked up boy
Who dulled the pain but killed the joy
And little J's a fuckin' mess
But when he's offered, just says yes
Little J is sad and fucked
First, he jumped and then he looked
The tracks of time, those tracks of mine
Little J is occupied
Come on
Come together10Embed
