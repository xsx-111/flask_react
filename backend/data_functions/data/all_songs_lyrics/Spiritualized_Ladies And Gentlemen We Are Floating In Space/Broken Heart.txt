Broken Heart Lyrics
Though I have a broken heart
I'm too busy to be heartbroken
There's a lot of things that need to be done
Lord, I have a broken heart

Though I have a broken dream
I'm too busy to be dreaming of you
There's a lot of things that I gotta do
Lord, I have a broken dream

And I'm wasted all the time
I've gotta drink you right off of my mind
I've been told that this will heal, given time
Lord, I have a broken heart

And I'm crying all the time
I have to keep it covered up with a smile
And I'll keep on moving on for a while
Lord, I have a broken heart4Embed
