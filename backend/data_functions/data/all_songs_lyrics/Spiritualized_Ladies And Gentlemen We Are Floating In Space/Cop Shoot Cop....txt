Cop Shoot Cop... Lyrics
Hey man, there's a hole in my arm where all the money goes
Jesus Christ died for nothin', I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more

Hey man, there's a hole in my head where information goes
And all my friends died for nothin', I suppose

Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more

Hey man, there's a hole in my reason that I gotta close
'Cause all my love died for nothin', I suppose
Cop shoot cop
I believe
I believe that I have been reborn
Cop shoot cop
I haven't got the time no more


Desert is any place without you
Oh, my love, I'm pretty sure that you can feel that, too
And loneliness, you know it hits me and it lasts for days
'Cause you're so sweet, you make me feel like a child, my babe
The desert is where I find myself when I get blown
'Cause you're so sweet and I can't seem to find my way back home
If this is heaven, well, you know that I'm not happy here
'Cause heaven ain't any place where you're not there
Desert is any place without you, my friend
And I will love you even if I'm getting to the end
'Cause you're so sweet, I'm always wishing, babe, that you were here
The desert is any place without you, my dear
And I will love you
I will love you
I will love you
I will love you
I will love you
I will love you3Embed
