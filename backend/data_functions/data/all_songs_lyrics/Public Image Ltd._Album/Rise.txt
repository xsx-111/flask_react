Rise LyricsI could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong
I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be white, I could be black
Your time has come, your second skin
The cost so high, the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
I could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be black, I could be white
They put a hot wire to my head
'Cause of the things I did and said
They made these feelings go away
Model citizen in every way
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
I could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong, I could be right
I could be black, I could be white
I could be right, I could be wrong
I could be black, I could be white
Your time has come, your second skin
The cost so high, the gain so low
Walk through the valley
The written word is a lie
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
I could be wrong
I could be right
I could be wrong
They put a hot wire to my head
'Cause of the things I did and said
They made these feelings go away
A model citizen in every way
Your time has come, your second skin
Cost so high, the gain so low
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
May the road rise with you
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy
Anger is an energy2Embed
