F.F.F. LyricsFarewell, my fairweather friend
Senseless reasoning
You believe what you want to believe
Farewell, my fairweather friend
On you no one can depend
Bad times
Now they must end
Whatever you want it to be
For you that's what it will be
Honesty to you is arbitrary
Logic is lost in your
Cranial abattoir
Shallow
Empty inside
Sly-witted
And full of snide
Bad times
Now they must end
The shutter-speed of your thinking process
Is small
Too small
Too full of pride
Bad times
Now they must end

Farewell, my fairweather friend
Bad times
Now they must end
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Bad times
Now they must end
Used to be nice
Now you're twice as nice
Used to be good
Now you're too good
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Bad times
They must end
On you no one can depend
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Logic is lost in your
Cranial abattoir
Shallow
Empty inside
Sly-witted
Full of snide
The shutter-speed of your thinking process
Is small
Too small
Too full of pride
Lost in a storm
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Bad times
Now they must end
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Farewell, my fairweather friend
Farewell, my fairweather friend
