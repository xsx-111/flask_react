Whats Wrong With That LyricsHow did I end up here closer to nowhere
In the middle of nothing
And I'm one step back from where I was
Spinning in circles gets old after a while
And you say if I fall
I will fall straight into your arms
And should I trip over my feet
And if I start to slip
I will slip right onto my knees
Into the center of your hands
Cause' maybe someday I could learn to trust you
And just stop thinking with my head
'Cause maybe someday I could learn to let go
I lose control but that's okay with me
I lose control but tell me what is wrong with that
Why do I have to know everything
And why does everything always have to make sense?
Why do I always have to have you figured out?
'Cause I just want to take your hand
And you say if I fall
I will fall straight into your arms
And I trip over my feet
And if I start to slip
I will slip right onto my knees
Into the center of your hands
'Cause maybe someday I could learn to trust you
And just stop thinking with my head
'Cause maybe someday I could learn to let go
I lose control but that's okay with me
I lose control but tell me what is wrong with thatEmbed
