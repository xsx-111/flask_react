Breathing Lyrics
I'm finding my way back to sanity again
Though I don't really know what I'm gonna do when I get there
Take a breath and hold on tight
Spin around one more time
And gracefully fall back to the arms of Grace

'Cause I am hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
Because I want nothing more
Than to sit outside heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
Is where I want to be, yeah
Where I want to be

I'm looking past the shadows of my mind into the truth
And I'm trying to identify the voices in my head
God, which one's you?
Let me feel one more time what it feels like to feel
And break these calluses off of me one more time

'Cause I am hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more
Than to sit outside your door
And listen to you breathing
Is where I want to be, yeah
I don't want a thing from you
Bet you're tired of me waiting
For the straps to fall off of your table to the ground
I just want to be here now

'Cause I am hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more
Than to sit outside heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
Is where I want to be, yeah
'Cause I am hanging on every word you say
And even if you don't want to speak tonight
That's alright, alright with me
'Cause I want nothing more
Than to sit outside heaven's door
And listen to you breathing
Is where I want to be, yeahEmbed
