Sick Cycle Carousel Lyrics
If shame had a face, I think it would kind of look like mine
If it had a home, would it be my eyes?
Would you believe me if I said I'm tired of this?
Well, here we go now, one more time

I tried to climb your steps, I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground
I tried to earn my way, I tried to tame this mind
You better believe that I tried to beat this

So when will this end? It goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around, I know that it won't stop
Until I step down from this for good

I never thought I'd end up here
Never thought I'd be standing where I am
I guess I kind of thought it would be easier than this
I guess I was wrong now, one more time

I tried to climb your steps, I tried to chase you down
I tried to see how low I could get down to the ground
I tried to earn my way, I tried to tame this mind
You better believe that I tried to beat this
So when will this end? It goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around, I know that it won't stop
Until I step down from this

Sick cycle carousel
This is a sick cycle, yeah
Sick cycle carousel
This is a sick cycle, yeah, ahh

So when will this end? It goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around, I know that it won't stop
Until I step down from this for good
So when will this end? It goes on and on
Over and over and over again
Keep spinning around, I know that it won't stop
Until I step down from this for good
