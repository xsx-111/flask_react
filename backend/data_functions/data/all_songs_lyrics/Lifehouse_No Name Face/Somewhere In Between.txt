Somewhere In Between Lyrics
I can't be losing sleep over this, no, I can't
And now I cannot stop pacing
Give me a few hours, I'll have this all sorted out
If my mind would just stop racing

Cause I cannot stand still
I can't be this unsturdy
This cannot be happening

This is over my head but underneath my feet
Because by tomorrow morning I'll have this thing beat
And everything will be back to the way that it was
I wish that it was just that easy

Cause I'm waiting for tonight
Then waiting for tomorrow
And I'm somewhere in between

What is real and just a dream
What is real and just a dream
What is real and just a dream
Would you catch me if I fall out of what I fell in
Don't be surprised if I collapse down at your feet again
I don't want to run away from this
I know that I just don't need this

Because I cannot stand still
I can't be this unsturdy
This cannot be happening

Cause I'm waiting for tonight
Then waiting for tomorrow
And I'm somewhere in between

What is real and just a dream
What is real and just a dream
What is real and just a dream
What is real and just a dreamEmbed
