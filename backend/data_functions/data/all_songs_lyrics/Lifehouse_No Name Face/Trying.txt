Trying Lyrics
Could you let down your hair, be transparent for awhile?
Just a little while
To see if you're human after all
Honesty is a hard attribute to find
When we all want to seem like
We've got it all figured out
Well let me be the first to say that I don't have a clue
I don't have all the answers
Ain't going to pretend like I do

Just trying to find my way
Trying to find my way the best I know how

Well, I haven't memorized all of the cute things to say
But I'm working on it
Maybe I'll master this art form someday
If I quote all the lines off the top of my head
Would you believe
That I fully understand all these things I've read

Just trying to find my way
Trying to find my way the best I know how
Well, I haven't got it all figured out quite yet, but
Even if it takes my whole life to get to where I need to be
And if I should fall to the bottom of the end
I'll be one step back to you, and

I'm trying to find my way
Trying to find my way
I'm trying to find my way
Trying to find my wayEmbed
