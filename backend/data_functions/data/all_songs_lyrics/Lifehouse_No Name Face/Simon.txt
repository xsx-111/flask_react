Simon Lyrics
Catch your breath, hit the wall
Scream out loud as you start to crawl
Back in your cage, the only place
Where they will leave you alone

Because the weak will seek the weaker 'til they've broken them
Could you get it back again? Would it be the same?
Fulfillment to their lack of strength at your expense
Left you with no defense
They tore it down

And I have felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same

Locked inside the only place
Where you feel sheltered, where you feel safe
You lost yourself in your search to find
Something else to hide behind

Because the fearful always preyed upon your confidence
Did they see the consequence
When they pushed you around?
The arrogant build kingdoms made of the different ones
Breaking them until they've become
Just another crown
And I have felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same

Refuse to feel anything at all
Refuse to slip, refuse to fall
You can't be weak, you can't stand still
You watch your back because no one will

You don't know why they had to go this far
Traded your worth for these scars
For your only company
And don't believe the lies that they have told to you
Not one word was true
You're alright, you're alright, you're alright

And I have felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the same
As you, I've felt the sameEmbed
