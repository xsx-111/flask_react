Quasimodo Lyrics
You can be right
And I'll be real
Oh, and it still won't be a pain
That you will have to feel
Because I don't need your approval
To find my worth
I'm trapped inside of my own mind
Afraid to open my eyes because of what I'd find and I
Don't want to live like this anymore

There goes my pain
There goes my chains
Did you see them falling
Because this feeling
There has no meaning

There goes the world
Off of my shoulders
There goes the world
Off of my back
There it goes

Does it scare you that I can
Be something different than you
Would it make you feel
More comfortable if I wasn't
Well you can't control me
And you can't take away from me who I am


Have you ever felt
Like your only comfort was your cage
You're not alone
I've felt the same as you
Have you ever felt like your secrets give you away
You're not alone
I've been there too

Because everyone is looking
Everyone is laughing
But I think everyone feels the same
Everybody wants to feel okay
Everybody wants to
Everybody wants to feel



Because I don't want it
I don't want it
You can't change me
You can't break me
