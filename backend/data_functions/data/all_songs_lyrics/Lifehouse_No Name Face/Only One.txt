Only One Lyrics
She's got a pretty smile
It covers up the poison that she hides
She walks around in circles in my head
Waiting for a chance to break me chance to take me down
Now I see the burden you gave me
Is too much to carry too much to bury inside

I guess you're the only one that nobody changes
I guess you're the only one left standing

When everything else goes down
You're still the only one
Yeah you're still the only one

It's all shallow and all so appealing now
I'm up to my ankles and I'm drowning anyway
In a sea of sarcastic faces familiar places
Everything looks quite the same here
It's all confusingly amusing
Bitter and tainted the picture you painted to me

I guess you're the only one that nobody changes
I guess you're the only one left standing
When everything else goes down
You're still the only one
Who hasn't changed faces
I guess you're the only one left standing
When everything else goes down



Just because it's all in your head
Doesn't mean it has to be in mine
Don't believe what you said
Still can't get it out of my mind
I've tried to find myself in approval
I've already been there already done that
It got me nowhere it brought me nothing
But a good place to hide and no one to confide in now

I guess you're the only one that nobody changes
I guess you're the only one that will never change faces
I guess you're the only one1Embed
