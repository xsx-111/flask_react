Check Baby LyricsCheck baby, check baby
One, two, three
That’s alright with me
Singing playing all the time
Now hey look, lucky me
Always been in touch with reality you see
Ahh check old man, check old man
Check all the cables and the chain
Yeah check baby, check baby
One, two, three
It’s alright with me
Amphetamine, amphetamine
You know what I mean
She got a real kick to her
Yeah balls to the balls to the balls to the walls to the walls
Watch the man, watch the man
Watch him as he walking around the world
Yeah it's balls to the walls to the walls to the walls to the walls
Check baby, check baby
One, two, three
That's alright with me
Hey, hey look look at me
Always been in touch with the world, obviously
Yeah, check baby, check baby
Three, four, five
Never no jive talking turkey, not me
And check old man, check old man
Check all the cables and the chain
And get back at me, get back at me
When its safe to sling up my six-string
Then it's easy like four, five, six
Anybody got a pick?
Check baby, check baby
All day 'round I was very lost but now I'm way unfound
Check brother, check brother
Check, what a world we’ve inherited from another mother
What a whale of a pickle
What a spell we are all pinned under
We give the devil a warm embrace and then we
Run like chickens from the dickens
But you wanna go to heaven when you D-I-E
That's alright with me
It’s easy like four, five, six
Anybody got a pick? Alright
Yeah, check it, old man
Ahh, check baby, check baby
Four and five
Never no jive talking turkey
Yeah, check old man, check old man
Check all the cables if you're able
It's easy like four, five, six
Anybody got a pick?
Then through the rest it's slick, slick licks
Then rub my belly with a stick of hot butter
All over, baby, all over
Then watch the man, watch the man
Watch him as he walking around the world
Watch the man, watch the man
Watch him as he walking around the world
And the crybabies, crybabies
Talking, talking trash while sitting still eternally
When I said I was in my element
I'm in a whale of a pickle I stumbled underEmbed
