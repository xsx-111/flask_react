Bassackwards Lyrics
What's in real...what's in real time?
Ha ha ha

I was on the beach, but I was thinking about the bay
Got to the bay, but by then I was far away
I was on the ground but looking straight into the sun
But the sun went down and I couldn't find another one
For awhile
For because it was an all-burning feeling in my chest
To fill the void
Of a long night unwatched by, well, the sun
Until the morn
Until when, well, the sun's reborn
And so am I
From all the scorn buried deep
Within the psyche of my soul
I was standing down but I was also on the run
In my mind
I was on the radio talking with a friend of mine
There wasn't no format because well, we like it like that
He was out of his mind and I was way out of mine
Then everything went backwards
With words coming out
Bassackwards
And I appreciate him to the utmost degree
I was on the beach, but I was thinking about the bay
Got to the bay, but by then I was far away
I was on the ground, but looking straight into the sun
But the sun went down and I couldn't find another one
For a while
To fill the void
Until the morn
Then everything went backwards
I mean, phrases flying out
Bassackwards
I was on the Moon, but more so, I was in the grass
So I was chilling out, but with a very drifting mind
So I was on the ground circa planet Earth
But outta sorts, but I snapped back, baby
Just in time to jot it down and come around
It's always nice to see you
And I came around
It's always nice to see you here when I come around
Or when I'm plain come, comin' down
Then everything goes backwards
I mean, everything moving out
Then everything goes backwards
I mean, everything oozing out
Bassackwards
(Strumming a Chet Atkins)
I was standing up
But you know I hate to still stoop you down
To my level
Bassackwards
And I appreciate her to the utmost degree
Then everything went backwards
I mean, words coming out
Bassackwards
Just the way things is these days
Just the way they come out these days
Just the way things come out
Yeah, c'mon
To the utmost degree3Embed
