Mutinies Lyrics
The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pills and pills to try and make 'em go away
Small computer in my hand explodin'
I think things were way easier with a regular telephone and
Impunity and disillusionment
I guess we see now just how far that went
Jupiter and Saturn
Think I'm noticing a pattern

The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pill and pill try and make 'em go away
The little man in my head take over
Drive me man, then he drive away in a Land Rover
Yeah

The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pills and pills try and make 'em go away
Small computer in my hand explodin'
I think things were way easier with a regular telephone and
Impunity and disillusionment
I guess we see now just how far that went
Jupiter and Saturn
I think I'm noticing a pattern
The mutinies in my head keep staying
I take pills and pills try and make 'em go away
The little man in my head take over
Drive me man, then he drive away in a Land Rover (gone)Embed
