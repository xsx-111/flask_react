Cold Was the Wind LyricsCold was the wind on my frozen face
But I didn't mind, cause I was long gone
Cold was the wind upon my brow
Below that, well, you don't wanna know at all
Cold, was the wind (Yeah)
Christmas in Siberia with the little bitty case of the delirium tremens
For some reason, picture Roger Clemens
But Mike Schmidt's more of the city I came with
Crossed my heart, hoped to die
Stick a needle in my, butter around your bread
Cold was the wind on my naked brow
Below it, well, you don't wanna know at all
Cold, wind, blows
Cold wind blows on my naked brow
Sun sits down on the sacred cow
You better Goddamn miss me when I'm gone
'Cause God's gonna damn me up and down now
Wherever it is, they're gonna give me the business
Whoever it is, gonna miss my girls
On the plane I'm drinkin red wine, 'cause like everybody else I'm afraid to die
Did I mention that I'm afraid of dying, think I heard my daughter crying
So I pick her on up, spin her around, live it on up, of what I found
Cold wind blow on my brow
Below it, well, you don't wanna know at all
Cold, wind, blowsEmbed
