Hysteria LyricsDon't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you, girl, and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details
Like, mm girl you gave me rabies
And I don't mean maybe
Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you, girl, and
What's your name boy?
You know the devils in the details
Like, mm girl you gave me rabies
And I don't mean maybe
I took a drink of head dream smoothie
All of a sudden I'm feeling very loopy
Don't you know I really love you now

Stop this plane 'cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud
Watch me get out
Watch me go down
And the rest is hysteria
And I stole that
But hey mom, look at me now
Stop this plane 'cause I wanna get off
Pull over somewhere on the side of a cloud and
Watch me get out
Watch me go down
And the rest is hysteria
And I stole that
But hey mom, look at me now
That's what it's all about
Don't you know I never knew you
But I, but I think I love you girl and
What's your name?
Boy you know the devil's in the details, like
But hey mom, look at me now
Hey mom, hey momEmbed
