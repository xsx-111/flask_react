Yeah Bones Lyrics(One, two, three, four)

When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones over it
You'll only leave yourself lonesome
To show for it
When nobody calls you on the phone
Don't break your bones
Dyin' dead in a black sea of tears over me

When you're runnin' on the run
But you run, run too far (Tomfoolin' and buckwild)
Deep in the country wildcats get shot at
When you're runnin' on the run
But you run too far
Where the rednecks raise hell
With the shotgun shell (blast!)


When nobody calls me on the phone
Won't break my bones over it
I don't believe myself lonesome
To show for that
When nobody calls me on the phone
Won't break my bones
Dyin' dead in a black sea of tears over me
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)
(Over me, over me, over me now)Embed
