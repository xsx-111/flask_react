Rollin with the Flow Lyrics(How's it goin'?)

Once was a thought inside my head
'Fore I reached thirty I'd be dead
Now somehow on and on I go
I keep on rollin' with the flow

Folks said that I would change my mind
I'd straighten up and do just fine
Aw, but I still love rock and roll
I keep on rollin' with the flow

While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
And they forgive me of my sins

Some might be callin' me a bum
But I'm still out there havin' fun
And Jesus loves me, yes, I know
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
(Keep on rollin', keep on)
(Keep on rollin')
While guys my age are raising kids
I'm raisin' hell just like I did
I've got a lot of crazy friends
They forgive me of my sins

Can't take it with you when you're gone
But I want enough to get there on
And I ain't never growin' old
So, I keep on rollin' with the flow
I ain't ever growin' old
If I keep on rollin' with the flow
Keep on rollin', keep on rollin'
Keep on rollin'Embed
