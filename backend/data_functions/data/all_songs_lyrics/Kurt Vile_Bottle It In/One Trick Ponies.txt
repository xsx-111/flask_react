One Trick Ponies Lyrics
Woah, shit, yeah
Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind

Loved them all through many a lifetime
Some are gone, but some still strong
Some are weird as hell, but we love 'em
Some are one trick ponies, but we embrace 'em
'Cause I've always had a soft spot for repetition

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind
(Oooo)

Loved you all a long, long time
Looked long into the length of a tunnel
Called all your names
And we was tripping out 'cause we needed a way out
And all them other crystalline mystic rationalizations
Loved them all right down to my soul
Looked well into the depth of a hole
Pondered perpetual motion in the echo
Just like the song if the repeats were long

Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind
(Oooo)

Loved you all a long, long while
And I'd give my left- (nevermind) for one big synchronized smile
Some are one trick ponies but so am I
Round 'em up into a mixed bag bundle of love now

Loved them all a long, long tick
And it's four, five, six
Prevent your schtick
Throw 'em at the wall into a mixed bag and see if they stick
And give 'em a glass of water
Give 'em a cherry pie
Loved you all a long, long while
Looked down into a deep, dark well
Called all your names
They echoed down for miles and miles
And all that other mystical, well, never-you-mind
(Oooo)Embed
