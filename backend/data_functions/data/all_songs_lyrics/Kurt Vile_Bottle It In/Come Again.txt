Come Again Lyrics
Autumn come and winter gone
Then spring came all over the lawn
I wanna die then be reborn
Like seasons come and go and come again

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
The world had better come around

I feel it in my chest
I feel it in my soul
The music and the whiskey
And it's warm and nurturing in a weird way
I feel it in my face right now when I sing
And it makes me wanna cry and scream and cry and

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
Could use a little help comin' around
Autumn come and winter go
Then spring sprayed all over, all we know
Then summer come in raging, brought my blood right to a boil
But even the heat too turned around and went
But it was a long one

Come again, come again
What was that you said?
Come again, come again
C-c-come on down
The world had better come around
Come again, come again
Come again, yeah
Come again1Embed
