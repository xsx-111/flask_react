Loading Zones Lyrics
Back is aching but I cannot sleep
'Cause I won't be beat like I am the mayor of some godforsaken town
Sure, they knighted me yesterday
But who needs armor when I've an exoskeleton?
I slip and squirm through the cracks
Creep around by the, all the loading zones in my dirty little town
Get my shopping done, laundry too
Drop some dead weight, clean my hands of what I need to clean my hands of
And all for free by mayoral decree
All from zone to loading zone of my town, yeah

Three grumpy girls and a dying daddy
But oh so gorgeous the way they crave
How beautiful to take a bite out of the world
I want to rip the world a new one
It just crawls out of my mouth anymore
You can hate on it or you can hug it
You can get all mushy and lovey-dovey
It's all the same when I'm out there driving around
All from zone to loading zone of my beautiful town

I park for free
One stop shop life for the quick fix
Before you get a ticket
That's the way I live my life
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free
I park for free5Embed
