Skinny Mini LyricsShe's a free-wheeling lady baby high-strung well-off (fuck... c'mon)
She's a free-wheeling lady baby high-strung well-off
In the brains and she means way well
She's a little bit skinny mini girl child old soul she grown up real well
She'll chew you out if you deserve it, man, but I kinda like it and I really love her
She's a wild kind of muskrat, scrappy mofo stay that way baby girl and I love you so
Never gonna let her go (no no no)
She got a wild brain, but so do I sometimes and I don't know why, you gotta die
She wanna clean up the world but I'm drowning in dirt
I wanna clean up the world (but I can't)
I wanna, give me a kiss girl
I wanna, wow would you look at that
I wanna, damn she sure is fine
I wanna, damn she just blew my mind alright (woah alright)
She's a skinny little, scrappy little, wild talking, all good-kind, always means well, baby girl, dandelion, flower child
All substance, no jive-talkin', fast walkin', girl babe
You might wanna roll her up in a ball and eat her in a sandwich, but it's mine man
She's a sweet talkin' honey in the raw
Flaming fast jaw flappin' woo!
Bee buzzing babe, well buzz awhile
It's a big old bulbous world at a boiling point
But she's always right there
She gets in your hair like bubblegum
But you love it and you need some schooling
Babe I would recommend, yeah (Fuck!)
She's a skinny mini little baby girl child
All fast walkin' no jive talkin' baby
She's a real wild card you know and I know you know man
I wanna give me a kiss girl
I wanna, wow would you look at that
I wanna, damn she sure is fine
I wanna, damn she just blew my mind
She make me cross my I's and dot my T's if you know what I meanEmbed
