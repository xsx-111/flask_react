Blue Moon LyricsI'm so tired of being alone
These penitent walls are all I've known
The songbird calling
Across the water
Outside my silent asylum
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone

So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time
See the turncoat on his knees
The vagabond that no one sees
When that moon stole your shadows
When you can't save the ones you caught in battle
Oh, don't leave me on my own
Left me standing all alone
Cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies you tried to hide
Behind your eyes
Don't leave me on my own
Don't leave me on my own

So cut me down to size
So I can fit inside
Lies that will divide
Us both in time30Embed
