Morning Lyrics
Woke up this morning
From a long night in the storm
Looked up this morning
Saw the roses full of thorns
Mountains are falling
They don't have nowhere to go
The ocean's a diamond
That only shines when you're alone
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I've lost all my defenses
This morning
Won't you show me the way
It used to be?

We've gone all around
'Til there's nothing left to say
We've worn it all down
Into something that couldn't be saved
You tore it all down
And bury me underneath the weight
But can we start it all over again?
This morning
I let down my defenses
This morning
It was just you and me
This morning
I've run all out of guesses
This morning
Won't you show me the way
It could've been?13Embed
