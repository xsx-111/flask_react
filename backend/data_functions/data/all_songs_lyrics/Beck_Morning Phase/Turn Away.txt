Turn Away Lyrics
Turn
Turn away
From the sound of your own voice
Calling no one
Just a silence
Learn to see around the edge
Follow the avalanche
Turn away

Hold
Hold the line
That fixes you in time
Keeps you under
Takes you over
The wall that love divides
Between
Waking and slumber
Turn away

Turn
Turn away
From the weight of your own words
It's a measure
For the devil
And betrays the lack of change
Once you have spoken
