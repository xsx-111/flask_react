Waking Light Lyrics
Waking light
Your profile in shadow
Raise yourself to the morning alone
Night is gone
Long way of turning
You've waited long enough to know

When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Lay me down in waking light

No one sees you here
Roots are all covered
There's such a length to go
And how much can you show?
Day is gone
On a landslide of ribbon
I've seen your lamplight burning low

When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Rest your eyes in waking light
When the memory leaves you
Somewhere you can't make it home
When the morning comes to meet you
Fill your eyes with waking light1Embed
