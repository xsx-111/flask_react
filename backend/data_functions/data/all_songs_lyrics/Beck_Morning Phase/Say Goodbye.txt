Say Goodbye Lyrics
See the sleep
That rests upon
The quiet street
We're standing on
Is it time to go away?
Try again some other day?

These are the words we use
To say goodbye
These are the words you use
To say goodbye

Bones crack
Curtains drawn
On my back
And she is gone
Somewhere else
I do not know
Time will tell
And I will go

These are the words we use
To say goodbye
These are the words we use
To say goodbye
I will wait
Take a turn
Sort it out
Let it burn
And empty out
An empty drawer
In my pockets
There's nothing more

These are the words you use
To say goodbye
These are the words we use
To say goodbye4Embed
