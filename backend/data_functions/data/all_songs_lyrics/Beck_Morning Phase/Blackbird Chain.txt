Blackbird Chain Lyrics
Give me traces of your lifeblood flowing
In a loving cup
And tell me I'm dream dream dream dreaming
And I'll never wake up:
A keepsake in a dresser drawer
From who-knows-where
A symbol of your exegesis
And a full-length mirror

I'll never never never never never never refuse you
I'll never never never never never never refuse you
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird chain
My blackbird
Chain

An SOS from an outpost there
And a common air
Now I could read you a brief account
Of a last frontier
We could come to understand what's wrong
As right as rain
At rock bottom of a hollowed ground
Restake your claim
