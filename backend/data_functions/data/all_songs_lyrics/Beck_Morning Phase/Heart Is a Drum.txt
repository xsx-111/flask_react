Heart Is a Drum Lyrics
Free
As a driving wheel
Circling around your iron will;
See-
Only what you feel
Keeps you turning when you’re standing still

You tried to run from trouble; when it comes
You follow the drum
Keeping time with everyone

High
As the light of day
Falling down across your lost highway;
Why
Does it hurt this way?
To come so far to find they've closed the gates?

You’ve lost your tongue; when you fall from the pendulum
Your heart is a drum
Keeping time with everyone
Everyone
If they drown from the undertow
Need to find someone
To show me how to play it slow
And just let it go

Your eyes get stung by the rays of the sinking sun
You follow the drum
Keeping time with everyone

Going, “beat, beat, beat”
It’s beating me down
“Beat, beat, beat, beat”
It’s beating me down
Day after day
It’s turning me round
Till all my days are drowning out9Embed
