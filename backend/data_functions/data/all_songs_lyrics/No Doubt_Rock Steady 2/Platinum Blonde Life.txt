Platinum Blonde Life Lyrics
I'm closing out the curtains
So don't you even bother
And they're calling out murder
But I'm underneath the covers

And who's fooling who
With this mood like a train
Watch me roll over
Get out of my way

And there's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away

I want a platinum blonde life
So I keep bleaching out the color
I try to do what I oughta
But never drink enough water

And where did my lamb go?
I wish he could stay
I feel as empty as a widow
I'm gonna sleep it all away
And there's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away

I'm gonna sleep all through the day
I'm gonna sleep my life away
I'm gonna sleep all through the day
I'm gonna sleep myself away
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away

And there's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away
And there's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away
And there's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away
And there's a knock on my door
But I'm not gonna open it
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go away
I'm gonna close my eyes
And maybe it'll go awayEmbed
