Detective Lyrics
Peek in, sneak about
Peek in, sneak about
Peek in, sneak about
Your broken hearted detective

Hey girl, save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
Hey girl, save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?

My back it hurts again
It aches like history
Cottonmouth and all lit up
You’re smiling back at me
But I feel you must have failed me
Once again, you’ve let me down
My confidence below my knees now
I need to find you out

Peek in, sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you, your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective
(Hey, hey, hey)
Hey lover, why the gun?
Hold on, I’m almost there
It’s too late, you killed the trust
Don’t act so unaware
So why are you so destructive?
Do you realize what you've done?
You can’t bring it back to life now
What are you running from?

Peek in, sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you, your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective

I don’t like the way I feel
I just want you to be real

Hey girl, save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
Hey girl, save the liar
Can’t you see his pants on fire?
I’m rummaging through your closet
Imagining all the worst thoughts
Peek in, sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you, your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective
Peek in, sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you, your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective
Peek in
Peek in
Peek in
Peek in
Peek in, sneak about
I’m gonna snoop and call you out
I caught you, your hands are red
Now I’m your broken hearted detective1Embed
