Waiting Room Lyrics
I signed in my name
I guess I'll have to wait a while
I wanna play this game
Call me up if you know how to dial

You always had my number
You need to be my lover
Humiliation, I'm in the waiting room
If we both want the love and I wait long enough
Then the ground that we're on might be common

All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone in the waiting room

When you’re burning solitude
It can get real thick
If desire is your only food
It can get you sick

You know you're so fine (so fine)
I'm over here standing in this line
(Just a-wait) Just a-waiting in the waiting room
If we both want the love and I wait long enough
Then the ground that we’re on might be common
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you, hey
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone, I'm all alone in the waiting room

While I'm in the waiting room
A thousand thoughts I think of you
Whatever you did has got me glued
It's icky, it's sticky ooh
You're the one I’m dreaming of
Why does this feel like wasted time
(What a price) What a price this traveling love?
You and me trapped between these lines
Ooh, you're so mine
If we both want the love and I wait long enough
Then the ground that we’re on might be common

All I can do is wait for you (I'm just waiting for you)
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you (you know you need to be my love)
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
All I can do is wait for you
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone, I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone, I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone in the waiting room
I'm all alone, I'm all alone in the waiting room
Will you call me when it's my turn?Embed
