The Story Lyrics
I've been thinking of everything
I used to want to be
I've been thinking of everything
Of me, of you and me

This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)
This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)

I'm in the middle of nothing
And it's where I want to be
I'm at the bottom of everything
And I finally start to leave

This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)
This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)

And I swear to God
I've found myself in the end
And I swear to God
I've found myself in the end
And I swear to God
I've found myself in the end, in the end
And I swear to God
I've found myself in the end, in the end
In the end, in the end, in the end

This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)
This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)

This is the story of my life
(And these are the lies I have created)3Embed
