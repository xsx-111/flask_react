The Fantasy Lyrics
With the lights out, it's a little less dangerous
Even with a stranger, never gets painless
Don't be afraid
Every time I think I'm gonna change it
It's driving me insane
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Do you live, do you die
Do you bleed for the fantasy?
In your mind, through your eyes
Do you see, it's the fantasy?

Maybe tonight we can forget about it all
It could be just like Heaven
I am a machine, no longer living
Just a shell of what I dreamed
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Do you live, do you die
Do you bleed for the fantasy?
In your mind, through your eyes
Do you see, it's the fantasy?
Say it, say it, say that you believe
Say it, say it to me

Oh-woah (Oh-woah)
Oh-woah-oh-oh (Oh-woah-oh-oh)
Oh-woah (Oh-woah)
Oh-woah-oh-oh (Oh-woah-oh-oh)

Do you live, do you die
Do you bleed for the fantasy?
Automatic, I imagine, I believe


Do you live, do you die
Do you bleed for the fantasy?

Do you live, do you die
Do you bleed for the fantasy?
In your mind, through your eyes
Do you see, it's the fantasy?
Automatic, I imagine, I believe
Automatic, I imagine, I believe
(Automatic, I imagine, I believe)
Say it, say it, say that you believe
(Automatic, I imagine, I believe)
Say it, say it to me
(Automatic, I imagine, I believe)
Say it, say it, say that you believe
(Automatic, I imagine, I believe)
Say it, say it to me
I believe, I believe, I believe4Embed
