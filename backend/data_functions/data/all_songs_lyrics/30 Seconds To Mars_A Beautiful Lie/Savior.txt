Savior Lyrics
You always do that, too--
I know, I know, I don't know why...
He's always so sure about something
You have conviction and I appreciate that
Sometimes conviction can lead to stubbornness

Until you crash, until you burn
Until you lie, until you learn
Until you see, until you believe
Until you fight, until you fall
Until the end of everything at all
Until you die, until you are alive

Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care

Until you give, until you've used
Until you've lost, until you lose
Until you've seen, how could you believe?
Until you've lived a thousand times
Until you've seen the other side
This is my chance, this is my chance

Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care

Until the truth becomes a lie
Until you change, until you deny
Until you believe
This is my chance, this is my chance
I'll take it now, because I can
This is my chance, I want it now

Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care
Don't save me, don't save me
'Cause I don't care

Save me, save me (I don't care!)
Save me, save me (I don't care!)
Save me, save me (I don't care!)
I don't care!3Embed
