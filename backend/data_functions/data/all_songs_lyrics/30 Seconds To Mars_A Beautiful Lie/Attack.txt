Attack Lyrics
I won't suffer, be broken, get tired, or wasted
Surrender to nothing, or will give up what I
Started and stop this, from end to beginning
A new day is coming, and I am finally free

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack

Kill off this thinking, it's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now, but without you I can finally see

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack

Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife
I promise you, I promise you
I am finally free
Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack
I will attack

Your promises
I promise you, I promise you10Embed
