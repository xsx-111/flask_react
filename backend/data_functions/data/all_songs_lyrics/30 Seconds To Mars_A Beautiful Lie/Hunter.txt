Hunter Lyrics
If travel is searching
And home what's been found
I'm not stopping

I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'll bring back the goods
But I don't know when

I thought, I could organize freedom
How American of me
This is soon
You figured it out, didn't you?

You could smell it
So you left me on my own
To complete the mission
Now leave it all behind

I'm going hunting
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
I'm the hunter
You just didn't know me
You just didn't know me
You just didn't know me
You just didn't know me
You just didn't know me
You just didn't know me
You just didn't know me1Embed
