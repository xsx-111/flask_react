The Kill (Acoustic) Lyrics
What if I wanted to break
Laugh it all off in your face
What would you do?
E se eu desmoronar
Se não pudesse mais aguentar
O que você faria?

Come break me down
Bury me, bury me!
I am finished with you!

E se eu quisesse lutar
Pelo resto da vida implorar
O que você faria?
Say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you

Come break me down
Bury me, bury me!
I am finishing with you!
Look in my eyes
You're killing me, killing me!
All I wanted was you!
I tried to be someone else (Someone else)
But nothing seemed to change
I know now, this is who I really am inside!
Finally found myself
Fighting for a chance I know now
This is who I really am!
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Come break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killing me, killing me
All I wanted was youEmbed
