Radio Apeshot Lyrics
Slim came, guts out
Blowing like a saxophone
Chopped his boulevard turn again
Super lady
Heads turned down
Drooling bastards
In case they're never found

Radio apeshot
A fool caught down
Pretend it's stone groovy, groovy
Nothing like a tin crown

Slam cocks his heat
God, it's nothing but a cap gun
Wipe those blue-dick ghosts away
More protection
Goose that mod squad
His minds a beauty cage
But his hands are stone gray

Can't see anything better
The colors always get in the way
Find the communique severed
Over and over again
Radio apeshot
A fool caught down
Pretend it's stone groovy, groovy
Nothing like a tin crown

You have radio apeshot
A fool caught down
Pretend it's stone groovy, groovy
Nothing like a tin crownEmbed
