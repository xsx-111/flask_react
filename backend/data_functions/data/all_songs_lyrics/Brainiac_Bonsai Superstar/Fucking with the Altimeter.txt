Fucking with the Altimeter Lyrics
Give me some love
Give me some love
Give me some love
God save us all!

No more flowers for you
So when you see an empty vase you'll know it's supposed to be a clue
Not just a mishap, some kind of creep forgot

Now, tell me, how does paralysis feel?
Like you're trapped in a light beam, a part of the atom stream that oozes down through the glass
But not through me, you can't penetrate my physical field

Tipped with silver airplanes, quiver down
Under the fuselage
Elementary aeronautics ground
Look at me now, I'm a wreck!
How 'bout a kiss?

My oxygen's lost in those lungs again
Somebody give me some oxygen
I need to breathe!
Before I forget
I'm going into oxygen debt
I think your flesh is separated from the sins it commits and that explains why you smile when you balance on your stack of regrets
Nobody's with you this time
How does it feel?

One flight down the aeronaut was found
Under the fuselage
Cleanse before we feed the carnivore
But look at me now, I'm a wreck!

Such a pretty birdEmbed
