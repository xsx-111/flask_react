Sexual Frustration Lyrics
Unintelligible 

Boom shalocka locka
Ooh I think she likes me
Boom shalocka locka
Ooh she really likes me

Why will it take so long
For me to say yeah find my big fuckin' 80
Stop it with my reasonable eye
I've got my hand stuffed into my suit
I can see you killing time
Until the pills combine
To make a monster with a chemical glare
In a ray of armor suitable attempts
So remember that I don't take dares

Spare me my brace
(In a motion attack)
Gouge my eyes
(Burn for the slack king)
Boom shalocka locka
Ooh I think she likes me
Boom shalocka locka
Ooh she really likes me

I put my hand into my suit again
'Cause I'm fixing on the kick of the beats
A three o'clock shadow
Soaks my bone to the marrow
As the shuttlecock is breaking me loose
Well a crack-team breakdown
Caught me on a stakeout
Kissing everything I could see
They got my testimony on a lie detector
Broke the needle so they're setting me free

Spare my brace
(Motion attack)
Gouge my eyes
(Motion attacking)
Spare my brace
(Another's attack)
Gouge my eyes
(Motion attacking)
Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!
Uh-huh!
So damn tired with the masturbation
My doctor walked away with an application 
But I think I found a cure for my sexual frustration

Boom shalocka locka
Ooh, I think she likes me
Boom shalocka locka
Yeah, she really likes me
Boom shalocka locka
Ooh, I think she likes me
Boom shalocka locka oh

Spare my brace
(In a motion attack)
Gouge my eyes
(Burn for the slack king)
Spare my brace
(Another's attack)
Gouge my eyes
(Burn for the slack king)
Uh-huh!Embed
