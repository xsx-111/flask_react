Flypaper Lyrics
New flypapers out tonight
I'm smarter than every parasite
Nowhere to cut them free, but I want to
Do catch me if you can
You stole my mama and papa, I could stand
I could fly so high through the tree, if I want to

Flip your boss, let's run away
My busty baby doll and a car today
Can you say your dirty words
And balance a book on top of your head?
How silly you look

Your smoke sucks me down the flue
And pulls on me backwards to the arms of you
Well, it bows the man with your hands, if you want to

Flip your boss, let's run away
My busty baby doll and a car today
Can you say your dirty words
And balance a book on top of your head?
How silly you look
How silly you look
How silly you look
How silly you look
How silly you look
How silly you look

Oh
(Whimpering)
Oh my dirty
(Whimpering)
Hold me down1Embed
