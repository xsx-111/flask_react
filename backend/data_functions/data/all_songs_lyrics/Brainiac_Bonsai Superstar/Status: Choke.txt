Status: Choke Lyrics
Where have my daisies gone?
Can I forget the sting?
One thousand flowers are storming the walls to defect to the midget-king

Today there's something caught in my quiver
A cauliflower-fisted dream
The shaman inside of the sty in my eye's prediction
Absurd!

You can take your status
Choke! Choke!
Put your fingers down your throat
Choke! Choke!
Take your status
Choke! Choke!
Put your fingers down your throat
Choke! Choke!

Oh, don't turn away
Now that I'm through with you
Say that you're afraid
Find me some lard to fry
My daisies are coming home
Choke! Choke!
Choke! Choke!
Choke! Choke!

Where have my daisies?
Where have my daisies?
Where have my daisies?
Where have my daisies?
Where have my daisies?Embed
