To the Baby-Counter Lyrics
I don't mean to be rude, Marimari
But I wish you were someone else

I know that I'm on the first trip out
And my put me out on the back
A silhouette grows
Superimposed
And so I can cut through the crack

A sparrow's severed beak could never
Sing on its own
Bankers, beggars it's a mistake it
Just to find
Eye in the sky

Hey, hey
We need to stop, hey hey
Hey, hey
We need to stop, hey hey

Mortar shell forgets all the rest
And I can feel the report
Chica-boom-boom, Chica-boom-boom
Smile is an illusion
A stack of emotions
From the millisecond shot
A sparrow's severed beak could never
Sing on its own
Bankers, beggars
In silence, together
Scrape that off
I'm in disguise

Hey, hey
We need another baby
Hey, hey
We need another baby

Aaaahh!
Let me pull the lever, let me pull the lever!
Ahh!

Hey, hey
Baby-counter, hey hey
Hey, hey
Baby-counter, hey hey
Hey!
Hey! (Hey!)
Hey! (Hey!)
Hey! Hey!
Hey!Embed
