Juicy (On a Cadillac) Lyrics
One, two, three, four
I got attention 

My juicy says she's a crazy, crazy child
Says she's so kooky, but I don't believe in the child

I don't know what I'm gon' do
Juicy on a Cadillac 

Says she goes wacky...
And a bonsai stretch
Before get my baby, hey

I was killed by time
I don't know what I'm gon' do
Juicy on a Cadillac 
Juicy
My juicy do mine, so I sleep behind the wheel
Well I got one more pocket
I don't remember how to drive a car 
I get so so goddamn bad

I don't know what I'm gon' do??
Juicy on a Cadillac 

Juicy
Oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohEmbed
