You Wrecked My Hair Lyrics
"Take for example, a local advertiser, she says to me
But why is everyone... First lane, sesame oil... entrance." 

I struggle to control myself
And laugh at the jokes because
They're supposed to be funny, can't help it
Gentlemen employed
Like friction of a fictional thought
Consumed by a passion, a struggling action
Swing the seven, swing the nine and fall
To a sour old man with palsied hands
Dirty fingers and a billiard ball
While the man on the wire says
"My face is on fire
So cancel all my calls"
While the man on the wire with a jumbled line
 on the walls

Call it a crutch
If you want to
I don't understand
If I don't want to
I said attention
I said attention
I think I like you better with a stick in your hand
Cause it seems to me like you were always meant to be
Liberated on the stain  to crawl
Please stop it and I'll do it again
You put your hands in your pockets and I'll do it again
You shoot off your bottle rockets and I'll do it again and again
And all over the place

I said the man on the wire says my face is on fire
So cancel all my calls
Yeah the man on the wire with a jumbled line
 on the walls

Well call it a crutch
If you want to
I don't understand
If I don't want to
I said attention
I said attention

Wrists and tits and snout
Ya gotta 
Wrists and tits and snout
That's what this fable's about
Wrists
The man on the wire says my face is on fire
So cancel all my calls
Yeah the man on the wire with a jumbled line
 on the walls

So call it a crutch
If you want to
I don't understand
If I don't want to
I said attention
I said attention

Wrists and tits and snout
Ya gotta  out
Wrists and tits and snout
That's what this fable's about
Aaahhh!
Wrists and tits and snout
That's what this fable's about
I said attention
I said attentionEmbed
