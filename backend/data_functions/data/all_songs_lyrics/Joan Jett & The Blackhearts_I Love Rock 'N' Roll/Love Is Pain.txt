Love Is Pain Lyrics
Hey, you must obey
While you will bleed, you know I need to get my way
So now, you listen up
You are my pup, I'll beat you up in every way
And when I speak to you
You answer true or I will make you black and blue
I love to make you wait
You take the bait, I know you hate and love me too

We are not to blame
For seeing love is pain
And we are not ashamed
To say that love is pain
And we'll do it again

I know you're not afraid
'Cause when you stayed, you knew you made the final show
So now, you must submit
I'll never quit to you, admit you'll never go

We are not to blame
For seeing love is pain
And we are not ashamed
To say that love is pain
We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed
We are not ashamed
To say that love is pain
And we'll do it againEmbed
