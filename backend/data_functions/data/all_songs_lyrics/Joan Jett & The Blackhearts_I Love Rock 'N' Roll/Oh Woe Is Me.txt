Oh Woe Is Me Lyrics
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

What happened to my heroes?
They seemed to disappear
The idols keep on singin'
But they don't sound sincere

Oh, woe is me
(Hey)
(Hey)
Oh, woe is me
(Hey)
(Hey)

I don't got no money
All I got's a name
The future's lookin' hazy
But who can I blame?
Oh, woe is me
(Hey)
(Hey)
Oh, woe is me
(Hey)
Is me (Hey)
(Hey)
Woe is me (Hey)
(Hey)
Is me, me, me, me, me (Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)

What happened to the parties?
I thought they'd never end
I lost my only lover
Proves you can't trust a friend

Oh, woe is me
(Hey)
(Hey)
Oh, woe is me
(Hey)
(Hey)
Oh, woe is me (Hey, hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
Oh, woe is me (Hey, hey)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey, hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)
(Hey)Embed
