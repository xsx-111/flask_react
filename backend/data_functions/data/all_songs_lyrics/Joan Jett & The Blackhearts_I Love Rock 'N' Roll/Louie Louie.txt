Louie Louie Lyrics
Louie, Louie, whoa, baby
Say we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Say we gotta go

Fine little boy, he waits for me
He gets his fill, oh, constantly
Seen him playin' 'round 'bout an hour ago
He's never without, I'm waitin' at home

Louie, Louie, whoa, baby
Say we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Say we gotta go

Every night at ten I see him again
I think of him, oh, constantly
Goin' anywhere and he takes me there
Goin' down the road right in his ear
Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Say we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Say we gotta go

All right
Meet my maker, I know my part
It won't be long, please touch my heart
Take him in my arms again
Dug her eyes, they never leave you again

Say, Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Say we gotta go
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say Louie, Louie, oh, baby
Say we gotta go

Say we gotta go now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We gotta go now
Louie, Louie, oh, baby
We gotta go now1Embed
