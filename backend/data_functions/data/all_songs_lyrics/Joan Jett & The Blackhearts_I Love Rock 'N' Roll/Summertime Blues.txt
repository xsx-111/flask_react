Summertime Blues Lyrics
Well, I'm gonna raise a fuss and I'm gonna raise a holler
About workin' all summer just tryin' to earn a dollar
Well, I went to my boss that governs me
He said "No, dice, bud, you gotta work late"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm ever gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Well, my mom and papa told me, "Now you better earn some money"
If one of you is gonna go ridin' next Sunday
Well, I didn't go to work, I told my boss I was sick
He said, "You can't use the car 'cause you didn't work a lick"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm ever gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Gonna save two weeks, gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problem to the United Nations
Well, I went to my Congressman, he sent me back a note
It said, "I'd like to help you, hon, but you're too young to vote"
Sometimes I wonder what I'm ever gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues

Now there ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Now there ain't no cure for the summertime bluesEmbed
