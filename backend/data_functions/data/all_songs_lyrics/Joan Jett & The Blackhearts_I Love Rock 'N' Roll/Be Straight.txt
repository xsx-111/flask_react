Be Straight Lyrics
I don't believe you should live by the rules
I don't wanna listen when life's so cruel
We're not sorry for things we do and my advice to you
Ow

I never listen to things they say
'Cause what you hear, it gets in your way
I'm not gonna be on your side if I find out you lied
Ow

When you talk to me (Be straight)
When I take you home (Be straight)
Anyone can do what they wanna do if you wanna be (Be straight)
(Be straight)

Everybody needs a shoulder to cry on
And I am one that you can rely on
If you wanna know my opinion, It don't matter 'bout what you've been in, yeah
Ow

When you talk to me (Be straight)
When I take you home (Be straight)
Anyone can do what they wanna do if you wanna be (Be straight)
(Be straight)
When you talk to me (Be straight)
When I take you home (Be straight)
Anyone can do what they wanna do if you wanna be (Be straight)
When you talk to me (Be straight)
When I take you home (Be straight)
Anyone can do what they wanna do if you wanna be (Be straight)
When you talk to me (Be straight)
When I take you home (Be straight)
Anyone can do what they wanna do if you wanna be (Be straight)
If you wanna be (Be straight)
If you wanna be (Be straight)
(Be straight)Embed
