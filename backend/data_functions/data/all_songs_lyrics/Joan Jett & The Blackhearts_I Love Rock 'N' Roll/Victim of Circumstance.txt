Victim of Circumstance Lyrics
The police were waitin' when the sun came up
You better move your ass or we'll really get rough
I never wanted trouble but I sure got enough
I'm bad at bein' subtle but I ain't that tough, no

(Just a victim of circumstance)
Didn't you know?
(Just a victim of circumstance)
Doesn't it show?
(I'm just a victim of circumstance)
Wherever I go
Just a victim of a bad reputation
I got no chance of shakin'

Really gets you down when you don't belong
And everyone around says you growed up wrong
But why do they resent it? I ain't doin' anything
They say that I'm demented and I never could sing
Then everywhere I went I caused them such alarm
You know I never meant to cause anybody harm, no

(Just a victim of circumstance)
Didn't you know?
(Just a victim of circumstance)
Doesn't it show?
(I'm just a victim of circumstance)
Wherever I go
Just a victim of a bad reputation
I got no chance of shakin'
I've been laughed at
I've been shut out
But let there be no doubt
Never been afraid of chances I been takin'

The police are waitin' when the sun came up
You better move your ass or we'll really get rough
I never wanted trouble but I sure get enough
I'm bad at bein' subtle but I ain't that tough, no

(Just a victim of circumstance)
Didn't you know?
(Just a victim of circumstance)
Doesn't it show?
(I'm just a victim of circumstance)
Wherever I go
Just a victim of a bad reputation
I got no chance of shakin', yeahEmbed
