Let X = X LyricsI met this guy
And he looked like might have been
A hat check clerk at an ice rink
Which, in fact, he turned out to be
And I said
Oh boy
Right again
Let X = X
You know, it could be you
It's a sky-blue sky
The satellites are out tonight
Let X = X
You know, I could write a book
And this book would be thick enough to stun an ox
'cause I can see the future, and it's a place
About seventy miles east of here, where it's lighter
Linger on over here
Got the time?
Let X = X
I got this postcard
And it read, it said
Dear Amigo, dear Partner
Listen, uh, I just want to say thanks
So
Thanks
Thanks for all the presents
Thanks for introducing me to the Chief
Thanks for putting on the feedbag
Thanks for going all out
Thanks for showing me your Swiss Army knife
Oh and uh
Thanks for letting me autograph your cast
Hug and kisses
XXXX0000
Oh yeah, P.S
I, I feel, feel like, I am in a burning building, and I gotta go
Cause I, I feel, feel like, I am, in a burning building
And I gotta goEmbed
