From the Air LyricsGood evening. This is your Captain
We are about to attempt a crash landing
Please extinguish all cigarettes
Place your tray tables in their
Upright, locked position
Your Captain says: Put your head on your knees
Your Captain says: Put your head in your hands
Captain says: Put your hands on your head
Put your hands on your hips. Heh heh
This is your Captain - and we are going down
We are all going down, together
And I said: Uh oh. This is gonna be some day
Standby. This is the time
And this is the record of the time
This is the time. And this is the record of the time
Uh - this is your Captain again
You know, I've got a funny feeling I've seen this all before
Why? Cause I'm a caveman
Why? Cause I've got eyes in the back of my head
Why? It's the heat. Standby
This is the time. And this is the record of the time
This is the time. And this is the record of the time
Put your hands over your eyes. Jump out of the plane
There is no pilot. You are not alone. Standby
This is the time. And this is the record of the time
This is the time. And this is the record of the time1Embed
