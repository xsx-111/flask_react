Born, Never Asked  LyricsIt was a large room. Full of people. All kinds
And they had all arrived at the same building
At more or less the same time
And they were all free. And they were all
Asking themselves the same question:
What is behind that curtain?
You were born. And so you're free. So happy birthdayEmbed
