Hi, I'm not home right now
But if you want to leave a message
Just start talking at the sound of the tone
Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Hello? This is your mother, are you there?
Are you coming home?
Ah, ah, ah
Hello? Is anybody home?
Well, you don't know me, but I know you
And I've got a message to give to you
Here come the planes
So you better get ready, ready to go
You can come as you are, but pay as you go, pay as you go
Ah ah ah ah ah
And I said: okay, who is this really? And the voice said:
This is the hand, the hand that takes
This is the hand, the hand that takes
This is the hand, the hand that takes
Here come the planes
They're American planes, made in America
Smoking or non-smoking?
Ah, ah
Ah ah ah ah
And the voice said: Neither snow nor rain nor gloom of night
Shall stay these couriers from the swift completion
Of their appointed rounds

'Cause when love is gone, there's always justice
And when justice is gone, there's always force
And when force is gone, there's always Mom. Hi Mom!
Ah, ah
Ah ah ah ah
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
In your automatic arms, your electronic arms
In your arms
So hold me, Mom, in your long arms
Your petrochemical arms, your military arms
In your electronic arms10Embed
