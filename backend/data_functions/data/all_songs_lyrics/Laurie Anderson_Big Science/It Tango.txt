It Tango LyricsShe said, it looks
Don't you think it looks a lot like rain?
He said, isn't it?
Isn't it just, isn't it just like a woman?
She said, it's hard
It's just hard, it's just kind of hard to say
He said, isn't it?
Isn't it just, isn't it just like a woman?
She said, it goes
That's the way it goes, it goes that way
He said, isn't it?
Isn't it just like a woman?
She said, it takes
It takes one, it takes one to
It takes one to know one
He said, isn't it just like a woman?
She said, she said it
She said it to no, she said it to no one
Isn't it?
Isn't it just?
Isn't it just like a woman?
Your eyes
It's a day's work to look into them
Your eyes
It's a day's work
Just looking into themEmbed
