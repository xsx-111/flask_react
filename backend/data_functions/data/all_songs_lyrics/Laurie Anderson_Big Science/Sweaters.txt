Sweaters LyricsI no longer love your mouth
I no longer love your eyes
I no longer love your eyes
I no longer love the color of your sweaters
I no longer love the color of your sweaters
I no longer love the way
You hold your pens and pencils
I no longer love it
Your mouth, your eyes
The way you hold your pens and pencils
I no longer love itEmbed
