You Got a Nerve Lyrics
Here you stand with tears in your eyes
Crying into my arms
Pleading with me to take you back
Teasing me with your charms
But you got a nerve to come 'round here
After all you've said and done
I thought I had seen everything
Obviously I was wrong
'Cause where were you when the sun went down?
Skies turned dark and gray
Where were you when the north winds blew
Honey, tell me where were you?

I heard you were living down in Brazil
With them high-class friends of mine
I can't believe I was so naive
Did I never once cross your mind
You told them all I was down and out
My existence you even denied
Oh what pleasure it gives me now
To know that you're bleeding inside

You were my life, you were my breath
You were every move I ever made
But recently my opinion's changed
The joke's on you I'm afraid
'Cause I have a woman so beautiful
For you I could no longer wait
Please go away you may spoil everything
Your love has turned up too late
Go away, go away
Please, please go away
I loved you once
I don't love you now
Please, please go awayEmbed
