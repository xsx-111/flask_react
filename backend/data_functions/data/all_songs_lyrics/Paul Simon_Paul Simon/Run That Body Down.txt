Run That Body Down Lyrics
Went to my doctor yesterday
She said I seem to be okay

She said, “Paul, you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think that you can
Do what you been doin’?
Who, now who we foolin?”

I came back home and I went to bed
I was resting my head
My wife came in and she said
“What’s wrong, sweet boy, what’s wrong?"
Ah, I told her what’s wrong

I said, "Peg, you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think that you can
Do what you been doin’?
Who now we foolin’?
Who you foolin’?
Who you foolin’?"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said, yeah…

Kid, you better look around
How long you think that you can
Run that body down?
How many nights you think that you can
Do what you been doin’?
Who, now who you foolin’?
Who you foolin’?
Who you foolin’?1Embed
