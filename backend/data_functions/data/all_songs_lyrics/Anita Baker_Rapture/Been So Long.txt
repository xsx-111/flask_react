Been So Long Lyrics
I won't be neglected
I won't be denied
The pleasure of your kisses
The pleasure of your smile
I think you take for granted
I'll always be here
Just because I love you
It doesn't mean I won't disappear

(Been so long) I'm missin' you, baby
(Been so long) I'm missin' you, baby

Thoughts and mellow memories
Of once upon a time
Slowly creepin' on me
And they linger on my mind
Just let somebody love you
I just don't know why
Whenever I get close to you
You want to run and hide

(It's been so long) I'm missin' you, baby
(It's been so long) I'm missin' you, baby
(It's been so long) I'm missin' you, baby
(It's been so long) I'm missin' you, baby
We began lovers' dance
The road was smooth to romance
And we sang love sweet song every day
I believe that love would stay in my heart
Now it's torn all apart
It's gone away, I can't stay, I've got to say
I don't believe that you could do me this way
Now don't you understand
I'm in need of comfort
The comfort of your hand in mine
And what I feel inside
Why don't you come closer?
I, I can't hide

Been so long
Been so long (Can't hide)
Been so long
Been so long
It's too long, won't you come on, baby
Won't you come on home
Been so long
See about me, ah, see about me
Baby, ba, ba da ba da
Been so long
Come on, see about me
'Cause I keep tellin' you
Been so long
I can't do, I can't do without you
Without you, oh, now don't ask me to
Been so long
To do without you, love, without you, love
'Cause I won't do it, you can't make me do it
Bop, ba dop ba ba
Ah bop bop, a hubba hubba bubba
A hubba bubba baby, a baby bop ba dop bop bop baby, hey
My baby, sweet baby
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet ba ba ba bay bay baby1Embed
