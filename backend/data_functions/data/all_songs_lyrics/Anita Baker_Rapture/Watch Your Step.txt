Watch Your Step LyricsI know the kind of pain you offer
Baby, I've felt your kind of pain before
Change your mind
Like revolving doors
Change your women
Like you change your clothes
I'm telling you
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
I don't understand your thinking
Don't know why you do the things you do
Break my heart
And disregard my feelings
Breaking hearts
Some kind of game to you
I'm telling you
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
It's so easy to tease me
It's so easy to let me down
It's so easy to mislead me
It's so easy to leave me hanging around
Nowhere to come down
Maybe we should just forget this
Baby, just throw me out of your mind
I won't stay
Not while you mistreat me
I won't stay
It's just a waste of my time
I'm telling you
You better watch your step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one day
Baby, listen
You better watch step
You'll fall and hurt yourself one dayEmbed
