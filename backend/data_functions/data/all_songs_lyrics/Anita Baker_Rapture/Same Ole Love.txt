Same Ole Love Lyrics
Flashbacks of the times we've had
Some made us laugh, and some made us sad
We used to break up to make up
All the fun that came from those love games
Oh, when I think I need someone new
Naw, it just won't do
Because I think about you, baby

From beginning to end
365 days of the year
I want your same ol' love, baby, uh-huh
All I wanna do, is keep on loving you
I want your same ol' love

There's a reason that I feel this way
All the things you do
Well, it might be the things that you say
Your love never changes
It's like a picture in a frame, and it remains the same
Your undying love for me, oh, it keeps me strong
Keeps me holding on

From beginning to end
365 days of the year
I want your same ol' love', baby, mmm-hmm
And all I wanna do, is share my life with you
I want your same ole love
Slowly, love me
All is forsaken
I love the love we're making
'Cause it's truly lovely
I'll never leave you
You'll know I need you, baby

From beginning to end
365 days of the year
I want your same ol lovin', baby, mmm-hmm
And all I wanna do, is share my life with you
I want your same ole love
From beginning to end
365 days of the year
I want your same ol' lovin', baby, mmm-hmm
And all I wanna do, is share my life with you
I want your same ol' love
From beginning to end
365 days of the year
I want your same ol' lovin', baby, mmm-hmm
And all I wanna do, is share my life with you
I want your same ol' love
From beginning to end
365 days of the year
I want your same ol' lovin', baby
And all I wanna do, is share my life with you
I want your same ol' love2Embed
