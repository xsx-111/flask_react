No One In The World Lyrics
I look back on all those good times
We once shared and I must have been blind
Just to think I'd find someone new
One who'd love me better than you
Well, it may come as a surprise
Loneliness has opened my eyes
I tried every love I could find
Still I can't get you out of my mind

'Cause there's no one in the world to hold me
No one in the world's gonna move me
No one in the world can love me
Like you do, baby
Every time I'm with someone
I'm loving you, yes, I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again
Ain't no one in the world (No one in the world)
Loves me like you do

Are you happy now with your life?
Well, for me, I'm breaking inside
So self-assured that I could not see
I had it all when you were with me, baby
No one in the world's gonna hold me
No one in the word can move me
No one in the world can love me
Like you do, baby
Every time I'm with someone
I'm loving you and I want to run
I wanna run back to your arms again
Ain't no one in the world (No one in the world)
Loves me like you do

Please take me back (Please take me back)
Oh babe, I can't go on (I can't go on)
I'm not happy in my life without you
I'll do whatever it takes
I've got to get you back with me again (Got to get you back with me)
I realize I need you here in my life

(No one in the world) No one, no one
(No one in the world) Nobody loves me like you do
(No one in the world)
(Like) My (You) my (Do) my (And) baby
(Every time) You got the love that I need
(Love I need) Ain't nobody 'round here to love me
Ain't no one in the world (No one in the world)
In this world
In this world, hoo... (No one in the world)1Embed
