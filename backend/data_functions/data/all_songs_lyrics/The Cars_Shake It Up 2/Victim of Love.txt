Victim of Love LyricsVictim
She can take you
Anywhere she wants to
She can show you things
That make you weak
She can make you think
That you're the only one
She can steal your heart
With just one wink
Why she'll hold ya tight
And she won't let go
She'll make it last and she'll make it slow
She tell you things that you should not know
Cause you're the victim, the victim of lo-o-ove
Framed by the night, touched by the glove
You're the victim, the victim of love
She can freeze you, when she doesn't want to talk
She can work it on in, yea she can go take a walk
She can have or leave it, she can do the skidoo-o 
Well you better believe it, She's having fun on you
She can hold you tight
And she won't let go
She'll make it last and she'll make it slow
She'll tell you things you should not know
Cause you're the victim, victim of lo-o-ove
Framed by the night, touched by the glove
You're the vic-tim, victim of lo-o-ove
That's right
Oh When she's calling you out
You better run to her-er
When she's just falling out
You'd better care
Oh when she needs somebody
Oh you better run to her-er
Oh when she gives in too soon
It's just not fair
Oh well she'll hold you tight
And she won't let go
She'll make it last and she'll make it last
And she'll make it slow-o
She'll whisper things
You'd never know
Cause you're the victim, yea
Victim of lo-o-ove
You're framed by the night
And touched by love
You're the vic-tim
Victim of lo-o-ove2Embed
