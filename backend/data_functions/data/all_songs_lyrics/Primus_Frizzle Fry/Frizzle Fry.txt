Frizzle Fry LyricsHello, all you boys and girls
I'd like to take you to the inside world
It's quite an irregular place to be
But never fear, you're safe with me
Well, maybe
Golden hair of macram√©
Against the face that's cut from stone
The white porcelain's screaming, "Ayie!"
Thank God the boy's not alone
I don't believe in Santa Claus
I don't believe in spite
I have no use for beauty dolls
Especially on this night
I don't believe in miracles
I don't believe in lies
I don't believe in holograms
For I am the Frizzle Fry
Andy's painting green again
This time they might take him away
When Barrington starts to breathe again
It may just take us all away
I don't believe in charity
I don't believe in sin
And if you don't believe in me
We'll play this tune over again
I don't believe in pinochle
And I don't believe I'll try
I do believe in Cap'n Crunch
For I am the Frizzle FryEmbed
