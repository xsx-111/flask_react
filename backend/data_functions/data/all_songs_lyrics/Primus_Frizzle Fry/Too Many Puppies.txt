Too Many Puppies Lyrics
Too many puppies are being shot in the dark
Too many puppies are trained not to bark
At the sight of blood that must be spilled
So that we may maintain our oil fields

Too many puppies
Too many puppies

Too many puppies are taught to heel
Too many puppies are trained to kill
On the command of men wearing money belts
That buy mistresses sleek animal pelts

Too many puppies
Too many puppies
Too many pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-pup-puppies
Too many puppies

Too many puppies with guns in their hands
Too many puppies in foreign lands
Are dressed up sharp in suits of green
And placed upon the war machine
Too many puppies are just like me
Too many puppies are afraid to see
The visions of the past brought to life again
Too many puppies, too many dead men3Embed
