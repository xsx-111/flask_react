Spegetti Western Lyrics

Why do we do this, CG and I?
Every night vegetables
Minds numbed by THC
I've got my pen, CG the remote
Laurel and Hardy is the best bet at 4am on a Friday
No dreads about the working day after, though
Funny thing about weekends when you're unemployed
They don't mean quite so much
Except that you get to hang out with your working friends
We got a spaghetti western here on 36
I like spaghetti westerns
I like the way the boots are all reverbed out walking across the hardwood floor
In fact, everything's got that big reverb sound
Well what do I do now?
Go to sleep?
Pull the pud?
We need new pornos
Guess I'm still writin'

Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again

Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
Stoned stoned again
