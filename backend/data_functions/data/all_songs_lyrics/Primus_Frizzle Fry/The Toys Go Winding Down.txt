The Toys Go Winding Down Lyrics
An overaged boy of 39 has left the wing today
The first time in his life he's made that step
Be numbed by the society and plagued by his insecurity
He's entered in a race that must be won
One of the animals has left its cage today
In search of better things, so it seems to be
But in this land of polyurethane
Things are apt to get a bit hot

As the toys go winding down

C.G. The Mexican is a friend of mine
We used to sit around the house watching *Evil Dead*
Talking about the way it used to be
Skit dat daddle dee dee
We used to pull the stripers out of San Pablo Bay
Now the delta waters going down SoCal
And the stripers start to fade away
It's pudding time! It's pudding time!

As the toys go winding down
As the toys go winding down
As the toys go winding down
As the toys go winding downEmbed
