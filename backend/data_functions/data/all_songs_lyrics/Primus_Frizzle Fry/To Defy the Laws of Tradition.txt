To Defy the Laws of Tradition Lyrics

What if Christmas didn't come this year
And no one paid for Christmas cheer?
Who would cry the biggest tear
The child or the store?

Why do brides wear virgin white?
Most do not deserve that right
But to choose a color of their delight
Would surely bring on the frowns

To defy the laws of tradition
Is a crusade only of the brave
To defy the laws of tradition
Is a crusade only of the brave, yeah

Suppose the taxman, he comes to town
And you don't lay your money down
Yet Mr. Jones he killed Mr. Brown the other day
Well I wonder, who's gonna go to hell
Oh, I'm just a bill
And I'm only a bill
And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill
And I hope to be a law someday

To defy the laws of tradition
Is a crusade only of the brave
To defy the laws of tradition
Is a crusade only of the brave1Embed
