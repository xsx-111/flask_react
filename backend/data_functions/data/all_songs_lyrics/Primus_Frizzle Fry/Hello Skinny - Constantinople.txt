Hello Skinny / Constantinople LyricsHello Skinny

Skinny was born in a bathtub and he grew so incredibly thin
Even the end of an eyedropper sucked him in
Skinny never knew any questions, Skinny never looked at lights
Skinny sold something every single night

Skinny sold a soldier toy to me, Skinny sold a wife
Skinny sold a suction cup and a knife
Skinny found a "Hello, Dolly" record in the hall
He sold it to a truck driver in the fall

Hello, Dolly
Constantinople

Here I come, Constantinople
Here I come, Constantinople
I am coming, Constantinople
Here I come
Here I come, Constantinople
Here I come, Constantinople
I am coming, Constantinople
Here I come
All the leaves are off of the oak and
All the sheep have followed the spoken
Word I'm coming, Constantinople
Here I come
As I stand out in the open
All my friends are with you I hope and
Pray I'm coming, Constantinople
Here I come

Here I come, Constantinople
Here I come, Constantinople
I am coming, Constantinople
Here I come
Here I come, Constantinople
Here I come, Constantinople
I am coming, Constantinople
Here I come
Well, here I come, Constantinople
I'm coming, Constantinople
I'm coming with my head held high
Here I come, Constantinople
I'm coming
I can't wait to see you
I'm coming with my head held high
I'm not coming on my knees
I'm coming, Constantinople
Here I come, Constantinople
Here I come, Constantinople
I am coming, Constantinople
Here I comeEmbed
