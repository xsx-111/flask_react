Pudding Time Lyrics
You can have a lollipop, a candy bar, a jelly bean
I'll buy you a rainbow to hang above your door

It's pudding time
It's pudding time
It's pudding time

Laughter is a sweet
You can't put a price on
When laughter's all gone
Daddy won't buy you more

It's pudding time
It's pudding time children

Money money money money money money money money money
Money money money money money money to buy you things
Daddy's gonna buy you a diamond ring
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
All the kings horses and all the kings men
Couldn't put Humpty together again
San Francisco Bay
The striped bass are dying
But you're gonna get that brand new bike
Oh joy

It's pudding time
It's pudding time children
Pudding time children, pudding time children
Pudding time children, pudding time children
Pudding time children, pudding time childrenEmbed
