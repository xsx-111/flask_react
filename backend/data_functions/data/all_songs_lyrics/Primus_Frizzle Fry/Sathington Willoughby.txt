Sathington Willoughby Lyrics
We are gathered here today in the majestic halls of old
To honor a man they call Sathington Willoughby
There's a joke or two a pun or three I feel that must be told
Then I go on to speak of Sathington Willoughby
Sathington Willoughby, the legislator
That penned us up a bill, that banned the use of certain things

Like this and that
(this and that)
This and that
(this and that)
This and thatEmbed
