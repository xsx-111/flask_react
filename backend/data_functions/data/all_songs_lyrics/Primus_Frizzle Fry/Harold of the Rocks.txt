Harold of the Rocks Lyrics
It was a weekend's eve
I had sex on my breath
I was looking for something to see
With a borrowed black leather and my best fishing hat
Well it was just Wendy-O and me
We called ol' Swamp up on the telephone and said
We was coming on down to pick him up and then
He said "Hey Snappy, me and Greeny'll come along
But only if we can bring a friend. His name is Harold"
So I said "Okay"

Now, we had a Swamper, Greeny, Wendy-O, Stanley
Harold of the Rocks and me
We hopped into my Dart and headed for the Nightbreak
To see a man they called Schoolly D
Harold, he's a friendly guy, he rambles on and on
He'll talk the balls off a rhinosaurus
Fact is he just doesn't make much sense
Well Stan said, "This guy's pretty bizarre, Gus."

Harold of the rocks
Harold of the rocks
Harold of the rocks
I saw Harold at a party Trouzy threw late one night
I said, "Hey man do you remember me?"
He said, "Well of course I do, Snap-Dad, and let me tell you right about now
I'm lit up like an old Christmas tree."
"Hey bro you know I'd like to thank you once again
For letting me hang with y'all across the bay
When I look back at that night I get a warm spot across my heart"
Then he shook my hand, and walked away
That's the last I seen of Harold

Harold of the rocks
Harold of the rocks
Harold of the rocks

So in the end, Swamper and Greeny
Finally succumbed to the ways of Harold
And in doing so each gave just a little bit of his soul away
What a couple of dumbshits!2Embed
