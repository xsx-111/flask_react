Mexican Radio Lyrics
Ooo, hey

I feel a hot wind on my shoulder
And the touch of a world that is older
I turn the switch and check the number
I leave it on when in bed I slumber

I hear the rhythms of the music
I buy the product but never use it
I hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand - just what does he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

I dial it in and tune the station
They talk about the U.S. inflation
I understand just a little
No comprende - it's a riddle

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio, ooo!
Ooo

I wish I was in Tijuana
Eating barbecued iguana
I'd take requests on the telephone
I'm on a wavelength far from home

I feel the hot wind on my shoulder
I dial it in from south of the border
I hear the talking of the DJ
Can't understand - just what does he say?

I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio

Radio, radio
Radio, radio
(What does he say?) Radio, radio
Ooo
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
I'm on the Mexican radio
Ooo1Embed
