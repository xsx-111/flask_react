Mesmerized LyricsYou, who like the moon at night
Haunt my mortal heart
You, who made these ancient walls
Shine like divine marble
The unwanted breath - through credence
A derelict shell in the desert
Mesmerized
As love inflamed the night
Burning tongues brought the rain
The sand remained - purified
Murmur at the meager's spear
Battered Carthagian pride
The beloved cry - wasted dismay
Invasion of baseness and shade
You, loved by your father
Innocent as a vestal - dove
Buried in a deep blue sea
As we all lose - everEmbed
