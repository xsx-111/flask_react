Sorrows of the Moon Lyrics
This evening the moon dreams more lazily
As some fair woman, lost in cushions deep
With gentle hand caresses listlessly
The contour of her breasts before she sleeps

On velvet backs of avalanches soft
She often lies enraptured as she dies
And gazes on white visions aloft
Which like a blossoming to heaven rise

When sometimes on this globe, in indolence
She lets a secret tear drop down, by chance
A poet, set against oblivion

Takes in his hand this pale and furtive tear
This opal drop where rainbow hues appear
And hides it in his breast far from the sunEmbed
