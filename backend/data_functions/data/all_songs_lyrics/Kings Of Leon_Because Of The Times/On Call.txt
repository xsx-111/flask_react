On Call Lyrics
She said call me now baby and I'd come a running
She said call me now baby and I'd come a running
If you'd call me now baby I'd come a running

I'm on call to be there
One and all to be there
And when I fall to pieces
Lord you know I'll be there waiting

I'm on call to be there
One and all to be there
And when I fall to pieces
Lord you know I'll be there waiting

I'm gonna brawl so be there
One for all we'll be there
And when they fall to pieces
Lord you know I'll be there laughing

I'd come a running
I'd come a running
I'd come a running
To be there
To be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there
I'm on call to be there2Embed
