McFearless Lyrics
Strain living with a name they get the best of me
But I don't walk away
No complaint I got much to gain so they keep testing me
And I keep feeding their face
They could go off and hit the road and what would I care
Hell I ain't going nowhere
I got the reigns and courage I was made of
And they've got fake love

So I know I must show it's my show
I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand
It's my role, it's my soul

Pearls and necklaces and girls and all the pretty things
I ain't seeking to have
It's safe to say if I don't get this out of me I might quite easily
End up dead or just mad
Cross my t's and try to dot my i's
But that's just blinding me and I ain't living that way
I roll my sleeves to make a better man of me or I might easily
Just give up on this show
It's my show
I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand
It's my role, it's my soul
I must show it's my show
I must go with my soul
Not my hand where I stand
It's my role, it's my soul
I must show it's my showEmbed
