Charmer Lyrics
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no

Wow
She stole my karma oh no
Sold it to the farmer oh no
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no

Born
In West Virginia oh no
Married
To the preacher oh no
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no
{Outro}
Why she's always looking at me
Why she's always looking at me
Wow
She's such a charmer oh no, oh no1Embed
