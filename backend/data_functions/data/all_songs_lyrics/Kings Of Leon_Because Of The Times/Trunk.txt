Trunk Lyrics
Well I got
What she wants
Ah her nose
A tied knot
I got one mile to go
On down the road
On down the road

Well she got
What I want
And she knows
What I'm not
And I got one mile to go
On down the road
On down the road

She sang
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo


Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
Whooooooo
WhoooooooEmbed
