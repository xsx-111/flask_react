My Party Lyrics
It's raining an old yellow
And it’s carving a path
So now we’re on our way

It’s taking us some journeys
While we wipe away frowns in the most crowded place
Say why you never call me man you never seem to call now that I’m OK
I’ll beat you in the end and every time you turn around here comes the coming of age

Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party

I cock and load my mergers when you question my mood
Because you haven't got no taste
You talking bout my baby I could flip you upside down
And I could mop this place
Say why you never sorry no you never seen my calling right in front your face
I smoke you in the end and don’t you ever turn around because it’s that coming of age

Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh
Oh

Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party
Oh she's at my party
She's at my party1Embed
