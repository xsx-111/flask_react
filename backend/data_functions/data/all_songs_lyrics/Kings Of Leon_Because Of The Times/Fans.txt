Fans Lyrics
Homegrown
Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
Ain't got the slang but you got the face to play the role
And you can play with me

And all the bros
Try for the courage and try for Charity's tight clothes
She's got a hat and all the hat says is 'asshole'
She'll be bobbing to me

Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown, yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who moves you
The only one you see

Now, take it down
And don't you let those tears quench the thirsty ground
And don't you be so scared that you can't make a sound
Make a sound for me

All of London sing
'Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those raining days they ain't so bad when you're the king
The king they want to see
Homegrown
Rock to the rhythm and bop to the beat of the radio
Ya' ain't got the slang but you've got the face to play the role
And you can play with me-uh

Pretty hairdos and those lipstick kisses blown, yeah, that's the right move
Make me feel like I'm the one who's moving you
The only one you see

All of London sing
'Cause England swings and they sure love the tales I bring
Those raining days they ain't so bad when you're the king
The king they want to see7Embed
