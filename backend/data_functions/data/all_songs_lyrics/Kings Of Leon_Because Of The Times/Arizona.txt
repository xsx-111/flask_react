Arizona Lyrics
That taste
All I ever needed
All I ever wanted
Too dumb to surrender
She shakes
Like the morning railway
Checking me out
Someone on her shoulder

The lamp
Flickers in the bedroom
She must feel as awkward
Whorehouse Arizona
Now go
Stand up to a giant
Say that I'm a fighter
Too drunk to remember
Too drunk to
Shake hands

My face
Staring on the pavement
Tasted something awful
I hate when that happens
She waves
Thinkin that it's sexy
She must be plum crazy
I kind of think I like her
I kind of think I do8Embed
