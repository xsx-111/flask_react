Camaro Lyrics
She look so cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
I brought my fight next to her Camaro
And when I fire on a smile then she blows, she blows

I'm making eyes through my sharp sunglasses
She's such a brat now I'm packing her cigarettes
I guess I'll take off these great sunglasses
It makes her look me in the eye before she's taken away
So cool in her new Camaro
It's black as coal and it goes boy, go go go
She looks so cool in that new Camaro
So black as coal and it goes, no it go go go
