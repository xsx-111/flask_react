Black Thumbnail Lyrics
My cold cold sailor heart says get on your way
I ain't to proud to say but that's how I'm made
I'll be that person till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change

From runways to the road I ramble alone
This thumbnail size of heart is as black as coal
Through beauty it still brings me to my knees
Don't waste a tear on me it's my disease

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me

Those preppy boys in blue they make fun of us
So we take it to the street 'cause we are an ornery curse
But we're not here to make your children bleed
We're here to cover ground with a tumbleweed

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Now guitar, go get her

Don't take these boots off me when you think that I'm dead
I'll still be running from the demon in my head
I'll be that person till my dying day
I try so awful hard but I can't change

Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no smell on me
I'll blow off in your sleep
Don't leave no smell on me
Don't leave no, no smell1Embed
