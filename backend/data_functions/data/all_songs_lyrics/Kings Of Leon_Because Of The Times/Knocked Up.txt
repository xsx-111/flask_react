Knocked Up Lyrics
I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Taking off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No, she gonna have my baby
Taking all that I have to take
This takings gonna shake me

People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

And the doctor seems to say he don't know
Where we're going to go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
People call us renegades
'Cause we like living crazy
We like taking on the town
'Cause people's getting lazy
I don't care what nobody says
No, I'm gonna be her lover
Always mad and usually drunk
But I love her like no other

And her daddy he says he don't know
Where we're going to go
I'm a ghost and I don't think I quite know
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go
Where we're gonna go

People call us renegades
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
We like taking on the town
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
I don't care if you don't care
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
I don't care what nobody says
We're gonna have a baby
Takin off in a Coupe de Ville
She's buckled up on navy
She don't care what her momma says
No, she gonna have my baby
I'm takin' all I have to take
This takings gonna shape me
(woo ohh ohh ohh)
(woo ohh ohh ohh)4Embed
