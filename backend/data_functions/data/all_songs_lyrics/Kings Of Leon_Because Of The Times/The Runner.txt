The Runner Lyrics
Our time as we go
We know our times will change
I talk to Jesus
Jesus says I'm okay
Pushing and jumping
Jumping the mountain range
Burning up railroad
Railroad from Hell to Maine

While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacing on the phone
Taking numbers, taking names
Awful sick and tired of the game

She comes from nothing
Hoping for a taste of fame
She's got a birthmark
A birthmark the shape of Maine

While she says she's on her own
I'll be pacing on the phone
Taking numbers, taking names
Awful sick and tired of the game
And it's cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle
Cold and it's cold and it's cold when you're near
Cold when you're near any bottle

Our time as we go
We know our times will change
I talk to Jesus, Jesus, every day
(Our time as we go)Embed
