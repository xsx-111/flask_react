True Love Way Lyrics

I want in, like a substitute
I've been working awful hard for you
But you don't say, you just hold your breath
So I can't touch what I haven't yet
She's a cold one and it hurts me so
It's a dark path and a heck of a cold
And she could kill me like she did before

Oh we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home

Push in and I pull it away
It's a hard part but the true love way
Girl you're wanted like a wanted man
With your smart mouth and your killer hand
We could both share all that I have made
For a young man it's a heck of a wage
And I feel crazy when I see your face
Because we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making a song
Making me lie

People say our babies are walking this town
People say our babies are walking this town
People say our babies are just wandering around
People say our babies are walking

Because we'd be so free
Happy alone
Sharing a smile
So far from home
And we would laugh
Laugh till we cry
Making a song
Making me lie2Embed
