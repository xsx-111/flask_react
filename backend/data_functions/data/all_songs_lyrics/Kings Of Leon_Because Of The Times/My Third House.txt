My Third House Lyrics
How many souls will it take
How many necks will you break
I say, how many bones can I waste
In that little old shape
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive

Let me get away
On a holiday
We could, tire the ones we know
Going to tie right on
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive

Tell the idiot yeah
Running down my back
We could, see the devils in town
Smoke 'til the sun goes down
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
I showed you my car
But I don't drive
I said, hey, I'm taken it back
Like you don't know
You blow me away
When you don't try
Let me get away
On a holiday
We could, tire the ones we know
Going to tie right on
I say, hey, I'm sold from afar
But you don't try me
Showed you my car
But I don't drive1Embed
