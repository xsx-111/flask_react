Poison LyricsIt was one of those black cat nights
The moon had gone out and the air was thin
It was the kind of night the cat would drag in
I'll never forget it, we had a fight
Then you turned around turned on the light. You left our bed
Then you moved downstairs to live with her instead
Yeah just one floor and a shout away
I guess I should have moved but I decided to stay
Did I drink some poison that I don't remember now?
And every night I open all the windows
I let a cold dark wind blow through
I play loud organ music and I talk to myself and dream of you
Uh oh! I hear voices coming up through the pipes
Through all the springs in my bed and up through the lights
The volume goes up then it drops back down
I can hear the two of you playing records
Moving furniture and fooling around
Did I drink some poison that I don't remember now?
Is there blood on my hands?
No, my hands are clean
Did I do something in another lifetime
That was really really mean?
Yeah I'm hearing voices
Am I losing my mind?
Think I'm going crazy, I gotta get out
I run into the street and start to shout
Get out of my way! Get out! Get out!
Did I drink some poison that I don't remember now?
Is there blood on my hands?
Did I do something in another lifetime
That was really really mean?
A small bullet, a piece of glass
And your heart just grows around itEmbed
