Freefall LyricsYou're out on the ocean
And you get pulled down
Free fall to the bottom
Like when you're drowning
Or falling asleep
You get turned around
And when you think you're
Swimming to the surface
You're swimming straight down
Down to the bottom
All the way to the bottom
Secret codes and cryptograms
I'm lost in your words
I'm swimming
We're going down to the bottom
All the way to the bottom
Rapture of the deep
I got your letter
I couldn't read it
It was a cryptogram
Did it say, "take me with you"
Or "take me as I am?"
We're going down to the bottom
All the way to the bottom
We get turned around
There is another world
Spinning inside of this one
I remember where I came from
There were tropical breezes
And a wide open sea
I remember my childhood
I remember being free
We're going down to the bottom
All the way to the bottom
We get turned around
There is another world
Inside of this one
Rapture of the deep
We're going down to the bottom
There is another world
Spinning inside of this oneEmbed
