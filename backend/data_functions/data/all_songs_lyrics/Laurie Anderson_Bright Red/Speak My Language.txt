Speak My Language LyricsDaddy, Daddy
It was just like you said
Now that the living
Outnumber the dead
Where I come from, it's a long thin thread
Across an ocean, down a river of red
Now that the living outnumber the dead
I'm one of many
Daddy, Daddy
It was just like you said
Now that the living
Outnumber the dead
Speak my language
Hello. Hello
Here come the quick
There go the dead
Here they come
Bright red
