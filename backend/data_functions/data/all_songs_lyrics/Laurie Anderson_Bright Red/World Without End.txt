World Without End LyricsI remember where I came from
There were burning buildings and a fiery red sea
I remember all my lovers
I remember how they held me
World without end remember me
East. The edge of the world
West. Those who came before me
When my father died we put him in the ground
When my father died it was like a whole library burned down
World without end remember meEmbed
