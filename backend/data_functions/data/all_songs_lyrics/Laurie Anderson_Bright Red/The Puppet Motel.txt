The Puppet Motel LyricsI live on the highway near the Puppet Motel
I log in every day. I know the neighborhood well
Now about the residents of the Puppet Motel
They're more than a little spooky
And most of them are mean. They're runnin' the numbers
They're playin' cops and robbers
Down in their dungeons inside their machines
Cause they don't know what's really real now
They're havin' fourth dimensional dreams
Their minds are out on bail now
And real is only what it seems
And all the puppets in this digital jail
They're runnin' around in a frenzy in search of the Holy Grail
They're havin' virtual sex. They're eatin' virtual food
No wonder these puppets are always in a lousy mood
So if you think we live in a modern world
Where everything is clean and swell
Take a walk on the B side of town down by the Puppet Motel
Take a whiff. Burning plastic
I drink a cup of coffee I try to revive
My mind's a blank I'm barely alive
My nerves are shot I feel like hell
Guess it's time to check in at the Puppet Motel
Boot up. Good afternoon. Pause
Oooo. I really like the way you talk
Pardon me. Shut downEmbed
