Bright Red LyricsDid she fall or was she pushed?
Your shirt on my chair
Your shirt on my chair
I'll be with you. I'll be there
I'll never leave you
Your shirt on my chair
Come here little girl. Get into the car
It's a brand new Cadillac. Bright red. Come here little girl
Hey! Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Your despair in my heart. Bright red
Your words in my ears
I'll be with you. I'll be there. I'll never leave you
Wild beasts shall rest there
And owls shall answer one another there
And the hairy ones shall dance there
And sirens in the temples of pleasure
Your shirt on my chair
I'll be with you. I'll be there. I'll never leave you
Your shirt on my chairEmbed
