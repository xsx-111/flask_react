Beautiful Pea Green Boat LyricsI'm lying in the shade of my family tree
I'm a branch that broke off
What will become of me?
Dear Mom, I'm lying here
In this queen-sized bed
I'm thinking back
To all the stories you read to me
About the little animals who went to sea
In their beautiful pea green boat
But I can't remember now
What happened then?
Dear Mom, how does it end?
The owl and the pussycat went to sea
In a beautiful pea green boat
They took some honey and lots of money
Wrapped in a five pound note
The owl looked up to the stars above
And sang to a small guitar
O lovely pussy! Pussy my love!
What a wonderful pussy you are
Let us be married
Too long we've tarried
But what shall we do for a ring?
What shall we do for a ring?
Hey! Hey
They sailed away for a year and a day
To the land where the bong tree grows
And there in a wood a piggy wig stood
A ring at the end of his nose
A ring at the end of his nose
And hand in hand at the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the
By the light of the, by the light of the moon
And hand in hand at the edge of the sand
They danced by the light of the
By the light of the, by the light of the moon
The moon, the moon
Hey! Hey! Hey! HeyEmbed
