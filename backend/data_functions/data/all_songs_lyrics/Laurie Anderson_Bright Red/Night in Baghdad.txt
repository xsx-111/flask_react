Night in Baghdad LyricsAnd, oh, it's so beautiful
It's like the Fourth of July
It's like a Christmas tree
It's like the fireflies on a summer night
And I wish I could describe this to you better
But I can't talk very well now
'Cause I've got this damned gas mask on
So I'm just going to stick this microphone out the window
And see if we can hear a little better. Hello California?
What's the weather like out there now?
And I only have one question: Did you ever really love me?
Only when we danced. And it was so beautiful
It was like the Fourth of July
It was like fireflies on a summer nightEmbed
