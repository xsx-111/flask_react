Muddy River LyricsRain keeps pouring down
Houses are cracking
People drown
Cars are rusting here
A church floats by
Washed in the blood of the lamb
And all the superhighways have disappeared
One by one
And all the towns and cities and signs
Are underwater now
They're gone
We're going down by the muddy river
We're walking down by the muddy river
Somebody tell me please
What happened here?
Mud is everywhere
Fish are swimming in the fields
Everybody's running around, they're yelling
Is this the end of the known world?
Men and women in their boats
Try to save what they've lost
They're yelling, It's all gone now
We're never gonna find it again
But when the muddy river starts to rise
It covers us all
And when I look into your eyes
Two tiny clocks, two crystal balls
We begin again
We try
We begin again
Down by
We're going down by, down by, the muddy river
We begin again down by the muddy river
We're walking down by, down by, the muddy river
We're going down by, down by, the muddy riverEmbed
