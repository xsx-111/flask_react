That Lucky Old Sun (Just Rolls Around Heaven All Day) LyricsUp in the morning, out on the job
Work like the devil for my pay
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining
Tears all in my eyes
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, gimme nothing to do
But roll around Heaven all day
Send down that cloud with a silver lining
Lift me to paradise
Show me that river, take me across
Wash all my troubles away
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do
But roll around Heaven all dayEmbed
