Country Trash LyricsI got a crib full of corn and a turning plow
But the ground's too wet for the hopper now
Got a cultivator and a double tree
A leather line for the haw and gee
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for country trash
I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day
I got about a dollar laid away
The wind's from the south and the fishing's good
Got a potbelly stove a cord of wood
Mama turns the left-overs into hash
I'm doing alright for country trash
I got a mackinaw wand a hunting dog
A cap I ordered from the catalog
A big tall tree that shades the yard
A big fat sow for the winter's lard
Let the thunder roll and the lighting flash
I'm doing alright for country trash
Well there's not much new ground left to plow
And crops need fertilizing now
My hands don't earn me too much gold
For security when I grow old
But we'll all be equal under the grass
And God's got a heaven for country trash
And God's got a heaven for country trash
I'll be doing alright for country trashEmbed
