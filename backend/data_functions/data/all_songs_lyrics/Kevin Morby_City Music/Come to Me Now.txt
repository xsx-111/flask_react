Come to Me Now Lyrics
Come to me now
Like you did then
Pretty and slow
Pretty and thin
Ain't got no friend
In a world so big
Ain't got no family
Ain't got no kin
Where do you go
Boy, when you die?
Is it pretty and slow?
Is it up real high? I don't want to know

I can't wait for the sun to go down
Tired of squinting at this god-awful town
I can't wait for that moon to rise
She's my friend, always been, you can see it in my eyes

That I love her
Yeah, I do
Oh, I love her
And she loves me too
Come to me now
Like you did then
Pretty and slow
Pretty and thin
Where do you go
When you go out at night?
When will you come home?
What did you find?
Ain't got a friend
In a world like this
There is a fortress
Around my heart
Till death do we part

I can't wait for the sun to go down
Tired of squinting at this ugly little town
I can't wait for that moon to shine
She's my friend, always been, you can see it in my eyes

That I love her
Yeah, I do
Oh, I love her
And she loves me too
Oh, I love her
Yeah, I do
Yeah, I love her
And she loves me too

You'll burn in her sunlight
You'll freeze in her night
You will run that way forever
Like an echo
Come on, Mabel
