Tin Can LyricsI live high
Oh my tin can up in the sky
All those people down below
Oh that city that I long to know
Moving fast, what's their name?
Where they going and from which hole they came?
I'm no one but a face just a stranger in a stranger place
Breathing out, breathing in
Sun came up then it went down again
As I say I am a visitor here
I don't mind
Oh my tin can up in the sky
All those people down below
Oh they're just people that I long to show
That I'm fast, that I'm game
So much bigger than the hole I came
I'm not no one not empty space
Just a stranger in a strange strange place
Breathing in, breathing out
Sun came up and then the sun came down
And I sing I am a prisoner here
But I don't mind
I live high
Oh my tin can up in the sky
All those people down below
Oh that city that I long to know
Moving fast, what's their names?
Where they going and from which hole they came?
I'm no one but a face just a stranger in a stranger place
Breathing out, breathing in
Sun came up then went down again
As I say I am a visitor here
But I don't mindEmbed
