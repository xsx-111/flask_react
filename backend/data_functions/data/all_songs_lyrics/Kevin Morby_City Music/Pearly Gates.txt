Pearly Gates LyricsIn my time of sorrow
Do you have a song that I could borrow?
All mine are worn out now
Dead and fallen out of my mouth, yeah
I need a melody
Something I could sail away on
I need a song to sing
Let my fire burn the stake on
And I was wondering
On my judgment day
What song I'd be humming
In line for the pearly gates
And In my time of dying
You know the choirs will be crying
Little girls with long hair
Throwing songs into the air
And everybody's taking pictures
Inside Saint John The Divine
But me I was just lighting candles
That hailed every name but mine
And I was wondering
On my judgment day
What I would be wearing
In line for the pearly gates
And baby angels come to me
Singing songs with no warning, they're singing
Sleep through this morning
Sleep in my child
And may your dreams become you
Oh forever whileEmbed
