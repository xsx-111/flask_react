Crybaby LyricsI never was someone that I liked
I never was someone that you know
Now the tears flow through my eyes
And the trouble fell like a snow
I never walked down an empty street
I never was someone you'd want to meet
Just to be a normal man
Just to go out shaking hands

Now I'm walking hand in hand
With my self and with my sin
All alone on a crowded street
I never was someone you'd want to meet
Just to be a normal man
Just to go out making plans
All alone on a crowded street
I never was someone you'd want to meet

I never was someone that I liked
I never was someone that you know
Now the tears pull through my eyes
And the trouble fell like a snow
And you cried, crybaby
Come on cry, crybaby
And you cried, crybaby
Come on cry, crybaby

I never walked down an empty street
I never was someone you'd want to meet
Just to be a normal man
Just to go out shaking hands

And to cry, crybaby
Come on cry, crybaby
And to cry, crybaby
Come on cry, crybaby

And you cried, cry baby
Come on cry, cry baby
And you cried, cry babyEmbed
