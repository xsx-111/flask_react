Night Time LyricsOne, two, three, four
Night time
Out my window
With sad eye
On the stereo
Not feeling alright
And life goes
On below
Watch the heat rise
From the barrio
And into my life
Oh turn me on
Don't turn on me
Oh turn me on
Like a bright light in the big city
If you walk a mile
In my shoes
What would you choose?
Thought that I saw Lesra
Sitting on some steps
Thought that I saw Lesra then I wondered what was next
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting on a stone
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting all alone
Thought that I saw Lesra I got close it wasn't here
Thought that I saw Lesra she looked just like a bird
Thought that I saw Lesra
I saw night time
Out my window
With sad eyeon the stereo
Not feeling alright
And night time
Goes on below
Watch the heat rise
From the barrio
And into my life
Oh turn me on
Don't turn on me
Oh turn me on
Like a bright light in the big city
If you walk a mile
In my shoes
What would you choose?
Would you stay
Away from me
Or would you come here
Into my arms
I won't do you harm
Oh forget about it child
Night time
Out my window
With sad eyeon the stereo
Not doing alrightEmbed
