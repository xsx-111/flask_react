Aboard My Train LyricsI once loved a boy so smart and true
We would walk home every day from the school
He'd say, "I think we could walk forever
Oh no, how 'bout just a little while?" Okay
He would make me laugh like the devil, haha
He would pick me up like the child that I was
In my time I'd like to stay young forever
Like a tide, the crest beneath sunny weather
May we fill these lungs with laughter (haha)
And we may shake these bones with style (watch me now)
And may we claim all that we're after (everything)
And may we do it wearing a smile
And may the breath we breathe be free
And for you to remain a part of me
Three, four

I have loved many faces, many places
All aboard my train but depart at different stations
And some of them look the same
But none of them smell the same
And some of them will never change
While some of them are growing strange
And some of them are center stage
While some of them go and turn my page
And some are wrangled in pain
And some are diseased with rage
Oh, but all of them are aboard my train
But all of them are a friend of mine
And oh, my darling, can't you see?
Oh that, babe, oh, and you, are a part of meEmbed
