Dry Your Eyes LyricsDry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Oh Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Oh Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Go to, down town at dawn
Just to see what, going on there
But there ain't no, one I know, no
No crowd, to be a part of
Now there's tears in my eyes
Tears in my eyes
Oh tears in my eyes
Tears in my eyes
Tears in my eyes
Tears in my eyes
Oh oh Tears in my eyes
Tears in my eyes
I go to, a city square
Just to see what, or who I'm gonna find there
But there ain't no, soul I know
No commotion, for me to be a part of
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Oh dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Dry your eyes
Oh Dry your eyes
Dry your eyesEmbed
