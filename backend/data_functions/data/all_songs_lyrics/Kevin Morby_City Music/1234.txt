1234 LyricsEverybody talking 'bout 1 2 3 4
Everybody talking 'bout 1 2 3 4
Everybody do the 1 2 3 4
Everybody talking 'bout 1 2 3 4
Well you know I'd walk a mile just to die
Gotta learn what that door is for
Gotta learn what that door is for
Gotta learn what that door is for
Gotta learn what that door is for
Well you know I'd walk a mile just to die, die, die, die, die
Bad luck coming up
Good luck is gone
Bad luck coming up
Good luck is gone
And the mile that I speak of is the one I'm on
Woo
