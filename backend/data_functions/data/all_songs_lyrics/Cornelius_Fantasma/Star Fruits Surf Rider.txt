Star Fruits Surf Rider LyricsI was walking the streets when I felt a little dizzy
Around my head I saw some stars
Star fruits surf rider
Near me sits a cat who's staring my way
Deep inside that cat's eyes, I see some stars
Star fruits surf rider
I was somewhere near the ocean and I was feeling cold
The stars were amazing and there was no one around
