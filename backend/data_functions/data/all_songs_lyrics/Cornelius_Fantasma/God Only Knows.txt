God Only Knows LyricsSilently at night it fell
From that snow last night
I was the only one in the world
The only one who caught a cold
God only knows
On March 1997
I was the only one in the world
Humming a song called
"Just Like Honey"
God only knows
They said nothing on the news
I don't even know who it was
He was counting down the days
To the moment the world ends
God only knowsEmbed
