Thank You For The Music LyricsBye bye to my foolish
Bye bye dream travels
Thank you for giving me your valuable time
Wave your hand and turn around
Flash back to a scene from the past
Bye bye
Bye bye you and I will someday
Bye bye meet again somewhere
It would be nice if the next time we met we were smiley smile
Wave your hand and turn around
Flash back to a scene from the past
Bye bye thank you for the music
Bye bye thank you for the music
