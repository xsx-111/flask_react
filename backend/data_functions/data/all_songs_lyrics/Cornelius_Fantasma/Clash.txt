Clash Lyrics
On that cold winter day
At that club
You and I met
It had been a long time
Playing on that stage
That skinny guy
Hitting his drum
Banging his cymbal

Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!

A row of glasses
Sitting on the table
I choose one
I pick it up
As I lift it to my lips
I saw you
You looked into my eyes
I felt it slip away
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!

Now it's broken
My glass is in pieces
Gather them together
Melt them down with fire
Now I can make
A glass figurine
It looked like somebody
Maybe Mick Jones?

Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
Clash!
