Taylor Lyrics(Ladies and gentlemen, this is a test-
Okay, let's begin.)
Beware the beast, man
For he is the devil's pawn
Alone among God's primates
He kills for sport
Or lust, or greed
Yea, he will murder his brother
To possess his brother's land
Let him not breed in great numbers
For he will make a desert of his home
(We're from this planet, from another time. 2000 years ago.)
(Brothers of the Citizen's cup, I am the- I am a  soldier
Brothers of the Citizen's cup- and as a soldier, I  accept.)
Beware the beast, man
For he is the devil's pawn
Alone among God's primates
He kills for sport
Or lust, or greed
Yea, he will murder his brother
To possess his brother's land
Let him not breed in great numbers
For he will make a desert of his home
(We're from this planet, from another time. 2000 years ago
Brothers of the Citizen's cup, I am the- I am a  soldier.)Embed
