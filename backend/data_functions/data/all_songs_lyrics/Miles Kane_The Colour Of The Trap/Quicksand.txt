Quicksand Lyrics
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da

Riding on this wave of blue sequins
You're shimmering
Tango, foxtrot, I'm in trouble
Can you hear the clammer laughter and louder?

I see you falling, gently onto the cobbles
Skipping into the quicksand, not into my arms
I see I'm falling, gently onto the cobbles
Skipping into the quicksand, not into your arms

Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da
Ba-ba-ba-da, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da

Ears drop, drip-drip-dripping down my ears
For gigs and tears
Delicate and gently does it
Won't you dedicate your hate to another? Ah-ooh
I see you falling, gently onto the cobbles
Skipping into the quicksand, not into my arms
I see I'm falling, gently onto the cobbles
Skipping into the quicksand, not into your arms


I see you falling, gently onto the cobbles
Skipping into the quicksand, not into my arms
I see I'm falling, gently onto the cobbles
Skipping into the quicksand, not into your arms

La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la, la-la-la-laEmbed
