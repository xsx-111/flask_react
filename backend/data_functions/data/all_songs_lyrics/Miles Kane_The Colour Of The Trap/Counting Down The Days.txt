Counting Down The Days Lyrics
I'm counting down the days
Love seems strange to me

Excuse me, you're killing me
With your heartbreak and your wild signs
I've been looking for something to open my eyes
Holding it up to the light only locks it away, hey

I'm counting down the days
Love seems strange to me, to me

Out of focus, joking with the ups and downs
Hocus pocus, nowhere to be found
Holding it up to the light only locks it away, hey
Oh, coughing excuses, the smoke and the mirrors and me

I'm counting down the days
Love seems strange to me, to me

Coughing excuses, the smoke and the mirrors and me
I'm counting down the days
Love seems strange to me, to me
I'm counting down the days
Love seems strange to me, to meEmbed
