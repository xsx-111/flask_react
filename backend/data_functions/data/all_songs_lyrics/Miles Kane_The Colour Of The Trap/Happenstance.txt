Happenstance Lyrics
I wanna climb on your shadow
I wanna use pseudonyms
You see the way and I'll follow
I won't try to escape

And I don't know why on Earth
I'm calling, calling at this time of night
You've got me hoping for some happenstance, baby
You've got me uptight

I don't know who you are
All I know is you fold me in half

I want the slope of your sorrow
I want the curve of your neck
I want the fuse to your morals
Well, I want the keys to your chest

And I don't know why on Earth
I'm calling, calling at this time of night
You've got me hoping for some happenstance, baby
You've got me uptight
I don't know who you are
All I know is you fold me in half

I don't know who you are
Darling, all I know is
I'm caught up on you
I'm caught up on you
I'm caught up on you, yeah
(I'm caught up on you)

I don't know who you are
All I know is you fold me in half
You fold me in half1Embed
