My Fantasy Lyrics
When I turn to my favourite hideaway
My hand on hip will always be the same
Only half the plan
Once I thought that I was over you
Now you're back and I'm falling like a fool
You know, the one I am

I'm ridiculed by my fantasy
Scheduling insanity
My eagerness comes untangled
I can't handle you

At least it will be a thrill keeping up with you
At least it will be a thrill keeping up with you

I'm going 'round and 'round this bunch of keys
So let me in, 'cause I'm about to freeze
With my jealousy
Trying hard to persuade myself
That you aren't everything I need
But my tricks are weak
I'm ridiculed by my fantasy
Scheduling insanity
My eagerness comes untangled
I can't handle you

At least it will be a thrill keeping up with you
At least it will be a thrill keeping up with you

Oh, darling, hold me like before
Oh, darling, hold me like before
