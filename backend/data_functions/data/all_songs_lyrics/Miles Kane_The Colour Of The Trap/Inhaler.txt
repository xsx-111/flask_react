Inhaler Lyrics
Well, I've been looking forward to lifting up the veil
Yes is the answer, you know that for sure
The night time is the right time
Oh, don't you know, girl?
You've heard it before, hey

Inhaler, inhaler
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Inhaler, inhaler
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Cold is the shoulder you'll give me for sure
Dance with your hips and grind on the floor
The night time is the right time
Oh, don't you know, girl?
You've heard it before, hey

Inhaler, inhaler
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Inhaler, inhaler
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Inhaler, inhaler
Inhaler, inhaler
Yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
