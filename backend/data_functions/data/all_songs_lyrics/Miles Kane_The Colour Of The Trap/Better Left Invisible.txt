Better Left Invisible Lyrics
Sipping on your looks but you drink me in
Pass over the flattery again
It's haggard, heavy on my chest
It's better left invisible for now

Confessions are bouncing 'round my head
So I add them to the archive of things we've never said
I lock them up with all the rest
It's better left invisible for now

If the rope we walk starts wobbling
Or if the tide feels like it's coming in
I lock them up with all the rest
It's haggard, heavy on my chest
Though it's tempting to confess
It's better left invisible for now

Oh, oh, ohEmbed
