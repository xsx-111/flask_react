Take The Night From Me Lyrics
I've been searching for love
I'm sorry I escaped you
I wonder how I will end
For now, I'll carry to push on through
And bite my jealous lip
And hope to turn it to a kiss

Take this night from me, girl
You're stunningly divine
Take this night from me, girl
You're the love I've been searching for
'Cause I will be true and be faithful
And that's not like me
So take the night from me

And now, my worried concave of thoughts
Won't linger anymore
Because I've been trying my best
Yet still, I've been skipping through my years
To cover my sacred tears
Ready for the heartaches and fears

Take this night from me, girl
You're stunningly divine
Take this night from me, girl
You're the love I've been searching for
'Cause I will be true and be faithful
And that's not like me
So take the night from me
Take it from me
And then, darling, you'll ask me where I've been

Take it from me
Take it from me
Take it from me
Take it from me1Embed
