Come Closer Lyrics
What do I have to do
To get you where I want you?
I guess we'll see what might be
Woah, woah

You're a million miles, a million miles away
So come closer, so come closer
So come close, ah, woah, ah, woah

Your reasons don't make any sense
I'll never rely on you
And you're draped on him while you're staring at me
Woah, woah

You're a million miles, a million miles away
So come closer, so come closer
So come close, ah, woah, ah, woah


You're a million miles, a million miles away
So come closer
So come close, ah, woah, ah, woah
Ah, woah, ah, woah
Ah, woah, ah, woah
Ah, woah, ah, woah
Ah, woah, ah, woah
Ah, woah, ah, woah
Ah, woahEmbed
