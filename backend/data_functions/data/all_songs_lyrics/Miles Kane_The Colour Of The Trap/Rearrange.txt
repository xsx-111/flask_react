Rearrange Lyrics
I wanna make your smoke and kisses black and white
Measure all your spinning whispers in the loose moonlight
Magic from your fingers tingles down my spine
Colour in between the lines

Oh, let it out, let it out, let it all out
Let it out, let it out, let it all out

You rearrange my mind
You rearrange my mind

An uneasy feeling churns inside of me
I'll draw it on a wall for you all to see
Tryin' to find a diamond in an avalanche
But you just haven't had the chance

Oh, let it out, let it out, let it all out
Let it out, let it out, let it all out

You rearrange my mind
You rearrange my mind
Let it out, let it out, let it all out
Let it out, let it out, let it all out

You rearrange my mind
You rearrange my mind1Embed
