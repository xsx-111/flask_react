Telepathy Lyrics
I can feel you searching 'round my brain
Looking for a way to make a wave
Floating out and in, and in and out again
'Til our falling thoughts cascade together

Telepathy to the rescue
Just look at me and I will let you know
I will let you know

I can see you making little flames
All along the path to guide the way
Floating out and in, and in and out again
'Til our falling thoughts cascade together

Telepathy to the rescue
Just look at me and I will let you know
Oh, I will let you know


Telepathy to the rescue
Just look at me and I will let you know
I will let you knowEmbed
