Colour of the Trap Lyrics
If you'd just get it together and read my mind
Then sleeping would be easy
Then I'll be there to acquiesce
I confess I'm in trouble
Another afternoon of increments
And asking the wrong questions
And then you get up and leave again
Just as the evening threatens to set

Consider this now, it's not too late
I have watched you change
The colour of the trap before, girl
I have learned to wait

Most of the things that you say I don't understand
But I will sit and listen
And nod along attentively
But the truth is I can't concentrate

Consider this now, it's not too late
I have watched you change
The colour of the trap before, girl
I have learned to wait, make no mistake
I have learned to wait
And you have learned that you can make me
I need something to sort me out
I need someone to come and shake me
And your exit calms me down
Before it infuriates me
Girl, I'm in trouble
Wish you'd just get it together and read my mind

La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, laEmbed
