Runner Lyrics
Cross my heart, let me be
Tripped in the dark, you found me
And boy I'll be back when you're lonely if you want me to
My parents don't know what's gotten into me since I've met you

And hold, hold
Hold, hold

When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, ooh
Why you gotta let go? Why you gotta let go?
Why you gotta move on? Move on, ooh

When you let

When you wanna let go, when you wanna let go
When you wanna move on, move on, ooh19Embed
