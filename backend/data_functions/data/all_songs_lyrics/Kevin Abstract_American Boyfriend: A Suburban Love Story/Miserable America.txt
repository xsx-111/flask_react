Miserable America Lyrics
My boyfriend saved me, my mother's homophobic
I'm stuck in the closet, I'm so claustrophobic
I just want help if, my best friend's racist
My mother's homophobic, I'm stuck in the closet
I'm so claustrophobic, I just wanna know shit
Well, we all love Young Thug

Miserable America, assassinate my character
Miserable America, assassinate my character

I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't
I don't care, I don't care, no, no

My boyfriend hates me, won't let me meet his parents
Says my skin might scare 'em, not afraid of my appearance
Feel like jumping off the building
Feel like saying, "fuck your parents"
Son don't feel 'em and I know they never will
They love gays but they hate niggas
What else are we to do rather than talk and paint a picture?
I told that nigga before I even tried to tell myself
I wish you thought of me the way you thought about yourself
Hella help, wish 'em well
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't

These days just don't make sense without you
These days just don't make sense without you
(It don't make sense without you)

I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't
I don't care no more, I don't care no more, I don't, I don't

Miserable America, assassinate my character
Miserable America, assassinate my character
Miserable America, assassinate my character25Embed
