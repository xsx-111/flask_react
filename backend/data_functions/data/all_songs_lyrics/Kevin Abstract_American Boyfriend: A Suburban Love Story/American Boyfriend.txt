American Boyfriend Lyrics
Simple girl, I ended up on your dad's doorstep
(She was a simple girl)
Suddenly, my body fell into yours

Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care

Burn bridges
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)

I wanna die on sunset (I wanna die, I wanna die)
(He was a pop star with a bounty on his head)
My parents wanna kill me, let 'em kill me
I'll finally be on TV

Bleachers only hold (gotta find it though)
Thunder only grows (gotta find it though)
It's all the same at dark, the sun don't care
(Say it again now, say it again now, yeah)
Burn bridges
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
Burn bridges
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)
No one knows, no one calls home
American Boyfriend (Ooh-oh)

Yeah, yeah
I found my way
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I found my way
I found my way
I found my way

You're my American boy, yeah
You're my American boy (American Boyfriend)
You're my American boy
You are, yeah10Embed
