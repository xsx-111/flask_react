Papercut Lyrics
And just no break

A broken heart led me to you, she said "I'm seeing through you"
And this before I knew you, way before I knew you
Back when darkness was all I had to hold
I smoke a bag of weed, all on my fucking own
And all them baddies all my favorite rappers rapped about
Never made sense when them words played in my fucking house
Now I'm on the highway, nearly passing out
With my feet hanging out the sunroof, my hands holding your hands
Driving past the sunset, I know I wanna marry you
It's kinda unbearable and that's pretty overwhelming
The feeling is brand new, eh, the feeling is brand new
But I still feel 17, it's like I just made MTV
It's like I just facetimed you for the first time last week
And that feeling will never leave
Different than all the highs, my life hit a new high
The harshest of all times, can't tell my family I'm bi
Can't tell my mother I'm gay
The hardest part of my day is wishing I was fucking straight
Life could be so fucking easy, man

I take everything for what it is and I never try to change it
I take everything for what it is and never try to change
I take everything for what it is and never try to change it, damn
And just no breakin' my heart
(That shit wavy, dawg, I feel like I'm at the motherfuckin' beach!)
And just no breakin' my heart
Ooh, keep breakin'
Ooh, keep breakin', yeah
Ooh, keep breakin'
Ooh, break my heart
A bad man, bad man, a bad boy
Been a bad man, a bad man (aye, aye)
Been a bad boy, a bad boy (aye, uh)
Been a bad man, a bad man (aye, aye)
A bad boy, a bad boy (aye, ooh)
Been a bad man, a bad man
A bad boy, a bad boy

I take everything for what it is and I never try to change it
I take everything for what it is and never try to change
I take everything for what it is and never try to change it8Embed
