Knotty Head Lyrics
It's history right here (Tote a 4 and pour some liq')
Wassup my nigga? (I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen)
It's time to empower these niggas mane, do it for the city  (This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live)
We got to give it to them raw though, ya feel me? (Knotty headed niggas)

Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
But they got jacked like MK4
Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party
Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy
My pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz
Rico's Story when I see the coppers
Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition we made obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday, all of you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

Yeah, uh
Maybach Music
Found another body in the lake (Huh)
Same day another tattoo on his face (Huh)
Obituary on his mother’s fireplace
Baby mother fuck another sucker on a blind date (Woo)
Shots fired every night I’m tryna mind mine
Dolphin Gang, Bello cigars on the sideline (Yea)
Pussy niggas, you can see it on his timeline
Hatin' on his dawg, shit I’m tryna find mine (Woo)
Calm nigga, when I’m lit up I get Von Miller (Huh)
Rich niggas, if you real then you can run with us (Let's get it)
Educated reading books, I’m talkin Art of War
Whippin yoda yayo residue on the marble floors
I wanna see my niggas with the flyest clothes (Woo)
Came to put my city on that’s if I’m right or wrong (What?)
Pulling into Risco Park in the richest cars (Woo)
And I’m thinking of my dawgs since I’m livin wrong
Jehovah’s witness, swear to God I done seen it all (Bang)
Picking up the pistols every time the dogs bark (ugh)
You pointing fingers but them choppers cutting arms off
D.C.C.C., we came to warn y'all
Mothafucka, damn right, we came to warn y'all (Woo)
Mothafucka, damn right, we came to warn y'all (Huh)
Curry what’s up! Double M (Uh)
It’s futuristic shit29Embed
