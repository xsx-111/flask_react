Emotional Lyrics
God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional

It started in November, I started losing my mind
I ended up in rehab, I don't want to cry
But people can be so mean, and I don't understand why
And when they say I can't sing, I just want to die

Trying to keep my shit together
When will this get any better?
I'm trying so hard not to break down

God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional

I didn't mean to do this, didn't mean to sell out
Got everything I ever thought I wanted, now I can't get out
I saw the love of my life leave me for his new wife
Stab me right in the heart with a fucking knife
Trying to keep my shit together
When will this get any better?
I'm trying so hard not to break down

God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional

I'm driving back home through the canyon
There's only so much that I can handle
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
I never show it, I never show it
I'm supposed to be the girl that never does this
I'm supposed to be some party girl that stands for nothing
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it
I'm about to lose it, I'm about to lose it

God, I'm only human, trying to face it all
But I don't want to get emotional
Been walking on a tightrope, trying not to fall
But I don't want to get emotional10Embed
