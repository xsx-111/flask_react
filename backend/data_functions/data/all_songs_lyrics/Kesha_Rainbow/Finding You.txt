Finding You Lyrics
I wanna lay in your arms when the world is burning
I wanna dig in your heart, take away your hurting
Kiss me and tell me I'm fine and forget we’re dying
I wanna feel you tonight like the very first time
Let's run away, baby, drive straight into the moonlight
Kiss me and tell me you're mine like no one’s watching
Like time is stopping

I know forever don't exist
But after this life, I'll find you in the next
So when I say "forever," it's the goddamn truth
I'll keep finding, finding you

I'm gonna search for your love, right through Hell and Heaven
Millions of years yet to come and in all dimensions
I know that you'll always be my happy ending
My happy ending

No, I know forever don't exist
But after this life, I’ll find you in the next
So when I say "forever," it’s the goddamn truth
I'll keep finding, finding you
Ah, ooh (Finding, finding you)
Ah, ooh (Finding, finding you)
Ah, ooh (Finding, finding you)
Ah, ooh (Finding, finding you)
I’ll keep finding, finding you
I know forever don't exist
After this life, I'll find you in the next
When I say "forever," it's the goddamn truth
I’ll keep finding, finding you, oh

I know forever don't exist
But after this life, I'll find you in the next
When I say "forever," it's the goddamn truth (Finding, finding you)
I'll keep finding, finding, finding you, oh (Finding, finding you)
Keep finding, finding you18Embed
