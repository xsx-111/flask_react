Woman Lyrics
Let's be serious, come on
This is a real, this is, excuse me!
Okay, shut up!

I buy my own things, I pay my own bills
These diamond rings, my automobiles
Everything I got, I bought it
Boys can’t buy my love
Buy my love, yeah (My card's been rejected)
I do what I want (She does), say what you say (Woo)
I work real hard every day

I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don’t need a man to be holding me too tight
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker

Mmm, yeah

Let's drive around town in my Cadillac
Girls in the front, boys in the back
Loosey as a goosey and we're looking for some fun
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright
I don’t need a man to be holding me too tight
I’m a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I’m just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker

Mmm, yeah
Mmm, yeah

Don't buy me a drink, I make my money (Oh)
Don't touch my weave, don’t call me "honey"
'Cause I run my shit, baby ('Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit)
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I write this shit, baby, I write this shit) I write my shit
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit)
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey" (Don't touch my weave, baby)
'Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit ('Cause I run my shit, baby, I run my shit)
Don't buy me a drink (Oh), I make my money (Oh)
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey" (Oh)
I run this shit, baby, I run this shit ('Cause I run this shit, baby, I run this shit)
Don't buy me a drink, I make my money
Don't touch my weave, don't call me "honey"
('Cause I write this shit, baby, I write this shit)
Whoa, woo
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, alright (Oh, yeah)
I don't need a man to be holding me too tight
I'm a motherfucking woman, baby, that's right
I'm just having fun with my ladies here tonight
I'm a motherfucker

Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Ooh, oh
Mmm, yeah24Embed
