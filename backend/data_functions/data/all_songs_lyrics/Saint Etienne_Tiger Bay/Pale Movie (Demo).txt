Pale Movie (Demo) LyricsLalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
All of his friends have been wondering
Why he spent so long with her
He's so dark and moody
She is his sunshine girl
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
In the bed where they make love
She's in a film on the sheets
He shows dreams like a movie
She's the softness of cinema seats
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
He sees all of the girls
Like Demi Moore as she sighs
Dreams come true as he holds her
'Til the X's come up in her eyes
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Like roses grow in a churchyard
Her skin as white as the milk
Just like a Sherpa Tensing
Under a Manilla silk
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala
Lalala lalalala, lalalala lalalalala...Embed
