Western Wind (2) LyricsWestern wind, when will thou blow?
Snow rain down, hey, rain
Oh that my love were in my arms
Western wind, when will thou blow?
Snow rain down, hey, rain
Oh that my love were in my arms
Western wind, when will thou blow?
Snow rain down, hey, rain
Christ, that my love were in my armsEmbed
