Groveley Road LyricsGeorge, he called to say that he'd be late; /
There's something on the tv around eight. /
If you could see me, / and if you could see me, ooh, /
And if you could see me, ooh. /
Talk to you at night when you're asleep. /
I say i deserve / better than this. /
If you could see me, / and if you could see me, ooh, /
And if you could see me, ooh. /
Spring-time came, george didn't care at all. /
No-one's broke my heart like this before. /
If you could see me, / and if you could see me, ooh, /
And if you could see me, ooh. /
It's spring-timeEmbed
