Black Horse Latitude LyricsA Tuesday night in No 19
I'd like to think it's a bit of a scene
Steve Coogan and his lady friend
Are thinking about a kiss
There's revue songs on Friday night
But we're giving them a miss
Drinking in the Black Horse
Prince is on the jukebox
Pete Paphides in's the corner
Four degrees and getting warmer
Across the road from Winnington Park
Taylor Parkes in a bit of a nark
Will Georgie Graham's Arsenal be champions again?
Is Michael Jackson's 'Dangerous' as bad as people say?
Drinking in the Black Horse
Prince is on the jukеbox
Simon Price is in the corner
Four dеgrees and getting warmerEmbed
