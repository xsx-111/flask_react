My Christmas Prayer LyricsOh Lord, / the snow is falling /
And the whole world / kneels to pray, /
For tomorrow / brings the dawning /
Of another / Christmas Day. /
Oh Lord, / will you please help me, /
For my baby's / gone astray? /
Bring him back, / 'cause I'm so lonesome, /
And tomorrow's / Christmas Day. /
I don't need mistletoe; / where did my baby go? /
Where, / oh where / can he be? /
Oh Lord, / won't you hear my prayer? /
Oh, / you know, / I really care. /
Please, / please, bring him back / to me. /
Oh Lord, / the snow is falling /
And the whole world / kneels to pray, /
For tomorrow / brings the dawning /
Of another / Christmas Day. /
It's another / Christmas DayEmbed
