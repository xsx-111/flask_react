I Was Born on Christmas Day Lyrics
(Laughs) Roll the tape!
(Sarah:) Spent the summer holed up in a room
(Tim:) Looking pretty, won't you be here soon?
(Sarah:) Euro Disney, could not work at all
(Both:) a little bird had told me in the fall
Getting groovy after Hallowe'en
Mid-November, got back on the scene
I'm so glad that I just got my pay!
I was born on Christmas day
(Tim:) In December, my heart's full of spring
(Sarah:) I could phone you, tell you everything
(Tim:) like the crazy evenings on the yacht
(Both:) Tim and Sarah went and tied the knot!
Did you know they pulled the town hall down?
I don't think you'll recognise this town
Never could have been a tennis wife
Get into the acting life
Getting groovy after Hallowe'en
Mid-November, got back on the scene
I'm so glad that I just got my pay!
I was born on Christmas day
I was born on Christmas day
I was born on Christmas dayEmbed
