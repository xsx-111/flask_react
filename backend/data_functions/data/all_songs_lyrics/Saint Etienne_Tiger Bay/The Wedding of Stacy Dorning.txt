The Wedding of Stacy Dorning LyricsApril morning, a chance of rain
Stacy Dorning puts on her train
She walked by the river down to the gate
He hoped that his love was real
Say goodbye, say goodbye to the girls on the Ferris wheel
Say hello to the sporting life
Mr. Bowie, meet your new wife
She walked by the river down to the gate
He hoped that his love was real
Say goodbye, say goodbye to the girls on the Ferris wheel
She walked by the river down to thе gate
He hoped that his lovе was real
Say goodbye, say goodbye to the girls on the Ferris wheelEmbed
