I Buy American Records LyricsShe's an auburn-haired girl / from a town of Spanish sand, /
And she wades through Junior High / with a radio in her hand, /
And she never talks to the country kids, /
She just moves with the times like her mother did, /
And when / she comes in the spring, /
Her touch can do everything, /
'cause she wears my ring. /
Oo-ooh, / American records. /
She never looks at her watch, / 'cause time's the clock of her heart. /
Her eyes are a million years, / she sighs like a movie star, /
And under the boardwalk by the sea, /
With my baby is where I'll be, /
And when / she comes in the spring, /
Her touch can do everything, /
'cause she wears my ring. /
Oo-ooh, / American records. /
And under the boardwalk by the sea, /
With my baby is where I'll be, /
And when / she comes in the spring, /
Her touch can do everything, /
'cause she wears my ring. /
Oo-ooh, / American records. /
'Cause she wears my ring. /
Oo-ooh, / American records. /
Oo-ooh, / American records. /
Oo-ooh, / American records. /
American records. /
