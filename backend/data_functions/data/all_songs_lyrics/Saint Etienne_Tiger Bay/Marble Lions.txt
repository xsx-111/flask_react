Marble Lions LyricsI'll meet you / past the great divide, yeah, /
Setting sail 'cross darkened dawn. /
Everybody wants / something, /
And I want it all. /
Stars are calling, / goodnight, darling. /
Don't say good-bye. /
Stars are calling, / take the slow train. /
Don't say good-bye. /
Marble lions / at the gates of Eden /
Screaming songs to lull the rage. /
Let's raise a flag / that has no colours, /
Release the sun into the empty cathedral, yeah. /
Stars are calling, / goodnight, darling. /
Don't say good-bye. /
Stars are calling, / take the slow train. /
Don't say good-bye. /
Don't say good-bye, darling, / don't say good-bye
Stars are calling, / goodnight, darling. /
Stars are calling, / take the slow train. /
Stars are calling, / goodnight, darling. /
Stars are calling, / goodnight, darling. /
Goodnight, darlingEmbed
