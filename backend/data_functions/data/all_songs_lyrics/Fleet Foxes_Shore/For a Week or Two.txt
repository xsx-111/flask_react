For a Week or Two LyricsSome lost coast
Some bright days
No face on your young head
Piece of wheat
In your teeth
Carrying water, pears, and bread
And you're close to some surrender
You can feel it at your feet
And later on remember
When the fever broke and you could eat
And you've brought enough to last another week or two
Know the door is open, know that I miss you
You sought land
Overgrown
No words, no false, no true
Water stands
Waves just pass through it
Like something moves through youEmbed
