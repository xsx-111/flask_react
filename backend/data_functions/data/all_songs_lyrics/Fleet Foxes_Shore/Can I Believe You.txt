Can I Believe You LyricsCan I believe you?
Can I believe you?
Can I
Ever know your mind?
Am I handing you mine?
Do we both confide?
I see it, eat through every word I sow
See what you need to, do you doubt it's yours?
Now I’m learning the ropes
Never get this close
I've been wounded before
Hasn't let me go
It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don’t, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day
Can I believe you when you say I'm good?
I didn't need to when I wished you would
No, it isn't enough
Never held that much
Now another way up
Been a row too rough
It never got less strange, showing anyone just a bare face
If I don't, well, nothing will change
Staying under my weather all day
Lately, I'm wondering too
What type of desire I can break
When I'm one way with them, one with you
What half is it of me rearranged?
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?
I want to need you
I want to need you
Can I believe you?
Can I believe you?6Embed
