Sunblind Lyrics
For Richard Swift
For John and Bill
For every gift lifted far before its will
Judee and Smith
For Berman too
I've met the myth hanging heavy over you
I loved you long
You rose to go
Beneath you, songs, perfect angels in the snow
So time to stage
Forget reserve
The type of great coronation you deserve

I'm going out for a weekend
I'm gonna borrow a Martin or Gibson
With Either/Or and The Hex for my Bookends
Carrying every text that you've given

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Swimming high on a lea in an Eden
Running all of the leads you've been leaving
I'm overmatched (For Arthur Russell)
I'm half as wise (Duncan and Curtis)
If this is flat, brother, I apologize (Jimi and David, for Nick and Otis)
No one alone (For Bell and Buckley)
Can leave the cave (Marvin and Adam)
And all you've loaned won't be kept inside a grave (For Arthur Russell, for Arthur Russell)

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Just intending that I would delight them
Swimming high on a lea in an Eden

So I dream, dream
So I dream, dream

I'm gonna swim for a week in
Warm American Water with dear friends
Swimming high on a lea in an Eden
Running all of the leads you've been leaving

And in your rarified air I feel sunblind
I'm looking up at you there high in my mind
Only way that I made it for a long time
But I'm loud and alive, singing you all night, night
Warm American Water1Embed
