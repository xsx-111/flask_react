A Long Way Past the Past Lyrics
More than I had in mind
More than I wish I knew
And now itâ€™s near on me
Some rush of red fear
And my worst old times look fine from here

I know you walked this route
And you might help me out
You said what's done is done
I can't turn the hand 'round
But still it looks a long way down

Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain

We're not on one straight line
I made my own way through
And when the track goes cold
I'll know that it's true
That rebirth won't work like it used to
Oh man, was it that much better then?
We were left alone, we were proud of our pain
And so I want to walk out in the night
See the wide young river flood rain

And I can't let go
Of a lot I've left
I'm holding nothing
But what I kept
And it all got dimmer
Each passing step
And I need you with me
And you read the writ
Are you now insisting
Is it not worth it?
But I've got no option
I inherited this and I'm overcome

That's that, we're a long way from the past
I'll be better off in a year or in two1Embed
