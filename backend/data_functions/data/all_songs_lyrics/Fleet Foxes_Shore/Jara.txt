Jara LyricsFirst sight of the first good morning since you've been out of town
First time any violet omens don't shadow me around
So you want part of the great white tyrant, of ghost after ghost?
Well, you won't stop and I know you'll find it, halfway down the coast
You were never afraid of fighting, you blame an angry god
And when you see the first sign of violence, you bear it all as hard
When you held her son and wept I just felt jealous most of all
The best I had was near as bad as the sign of the rising fall
Though we're only alive a short while
So many beneath my feet
All weather, you walk with me
And you were off on a wandering mile
I was holding a weak excuse
I was heavy beneath blue
Now you're off to Victor on his ladder to the sky
And I'm left to sing it with you from my piece of the waterside
And you sang for the lost and gone who were young, and deserving more
And now I'm stood upright all night ready when you come in the door
Though we're only alive a short while
So many beneath my feet
All weather, you walk with me
And you were off on a wandering mile
I was holding a weak excuse
I was heavy beneath blue
All I heard
Wait for the word
You're coming with meEmbed
