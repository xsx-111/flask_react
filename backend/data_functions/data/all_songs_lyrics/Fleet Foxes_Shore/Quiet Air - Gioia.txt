Quiet Air / Gioia LyricsQuiet air, quiet in blue
Quiet ice-melt, summer-red cedar
Quiet air might terrify you
Quiet now though soon enough louder
Some shape, float on faith, in the eye
You want to go where the fire is worst
You want to watch our tower drop to the water
I know you don't want anyone else hurt
I know you don't you're better you're stronger
Some shape, float on faith in the eye
Some shape, floating in the eye
I'll be alone in the corduroy heath
I'll wait a long time till the hard rain is over
You're alone and you're calling on me
I'm underneath my canopy colder
Some shape, float on faith in the eye
Some shape, floating in the eye
Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me
Nowhere to go, no one I'd rather see (Oh, devil walk by, oh, devil walk by)
Oh, devil walk by, oh, devil walk by (I never want to die, I never want to die)
Oh, devil walk by, oh, devil walk by (I never want to die, I never want to die)
Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me (Wrong hour, wrong time, wrong hour, wrong time)
Oh, devil walk by, oh, devil walk by (I never want to die, I never want to die)
Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me (Wrong hour, wrong time, wrong hour, wrong time)
Nowhere to go
Feeling a gold unfolding hand on me
Nowhere to go, no one I'd rather seeEmbed
