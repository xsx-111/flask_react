Maestranza Lyrics
Monday night
Loud in the road outside
I saw the gate coming down
And smoke all around
The south hill
These last days
Con-men controlled my fate
No one is holding the whip
And the oil won't stick
But I will

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong

Sunday end
Ache for the sight of friends
Though I've been safe in the thought
That the line we walk
Is the same one

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrong
Sometimes it comes to this, no it's true
This time, what comes of it, call it due
I do
I do, I do, I do

Now that a light is on
Now that the water runs
And the heartless are nearly gone
No time to get it wrongEmbed
