Featherweight Lyrics
All this time I've been hanging on
To an edge I caught when we both were young
That the world I won wasn't near enough
Always distant, always all
In all that war, I'd forgotten how
Many men might die for what I'd renounced
I was staging life as a battleground
No, I let that grasping fall

May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to
And we've only made it together
Feel some change in the weather
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to

And though it's all so uncertain, cold
All the rafters cracked, all the copper sold
There's a ration back in a manifold
If you need it or forgot

May the last long year be forgiven
All that war left within it
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to
And we've only made it together
Feel some change in the weather
I couldn't, though I'm beginning to
And somehow I see
It's free

And with love and hate in the balance
One last way past the malice
One warm day's all I really need
And with love and hate in the balance
One last way past the malice
One warm day is all I really needEmbed
