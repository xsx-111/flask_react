Wading in Waist-High Water Lyrics
Summer all over
Blame it on timing
Weakening August water
Loose-eyed in morning
Sunlight covered over
Wading in sight of fire

And we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose

Soon as I knew you
All so wide open
Wading inside of fire
As if I just saw you
Cross Second Avenue
Wading in waist-high water

And I love you so violent
More than maybe I can do

Now we're finally aligning
More than maybe I can choose5Embed
