Buried Myself Alive LyricsYou almost always pick the best times to drop the worst lines
You almost made me cry again this time
Another false alarm, red flashing lights
Well, this time I'm not going' watch myself die
I think I made it a game to play your game and let myself cry
Buried myself alive on the inside, so I could shut you out
And let you go away for a long timeâ€¦ God!
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask
I think the chain broke away and I felt it the day
That I had my own time
I took advantage of myself and felt fine
But it was worth the night I caught an early flight
And I made it home
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask
Nicer than that, nicer than that
My foot on your neck, I finally have you
Right where I want you, right where I want you
Right where I want you, right where I want you
I guess it's okay I puked the day away
I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask
Nicer than that
(I guess it's okay I puked the day away)
Nicer than that
(I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way)
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask
Nicer than that, nicer, nicer5Embed
