The Taste of Ink Lyrics
Is it worth it? Can you even hear me?
Standing with your spotlight on me
Not enough to feed the hungry
I'm tired, and I felt it for a while now
In this sea of lonely
The taste of ink is getting old, it's
Four o' clock in the fucking morning
Each day gets more and more like the last day
Still I can see it coming
While I'm standing in the river drowning
This could be my chance to break out
This could be my chance to say goodbye
At last, it's finally over
Couldn't take this town much longer
Being half-dead wasn't what I planned to be
Now I'm ready to be free

So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this

Don't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright-lit city?
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see it
So long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
We'll drink and dance the night away
We can drink and dance the night away
So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last
And I'll savor every moment of this, I'll savor every moment of this

As long as you're alive, here I am
I promise I will take you there
As long as you're alive, here I am
I promise I will take you there

Don't you think I'm pretty
When I'm standing top the bright-lit city?
And I'll take your hand and pick you up
And keep you there so you can see it
As long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there
So long as you're alive and care
I promise I will take you there

So here I am, it's in my hands
And I'll savor every moment of this
So here I am, alive at last, and I'll savor every moment of this
Savor every moment of this, savor every moment of this!
