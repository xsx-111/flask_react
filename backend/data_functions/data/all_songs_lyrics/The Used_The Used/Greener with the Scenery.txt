Greener with the Scenery Lyrics
You took it back
How could you go and do something like that
My fingernail phase
Worst has got the best of you
I ask you and I know I need to change, change

You took it back
You ripped my heart out of my, then you put it back
I'm pulling my hair
I let you just a million times
I love you even though it isn't fair

Round we go, 'round again, circles
Play this game over again
Round we go, 'round again, circles

You took it back
You ripped my heart out of my, then you put it back
I'm pulling my hair
I let you just a million times
I love you even though it isn't fair
Round we go, 'round again, circles
Play this game over again
Round we go, 'round again, circles

You took it back
You took it back

Round we go, 'round again, circles
Play this game over again
Round we go, 'round again, circles, circles4Embed
