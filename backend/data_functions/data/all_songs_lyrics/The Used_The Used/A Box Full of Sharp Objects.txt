A Box Full of Sharp Objects Lyrics
It's our time to shine
Through the down
Glorified by what is ours
We've fallen in love
We've fallen in love
It was the best idea I ever had

Today I fell, and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger
And sharper!
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful
Today I fell, and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger
And sharper!
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing!
Today I fell, and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger
And sharper!
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing!

Do you want a song of glory?
Well, I'm fucking screaming at you!
It's our time to shine
Through the down
Glorified by what is ours
We've fallen in love
We've fallen in love
It was the best idea I ever had

Today I fell, and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger
And sharper!
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing
Today I fell, and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger
And sharper!
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing

Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing
Found a box of sharp objects, what a beautiful thing!9Embed
