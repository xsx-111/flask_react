Pieces Mended Lyrics
Being faced with what I'm faced with I feel like I can't rock
Like a rock hit my heart
Started to chain the day and exploded into pieces

Marry me, stay the same
Lie to me and try to say you never will
Marry me, stay the same
Lie to me and try to tell me

I've got a feeling in my gut, now fills me with so much hope
Said fuck it, I'm fine, dine and dashed
The pianist peddled into morning, morning

Marry me, stay the same
Lie to me and try to say you never will
Marry me, stay the same
Lie to me and try to say you never

Morning, morning

Being faced with what I'm faced with I feel like I can't rock
Like a rock hit my heart
Started to chain the day and exploded into pieces
Pieces
Pieces
Pieces
Pieces
Pieces
Pieces
Pieces

Being faced with what I'm faced with I feel like I can't rock
Like a rock hit my heart
Started to chain the day and exploded into piecesEmbed
