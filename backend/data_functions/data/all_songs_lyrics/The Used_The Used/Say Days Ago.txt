Say Days Ago Lyrics
I still remember a year ago
The times we spent
I feel that I'm happier now
Up from the down
By all means
It's strange cause I feel the same way

I think of what it looks like, I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like, I think of what it tastes, tastes

Same strange, said it's strange cause I feel the same
Same strange, said it's strange cause I feel the same
Still remember what it tastes like, what it felt like

Makes me ill, me ill

I think of what it looks like, I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like, I think of what it tastes, tastes

Same strange, said it's strange cause I feel the same
Same strange, said it's strange cause I feel the same
Still remember what it tastes like, what it felt like
It makes me ill, makes me ill
Makes me, makes me
(Kinda makes me ill, kinda makes me ill, me ill)
Still remember what it tastes like, what it felt like
(Kinda makes me ill)
What it felt like
(Makes)2Embed
