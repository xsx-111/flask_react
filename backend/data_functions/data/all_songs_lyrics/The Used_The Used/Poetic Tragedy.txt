Poetic Tragedy Lyrics
The cup is not half empty as pessimists say
As far as he sees nothing's left in the cup
A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge
Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up

A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere
He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was is just a tragedy

So he voyages in circles and succeeds getting nowhere
And submits to the substance, that first got him there
There, there, there

In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy

He feels alone
His heart in his hand, he's alone
He feels alone
I feelâ€¦

Then on that last day he breaks
And he stood tall, and he yelled, and he yelled
(Why world, why world, hate you, hate you, bye world)
In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy2Embed
