On My Own Lyrics
See all those people on the ground, wasting time
I try to hold it all inside, but just for tonight
Top of the world, sitting here wishing
The things I've become, but something is missing
Maybe I, (fuck) what do I know

And now it seems that I have found, nothing at all
Want to hear your voice out loud, slow it down, slow it down
Without it all, I'm choking on nothing
It's clear in my head, that I'm screaming for something
Knowing nothing is better than knowing it all

On my own
On my own
On my own
On my own

On my own, yeah
On my own, yeah
Without it all I'm choking on nothing
It's clear in my head I'm screaming for something
Knowing nothing is better than knowing it all
On my own
On my own
On my own
On my ownEmbed
