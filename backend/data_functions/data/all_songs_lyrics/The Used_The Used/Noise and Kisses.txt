Noise and Kisses Lyrics
Look in my eyes
I'm jaded now, whatever that means
By sharing these things
I rip my heart out
It's worth my time
Whatever that means, so

Hard to see up
My neck feels stiff until I wake up
The orange I choked
And back to my neck
It's worth my time
Whatever that means, so

Share with me
'Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
'Cause I'd rather starve now
If you won't open up

Give it to me
Give me all
Whatever you want
It's never been me
To want this much
From you I can see
Yeah
Share with me
Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
Cause I'd rather starve now
If you won't open up
You won't open up

Tears me up
Tears me up
Tears me up
Tears me up

Look in my eyes
I'm jaded now, whatever that means
By sharing these things
I rip my heart out
It's worth my time
Whatever that means, so

Share with me
'Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
'Cause I'd rather starve now
If you won't open up
Won't open up
(Share with me)
Yeah it tears me up
('Cause I need it right now, let me see your insides)
Tears me up
(Or write me off)
And it tears me up
('Cause I'd rather starve now if you won't open up)
Tears me upEmbed
