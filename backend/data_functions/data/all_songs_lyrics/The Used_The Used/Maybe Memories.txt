Maybe Memories Lyrics
As we trudge along through the mud and we tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, not at all, not for one, for one, for one second

Never have been one to write it down, now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now, who's looking South?
Not me, I'm not looking back, done denying the truth to anyone
Cause I'm alive

You showed me how you seemed to find a hole
But I just laughed and smiled begged and rolled my eyes
Even cried and denied the truth to you
Just like the truth to me mostly lied
I'm not going to look back x4
White it out glittering wax butterflies

I'm not going to look back x71Embed
