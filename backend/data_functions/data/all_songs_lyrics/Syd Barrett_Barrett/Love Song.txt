Love Song LyricsI knew a girl and I like her still
She said she knew she would trust me and I, her will
I said, "OK baby, tell me what you'll be
And I'll lay my head down and see what I see"
By the time she was back by her open eyes
I knew that I was in for a big surprise
I knew a girl and I like her still
She said she knew she would trust me and I, her will
I said, "OK baby, tell me what you'll be
And I'll lay my head down and see what I see"
By the time she was back by her open eyes
I knew that I was in for a big surprise1Embed
