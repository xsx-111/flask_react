Rats LyricsGot it hit down
Spot knock inside a spider
Says: "That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Says: "That's love - All know it
TV, teeth, feet, peace, feel it...
"That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
"That's love yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!"
Like the fall that brings me to
I like the fall that brings me to
I like the cord around sinew
I make a cord around sinew
Duck, the way to least is less
The deep craving of the metal west
Held tomorrow's rain in test
Held tomorrow's rain in test
Love an empty sun and guess
Love an empty sun and guess
Dimples dangerous and blessed
Heaving, arriving, tinkling
Mingling jets and statuesque
Seething wet we meeting fleck
Seething wet we meeting fleck
Lines and winds and crib and half
Each fair day I give you half
Of each fair day I give you half
I look into your eyes and you
Flathe in the sun for you...
Bam, spastic, tactile engine
Heaving, crackle, slinky, dormy, roofy, wham
I'll have them, fried bloke
Broken jardy, cardy, smoocho, moocho, paki, pufftle
Sploshette moxy, very smelly
Cable, gable, splintra, channel
Top the seam he's taken off
Rats, rats lay down flat
We don't need you, we act like that
And if you think you're un-loved
Then we know about that...
Rats, rats, lay down flat!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, lay down flat!Embed
