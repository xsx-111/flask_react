Maisie LyricsMaisie, Maisie, Maisie, Maisie...
Bad luck, bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
Maisie, his illuminous grin put her in a spin
Maisie, lay in the hall
With diamonds and emeralds
Maisie, Maisie...
Bad luck - the bride of a bull
Maisie, Maisie...
Bad luck - the bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light
His luminous grin put her in a spin
Maisie lay in the hall with her emeralds
And her diamond brooch, beyond reproach
Bad luck - bride of a bull
Strode out to meet Maisie in the evening light...
Maisie!Embed
