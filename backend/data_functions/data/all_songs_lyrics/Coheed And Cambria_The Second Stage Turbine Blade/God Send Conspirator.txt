God Send Conspirator Lyrics
Hold in your last breath and stare
Assure me your metronome's left arm stick shift
Is stuck on the right words in your ear
Did you hear me loud and clear, in sight and out of mind?
Cautiously avoiding the cracks
Not to disturb your steadied-arm straight line
The facts before a climb, a plan before a crime
Tired in the days that passed away
Sporadically arranged across your floor when you've got it made

Dear Mariah
The world's not big enough for the both of us
When we live in the same town, that's wrong
Fight on, fire (Fight on, fire)
I'll burn my hands 'til I've got nothing left
To count my numbers on, that's wrong
What's right?

Your wise-ass comments could cheer you up
The emotional disturbance, relax, deep breath, sit back
From the space in which you stand
Here and in demand
Don't touch a fresh wound that bleeds
All over your carpets, the stains, the storybook remains
And the page that states you've lied
Accept and then reply, acknowledge the other guy
Tired in the days that passed away
Sporadically arranged across the floor when you've got it made
(Tired in the days that passed away)
Dear Mariah
The world's not big enough for the both of us
When we live in the same town, that's wrong
Fight on, fire (Fight on, fire)
I'll burn my hands 'til I've got nothing left
To count my numbers on...

Don't change your mind when all's been won
Your words, in time, with the loss that you'd let them go
Don't let them fall if your grip's not strong
In time, decide, with the words that you'd let them go
Don't let them fall if your grip's not strong

Dear Mariah, come sleep in your own
Oh, dear Mariah, come sleep in your own
Well, dear Mariah, come sleep in your own
Oh, dear Mariah, come sleep in your own

When eye meets eye, become
We'll lie here alone, locked, our children in the floor
When eye meets eye, become
We'll lie here alone, locked, the children in the floor
When eye meets eye, become
(Your dreams can't last forever)
We'll lie here alone, locked, the children in the floor
In the floor...
Father figure wraps his face up
He'll be coming home to you
(Who sat me down here?)
(Your dreams can't last forever)
Locked, our children in the floor
(Who sat me down here?)
When eye meets eye, become
(Your dreams can't last forever)
We'll lie here alone, locked, our children in the floor
(Who sat me down here?)
When eye meets eye, become
(Your dreams can't last forever)
We'll lie here alone, locked, the children in the floorEmbed
