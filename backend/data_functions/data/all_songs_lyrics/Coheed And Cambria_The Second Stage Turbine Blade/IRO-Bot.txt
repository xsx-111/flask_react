IRO-Bot Lyrics
In our days we've mourned insignias
The passing glance, unstamped
We've rendered ourselves powerless, unfortunate
The useless mend the fixed
In our every hour, it detonates
My courage goes unlooked
The ride home through perilous
The land it goes, I will

You've been a bad boy
You broke all the rules
You've been a bad boy
You'll get yours paid in full

IRO-bot will never die
My robot will never die
You look down but far from out
And the paper reads "You lose"
IRO-bot will never kill

A favor captain, a word with you
My system's gone and lost its mind
My right eye has done shed a tear
My gun, I've left behind
Will systems take me home and disassemble me?
Will I be terminated with you near?
Alongside the others that I hold so close?
If I'm to be killed, then when, by whom?

You've been a bad boy
You broke all the rules
You've been a bad boy
You'll get yours paid in full

IRO-bot will never die
My robot will never die
You look down but far from out
And the paper reads "You lose"
IRO-bot will never dieEmbed
