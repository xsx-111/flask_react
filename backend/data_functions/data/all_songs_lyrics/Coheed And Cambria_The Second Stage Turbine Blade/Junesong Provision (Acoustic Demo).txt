Junesong Provision (Acoustic Demo) Lyrics
Yeah..
Alright you primitive screw-heads, listen up
See this? This...is my BOOMSTICK!

Good morning, sunshine, awake when the sun hits the sky
Look up the sounds that surround the day you died
She waits for me outside near a hole in the ground
And there's one way thinking you might get the upper hand

Dear Newo Ikkin, how's Apollo been treating you?
Has he been a good boy since the day I left?
Give him my love and a sweet kiss for his head
'Cause I won't be coming home, when you get this I'll be dead

Norris and Larry
Gloria to nowhere
Sir, I think you'd better take my hand
And pray we'll make this one out alive
Captain, we've lost all systems control
Then, son, I'll see you in my sleep

Is it all you've shared with them that makes us paranoid?
Is it the dream that one day you might be something you're not?
Is it all you've shared with them that makes us paranoid?
Is it the dreams that make us real?
I...
Wrong way, back there
I'll stand quiet and shiver
I...
(And with you and wait for you when we come)
Wrong way, right way
Bad luck, you've got to be kidding me

I've spent so long sitting down here
Papercut my heart in half and discard the evidence
When it's yours, come send me the left half
Dowsed in kerosene
In a torched blazed bloodbath
When boy sets fire, God knows you've lost
At a cost that has no price
When you've purchased guilt
Stand at attention
And make sure you know the lines and yourself
You'd say, "I'll be home alone again, waiting"

Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Way down, where's Wednesday?)
When you want to promise me that
(Where's Wednesday?)
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Way down, where's Wednesday?)
When you want to promise me that
(Where's Wednesday?)
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Way down, where's Wednesday?)
When you want to promise me that
(Where's Wednesday?)
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Way down, where's Wednesday?)
When you want to promise me that
(Where's Wednesday?)
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Way down, where's Wednesday)
When you want to promise me that
(Where's Wednesday?)Embed
