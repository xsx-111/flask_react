Junesong Provision Lyrics
Good morning, sunshine
Awake when the sun hits the sky
Look up at the sounds that surround
The day you died
She waits for me outside
Near a hole in the ground
In the one way thinking
You might get the upper hand

Dear Newo Ikkin
How's Apollo been treating you?
Has he been a good boy
Since the day I left?
Give him my love
And a sweet kiss for his head
'Cause I won't be coming home
When you get this, I'll be dead

Norris and Larry, Gloria to nowhere
Sir, I think you'd better take my hand
And pray we'll make this one out alive
Captain, we've lost all systems control
Then son, I'll see you in my sleep, sleep...
Is it all you've shared with them
That makes us paranoid?
Is it the dream that one day
You might be something you're not?
Is it all you've shared with them
That makes us paranoid?
Is it the dreams that make us real?
Is it the dreams that make us real?

(We'll miss you and wait for you when you come)
Wrong way, right way
Bad luck, what God has been giving me
(We'll miss you and wait for you when you come)
Wrong way, right way
Bad luck, you've gotta be kidding me

I've spent so long sitting down, here
Paper-cut my heart in half and discard the evidence
When it's yours, come send me the last half
Doused in kerosene in a torched, blazed blood bath
When boy sets fire, God knows you've lost
At a cost that has no price, when you've purchased guilt
Stand at attention and make sure you know
The lines and yourself
Yet you'd say, "I'll be home alone again, waiting"

Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
When you wanna promise me that
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
When you wanna promise me that
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
When you wanna promise me that
(To drive down, where's Wednesday?)
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Where's Wednesday?)
When you wanna promise me that
(To drive down, where's Wednesday?)
Wait for me alright, I'm still a boy down there
(Where's Wednesday?)
When you wanna promise me thatEmbed
