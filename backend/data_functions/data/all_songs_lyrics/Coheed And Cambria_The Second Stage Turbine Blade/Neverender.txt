Neverender Lyrics
When you've gone about things all wrong
Bury them here, with the lifetime you would never regret
In savoring sleep
What do you mean I "toss and turn everywhere"?
I'll miss you when you're gone
In pretending that you meant the world to me
With that, you'd call me a liar
And in the making mistakes, you'll rest incomplete

(I'll be home) In graver mistakes, dear Mom and Dad
I write you in this letter that states: (I'll be moving on)
When the new day's begun (New day's begun)
Forget your son, when he's out on his own

When the hand reads 7:30
And your night begins to sink in the short, but faster fall
Anxious but calm retort
To a mirror that frames your face, baring the finest swell
When the day begins to break
Like the tears that run across your cheek
Stand straight and imagine you, then
And if things were the way they could have been
When the thoughts, they race across your chin
Here, in the Neverend
(I'll be home) In graver mistakes, dear Mom and Dad
I write you in this letter that states (I'll be moving on)
Scratched through the wall:
When the new day's begun (New day's begun)
Forget your son, when he's out on his own

Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Here, in there, after the fire

(Before you walk home)
Peace and figuring, will he be home again?
(Signal loss in stereo)
With wide open windows, will she be waiting for?
(The sounds that surround the overpass)
With severed arm placement when the day's dark, old, and dead
(A dead man against you)
We'll write her a letter with long time passing

(I'll be home) In graver mistakes, dear Mom and Dad
I write you in this letter that states: (I'll be moving on)
When the new day's begun (New day's begun)
Don't forget son, when he's out on his own
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Point your gun in another direction
Now that you've cried yourself to sleep
Here, in there, after the fire

After the fire
(I'll be home to say "I love you," and I'll be moving on)
And I'll be bigger
And I'll be bigger2Embed
