Elf Tower New Mexico Lyrics
Elf Power, New Mexico
Elf Power, New Mexico

Well, thank God you're still angry at me
I've got a better chance of seeing you dead and buried
I'll thank her for this one last big mistake
It's your turn, come shoot for it, if you win
Well, you can lead the way
Midday subway into New Jersey
Did you think maybe I was doing quite well
Without you in the frame, still?

Killed in defense, calm with your cold years after
I'm giving you up, go on, find someone new
'Til then, pretend I touched before you'd ask her
I'm giving you up, go on, find someone new
Dear Nikki, what, what if I
Could have found a better half here, in you?
Oh Nikki, here in Elf Power, New Mexico

Elf Tower, New Mexico
Stay here
In our last standing hourglass circumstance
Devoted here, to the midst of the weary eyes
Lost and buried here, in your big surprise again
Well, your fingers find my back
Familiar fit in the questions that I had to ask
Did you think maybe I was doing quite well
Without you in the frame, still?

Killed in defense, calm with your cold years after
I'm giving you up, go on, find someone new
'Til then, pretend I touched before you'd ask her
I'm giving you up, go on, find someone new
Dear Nikki, what, what if I
Could have found a better half here, in you?
Oh Nikki, here in Elf Power, New Mexico

Somehow, tonight, you run out of air

I'll mark my words in learned lessons
Dear god, before I heard this was your intention
Before I could have figured how to love another
Dear, there's Coheed and then Cambria
In departure, absence makes the heart grow fonder
Thank God they recovered your body in New Mexico
Three days, it's spoiled, love
We miss you in every way, you could've been dear
Wish you were here in the frame, still

Killed in defense, calm with your cold years after
I'm giving you up, go on, find someone new
'Til then, pretend I touched before you'd ask her
I'm giving you up, go on, find someone new
Dear Nikki, what, what if I
Could have found a better half here, in you?
Oh Nikki, here in Elf Power, New Mexico1Embed
