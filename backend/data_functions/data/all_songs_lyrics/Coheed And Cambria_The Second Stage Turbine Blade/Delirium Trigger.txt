Delirium Trigger Lyrics
We're now up here, alone
Terror on the intercom, can someone save us?
Systems malfunction, blast it, this damn machine
Over and out, captain
Something lurks, creeps on the counter top
Somewhere behind you
Parasitic cyst, I can't stand to watch
It's coming up and out of your chest
Remember when we were young?

Sit up, right on the table
A photograph of earth feeding me a way back
Frightened, I tear alone
Or maybe not the the only one there
"Hello?"... "Hello"
When it rings, will you answer?
There, corner tall short stance, it's you
Come on, kill me

You made a good friend to me
But while you were outnumbered and torn
You made us do things
Oh dear god, I don't feel alive
When you're cut short of misery
Will you pray it be the end?
Give a look surprised, wide eyes to me
Then you'll know just what I am
The scare that triggers your fear
Come know me in a different light now
Come know me as god

You made a good friend to me
But while you were outnumbered and torn
You made us do things to you
Run sand, hourglass
It's my time, will I be worth?
Spin 'round, carousel
When your horse isn't screwed in

Oh dear god, I don't feel alive
When you're cut short of misery
Will you pray it be the end?
Give a look surprised, wide eyes to me
(Raise forth lost cause!)
Then you'll know just what I am (Subtle demise, legitimate cry)
The scare that triggers your fear
Come know me in a different light now
Come know me as god
(Raise forth lost cause!)1Embed
