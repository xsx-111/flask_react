33 Lyrics
It's not what you have learned
But what they said about you under your shirt
You know they never will
They'll make sense of what you gave them
And now it's all downhill from here
Well, in case you break my fall
We're bringing it home!
Patrick, short flip
And outside boundary lines

(I'm running you down)
Oh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here
(Inside out) I'm still unclear
'Bout the things you might have said

In pieces, they stagger, embedded
Rush me to the emergency room
Flatline equals frantic endeavor
But I guess this'll have to do now
Patrick, short flip, and outside
We're bringing it home!
(I'm running you down)
Oh yeah, well nothing seems right from up here
(Inside out) I'm still unclear
'Bout the things you might have said
(Down)
Oh yeah, well nothing seems right from up here
(Inside out) I'm still unclear
'Bout the things you might have said
'Bout the things you might have said

Hold on to the things you favour most
Shift right and let it run down
If my peace could find a way up
Let go of the youthful honesty
Let go of the youthful honesty
Let go of the youthful honesty

(I'm running you down)
Oh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here
(Inside out) I'm still unclear
'Bout the things you might have said
(Down)
Oh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here
(Inside out) I'm still unclear
'Bout the things you might have said
(I'm running you down)
Oh yeah, well nothing looks right from up here
I'm still unclearEmbed
