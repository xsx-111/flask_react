Everything Evil Lyrics
Wait for everything evil in you comes out
I'll stay when we'll only motivate sound instead, Sergeant
Make for the table, in hopes that I won't be afraid again
Call when enabled, and send the leader out against
I will stage a reenactment, in a false pretense: Exist, inflict
Unworthy unconsciousness
Why debate when the action's suppressed?
Then kill the acquitted
Listen to the sounds that remain in question
In hopes to solidify a truce
Amongst the children, and the jury that stands the verdict
Alive, here among the dead

Evolve, Monstar!
Show me the things I've never wanted done
Evolve, Monstar!
Do to me the things I never wanted done

I, I felt much better than this before
If they find out to avoid
Then the accidents kept hidden away
But if they stay...
Blood-hungry, cannibalistic, unfit family ties
In a series of knocks to the young girl's head side
Come write me a letter, and paste it on my refrigerator door
Inspected inspector, I think we've found something over here

I, I felt much better than this before
If they find out to avoid
Then the accidents kept hidden away
But if they stay...

Jesse, just come look at what your brother did
Here, he did away with me
Jesse, just come look at what your brother did
Here, he did away with me

Stay until Wednesday
And write me a childlike letter, pretending
At war here in Thursday
Let's make this our last day at home by the Fence

Would you run? Would you run?
Would you run, down past the Fence?
Would you run? Would you run?
Would you run, down past the Fence? (FBI!)
And she screamed "Claudio! Dear Claudio!
I wish, God damn it, we'll make it if you believe!"
And she screamed "Claudio! Dear Claudio!
I wish, God damn it, we'll make it if you believe!" (FBI!)Embed
