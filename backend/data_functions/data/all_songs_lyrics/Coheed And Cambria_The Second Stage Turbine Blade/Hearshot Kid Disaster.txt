Hearshot Kid Disaster Lyrics
Still searching for your call, today
Sit down, and structure will you be the engineer?
Still tired and dreaming out again and overboard
When pain kills you'll hate me and wait for, or
Then call me crazy
And pretend I left us discontent and afraid
So what, so I'm crazy, yeah
Then send me justice and I'll have Paris in flames

Still searching for your faith
In the arm that killed the president
Relapse, waiting here for
Still searching for your face
In the crowd that killed the president
Relapse, waiting here for

I need Mayo! (I won't fail you now)
Dear Captain, send the S.O.S
When we're gonna go down
I need Mayo! (I won't fail you now)
(We're going down and you're all fucked up, for sure!)
Dear Captain, send the S.O.S
When we're gonna go down
Wound open and squeezing my heart against
This pain inflicts and, in passion, I bleed for it
But with this what they gave me, yeah
This book and flint and a match to go with it

Still searching for your face
In the arm that killed the president
Relapse, waiting here for
Still searching for your face
In the crowd that buried New Mexico
I'll be waiting here for

I need Mayo! (I won't fail you now)
Dear Captain, send the S.O.S
When we're gonna go down
I need Mayo! (I won't fail you now)
(We're going down and you're all fucked up for sure!)
Dear Captain, send the S.O.S
When we're gonna go down

(Have you ever heard the lyrics he sang?)
In his thoughtful transmission, the words lost sentence remain
(Sing his song, sing his song loud!)
Structure, will you be the engineer?
(Where's your song, or have you lost the key or tone?)
Thank God for your strength, no
Will you hold your breath, waiting for me to exhale
In the short life lived?
Thank God for your strength, no
Will you hold your breath, waiting for me to exhale
In the short life lived?Embed
