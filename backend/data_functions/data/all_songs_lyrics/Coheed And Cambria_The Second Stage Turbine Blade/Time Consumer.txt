Time Consumer Lyrics
The young stale memories of, play the role to your part
Librarian, find me the pole, the one that kicks your head in
To my own time, roll your own innocence by
Grab on to my sleeve, the one that grabs at your ankle
Debate to understand that we all have a flaw
Then fail to represent your life as you know it
God grant you one wish, to turn back the time
Correct and create, making sense of...

Me and my star, Matthew, goodnight
You know by law, when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star, Matthew, goodnight
You know by Lord, when you'll be forgiven

So they pulled your confidence down
With those verbal discrepancies
Now and then, you'll gain what they've lost
Through a challenge of unpronounced
Pain is only a pulse
If you just stop feeling it
You might be able to use
The very things that makes us up
Me and my star, Matthew, goodnight
You know by Lord, when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star, Matthew, goodnight
You know my Lord

Wait now, here, when will you believe me?
I'm merely asking you to help me, when did I say to murder?
Wait now, here, please hear me out
Time consumer, time consuming, consume me
Down and out, now

Me and my star, Matthew, goodnight
You know by law, when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star, Matthew, goodnight
You know my Lord, when you'll be forgiven
You know, goodnight
And I'll promise you that
You know, goodnight
And I'll promise you thatEmbed
