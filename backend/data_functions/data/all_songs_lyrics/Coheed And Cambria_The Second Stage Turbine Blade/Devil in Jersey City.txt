Devil in Jersey City Lyrics
Hee-hee, Shabutie

New Jersey bound, when sound asleep
They'll find you at your most vulnerable pole position
Speak up, let out, when down the street
The corner boys fuck shit up

Scream loud, scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine, will you follow me home?
Scream loud, scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine, will you fuck me back home?

Let's fire it up, ha-ha, now
Let's fire it up, ha-ha, now
Sayonara!

Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding bastard
You'll be getting home real soon
And I'll pray for you high health
Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding bastard
You'll be getting home real soon
Speak up, let out, caught in the crossfire
Compared to the step to the bone that might break
It's too late to find a better way out of this
With the finest regards that I lost in the cracks of this street

Scream loud, scream sayonara
(Wide open, now you're dead and gone)
Sweet Josephine, will you follow me home?
Scream loud, scream sayonara
Sweet Josephine, will you fuck me back home?

Let's fire it up, ha-ha, now
Let's fire it up, ha-ha, now
Sayonara!

Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding bastard
You'll be getting home real soon
And I'll pray for you high health
Don't let them scare you
When you're down on the floor bleeding bastard
You'll be getting home real soon
(Don't let them scare you)

(Take me home)
When you run, they'll follow you
(Take me home)
When you run, they'll follow you
(Take me home)
When you run, they'll follow you
(Take me home)3Embed
