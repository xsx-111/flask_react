The Happiest Place on Earth LyricsI wanna pledge allegiance to the country where I live
I don't wanna be ashamed to be American
But opportunity, no, it don't exist
It's the opiate of the populace
We need some harder shit now
The truth's gettin' 'round
Each public school is a halfway house
Where huddled masses sober up and up
Enough? There's not enough
To fatten the cows
And feed all of us
It's just a rationing of luck
What can't be bought gets raffled off
Oh God, good God, shed greed on thee
Your shining sea turned a dirty green
From the industry
Off the shores of New Jersey
I got a letter from the Army so I think that I'll enlist
No, I'm not brave or proud of nothing
I just want to kill something
Too bad that nowadays, you just point and click
Swing Lo satellite, hot white chariot
In the computer's blue glare, bombs burst in the air
There was a city once, now nothing's there
Our freedom comes at their expense
Makes sense, does it? Dollars and cents
They're stretching barbed wire
Across a picket fence
That's surrounding your housing development
In case you lack the confidence
Oh God, my God, give strength to thee
These amber waves, purple majesty
Is nothing but backdrops for Disney
Look up close
It's superimposed
On a blank blue screen
Yeah, it's fantasy
Fucking magical
The dream floats
Like a chemical
Through each snapped synapse
Television past is beautiful
No more, no more
No more2Embed
