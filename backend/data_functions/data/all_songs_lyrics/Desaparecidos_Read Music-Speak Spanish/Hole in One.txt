Hole in One LyricsA man at the bank said let'sâ€‹ not talk percentages
Fourteen hour days, still two mortgages
You asked the state for aid, they gave you an ad campaign
That didn't help
You took your family to join in the urban sprawl
You can't see the stars as well but you're near the mall
Don't know where you stand no more, in line at the convenient store
That's way too long
You used to work your land, fed a thousand mouths
Now you eat their shit for the money now
Emptied your heart to fill your bank account
Well I should talk I'm just the same...
Buy my records down at the corporate chain
I tell myself I shouldn't be ashamed...
But I am
Adolescence made her an activist
Now she's the one who does all the lecturing
"Oh they got their eighteen holes
Should tell them to dig one more
The dream is dead"
Won't eat their food or wear their clothes
Always wants to know where her money goes
But will shell it out for filling up her nose
So run it up I'll run my mouth
Never mind the shit that I sing about
Cause I'd sell myself to buy a fucking house
12,000 square foot, 4 car garage
Tennis courts, swimming pool, and a backyard
I know it can seem like a lot
That's why I pay someone to clean it up
To clean it up. My big houseEmbed
