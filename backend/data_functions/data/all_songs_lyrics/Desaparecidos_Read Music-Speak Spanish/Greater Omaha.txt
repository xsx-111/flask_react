Greater Omaha Lyrics
Well, traffic's kind of bad
They're widening Easy Street
To fit more SUV's
They're planting baby trees
To grow to shady peaks
A little shelter from the sun
Or the upper tax bracket
Here on the cul-de-sac, we're not giving back
Till the community repents

'Cause we can't afford to be generous
There's closing costs and a narrow margin
So go earn your degree
And we'll take you out to lunch
You can work for us
But you gotta eat 'em all up

Yeah, one more mouthful and we will be happy then
Yeah, one more mouthful and we will be happy then

Out west, they're moving dirt
To make a greater Omaha
Another franchise sold
So there's even more
Restaurants per capita
And they all got a drive-thru
Yeah, who's got time to dine?
Although the floors are clean, the color scheme
It compliments me every time
So no one starves in this cattle town
The semis pass, making squealing sounds
And it's all you can eat
And they'll never get enough
They'll be feeding us
They'll be feeding on us

Just one more mouthful and they will be happy then
Yeah, one more mouthful and they will be happy then

All those golden fields, lovely empty space
They're building drug stores now until none remains
I've been driving now for a hundred blocks
Saw fifty Kum & Go's, sixty parking lots

Yeah, one more mouthful and they will be happy then
Woo!
Yeah, one more mouthful and they will be happy then

One more!
Yeah, one more, one more, more, more, more, more
Just one more!
Just one more!
Just one more!Embed
