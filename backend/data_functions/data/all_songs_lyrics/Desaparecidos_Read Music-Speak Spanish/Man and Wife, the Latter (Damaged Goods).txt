Man and Wife, the Latter (Damaged Goods) Lyrics
I'm growing out my hair
Like it was when I was single
It was longer than I've known you
I had no money then
I had no worries then at all
Such a high standard of living
I just feel like I am dying
I'd start an argument
But you can barely even talk
There's good reason for your silence
Have to take care of some business
So I fix your plate
And I stay out of the way

But you'll stay like that forever
Right in front of your computer
You'll look up one day
But you won't recognize me

So you wanna change
Read a letter from a lawyer
Wanna take me out to dinner
You wanna bury me under a mound of shopping bags
Like it'd really make a difference
Or make up for your disinterest
I'm a bill you pay
I'm a contract you can't break
And it's like I'm underwaterâ€‹
Or on an endless escalator
I just go up and up
But I don't ever reach the top
And it reads just like the bible
Twenty centuries of scandal
Yeah, it all depends on how you interpret it

The word is: love
The word is: loss
The words are: damaged goods
That's what I am
A lifetime gets chalked-up to an experience
Coincidence
We're chained to the events
That's itEmbed
