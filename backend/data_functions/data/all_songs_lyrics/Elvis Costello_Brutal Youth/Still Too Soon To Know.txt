Still Too Soon To Know Lyrics
Do you love him
Or is it still too soon to know?
When i think back a couple of days
Before i found you in his spell
Was there a warning?
What can i say
Should i look away

It's still too soon to know

Are you sorry
Or is it still to soon to know?
It didn't take much to break us in two
For it was in the way that he came close to touching you
The look in your eyes
I thought i recognized


And it's still too soon to know
Will you stay or will you go?

When i think back a couple of days
If i wasn't happy then, i never will be
I wonder was this ignorance or bliss?
