Apes-Ma Lyrics
Apes-ma, apes-ma
Your cage is too dirty, apes-ma
Remember when you were young, apes-ma?
And you used to break out of your cage?
Well you know that you're not
Strong enough to do that anymore now
And apes-ma, the little girl that
Named you years ago has died now
And you're older, apes-ma
Remember when she named you
And it was in the paper, apes-ma?
Apes-ma, apes-ma
You're eating too much
And going to the bathroom too much, apes-ma
And apes-ma, your cage isn't getting any bigger, apes-maEmbed
