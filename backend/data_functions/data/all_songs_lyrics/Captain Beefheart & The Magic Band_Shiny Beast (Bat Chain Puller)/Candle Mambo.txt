Candle Mambo Lyrics
Candle shy, candle weep
Fly hot candle leap
Candle roll, unfold and ball
Candle large, candle small

Your threads of fire are burning up
Your feathers of fire are winning night
And turning light, and turning light

Light deepest night for me and steer for me
Spin and spin, then and then

When I'm dancing with my love
The shadows flicker up above
Up above the shadows do the candle mambo

Candle roll, unfold and ball
Candle blur, candle whir
Candle her, candle her

While your lights are spinning around
Your feathers of fire are winning night
And turning light, and turning light
Candle crack, candle break
Correct the night's mistake

When I'm dancing with my love
The shadows flicker up above
Up above the shadows do the candle mambo
Candle mambo
Candle mambo


When I'm dancing with my love
The shadows flicker up above
Up above the shadows do the candle mambo

Candle roll, unfold and ball
Candle blur, candle whir
Candle her, candle her

While your lights are spinning around
Your feathers of fire are winning night
And turning light, and turning light
Candle crack, candle break
Correct the night's mistake

When I'm dancing with my love
The shadows flicker up above
Up above the shadows do the candle mamboEmbed
