The Floppy Boot Stomp Lyrics
The floppy boot stomped down onto the ground
The farmer screamed and blew the sky off the mountains
Eye sockets looked down on the chestbone meadows
'n the sun dropped down, and the moon ran off
His heels 'n elbows pale as chalk
'n all the comets collided 'n blew to dust
For fear they'd be seen

An' the sky turned white in the middle of the night
An' the sky turned white in the middle of the night
An' the big floppy boot stomped down onto the ground
An the red violin took the bow for to do the hoodoo hoe-down
(hoodoo hoe-down, hoodoo hoe-down, ha)
An the red violin took the bow for to do the hoodoo hoe-down
(hoodoo hoe-down, hoodoo hoe-down, ha)
The farmer jumped in a circle 'n flung his chalk right down
(hoodoo hoe-down, hoodoo hoe-down, ha)
(hoodoo hoe-down, hoodoo hoe-down, ha)
Do-shi-do the devil sure showed 'n he broke of his horns
(hoodoo hoe-down, hoodoo hoe-down, ha, hoodoo)
An' fiddled him down the road, through the fork

An' the farmer's floppy boot stomped down
Red tail squirmin' and the hot leg kicked
And the fire leaped 'n licked
Red tail squirmin' and the hot leg kicked
And the fire leaped 'n licked
And when the boot came up, the fire went out
And hell was just an ice cube melting off on the ground
And the bow caught down for to do the hoodoo hoe-down
And the bow caught down for to do the hoodoo, the devil hoe-down
And the bow caught down for to do the hoodoo, the devil hoe-down
Through the fork, huddled’ in the hollow
Standin’ at the crossroads
Was that bunged-up bandaged broken bum
That fell in the wrong circle
He had a sore red tail that once went red, now was pale
Fe-fo-fi-fum he was summoned up from hell
Booted down a spell
By a square-dancin’ farmer
By a square-dancin’ farmer, well
That old bum was sticking out his thumb
When the farmer drew up and said "Listen son"
And the horse compared his hooves
"If you fall into my circle again I’ll tan your red hide
And dance you on your tail, and pitch you from now to now
Pitch you from now to now."

And the hotlick kicked
And the fire leaped an’ licked
And the hotlick kicked
And the fire just leaped an’ licked
And the hotlick kicked
And the fire just leaped an’ licked
And the hotlick kickin’
An’ the fire jus’ leapin’ an’ lickin’
And the fire leaped and licked
The floppy boot stomped down to the ground
The floppy boot stomped down to the ground
The floppy boot stomped down to the ground
The floppy boot stomped down to the ground
The floppy boot stomped down to the groundEmbed
