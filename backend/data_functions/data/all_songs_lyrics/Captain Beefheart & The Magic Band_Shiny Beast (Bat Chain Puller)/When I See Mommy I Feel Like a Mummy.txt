When I See Mommy I Feel Like a Mummy Lyrics
When I see mommy, when I see mommy
I feel like a mummy, I feel like a mummy
When I see mommy, I feel like a mummy

Oh woe, when I see mommy, I feel like a mummy
I feel like a mummy, I feel like a mummy
Gonna wrap her up
Every time I see her, every time I see her
I want to grab her, pull her up to me
Till I look through her
But she moves so fast that I can't even see her
Her interest fades like breath on a mirror

Every time I see her, every time I see her
I try to grab her
And the wind from my hand
Blows away like a feather
Every time I grab her, every time I grab her

Oh - when I see mommy, I feel like a mummy
Gonna wrap her up, gonna wrap her up
Next time I see her, next time I see her
I'm gonna seize her
Then I'm gonna freeze her
It's the only way
That I might get to see her
Gonna wrap her up - oh, mommy

Oh, when I see mommy, I feel like a mummy
I feel like a mummy, I feel like a mummy
Every time I see her, every time I see her
I want to grab her, pull her up to me
Till I look through her
But she moves so fast that I can't even see her
Her interest fades like breath on a mirror
Like a breath on a mirror, like a breath on a mirror
Like a breath on a mirror, like a breath on a mirror
Yeah, when I see mommy, I feel like a mummy
I feel like a mummy, I feel like a mummyEmbed
