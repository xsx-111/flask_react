Harry Irene Lyrics
Harry, Irene were a couple that lived in the green
Harry, Irene were a couple that ran a canteen
Ran a canteen, ran a canteen

Two people Harry and Irene like you never seen
The floor was made of oak, the door was smoky grey
Their tuna sandwiches would turn the dark into day
They sold wine like turpentine to painters
They took to social life like props to aviators

Harry, Irene were a couple that ran a canteen
Harry, Irene were a couple that lived in the green
Ran a canteen, ran a canteen

Took Harry for all of his green and Irene
Harry was left holding an empty canteen
And by the way folks, it was Dusty not Harry
What does this mean? What does this mean?
What's the meaning of this? Poor Harry, I guess
