Love Lies Lyrics
Stopped by your house, saw your lamp lit
Not a sign of you in it
Where could you go at this hour?
Has all our love lost its power?

I said I'd be here with our flower

Street lamps flutter like fireflies
I wish I hadn't told you all of those love lies
Street lamps flutter like fireflies
I wish I hadn't told you all of those love lies

Where could you go at this hour?
Has all our love lost its power?
I miss you more hour by hour
The roses seem to smell sour

Street lamps flutter like fireflies
I wish I hadn't told you all of those love lies
Stopped by your house, saw your lamp lit
Not a sign of you in it
Where could you go at this hour?
Has all our love lost its power?
I said I'd be here with our flower
I miss you more hour by hour

Street lamps flutter like fireflies
I wish I hadn't told you all of those love lies
Oh, oh, all of those love lies
Butter lamps flutter like fireflies
Yeah, I wished I hadn't told you all of those love lies
Oh, all of those love lies
Oh, all of those love lies
Street lamps flutter like fireflies
I wish I hadn't told you all of those love lies
Oh, all of those love lies
All of those love lies
All of those love lies
All of those love lies
All, all, all of those love lies
Street lamps flutter like fireflies
All, all, all of those love lies
All, all, all of those love liesEmbed
