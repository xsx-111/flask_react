Bat Chain Puller Lyrics
Bat chain, puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller

A chain with yellow lights
That glistens like oil beads
On its slick smooth trunk
That trails behind on tracks, and thumps
A wing hangs limp and retreats
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Bulbs shoot from its snoot
And vanish into darkness
It whistles like a root snatched from dry earth
Sod-bustin’ rakes with grey dust claws
Announces it's coming in the morning
This train with grey tubes
That houses people’s very thoughts and belongings

Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
This train with grey tubes that houses people’s thoughts
Their very remains and belongings
A grey cloth patch
Caught with four threads
In the hollow wind of its stacks
Ripples felt fades and grey sparks clacks
Lunging the cushioned thickets
Pumpkins span the hills
With orange Crayola patches
Green inflated trees
Balloon up into marshmallow soot
That walks away in faulty circles
Caught in grey blisters
With twinkling lights and green sashes
Drawn by rubber dolphins with gold yawning mouths
That blister and break in agony
In zones of rust
They gild gold sawdust into dust

Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Bat chain puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Bat chain puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Puller, puller
Bat chain puller
Bat chain pullerEmbed
