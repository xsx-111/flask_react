Tropical Hot Dog Night Lyrics
Tropical Hot Dog Night, like two flamingos in a fruit fight
Every colour of day whirlin’ around at night
I’m playin’ this music so the young girls will come out
To meet the monster tonight
Tropical Hot Dog Night, like two flamingos in a fruit fight
I don’t wanna know ‘bout wrong or right
Yeah, I don’t want to know
I’m anywhere tonight

Tropical Hot Dog Night, like two flamingos in a fruit fight
Like steppin’ out of a triangle into striped light
Striped light, striped light
Tropical Hot Dog Night
Everything’s wrong, at the same time it’s right
The truth has no patterns for me tonight
I’m playing this music so the young girls will come out
To meet the monster tonight, meet the monster tonight

What do all you women do
When the men get Tropical Hot Dog payday?
What do you do on Tropical Hot Dog day-day?
Yeah, yeah
Step out of a triangle into striped light
Turn around and step back into striped light
Tropical Hot Dog Night
I’m playin’ this song for all the young girls
To come out to meet the monster tonight
Meet the monster tonight
How would you like to be the lucky girl
The lucky one to be the monster tonight?
Ow, to be the monster tonight
Oh, everything’s wrong, at the same time it’s white!
You get to be, you get to be with me!
And also to be the monster tonightEmbed
