Ode to Divorce LyricsThe food that I'm eating
Is suddenly tasteless
I know I'm alone now
I know what it tastes like
So break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
There might be some good ones
Like you might make a dollar
I'm inside your mouth now
Behind your tonsils
Peeking over your molars
You're talking to her now
You've eaten something minty
And you're making that face that I like
When you're going in, in for the kill, kill
For the killer kiss, kiss for the kiss, kiss
I need your money
It'll help me, I need your car, and I need your love
I need your money
It'll help me, I need your car, and I need your love
So won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out?
Just break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
You might make a dollar
Dollar, you might make a dollar
So won't you help a brother out
Won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out?
Just break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
There might be some good ones
You might make a dollar
There might be some good ones
There might be some good ones
You might make a dollar
You might make a dollar
There might be some good ones
There might be some good ones1Embed
