Carbon Monoxide LyricsCarbon monoxide
Soon I'll go to sleep
If I don't got my socks on right
They slide right off of my feet
As I walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
Carbon monoxide
As I take you home
First time I get my socks on right
But I don't have a gas mask on
As I walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
You home, yeah
I'm so cool, I'm so cool, I'm so cool
Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk
You home
I'm so cool, I'm so cool, I'm so cool
Come on daddy, come on daddy, come on daddy
Come on daddy, come on daddy, come on daddy
Carbon monoxide
Soon we'll go to sleep
No one will notice we're gone
Cause we don't have a job to keep
They'll just say that we're being lazy
Sex crazy, sex crazy
They'll just say we're living our whole life in bed
And we'll be in bed, but we'll be oh so very much
Dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a
Dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a
Dead-a, d-dead, yeah
But we're so cool, we're so cool, we're so cool
Dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a
Dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a, dead-a
Dead-a, d-dead, dead
But we're still cool, we're still cool, we're still cool
Come on daddy, come on daddy
Come on, come on, come on daddy
Come on daddy, come on daddy
Come on daddy, come on daddy
Come on daddy, come on daddy
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Carbon monoxide, carbon monoxide1Embed
