The Flowers Lyrics
The flowers you gave me are rotting
And still I refuse to throw them away
Some of the bulbs never opened quite fully
They might so I'm waiting and staying awake

Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep

The papers around me are piling and twisting
Regina the paperback mummy, what then
I'm taking the knife to the books that I own
And I'm chopping and chopping and boiling soup from stones

Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep
Things I have loved I'm allowed to keep
I'll never know if I go to sleep
