Scarecrow & Fungus LyricsCome on inside and I'll show you your brother
He's got enough money to buy a new father
He's got enough money to bother
Somebody else
Solder two wires together
Somebody else
Remember that mouthful you spat in his mouthful
He never forgave you, he's so very spiteful
He's so very vengeful and so very frightful
He's got enough money to bother
Solder two wires together
Scarecrow and fungus, they ran through a stoplight
But it didn't matter cause no one was hurt
Scarecrow and fungus, they ran through a stoplight
But it didn't matter cause they were on foot
Got enough money to bother
Somebody else
Solder two wires together
Somebody else
I don't know what I'm doing still here
They must have done such a very very good job...
Uh..
They say he's adopted but quite maladapted
They say he's corrupted but quite well-respected
He's got lots of money, we all really like him
He's got enough money to bother
Come on inside and I'll show you your brother
He's got enough money to buy a new father
He's got enough money to bother
Somebody else
Solder two wires together
Somebody else...Embed
