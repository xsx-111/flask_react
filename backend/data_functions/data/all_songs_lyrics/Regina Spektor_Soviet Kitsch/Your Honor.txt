Your Honor Lyrics
I kissed your lips and I tasted blood
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh
I asked you what happened and you said there'd been a fight
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh
You said, "I've been fighting for your honor, but you wouldn't understand"
De-nu-neh du-nuh-neh neh nuh
I said, "Hold on, your honor, I'll get ice for your hand"
Yes!
Oh, you been fighting for my honor and I don't understand
De-nu-neh du-nuh-neh neh oh
But hold on, your honor, I'll get ice for your hand
You said, "Come on, baby, let's just make love, it's the only thing to make me better"
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh
You said, "Oh, come on, let's just get you out of that sweater"
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh
I said, "I don't kiss losers and I don't kiss winners"
De-nu-mwah du-nuh-mwah mwah mwah
"And I don't fight for honor 'cause we all are born sinners"
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh

Gargle with peroxide, a steak for your eye
But I'm a vegetarian so it's a frozen pizza pie
You tell me that you care and you never do lie
And you fight for my honor but I just don't know why
Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh
You've got me and I'm just a common ho
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh
But I know what I am and I know what I ain't
De-nu-neh du-nuh-neh uh ung ugh
So don't get cut 'cause I still won't be no saint
Duh na-nuh-nuh duh na-nuh-nuh duh-na-nuh-na-nuh

Gargle with peroxide, a steak for your eye
But I'm a pizzatarian so it's a frozen pizza pie
You tell me that you love me and you never do lie
And you fight for my honor, but I just don't know why

You fight for my honor and I don't understand
But hold on, your honor, I'll get ice for your handEmbed
