Somedays Lyrics
Some days aren't yours at all
They come and go as if they're someone else's days
They go and leave you behind someone else's face
And it's harsher than yours
And colder than yours
They come in all quiet
Sweep up
And then they leave
And you don't hear a single floorboard creak
They're so much stronger than the friends you try to keep by your side

Downtown, downtown
I'm not here
Not anymore
I've gone away
Don't call me
Don't write

I'm in love with your daughter
I want to have her baby
I'm in love with your daughter
So can I please
Downtown, downtown
I'm not here
Not anymore
I've gone away
Don't call me
Don't write

Some days aren't yours at all
They come and go as if they're someone else's days
They go and leave you behind someone else's face
And it's harsher than yours2Embed
