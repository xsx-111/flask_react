Poor Little Rich Boy Lyrics
Poor little rich boy, all the couples have gone
You wish that they hadn't, you don't wanna be alone
But they wanna kiss and they got homes of their own
Poor little rich boy all the couples have gone, have gone, have gone

And you don't love your girlfriend
You don't love your girlfriend
And you think that you should, but she thinks that she's fat
But she isn't, but you don't love her anyway
And you don't love your mother
And you know that you should
And you wish that you would
But you don't anyway

Poor little rich boy, all the world is okay
The water runs off your skin and down into the drain
You're reading Fitzgerald, you're reading Hemingway
They're both super smart, and drinking in the cafes

But you don't love your girlfriend
You don't love your girlfriend
And you think that you should, but she thinks that she's fat
But she isn't, but you don't love her anyway
And you don't love your mother
And you know that you should
And you wish that you would
But you don't anyway
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young, you're so goddamn young
You're so goddamn young, you're so goddamn young

You don't love your girlfriend
And you don't love your girlfriend
And you don't love your girlfriend
And you don't love your girlfriendEmbed
