Sailor Song Lyrics
She will kiss you till your lips bleed
But she will not take her dress off
Americana, Tropicana

All the sailor boys have demons
They sing, "Oh, Kentucky why did you forsake me?
If I was meant to sail the sea
Why did you make me?
It should have been another state
Oh, state

"'Cause Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch

"Does it matter that our anchor
Couldn't even reach the bottom of a bathtub?
And the sails reflect the moon
It's such a strange job
Playing blackjack on the deck
Still, atop this giant puddle
Dressed in white we quietly huddle with our missiles
And we miss the girls back home
Oh, home sweet home
"'Cause Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch
Mary Anne's a bitch"

She will kiss you till your lips bleed
But she will not take her dress off
Americana, Tropicana
Americana, Tropicana
Americana, Americana...Embed
