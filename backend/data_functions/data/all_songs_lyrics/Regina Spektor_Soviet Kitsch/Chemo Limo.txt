Chemo Limo Lyrics
I had a dream
Crispy, crispy Benjamin Franklin came over and
Baby-sat all four of my kids
Then, in my dream
I told the doctor off
He said, "If you don't want to do it
Then you don't have to do it"
He said the truth is
You'll be okay, anyway

Then, in my dream
Crispy, crispy Benjamin Franklin and the doctor
Went and had a talk with my boss
Something about insurance policies
They kept the door closed at all times
I couldn't hear or see
When they came out they said
"You'll be okay, anyway"
And I smiled 'cause I'd known it all the while

No thank you, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you
I ain't about to pay for this shit
I can afford chemo, like I couldn't afford a limo
And on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
No thank you, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you
I ain't about to die like this
I can afford chemo, like I couldn't afford a limo
And besides this shit is making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me tired
You know I plan to retire some day
But mama gonna go out in style
Go out in style
This shit is making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me tired
Mama gonna go out in style
Go out in style

When I woke up
The kids were being quiet
I knew it was a dream right away
I called the limousine company
Then I got dressed
I dressed the kids as well
The limousine pulled in, and we piled in
The doctor he asked
Which way we were headed
I said "Sir, let's just go west", and he listened obediently
Sophie only wanted to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
With her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara
She looks just like my mom
Oh my God, Barbara
She looks so much like my mom

No thank you, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you
I ain't about to pay for this shit
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
And on any given day I'd rather ride a limousine
No thank you, no thank you, no thank you, no thank you
I ain't about to die like this
I can afford chemo like I couldn't afford a limo
And besides this shit is making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me tired
You know I plan to retire some day
But mama gonna go out in style
Go out in style
This shit is making me tired
It's making me tired
It's making me tired
Mama gonna go out in style, go out in style
Style, style, style, style
Style, style, style, style

I had a dream
Crispy, crispy Benjamin Franklin came over and
Baby-sat all four of my kids
I had a dream
Crispy, crispy Benjamin Franklin came over and
Baby-sat all four of my kids

Sophie only wants to listen to radio BBC
Michael sat on my knees and whispered to me
All about the meanies
Jacqueline was being such a big girl
With her cup of tea looking out of the window
And Barbara
She looks just like my mom
Oh my God, Barbara
She looks so much like my mom

Oh my Barbara
She looks so much just like my mom1Embed
