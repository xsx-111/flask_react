December Lyrics
December starts on Sunday
Next Sunday, won't you feel happier then?
Turn your room upside down
Turn your down upside

Rumors have started that you are in love again
Rumors that are completely unsubstantiated

Come on and say you're sorry
Real sorry for the trouble that you caused
Can't you see all this love?
Can't you see all this love?
Come on and say you're sorry
Real sorry for the trouble that you caused
Can't you see all this love?
Can't you see all this love?

We are not evacuating this house
We don't believe in you and your wrecking crew
We are not evacuating this house
We don't believe in you and your wrecking crew
We don't believe in you and your wrecking crew
We don't believe in you, we don't believe in you
We don't believe in you, we don't believe in you
We don't believe in you, we don't believe in you...Embed
