The Ghost of Corporate Future Lyrics
A man walks out of his apartment
It is raining, he's got no umbrella
He starts running beneath the awnings
Trying to save his suit, trying to save his suit
Trying to drying to trying to dry but no good

When he gets to the crowded subway platform
He takes off both of his shoes
He steps right into somebody's fat loogie
And everyone who sees him says ew
Everyone who sees him says ew

But he doesn't care
Because last night he got a visit
From the ghost of corporate future
The ghost said take off both your shoes
Whatever chances you get
Especially when they're wet

He also said
Imagine you go away on a business trip one day
And when you come back home
Your children have grown and you never made your wife moan
Your children have grown and you never made your wife moan
And people make you nervous
You'd think the world was ending
And everybody's features have somehow started blending
And everything is plastic
And everyone's sarcastic
And all your food is frozen
It needs to be defrosted
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending
You'd think the world was ending right now

Well maybe you should just drink a lot less coffee
And never ever watch the ten o'clock news
Maybe you should kiss someone nice
Or lick a rock, or both
Maybe you should cut your own hair
Because that can be so funny
It doesn't cost any money
And it always grows back
Hair grows even after you're dead

People are just people
They shouldn't make you nervous
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
If you don't toss your plastic
The streets won't be so plastic
And if you kiss somebody
Then both of you'll get practice
The world is everlasting
Put dirtballs in your pockets
Put dirtballs in your pockets
And take off both your shoes
Because people are just people
People are just people
People are just people like you

The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's going
The world is everlasting
It's coming and it's goingEmbed
