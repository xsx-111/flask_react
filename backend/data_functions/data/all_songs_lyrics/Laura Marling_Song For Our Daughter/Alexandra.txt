Alexandra Lyrics
What became of Alexandra
Did she make it through?
What kind of woman gets to love you?
Wrote us all a little note
Nothing left to lose
What kind of woman gets to love you?

I need to know
Where did Alexandra go?

Alexandra had no fear
She lived out in the woods
She'd tell you what you're doing wrong
If she thinks she'll be understood
Pulls her socks up to her knees
Finds diamonds in the drain
One more diamond to add to her chain

I need to know
Where does Alexandra go?
Where did Alexandra go?
It won't change how I'm feeling
You can try to help me understand
If she loved you like a woman
Did you feel like a man?
{Chorus}
I need to know
Where did Alexandra go?
Where did Alexandra go?

You had to say your shit to bed
You could not bear the unsaid
I had to try a fuck to give
Why should I die so you can live?

What did Alexandra know?
What did Alexandra know?
What did Alexandra know?1Embed
