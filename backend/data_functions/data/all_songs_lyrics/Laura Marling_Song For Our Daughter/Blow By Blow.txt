Blow By Blow Lyrics
I don't know what else to say, I think I did my best
Momma's on the phone already talking to the press
Tell them that I'm doing fine, underplay distress
I'm working out a story and there's so much to address

Note by note
Blow by blow
Seeing it all laid out
I should have known

I don't know what else to say, I think I'm doing fine
Tryna figure out what I will do with all my time
Tell them anything you like, I'll own up to what's mine
Knowing thunder gives away what lightning tries to hide

No one was prepared
But we all performed
Like we'd done it all before

Note by note
Bruise by bruise
Sometimes the hardest thing to learn
Is what you get from what you lose
I feel a fool, so do you
For believing it could work out
Like some things doEmbed
