Held Down Lyrics
I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
(Gone, gone, gone)
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long"
(Long, long, long)

And I just meant to tell you that I don't want to let you down
(Down, down, down)
And I just meant to tell you that I don't want to get you wrong
(Wrong, wrong, wrong)

Think about now with my legs wrapped around you
How many times before have you seen me run?
(Run, run, run)
It's a cruel kind of twist that you'd leave like this
Just drop my wrist and say, "Well, that's us done"
(Done done done)

I was just gonna tell you that I don't want to let you down
(Down down down)
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

You sent me a book which I gave half a look
But I just don't care for it and I cannot get through
(Through, through, through)
But you're writing again and I'm glad, old friend
I'll make sure you write me out of where you get to
(To, to, to)

I was just gonna tell you that I don't want to let you down
(Down down down)
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you mean

'Cause we all want to be here now
And we all want to be held down
And we all want to be here now
And we all want to be held down
I woke up, it was four in the morning
Clear as all hell that you'd already gone
Your note said, "Dear, you know I hate to disappear
But the days are short and the nights are getting long"

And I just mean to tell you that I don't want to be let down
Get lost in the crowd
Seen or unseen
Say what you meanEmbed
