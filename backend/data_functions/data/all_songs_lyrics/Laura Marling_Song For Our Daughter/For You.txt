For You Lyrics
I drew pictures of you
Long before I met you
Just a fragment of my mind
I had called out for you
Almost every night
Precious things are hard to find

It was just an evening
Much like any else
When you came into my life
It takes one to know one
And I saw you there
As I had seen you all my life

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted (For you)
I write it so I don't forget
Never let it get away
I wear a picture of you
Just to keep you safe
Mmm...
Mmm...

Now that I have you
I will not forget
What a miracle you are
No childish expectation
Love is not the answer
But the line that marks the start

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted (For you)
I write it so I don't forget
Never let it get away
I keep a picture of you
Just to keep you safe

Mmm...
Mmm...

I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted (For you)
I write it so I won't forget
Never let it get away
I keep a picture of you
Just to keep you safe
I thank a God I've never met
Never loved, never wanted
I sing it so I won't forget
Never let it get away
I keep a picture of you
Just to keep you safe

Mmm...
Mmm...2Embed
