Only the Strong Lyrics
Only the strong survive
Only the strong survive
Only the wrong relive their lives
We've been here a thousand times
Wish I could go back and find
Letters I wrote you in my mind
Perhaps I could unknot us from this awful bind
Most I have forgot or overrefined

Love is a sickness cured by time
Love is a sickness cured by time
Bruises all end up benign
Love is a sickness cured by time
I hope that you can change my mind
Had to leave this crying all behind
I hope that you don't think that I'm unkind
So somebody told me, only and only
Only the strong will survive

Only the strong survive
And I won't write a woman with a man on my mind
Hope that didn't sound too unkind
Just struggling to figure out how
Only, only, only, only
Only the strong can survive
Hope that you can change my mind
I had to leave this crying all behind
I hope that you don't think that I'm unkind
It's just somebody told me, only and only
Only the strong can survive2Embed
