Strange Girl Lyrics
Get all your records out and throw them all away
No one left to listen to, much left, less to say
Working hard and getting on, still not getting paid
Stay low, keep brave

Woke up in a country who refused to hold your hand
Kept falling for narcissists who insist you call them 'man'
You work late for a job you hate that's never fit the plan
Stay low, keep brave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave
I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

Build yourself a garden and have something to attend
Cut off all relations 'cause you could not stand your friends
Announced yourself a socialist to have something to defend
Oh yawn, girl, please don't bullshit me
I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave
I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave

Changed how you feel
It's good to break the seal
And blow us both away
Get to changing all the time
And it starts to blur the line
That's supposed to keep you safe
And you roll like a tidal wave
And you roll like a tidal wave

I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My brave
I love you, my strange girl
My lonely girl
My angry girl
My braveEmbed
