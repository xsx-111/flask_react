Blossom Lyrics
Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way
Lately I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen
Melt my cares away

Send the sunshine down my way
Whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me
Girl, it's all the same

Blossom, there's an empty road behind
Sit you down beside me
Blossom, there's a sweet dream on my mind
There's a song inside me
Take these chains away

Now send the sunshine down my way
Whenever you call my name
I know what you mean to say to me
Girl, it's all the same
Blossom, smile some sunshine down my way
Lately I've been lonesome
Blossom, it's been much too long a day
Seems my dreams have frozen
Melt my cares away
