Oh! Susanna Lyrics
Well I come from Alabama
With my banjo on my knee
And I'm bound for Louisiana
My own true love for to see

It did rain all night the day I left
The weather was bone dry
The sun was so hot I froze myself
Suzanne, don't you go on and cry

I said, oh! Susanna
Now you don't you cry for me
As I come from Alabama
With this banjo on my knee

Well I had myself a dream the other night
When everything was still
I dreamed that I saw my girl Suzanne
She was coming around the hill

Now the buckwheat cake was in her mouth
The tear was in her eye
I said that I come from Dixie Land
Suzanne, don't you break down and cry
