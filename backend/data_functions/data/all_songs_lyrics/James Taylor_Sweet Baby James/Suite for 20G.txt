Suite for 20G Lyrics
Slipping away, what can I say?
Won't you stay inside me, month of May?
And hold on to me, golden days, slipping away

Sunshine on my wall
To keep my mind on the things I'm saying
Footsteps in the hall
To tell me I've been this way before
Nevermore

Let it rain, sweet Mary Jane
Let it wash your love down all around me
Come inside and put it down, let it rain

I've been trying hard to find
A way to let you know
That we can make it shine most all the time
This time 'round, I'm searching down
To where I used to go
And it's been on my mind to make it shine

You can say I wanna be free
I can say someday I will be
You can say I wanna be free
I can say someday I will be

When I catch a common cold
Wanna hear a saxophone
When I let the good times roll, baby
Slide me a bass trombone
Walk me down old Funky Street
Lord knows, I feel good enough to eat, now
Hold my soul, now, I'm sure 'nough fond
Of my rock 'n roll

When I go to sleep at night
Wanna hear a slide guitar
When I'm feeling loose and right, go
Riding in my automobile
Boney Maroney and Peggy Sue
Got the rocking pneumonia
Got the boogie-woogie flu, baby
Hold my soul, said I'm sure 'nough fond
Of my rock 'n roll

Good God
Looky here, looky here!
Woo! Ooh-ooh-ooh
Go home now, Joe
Ooh, yeah
Oh, you're cookin'!Embed
