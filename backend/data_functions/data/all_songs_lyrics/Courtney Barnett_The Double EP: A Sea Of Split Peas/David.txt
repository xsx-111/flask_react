David Lyrics
If you see me when I’m feeling down
I don’t know if I want you around

Don’t want you around
Don't want you around
Don't want you around
Don't want you around

I don’t really like any of your friends
But it’s not that hard for me to pretend

Hard to pretend
Hard to pretend
Hard to pretend
Hard to pretend

Come on, Davey, let’s go plant a tree
You bring the spade; I’ll bring the seeds

I’ll bring the seeds
I'll bring the seeds
I'll bring the seeds
I'll bring the seeds2Embed
