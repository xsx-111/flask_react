Canned Tomatoes (Whole) LyricsI walk slowly to the store
You don’t live here anymore
You used to live round the corner
(Cigarettes and alcohol)
Last week, I turned twenty-four
You don’t call me anymore
We used to speak every morning
(I was sleeping on the floor)
I still get the mail for you
I leave it at the door
Every letter seems a warning
Pay your rego by the fourth
Monday morning laundry
Or coffee on the garden wall
You’re good 'cause you’re never boring
You should probably call me more1Embed
