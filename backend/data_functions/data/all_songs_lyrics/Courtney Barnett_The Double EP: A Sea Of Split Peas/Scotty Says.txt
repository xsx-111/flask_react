Scotty Says Lyrics
In my wallet is a photo of you
The day we split, I ripped it in two
Stuck it back together with glue
Tear my posters down from the wall
Don’t wanna worship no dead heroes
Everything I owned, I sold

I got lost somewhere between here and there
I’m not sure what the town was called

In my pocket is a bottle of blue
Drink it when I’m feeling misconstrued
Don’t like the taste but I like the overview
I made a lot of money in my days
Spent it all on the current craze
I don’t see no need to save

I got lost somewhere between here and there
I’m not sure what the town was called
I got lost somewhere between here and there
I'm not sure what the town was called1Embed
