Ode to Odetta Lyrics
I sing high, you sing low
I swing by, and you’re not home

Oh, oh, Odetta, won’t you come home?
Oh, oh, Odetta, won't you come home?

I sing plain, you sing pretty
Everything you say sounds easy

Oh, oh, Odetta, won’t you come home?
Oh, oh, Odetta, won't you come home?
Oh, oh, Odetta, won't you come home?
Oh, oh, Odetta, won't you come home?
Oh, oh, Odetta, won't you come home?
Oh, oh, Odetta, won't you come home?1Embed
