History Eraser Lyrics
I got drunk and fell asleep atop the sheets
But luckily, I left the heater on
And in my dreams, I wrote the best song that I've ever written
Can't remember how it goes
I stayed drunk and fell awake; I was cycling on a plane
And far away I heard you say you liked me
We drifted to a party, cool; the people went to arty school
They made their paints by mixing acid wash and lemonade

In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name

I found an Ezra Pound and made a bet
That if I found a cigarette, I'd drop it all and marry you
Just then a song comes on: "You can't always get what you want"
The Rolling Stones, oh, woe is we, the irony
The stones became the moss and once all inhibition's lost
The hipsters made a mission to the farm
We drove by tractor there; the yellow straw replaced our hair
We laced the dairy river with the cream of sweet vermouth

In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name
You said, "We only live once," so we touched a little tongue
And instantly, I wanted to
I lost my train of thought and jumped aboard the Epping
As the doors were slowly closing on the world
I touched on and off and rubbed my arm up against yours
And still, the inspector inspected me
The lady in the roof was living proof
That nothing really ever is exactly as it seems

In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name

We caught the riverboat downstream
And ended up beside a team of angry footballers
I fed the ducks some krill then we were sucked against our will
Into the welcome doors of the casino
We drank green margaritas, danced with sweet se√±oritas
And we all went home as winners of a kind
You said, "I guarantee we'll have more fun
Drink 'til the moon becomes the sun
And in the taxi home, I'll sing you a Triffids song"

In my brain, I rearrange
The letters on the page to spell your name7Embed
