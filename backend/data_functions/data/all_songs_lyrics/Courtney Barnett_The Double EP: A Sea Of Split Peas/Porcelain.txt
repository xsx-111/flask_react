Porcelain LyricsI found you at the store
Pretty as porcelain
You are worth so much more
Than what you’re going for
Don’t let them handle you
You better start praying
That ain’t no way to be
I got a colour TV
I’ll listen a thousand times
You can repeat yourself
If it helps clear your mind
It’s just another night
Call me when you are done
I’ll count my tickets up
No need to feel so low
You’re just as low as you could go2Embed
