Are You Looking After Yourself? LyricsAre you working
Hard, my darling?
We're so worried
Always thinking
Of you and we
Just want you to
Be so happy
Keep on going
I don’t want no 9 to 5
Telling me that I’m alive
And, ‘Man, you’re doing well!’
I don’t want no 9 to 5
Telling me that I’m alive
And, ‘Man, you’re doing well!’
Have you got some
Money saved up
For those rainy days?
You should start some
Sort of trust fund
Just in case you fail
My friends play in bands
They are better than
Everything on radio
My friends play in bands
They are better than
Everything on radio
Did you see that
Special on TV
The other eve?
No, my TV
It stopped working
When we got here
(It’s been four years)
Are you eating?
You sound so thin
Are you eating?
You sound so thin
I don’t know what I was thinking
I should get a job
I don’t know what I was drinking
I should get a dog
Should get married
Have some babies
Watch the evening news
Should get married
Have some babies
Watch the evening news2Embed
