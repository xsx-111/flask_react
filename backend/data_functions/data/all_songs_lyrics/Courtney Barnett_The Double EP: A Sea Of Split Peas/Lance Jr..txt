Lance Jr. Lyrics
I masturbated to the songs you wrote
Resuscitated all of my hopes
It felt wrong but it didn't take too long
Much appreciated are your songs

Doesn't mean I like you, man
It just helps me get to sleep
And it's cheaper than temazepam

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

I underestimated your intelligence
A little bit of weed mixed with some sentiment
Overrated films marked 'XXX'
Come on, play it with some tenderness1Embed
