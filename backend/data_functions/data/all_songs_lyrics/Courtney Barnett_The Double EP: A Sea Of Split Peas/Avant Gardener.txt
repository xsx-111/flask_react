Avant Gardener Lyrics
I sleep in late, another day
Oh, what a wonder, oh, what a waste
It's a Monday, it's so mundane
What exciting things will happen today?
The yard is full of hard rubbish, it's a mess and
I guess the neighbours must think we run a meth lab
We should amend that, I pull the sheets back
It's forty degrees and I feel like I'm dying
Life's getting hard in here so I do some gardening
Anything to take my mind away from where it's supposed to be
The nice lady next door talks of green beds
And all the nice things that she wants to plant in them
I wanna grow tomatoes on the front steps
Sunflowers, bean sprouts, sweet corn and radishes
I feel proactive, I pull out weeds
All of a sudden, I'm having trouble breathing in

I'm having trouble breathing in
I'm having trouble breathing in
I'm having trouble breathing in

My hands are shaky, my knees are weak
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet
I'm breathing but I'm wheezing, feel like I'm emphysem-ing
My throat feels like a funnel filled with Weet-Bix and kerosene and
Oh no, next thing I know, they call up triple-0
I'd rather die than owe the hospital 'til I get old
I get adrenaline straight to the heart
I feel like Uma Thurman post-overdose and kick start
Reminds me of the time when I was really sick and I
Had too much pseudoephedrine and I couldn't sleep at night
Halfway down High Street, Andy looks ambivalent
He's probably wondering what I'm doing getting in an ambulance
The paramedic thinks I'm clever 'cause I play guitar
I think she's clever 'cause she stops people dying
Anaphylactic and super hypochondriactic
Should've stayed in bed today, I much prefer the mundane
I take a hit from an asthma puffer
I do it wrong, I was never good at smoking bongs
I'm not that good at breathing in
I'm not that good at breathing in
I'm not that good at breathing in17Embed
