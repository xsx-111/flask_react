Anonymous Club Lyrics
Let’s start an anonymous club
We can sit close in the dark
Come 'round to mine
We can swap clothes and drink wine all night
Turn your phone off, friend
You’re amongst friends and we don’t need no interruptions
Leave your shoes at the door, along with your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles

Let’s start an anonymous club
I’ll make us name badges with question marks
Come 'round to mine
We can swap clothes and drink wine all night
Turn your phone off, friend
You’re amongst friends and we don’t need no interruptions
Leave your shoes at the door, along with your troubles
Your troubles, your troubles, your troubles

Thank you for cooking for me
I had a really nice evening, just you and me
Thank you for cooking for me
I had a really nice evening, just you and me
Just you and me
Just you and me
Just you and me
Just you and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me
You and me2Embed
