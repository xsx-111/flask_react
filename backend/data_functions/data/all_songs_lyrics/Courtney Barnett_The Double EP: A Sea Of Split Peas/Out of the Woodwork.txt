Out of the Woodwork Lyrics
I was busy underwater
Seeing how long I could hold my breath
A drowning flower caught my eye and I
Had to come on up for air
Just because you’re older than me
Doesn’t mean you have to be so condescending
I still see the same things that you see
I’m a little shady on my history

I am normally pretty forgiving
But only if you are

She’s so easy
She's so easy

I noticed you stopped talking to me
Now you’re talking to me all the time
Do you know you’re no good at listening?
But you’re really good at saying everything on your mind
It must be tiring, trying so hard
To look like you’re not really trying at all
I guess if you’re afraid of aiming too high
Then you’re not really gonna have too far to fall
I am normally pretty forgiving
But only if you are

She’s so easy
She's so easy

(She's so easy)
Climb aboard the wagon when it comes on through
(She's so easy)
Jump up on your horse and tell me, how’s the view?
(She's so easy)
Look over my shoulder when I talk to you
(She's so easy)
Where’s the more important person in the room?4Embed
