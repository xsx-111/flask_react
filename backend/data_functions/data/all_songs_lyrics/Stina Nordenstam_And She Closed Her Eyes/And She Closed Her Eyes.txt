And She Closed Her Eyes LyricsAnd she closed her eyes and said:
"No, I'm not in love
No, I'm not in much, for real"
And the hood fell off her head
And her face got wet
I held my part of the deal
I've been growing older he thought
And he smiled and said:
"You've got the saddest face I've seen"
And when she didn't seem to listen at all
He said: "I'm getting wet
You held your part of the deal"Embed
