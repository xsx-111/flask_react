So This Is Goodbye LyricsSo this is goodbye
So this is how you say it
These are the words
It's the voice you're using
It's the picture you've seen
So this is goodbye
So this is how you say it
This is the time it takes you
It didn't take you a lot now did it?
It didn't hurt you a lot now did it?
So this is good bye
So this is how you spell it
Where you place it in your mouth
What happens if I didn't hear you?
What happens if it wasn't serious?
Well, I was around
Maybe it was you I came to see
Maybe it was you who invited me
I remember your eyes were on me
I remember your eyes were on me
I remember your eyes were on me
I remember your eyes were on me
