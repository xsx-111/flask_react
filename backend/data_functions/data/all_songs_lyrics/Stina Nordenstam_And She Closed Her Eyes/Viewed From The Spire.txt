Viewed From The Spire LyricsViewed from the spire
It looks more like a coincidence to me
Another bomb in the harbour
But you were there
The place was all crowded but
No one crosses the street that way
It was such a lunatic thing to do
Broken glass was all over
I heard the sirens
Her name on the radio
Should have known there was no escape
They haven't found him
They say it wasn't professional this time
Just a bomb in the harbour
A love affair
Her room mate won't listen but I
No one crosses the street that way
She says: No, no. How would I know?
Cause you didn't know her
I heard the sirens
And just suddenly I thought
No one's gonna say it did not take placeEmbed
