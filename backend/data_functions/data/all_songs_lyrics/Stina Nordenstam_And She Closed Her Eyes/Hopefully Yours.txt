Hopefully Yours LyricsWind full of smells and far-away places
The last thing I said: "Are you sure you can do this?"
Hands fold together, he says no
"Don't turn your head, no don't, just go"
I'm here in your yard and it's getting colder
"You're making it hard": He smiled when he told me
Life on the wing like a lot of things would be better if we didn't try
Well I tried
Like I was walking out in your garden
Or am I just being foolish
Or am I just being hopefully yours?
Or just being foolish?
You know you've been seen not quite on the main street
And I was the queen, tlil then I had nothing
And I can't go on like this is not a way of telling you
"Be mine, be mine"
Like I was walking on your blue carpet
Or am I just being foolish
Or am I just being hopefully yours
Or am I just being foolish
Or am I just being hopefully yours
Just being foolish
Or just being hopefully yours
Or just being foolishEmbed
