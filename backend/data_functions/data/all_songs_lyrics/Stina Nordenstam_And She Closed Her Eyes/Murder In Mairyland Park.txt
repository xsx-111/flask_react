Murder In Mairyland Park LyricsThings that happen just once
If she'd looked she would have seen it
He was standing all night 'cross the street, very still
And they go out so easily, the streetlamps
The cars come and go
But I see you too clearly
I don't trust myself anymore
If it's all true just say it, I may already know
That sound when it's over
The sidewalks will carry you home
And they go out so easily
Agnus, Agnus
Agnus, Agnus
Agnus, Agnus
Qui tollis peccata mundi
Agnus, AgnusEmbed
