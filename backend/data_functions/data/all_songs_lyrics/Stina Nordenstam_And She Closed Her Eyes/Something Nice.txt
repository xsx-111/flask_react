Something Nice LyricsAlmost give it a try, I sure do
I wake up early thinking of you
And I paint my eyes in light blue
Reflecting every promise I do
There's a brand new note in the middle of this song
I close my eyes and hope that nothing will go wrong
That I'll have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
Have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
Almost wondering why you want me
Sometimes I think you're better off on your own
When I make you cry over me
I almost want to leave you alone
But when I wake up in the middle of the night
And when I sometimes suddenly remember your smile
And to have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
To have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
To have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
To have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home, walking home
Walking home, walking home
Walking home, walking home
To have something nice to talk about
While I'm walking home
To have something nice to talk aboutEmbed
