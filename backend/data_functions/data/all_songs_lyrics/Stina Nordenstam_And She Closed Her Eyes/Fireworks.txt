Fireworks LyricsThese fires never die
They told me this would help
I'm walking by the water
I'm falling with the tide
They said that this would end
I went as far as I could
I'm on distant ground now
Fishing boats go by
I fall asleep too early
I scream and no one hears me
The waves will wipe it out
And we'll be even
I turn my face to
From wherever the wind blows
Is it worth so much to try?
I turn my face to
From wherever the wind blows
Is it worth so much to try?
I'm at the airport waiting
For lights to fade below
And then: something else
All instant things are fading
The pain will go
I won't remember
And if the lights went out
If the elevator stopped
If we were lost where I was
Or in the deepest tunnel
The train just stopped
But you gave me no chance
I turn my face to
From wherever the wind blows
Is it worth so much to try?
I turn my face to
From wherever the wind blows
Is it worth so much to try?Embed
