Little Star LyricsLittle star
So you had to go
You must have wanted him to know
You must have wanted the world to know
Poor little thing
And now they know
Little star
I had to close my eyes
There was a fire at the warehouse
They're always waiting for a thing like this
Came traveling from all over town
For you, little star
Little star
So you had to go
You must have wanted him to know
You must have wanted the world to know
Poor little thing
And now they know
Laudamus, adoramus te, domine
Laudamus, benedicimus domine Deus
Laudamus, benedicimus domine Deus
Cum Sancto Spiritu in gloria Dei Patris
We praise, we worship you, Lord
We praise, we pray to you Lord God
We praise, we pray to you Lord God
With the Holy Spirit in the glory of God the Father
For you, little starEmbed
