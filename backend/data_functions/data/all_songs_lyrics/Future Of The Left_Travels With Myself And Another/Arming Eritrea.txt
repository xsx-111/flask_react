Arming Eritrea LyricsCome on, Rick, I'm not a prize
I'm not a cynic or one of those guys
Come on, Rick, I'm not a rope
Now pull your socks up
Come on, Rick, I'm not a child
I'm not special or one of a kind
Come on Rick, I'm not a drunk
I know my own worth
And then I don't!
And then I don't!
A common purpose
A common goal
Come on, Rick, I'm not a prize
I'm not a cynic or one of those guys
Come on, Rick, I'm not a rope
Now pull your socks up
Come on, Rick, I'm not a child
I'm not special or one of a kind
Come on Rick, I'm not a drunk
I know my own worth
And then I don't!
And then I don't!
A common purpose
Gains value as a common goal
Let's flail together
If we must flail at all
Deep in the heart of the battle
Caught in the switch of the flow
Freedom from notes, she sells freedom from songs
She sells freedom and arms Eritrea
I could have made these excuses in my sleep
As if anyone had doubted them at all
But if we arm Eritrea then we won't have to pay her
And everyone can go home
I've got to seek paranoia where I find
As if anyone had doubted it at all
But if we arm Eritrea then we won't have to pay her
And everyone can go home
