I Am Civil Service LyricsIf I must play a part in this mess
There are things that I have to know
If I eat what I fuck and I fuck what I eat
Am I worthy?
There are rules to obey
I am seen and ignored
I have been pinned it down
Is a lack of emotion
A curse or a skill
To rely on
I’ve got a letter from a friend
It was just in time
But it didn’t tell me anything
If I can’t be alone then I must be apart
I must see it through
If I love what I kill and I kill what I love
Am I worthy?
What a week, what a time, what a kill, what a crock
What a way to go
So I eat what I fuck and I fuck what I eat
Am I worthy?
I’ve got a letter from a friend
It was just in time
But it didn’t tell me anything
How does it feel
To make it on your own?
To prey upon your strengths
But leave it where it falls
How does it feel to listen to this song
To wrap your mind around it
To let your senses down
Yeah!
I am civil service!
I am civil service!Embed
