You Need Satan More Than He Needs You LyricsGoddamn it's gonna rain
I only brought my socks
The night might hide my shame
But shame won't dry my balls
The spell that brought me here
Dissipated when the weather turned
Yeah, sure, Satan rules but
That doesn't mean I can't be practical
What kind of orgy leaves
A sense of deeper love?
What kind of orgy leaves
A sense of deeper love?
You need Satan more than he needs you
You need Satan more than he needs you
Goddamn it, what's the time?
The babysitter needs a lift by nine
What's with that fucking kid?
Now who will wash my crucifix?
My girlfriend brought me here
I've got to get her on the telephone
Clean up, fetch the goat
If he's sober he can travel in the boot
What kind of orgy leaves
A sense of deeper love?
What kind of orgy leaves
A sense of deeper love?
You need Satan more than he needs you
You need Satan more than he needs you
It doesn't look like a man
It doesn't talk like a man
But does it fuck like a man?
Does it, does it fuck like a man?
It doesn't smell like a man
It doesn't taste like a man
But does it fuck like a man?
Does it, does it fuck like a man?
It doesn't look like a man
It doesn't talk like a man
But does it fuck like a man?
But does it fuck like a man?
It doesn't smell like a man
It doesn't taste like a man
But does it fuck like a man?
But does it fuck like a man?Embed
