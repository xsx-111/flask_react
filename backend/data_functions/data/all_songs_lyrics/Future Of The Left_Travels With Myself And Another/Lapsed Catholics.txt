Lapsed Catholics Lyrics(spoken word)
Whose prison break is the most impressive?
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go Tim Robbins in Jacob's Ladder
Such patience, such verve and poise
But wait a minute, shit, that's the wrong film
Morgan Freeman would roll in his grave, if he were dead
Which he nearly was, if you believe the hysterical gung-ho Technicolor crapfest
That is Sky News, or Murdoch Live, or whatever the hell the devil calls himself
Sky News, or Murdoch Live, or whatever the hell the devil calls himself
I preferred him when he was red and blatant, that guy
I liked him better when he swooped around the land indiscriminately
Bending wills and souls with glee
Hurrying kids to their graves at sea
Magnetically debasing the casts of the earth
In a terrible, wonderful focus of horrors
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet
A justice of sorts if you listen to fools who have dressed in the dark for a bet
(sung)
I'm on a mercy mission to prove to my new love
That she is my nothing, that she is my no-one
That even these triumphs are nothing without her
That even these triumphs are empty
But anyway, revel in it
Be grateful when the comfort comes
I can't stand still for the rest of my life
But there's always lapsed Catholics
I need a change of focus, a badge of honour
A mark of progress, a rope to hang from
To make a difference I need composure
To make a difference, to make it
But anyway, revel in it
Be grateful when the comfort comes
I can't stand still for the rest of my life
But there's always lapsed Catholics
The trick is, don't start
Be aware, be alert
The truth is, no words are
Worthy to hang on her
Lapsed Catholics are the worst
Lapsed Catholics are the worst
Lapsed Catholics are the worst
Lapsed Catholics are the worst
Give me something I can take away
Give me something I can take away
Give me something I can take away
Give me something I can take away
The problem with these people is
They understand the obvious
The problem with these people is
They understand their vices, not their faults
Lapsed Catholics are the worst
It's part of who they were
And who they'll be again
And who they'll be againEmbed
