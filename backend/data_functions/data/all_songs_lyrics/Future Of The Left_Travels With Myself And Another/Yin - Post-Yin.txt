Yin / Post-Yin LyricsCall me Anna, velociraptor
Excuse my manner, I'm having such a bad day
I woke this morning with expectations
Of gaining nothing; I've learned to trust my instincts
The white man claims that he's in love
Does anybody doubt him?
The white man claims that he's in love
Does anybody doubt his words?
But those tans are a curse, 'cause they promise so much health
And how far can you rise on borrowed Sellotape?
But it's on pause, it's on pause, for the pterodactyl's claws
It's on pause, it's on pause, for the pterodactyl
Oh yes it is
Call me Brutus, brontosaurus
It's just for Christmas, I'm going back to college
Though I am just a, a massive lizard
I am not stupid. I understand how it works
The white man claims that he can fly
Does anybody doubt him?
The white man claims that he can fly
Does anybody doubt his words?
And those songs, they are real, but they do not play for you
So dance to them once, then throw them to the wind
But it's on pause, it's on pause, for the pterodactyl's claws
It's on pause, it's on pause, for the pterodactyl
Good people know (Good people know!)
You take the money (money!), treasures (treasures!), glamourous bones (friends!)
Then throw them together, and see what we have left
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaah!
Good people know (Good people know!)
You take the money (money!), treasures (treasures!), glamourous bones (friends!)
Then throw them together, and see what we have left
Yeeeeeeeaaaaaah!
Good people know (Good people know!)
You take the money (money!), treasures (treasures!), glamourous bones (friends!)
Then throw them together, and see what we have leftEmbed
