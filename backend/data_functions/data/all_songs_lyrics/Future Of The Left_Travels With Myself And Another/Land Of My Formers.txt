Land Of My Formers LyricsNot much of an incident:
A couple of fists in the gut for my troubles
Nothing to write home about:
A couple of drinks and a break for the border
When in Rome, remember home is always here for you
Not much of a tragedy:
They only get under your skin if you let them
No need to say anything:
A couple of years in the dark and you'll thank her
When in Rome, remember home is always here for you
Step by step by mis-step
Step by step by mis-step
Land of my formers, land of my fellow combatants
Land of my formers, land of my fellow combatantsEmbed
