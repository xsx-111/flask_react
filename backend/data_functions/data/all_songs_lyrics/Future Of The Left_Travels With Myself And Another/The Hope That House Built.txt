The Hope That House Built LyricsIn the end everybody wins
As long as we remember there's a reason for incredible wealth (incredible wealth)
Incredible luck (incredible luck)
Don't despair, life is just a dream
And nobody can judge us if we choose to face it gradually (it gradually)
Makes everything right (means nothing can beat us)
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
Turn around, face our deepest fears
Re-imagine God as just a mental illness
Looming towards (appearing towards)
The end of our days (the end of our days)
Think again how could we go wrong with supernatural creatures who control our fate
Could anyone tell? (could anyone tell?)
Would anyone care ? (would anyone care at all?)
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
Come join, come join our hopeless cause
Come join, come join our lost cause
The feeling snaps the fools behind
And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to die
(in the end everybody wins, in the end everybody wins)
The feeling snaps the fools behind
And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to die
(in the end everybody wins, in the end everybody wins)
The feeling snaps the fools behind
And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to die
(in the end everybody wins, in the end everybody wins)
The feeling snaps the fools behind
And back in the ground we look at our hands
And wonder aloud could anyone choose to dieEmbed
