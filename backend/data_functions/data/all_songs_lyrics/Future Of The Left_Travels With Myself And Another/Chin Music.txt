Chin Music LyricsI know it only happened 'cause I couldn't stop drinking
It only happened 'cause I couldn't drink more
He took a picture of the ugly scene
And made stupid threats, yeah, you know what I mean
I only hit him 'cause he made me crazy
I only hit him 'cause he made me mad
She only hit him 'cause it gets her wet
Yeah, she's one of a kind, she's got chin music
The boy wears it well
You never can...
I knew I couldn't stop it so I didn't die trying
I didn't stop it so I didn't think twice
He wasn't heading for a glittering life
He's just a one-town man with a one-man wife
I only hit him 'cause he made me crazy
I only hit him 'cause he made me mad
She only hit him 'cause it gets her wet
Yeah, she's one of a kind, she's got chin music
The boy wears it well
You never can...
Our final test:
What passes now, it stays between us
The scrubbers and the buggers have it right
Stand up and raise your heads for the chin music
The boy wears it well
You never can...Embed
