The Grand Conjuration Lyrics
Majesty, faithful me
Pour yourself into me
Wield your power, martyr's price
Stare me down to the ground

The eyes of the devil fixed on his sinners

Slake my thirst, eternal wealth
Heathen key 'round my neck
This poetry our blasphemy
Know the sounds of infamy

The hands of Satan assembling his flock
Pale horse rider scorching the earth


Whispered conjuration, a belief takes form
Choking hand tapping the veins in your throat
His orders in your mouth, a decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom spins the undertow of hate
Injected seeds of vengeance, usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom beckoning in the mist

The grand conjuration

Tell me why love subsides in the light of your wishes
Say my name, ease the pain, clear the smoke in my head
