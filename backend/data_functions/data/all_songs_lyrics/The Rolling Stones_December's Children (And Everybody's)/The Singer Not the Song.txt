The Singer Not the Song Lyrics
Everywhere you want, I always go
I always give in because, baby, you know
You just say so because you give me

That feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song

It's not the way you give in willingly
Others do it without thrilling me
Giving me that same old

Feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song


The same old places and the same old songs
We've been going there for much too long
There's something wrong and it gives me that
Feeling inside
That I know I must be right
It's the singer not the song

It's the singer not the song
It's the singer not the songEmbed
