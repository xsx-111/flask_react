She Said Yeah Lyrics
Dom deedle dee dom dom
Little girl, where did you come from?
Try a little bit to make my mouth dribble
Come on baby, let's ride away in the rain

Baby you drive me crazy
Drive my poor heart hazy
You got my senses reelin'
Oh baby, what a feelin'
Come on baby, let's ride away in the rain

She said yeah (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
She said yeah (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
She said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on baby, I want to make love to you

Well you drive me cravin' (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
My love you've been savin (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
Well miss, I want to kiss
Come on, baby, don't you treat me like this

She said yeah (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
She said yeah (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
She said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on baby, I want to make love to you too
Yeah

Well I got the feeling (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
In my soul (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
I'm gonna love you, no one above you
Come on, baby, let me love you
Yeah

She said yeah (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
She said yeah (Dom deedle dee dom dom)
She said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on daddy, I want to make love to you tooEmbed
