Teardrops Will Fall Lyrics
Teardrops will fall tonight
Teardrops will fall

I read your letter, oh now, tears fell from my eye
All of your promises didn't, nothin' but lies
I turn your photograph, oh. face to the wall
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight, well
Teardrops will fall

Teardrops will fall tonight 'til I can't hide
Tears that I tried to keep down, deep down inside
Tears fall and love is gone beyond recall
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight
You know what, teardrops will fall

I'm going to pray tonight, Lord, hoping you will hear
Maybe you're right, after all now and dry each tear
I sit alone tonight darling hoping you will call
And when I dim the lights in my room tonight
Well, teardrops will fall, oh

Teardrops will fall tonight
'Til I can't hide
Tears that I tried to keep down
Deep down inside
Tears fall and love is gone beyond recall1Embed
