Take A Little Love Lyrics
Take a little bit of
This love of mine, oh yeah
You can bet your life, you'll feel so fine
Oh yeah
Love is the burning desire
Will set your soul on fire
If you take a little bit of love
This love of mine

Take a little bit of this hugging and kissing, oh yeah
You soon will discover, what you've been missing
Love you can call your own
You will never be alone
If you take a little bit of
This love of mine, oh yeah
Oh yeah
My my my my my my my my
Yeah

Come a little closer, while the moon is shining bright
Let me whisper sweet things in your ear
Darling let me hold you tight, oh yeah
I want to prove my love is true
I'll always stand by you
If you take a little bit of
This love of mine
Love of mine
You know it's so high
I said you can't go wrong
One more thing, darlingEmbed
