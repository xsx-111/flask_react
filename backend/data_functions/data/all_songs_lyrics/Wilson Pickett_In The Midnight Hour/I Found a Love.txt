I Found a Love LyricsYeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
I found a love, I found a love
I found a love that I need, oh yeah
I found a kiss
I just wanna tell you that I can't resist
I found a love that I need, oh yeah
And I wanna call her now
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Wait a minute; one thing I wanna say right here
The way that woman walk, she set my l'il soul on fire
The way she talks, she my heart desire
And oh she leave me, I think that I would die
Sometime I'll call her in the midnight hour
Yeah yeah don't leave me baby
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeahEmbed
