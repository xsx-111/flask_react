Come Home Baby LyricsI know just how bad I've hurt you
Oh yeah, let me make it up some way
What can I do just to prove I love you
Should I beg on my knees?
Baby, please come home
Come home, baby
Baby, just come on home
Come home, baby
Need your love so bad
Come home, baby
Need you by my side
Come home, baby
I'll be good to you, I promise
I'll do anything you say
I want your kiss, I can't go on like this
Keep me bad if you must, baby, just come home
Come home, baby
Baby, just come on home
Come home, baby
Need your love so bad
Come home, baby
Need you by my side
Come home, baby
What can I do just to prove I love you
Should I beg on my knees?
Baby, please come home
Come home, baby
Baby, just come on home
Come home, baby
Need your love so bad
Come home, baby
Need you by my side
Come home, baby
Come home, baby
Baby, just come on home
Come home, baby
Need your love so bad
Come home, baby
Need you by my side
Come home, baby1Embed
