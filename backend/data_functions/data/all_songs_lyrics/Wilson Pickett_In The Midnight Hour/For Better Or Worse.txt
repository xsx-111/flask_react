For Better Or Worse Lyrics
For better (My my my my my my my my)
Or worse (Oh yeah)
It's alright this morning, yes it is child

A small voice
Inside my head
Keep telling me to leave you baby
But what can I do
Lord, can I say
I love with all my heart
I don't want to go away now
So tell me
That you love me too, now
And everything
And I'm
Gonna be alright, oh

You got the people talking
Lord, they talkin'
About the way you treat me baby
Sometime I get a feeling
To walk out on you
Then again, I think I'll stay
Then you'll learn to be true
So come on back
Lord, and treat me right now
And everything
And everything
Gonna be alright
Oh yes it is
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
For better (My my my my my my my my)
Or worse (Oh yeah)
Sound kinda good, I want you to hear me say it
One more time children
For better (Yeah)
Or worse (Yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
When you're pillows wept with tears at midnight
One more time, come on
Come on children

For better (Please my baby)
Or worse (My my my my my my my my)Embed
