Bell LyricsOnce again, the rubber prize
Her breathing hand never makes that sound
All I know: it's in the stairs and
It's all around, a grinding insect sound
Her bell voice did let ring
I look up and lose sense of things
I took a look way outside
An hour less though and then it's mine
A borrowed dime she scrimped and saved
My doubt grew strong, but she bought some time
I came down in Tennessee
I took a look, she's undone me
Made it stain high and alive
I can wait though, it's fine
It's fine
Now, again
He's almost done
He's not allowed
But he can't stop now
Accidental flares of love burst through the atmosphereEmbed
