Wait Forever LyricsWhy can't you say it
I think you're afraid
That's okay
I feel it too
Right now it seems like forever
But you know I can't wait that long
I want you right here
But that's okay
I think I could wait forever
I want you here now
(Check it out. I was watching this show on...on...uh...on moths. Did I tell you this?
Yes...tell me again, tell me again
OK, OK, but, dude, I don't think I finished beause it was enlightening. Um...you know how skunks spray, in defense? Moths...ins- these insects, also spray in defense. They squirt this stuff against, like, bees and stuff, big bats that eat 'em, you know? To throw out their scent, they squirt this stuff. Doctors have found this stuff... that...moths squirt, to be a cure for a virus that we get. Now, what is a virus? I mean, have we proven what this is? We look at 'em under microscopes...I mean, what if a virus is, like, an evil spirit? I mean, it could be, couldn't it? I mean, we rationalize- Dan, we rationalize everything so it's concrete: "a virus is bacteria". What is bacteria? We don't know what- we can't see inside this stuff's soul, this side's mind. But then listen to this dude, i mean, that's so random, isn't it? I mean, stuff moths' squirt cures? Think of the potential that could be out there. What if we took mud, wiped it on maple branch, um, left it there out in the sun, scraped off the mud, stuck it in our noses, drank Mountain Dew, and then snorted the mud? What- who knows? Maybe that could do something. But how would we find this out, you know what I mean? I mean, it's so random, it's so coincidental. Dude check this out-)Embed
