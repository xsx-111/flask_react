Vigilant Always LyricsPneuma has left me now
Oh, I, forget it
There's something to say
For someone who won't talk to me
Waiting
I'm not going
Why not?
Maybe
(It's coming up... right here)
I know she's there beneath my window
There's a noise in her heart
And it's fucking her up
Be to me the one and only
I should know 'cause she told me so
I know
'Cause I'm right
Come to my window and
Throw stones of Jell-o
There's a little black spot and she knows it's her conscience
I hope she learns how to cope
With the pain in her heart
'Cause it's tearing her apart
Be one while I sleep
Wide awake
Her eyes take me1Embed
