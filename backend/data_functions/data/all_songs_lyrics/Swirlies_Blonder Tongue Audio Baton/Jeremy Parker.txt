Jeremy Parker Lyrics
Christmas stevedore
A basement hall, a broken jaw
The empire clock
Hangs up over there


Wettish window sill
Drying shell on sleeping pills
He's downstairs
She dreamed of artistic freedom


One, two, three, four, five, six


I'm going to...jump the- shit- I'll kick the shit out of any cocksucker...or killEmbed
