Tree Chopped Down LyricsI waited a while
I combed my hair
He looked so clean and handsome
I wasn't prepared to be taken by you
I wish I got away from you cause you kept turning into
Something I kept falling through
I hope that you can accept
Why'd you wait so long
You're kickin and scratching
You're gonna hurt me
I came in the back room
I went up the stairs
Straight and clean on the bathroom mirror
All around there
I wish there was a way for you to keep coming back to me
'cause I gotta get the fuck away from you
'cause you're unhealthyEmbed
