Wrong Tube LyricsHere we are
Without our clothes
Icky thick and dark
Silver spoon moon pretty soon
There's a big mess around the room
Through the drawers and the floorboards
Come unglued
Every night seems to be ten times longer
After all and even though i'm not so sure
It's the wrong tube now
Here we are without our clothes
Icky thick dark and silver spoon moon
Scream a little every night
Every night scream a littleEmbed
