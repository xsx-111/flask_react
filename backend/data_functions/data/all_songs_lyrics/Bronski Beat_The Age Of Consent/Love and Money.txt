Love and Money LyricsWork for money spend money
Spend for love love for money
Pain and love love and pain
Pain and lust lust for money
Love and money
Love and money
Exploit for money kill for love
Love for money exploited love
Love and money

Burning me up
Oooh it's burning me up
Bruning me up

Work for money spend money
Spend for love love for money
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
Money is the root of all evil
