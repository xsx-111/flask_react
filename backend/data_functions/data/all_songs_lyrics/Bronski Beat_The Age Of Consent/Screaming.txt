Screaming LyricsMy man love my first love
My closetness and pain
My lying my deceiving
My rivers keep on crying
My father my action man
My hiding in the crowd
My mother my sisters eyes
My seniors and their prying
My hero my schoolboy
My physical abuse
My loneliness my aching brain
My pounding in the head
My freedom my prison cell
My tempting to destroy
My fantasies my lost control
My confusion disillusion
Machismo my manhood
My wanting just to scream
Scream yeah yeah yeahEmbed
