Why? Lyrics
Tell me why
Tell me why

Contempt in your eyes when I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie, all my feelings denied, blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?

Ooh!

You in your false securities tear up my life, condemning me
Name me an illness, call me a sin, never feel guilty, never give in

Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Tell me why?
Yeah!
Aah!

You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love
You and me together, fighting for our love

Ooh!

Contempt in your eyes when I turn to kiss his lips
Broken I lie, all my feelings denied, blood on your fist

Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?
Can you tell me why?Embed
