Need a Man Blues LyricsI got those need a man blues
Driving me mad
I go those need a man blues
Hurting me bad
Sweet sweet sweet
Is the taste of a man
And sweeter still is the taste
Of his sweet tasting love
Evil, wicked or angel
Just give me a man
Evil, wicked or
Angel
Need a man blues
Need a man blues
Angel hurting me bad
Boys and heroes lovers and men
Turning me upside down
Again and again
Again and again
He-e-hey
I got those need a man blues
I got those need a man blues
Hurting me oh so bad
And the sweetest thing of all
Is men loving men loving men loving men
Is men loving men loving men loving men
I got those need a man blues
I got those need a man blues
Ne-he-he-he-he-he-he-ed a man blues
Ne-he-he-he-he-he-he-ed a man blues
Ne-he-he-he-he-he-he-ed a man blues
Ne-he-he-he-he-he-he-ed a man blues
Angel!Embed
