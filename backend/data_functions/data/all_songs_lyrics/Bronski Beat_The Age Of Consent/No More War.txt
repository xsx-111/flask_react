No More War LyricsNo more war please
No more destruction of innocent life
No more living in fear
No more on our bended knees
To live is our right
No more war
No more war please
It's got to stop oh we've got to make it stop
No more money for bombs
When the poor people hungry on the street
No more sending young men to fight
As they die for false glory and false pride (do or die)
No more war please
Who wants to die
No more war please
Who wants to die
No more war no more war no more
Who wants to die who wants to dieEmbed
