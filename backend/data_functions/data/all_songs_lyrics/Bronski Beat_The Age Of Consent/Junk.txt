Junk Lyrics
He can't take the street no more
Street too full, full of junk
Thinks he'll hide in his room
Room too full, full of junk

He turns on his T.V
T.V. full, full of junk
Processed zombies pushing junk
Junk food, junk clothes
Dressed in junk from head to toe

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
And be thankful what you get
And still he screams for more

Hits the night life once again
Night life full, full of junk
Junk is all he'll ever know
Junk music, junk dance
Too many junk heads on the floor
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
And be thankful what you get
And still he screams for more

Life (and bits of egg!)
Life (and tender chewy bits, with protein from bits of whole grain cereal, beefy bits, and bits of egg!)
Ow!
Life in the fast lane
(And bits of egg!)
Right, Stella?

Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
Eat what you get
Eat what you're given
And be thankful what you get
And still he screams for more
And still he screams for more
And still he screams for moreEmbed
