Concrete Walls Lyrics
I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm

Eyes are open and mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer
Eyes are open and mouth cries
Haven't slept since summer

I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm

Oh how I try
I leave the TV on
And the radio
Oh how I try
I leave the TV on
And the radio
I live between concrete walls
When I took her up she was so warm
I live between concrete walls
In my arms she was so warm

And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radio
And the radioEmbed
