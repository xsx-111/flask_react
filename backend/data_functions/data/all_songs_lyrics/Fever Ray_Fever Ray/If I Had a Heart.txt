If I Had a Heart Lyrics
This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more
This will never end 'cause I want more
More, give me more, give me more

If I had a heart I could love you
If I had a voice I would sing
After the night when I wake up
I'll see what tomorrow brings

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
If I had a voice I would sing

Dangling feet from window frame, will they ever
Ever reach the floor? More, give me more, give me more
Cushion filled with all I found underneath and inside
Just to come around, more, give me more, give me more

Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
Ah ah ah
If I had a voice I would sing19Embed
