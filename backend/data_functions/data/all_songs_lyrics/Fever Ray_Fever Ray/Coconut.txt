Coconut Lyrics
He came back one day and
Told me stories that I now dream of
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Open atmosphere
Take me anywhere, take me there
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We have water mouth
Sand in pockets and a strained household
Oh, oh, oh, oh

When the night falls
There is fire in the bungalow

Lay back with a big cigar
Lay back we are where we are
Lay back with a big cigar
Lay back this is where we areEmbed
