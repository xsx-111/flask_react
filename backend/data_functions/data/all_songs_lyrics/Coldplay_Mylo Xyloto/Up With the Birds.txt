Up With the Birds Lyrics
The birds they sang
The break of day
Start again, I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then, I'm up with the birds


Might have to go, where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way

Oh, yeah1Embed
