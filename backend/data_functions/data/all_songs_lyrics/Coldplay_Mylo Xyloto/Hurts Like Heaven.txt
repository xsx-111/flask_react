Hurts Like Heaven Lyrics

Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
"Do you ever get the feeling that you’re missing the mark?"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign:
"I struggle with the feeling that my life isn’t mine"
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
See the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart
Took the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still, I won’t let go
Still, I won’t let go
Of you
'Cause you do

Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven
On every street, every car, every surface, a name
Tonight, the streets are ours
And we’re writing and saying
"Don’t let 'em take control"
No, we won’t let 'em take control
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they’re out to get us?
How come they’re out when they don’t know the facts?
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, I’ll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I’ll be armed with a spray can soul
And you
Oh, you
'Cause you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven

Ohh oh, ohh oh

Yeah, it's true
When you use your heart as a weapon
Then it hurts like heaven
Oh, it hurts like heaven14Embed
