Paradise Lyrics

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly
And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la
La, la-la, la-la-la, la-la
So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, "Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh I know the sun must set to rise"

This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
This could be para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

This could be para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
This could be para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...98Embed
