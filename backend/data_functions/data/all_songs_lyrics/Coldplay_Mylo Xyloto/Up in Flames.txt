Up in Flames Lyrics
So it's over
This time, I know it's gone
Saltwater
Tasted it too long
I only know I'm wrong
Now I know it's gone

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone

So it's over
This time, you're flying on
This time, I know no song
Can't stop its lonely burn
Can't stop it slowly going

Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Up in flames
Up in flames
Up in flames
We have slowly gone
Oh, we have slowly gone

Can we pour some water on?6Embed
