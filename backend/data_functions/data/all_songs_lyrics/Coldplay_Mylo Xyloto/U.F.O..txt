U.F.O. Lyrics
Lord, I don't know which way I am going
Which way the river going to flow
It just seems that upstream, I keep rowing
Still got such a long way to go
Still got such a long way to go

Then that light hits your eye
I know, I swear
We'll find somewhere
The streets are paved with gold
Bullets fly, split the sky
But that's alright, sometimes
Sunlight comes streaming through the holes
