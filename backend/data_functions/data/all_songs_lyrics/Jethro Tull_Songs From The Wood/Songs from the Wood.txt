Songs from the Wood Lyrics
Let me bring you songs from the wood:
To make you feel much better than you could know
Dust you down from tip to toe
Show you how the garden grows
Hold you steady as you go
Join the chorus if you can:
It'll make of you an honest man

Let me bring you love from the field:
Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
To heal the wound and still the pain
That threatens again and again
As you drag down every lover's lane
Life's long celebration's here
I'll toast you all in penny cheer

Let me bring you all things refined:
Galliards and lute songs served in chilling ale
Greetings well met fellow, hail!
I am the wind to fill your sail
I am the cross to take your nail:
A singer of these ageless times
With kitchen prose and gutter rhymes

Songs from the wood - make you feel much better 
Songs from the wood 

Let me bring you love from the field:
Poppies red and roses filled with summer rain
To heal the wound and still the pain
That threatens again and again
As you drag down every lovers' lane
Life's long celebration's here
I'll toast you all in penny cheer

Songs from the wood - make you feel much better
Songs from the wood - make you feel much betterEmbed
