Ring Out Solstice Bells LyricsNow is the solstice of the year
Winter is the glad song that you hear
Seven maids move in seven time
Have the lads up ready in a line
Ring out these bells
Ring out, ring solstice bells
Ring solstice bells
Join together beneath the mistletoe
By the holy oak whereon it grows
Seven druids dance in seven time
Sing the song the bells call, loudly chiming
Ring out these bells
Ring out, ring solstice bells
Ring solstice bells
Ring out, ring out the solstice bells
Ring out, ring out the solstice bells
Praise be to the distant sister sun
Joyful as the silver planets run
Seven maids move in seven time
Sing the song the bells call, loudly chiming
Ring out those bells
Ring out, ring solstice bells
Ring solstice bells
Ring on, ring out
Ring on, ring outEmbed
