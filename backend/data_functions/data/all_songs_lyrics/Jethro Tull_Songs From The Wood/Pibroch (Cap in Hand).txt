Pibroch (Cap in Hand) LyricsThere's a light in the house
In the wood in the valley
There's a thought in the head
Of the man
Who carries his dreams
Like the coat slung on his shoulder
Bringing you love
In the cap in his hand
And each step he takes
Is one half of a lifetime
No word he would say
Could you understand
So he bundles his regrets
Into a gesture of sorrow
Bringing you love
Cap in hand
Catching breath
As he looks through the dining-room window
Candle-lit table
For two has been laid
Strange slippers by the fire
Strange boots in the hall-way
Put my cap on my head
I turn, and walk awayEmbed
