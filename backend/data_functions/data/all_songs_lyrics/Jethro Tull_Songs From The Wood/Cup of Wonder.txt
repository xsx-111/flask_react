Cup of Wonder Lyrics
May I make my fond excuses
For the lateness of the hour
But we accept your invitation, and we bring you Beltane's flower
For the May Day is the great day, sung along the old straight track
And those who ancient lines did lay
Will heed the song that calls them back

Pass the word and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder

Ask the Green Man where he comes from, ask the cup that fills with red
Ask the old grey standing stones that show the sun it's way to bed
Question all as to their ways
And learn the secrets that they hold
Walk the lines of nature's palm
Crossed with silver and with gold

Pass the word and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder

Join in black December's sadness
Lie in August's welcome corn
Stir the cup that's ever-filling
With the blood of all that's born
But the May Day is the great day, sung along the old straight track
And those who ancient lines did lay
Will heed this song that calls them back
Pass the word and pass the lady, pass the plate to all who hunger
Pass the wit of ancient wisdom, pass the cup of crimson wonder
Pass the cup of crimson wonderEmbed
