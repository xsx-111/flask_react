Soledad LyricsNobody's coming through my way
I'm drowning in the crown with nothin to say
Waitin' for a better day
This is another beautiful Sunday
It's alway the same old show
When trouble is comin by the door
Love jump all through the window
Here I am alone with nowhere to go
Soledad (¡no quiero, no!)
Stinkin' with your heavy perfume
The kind I will never loose
Whistlin' your favourite tune
Called "the Black Widow Blues"
Soledad (¡no quiero, no!)
Nobody's coming through my way
I'm drowing in the crown with nothin to say
Waitin' for a better day
Soledad XXX
Stinkin with your heavy perfume
Whistlin' your favourite tune
"Soledad lo que a mi me va
Soledad a mi me da la vida"
Nobody's coming through my way
I'm drowning in the crown with nothin to say
Waitin' for a better day
This is another beautiful Sunday
Soledad (¡no quiero, no!)

Nobody's coming through my way
I'm drowing in the crown with nothin to say
Waitin' for a better day
Soledad XXX
It's alway the same old show
When trouble is comin' by the door
Love jump all through the window
Soledad (¡no quiero, no!)
Nobody's coming through my way
I'm drowing in the crown with nothin to say
Waitin' for a better day
Soledad (¡no quiero, no!)2Embed
