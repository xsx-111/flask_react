King Kong Five Lyrics
Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Twist and Jerks they do the boogie
Like one big flop
They don't know about tha soul wine habit club
I sing my song and I'm a rocker
Burnin up with the puta's fever

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Twist and Jerks they do the boogie like ..
Twist and Jerks they do the boogie like ..
Twist and Jerks they do the boogie like ..
King Kong Five

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Standin'alive
We're the king kong five
Doin'the king kong jive
On the Gabony boogie
Now what's the matter whit me?
What's the matter whit me?
I'm playin like shakin under the coconut tree

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Twist and Jerks they do the boogie
Like one big flop
They don't know about tha soul wine habit club
I sing my song and I'm a rocker
Burnin up with the puta's fever

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum

Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Listen to the beat beat
Of the song song
Buzzin in my head head
Like a bum dum
Now we're standin'alive
We're the king kong five
Doin'the king kong jive
On the Gabony boogie
Standin'alive
We're the king kong five
Doin'the king kong jive
On the Gabony boogie
What's the matter with me?
What's the matter with me?
I'm playin like shakin under the coconut treeEmbed
