Magic Dice LyricsLa patchanka (cause we got it!)
The sticky sound (the magic dice)
But la patchanka (Thank you thank you)
Can't be no Rotten Sound! (Magic Dice!)
One day I found me a Magic Dice
Magic Dice that always talkin twice
Roll Roll Roll the tumblin dice
Every thing you say is a good advice
Nice Nice Nice the Tumblin Dice
Never leave me to my own, my own Device
He never Ever Ever Ever told me lies
Nice Nice Nice The Tumblin DiceEmbed
