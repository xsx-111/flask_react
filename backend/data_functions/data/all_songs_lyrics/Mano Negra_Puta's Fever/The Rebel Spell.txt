The Rebel Spell LyricsI want to be ready
I want to be ready
I want to be ready Lord
Walking to Babylon with my gun
1) Brother Rasta is dead
Listen every body says: They shot Brothers Rasta Dead!
Braggin Boys in blue
They shot him through
So tonight's the night
We're gonna have a big fight
They got the power, we got the right
2) Now it's my turn
I'm gonna take my gun
And walk to Babylon
Like a million
"They gonna kill you, son!", "Don't worry Mum"
Along my country way I'm gonna shout and say
"They shot Brother Rasta Dead"
Rudy left for the City
But three days later
Washed back by the Tide
Mum found his body on the RiverbackEmbed
