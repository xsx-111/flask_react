Old John Robertson (Single Version) LyricsOld John Robertson he wore a Stetson hat
People everywhere would laugh behind his back
No one cared to take any time to find out
What he was all about, fear kept them out
Children laughed and played and didn't know his name
They could tell when he was coming just the same
Walking slow with old Jo his crippled wife by his side
Then she sighed, then she died
Magic words from him entrancing children's ears
But their laughter didnâ€™t help to hide his tears
All in vain it was no game for he'd lost an old friend
In the end, in the end...
Old John Robertson he wore a Stetson hat
People everywhere would laugh behind his back
No one cared to take any time to find out
What he was all about, fear kept them outEmbed
