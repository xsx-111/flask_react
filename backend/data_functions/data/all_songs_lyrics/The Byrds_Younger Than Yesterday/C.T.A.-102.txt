C.T.A.-102 Lyrics
C.T.A.-102
Year over year receiving you
Signals tell us that you're there
We can hear them loud and clear

We just want to let you know
That we're ready for to go
Out into the universe
We don't care who's been there first

On our radio telescopes
Science tells us that there's hope
Life on other planets might exist

C.T.A.-102
Year over year receiving you
Signals tell us that you're there
We can hear them loud and clear
