Mind Gardens (Alternate Version) LyricsOnce upon a time
There was a garden
On a high hill
Green and blossomin' round
Against the sea
And there the sun came
And the rain pourin' down
Garden grew
And flourished
And splattered
Bits of color on the ground
And it took shape
And symmetry
And all of life around
But there came winds
Driven and howling
There came snow
And I feared for the garden
So I built a wall
And I built another
And roofed it over
Thick and strong
And kept it from the
Slings and arrows
Of outrageous fortune
The killing cold
Could not get in
But when the sun came
And the gentle rain of spring
They could not reach the garden
Behind those walls
It would have died
Safely, securely died
But as I longed
And as I learned
I tore the walls all down
The garden still livesEmbed
