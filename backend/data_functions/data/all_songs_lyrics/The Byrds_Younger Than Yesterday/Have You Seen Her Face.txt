Have You Seen Her Face Lyrics
Have you seen her face?
Her eyes reflect the colors in the sky
A warm familiar place
To be swept into whenever she's close by
Makes me wonder why

Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye

Must be the way she walks
A style made up to capture all she needs
No time spent on loose talk
If your luck runs right, she might see you tonight
Everything in sight

Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye


Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eye
You'll find you're locked in her spell
All the sights and sounds, your senses will be found
And only time will tell
How much love can be to wait so patiently
Wait and see

Run by, don't turn back
Can't hide from that look in her eyeEmbed
