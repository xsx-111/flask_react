It Happens Each Day LyricsLike a silent ray of sunlight
Catching in my eye
Like a bird sea-goin'
Coasting on my sky
It happens each day
You're away from here...
A bunch of friends are missing
From this tapestry
I remember kissing
Do you remember me
It happens each day
You're away from here...
Like a disembodied spirit
Watching over me
Like a sister sailing ship
Dead against the sea
It happens each day
You're away from here...Embed
