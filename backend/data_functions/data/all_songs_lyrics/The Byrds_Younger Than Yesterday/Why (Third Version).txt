Why (Third Version) Lyrics
You keep saying no to her
Since she was a baby
You keep saying no to her
Not even maybe

Now, why?
Why?

You say there's a limit there
She can't go past that
She don't believe you
She don't think that's very set

Why?
Why?

You say she can't change that
It's the way you've always done it
She don't care about that
She thinks you've just begun it
Why?
Why?

You say it's a dead old world
Dull and unforgiving
I don't know where you live
But you're not living

Why?
Why?

You keep saying no to her
Since she was a baby
You keep saying no to her
Not even maybe

Now, why?
Why?Embed
