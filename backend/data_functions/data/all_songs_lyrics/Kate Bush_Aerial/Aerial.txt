Aerial Lyrics
The dawn has come
And the wine will run
And the song must be sung
And the flowers are melting
In the sun

I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I'm gonna get up on the roof
I feel I need to be up on the roof
I wanna be up, up on the roof
I feel I'm gonna be up on the roof
I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I feel I gotta get up on the roof

And the wine will run
And the song must be sung
And the flowers are melting

What kind of language is this?
What kind of language is this?
I can't hear a word you're saying
Tell me how you are singing
In the sun

All of the birds are laughing
All of the birds are laughing
Come on let's all join in
Come on let's all join in

I feel I wanna be up on the roof
I wanna be up, up on the roof
Up high, high on the roof
I feel I gotta be up on the roof
I feel I need to be up on the roof
Up, up high on the roof
High, high on the roof
In the sun
