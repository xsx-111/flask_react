Bertie Lyrics
Here comes the sunshine
Here comes that son of mine
Here comes the everything
Here's a song and a song for him

Sweet kisses
Three wishes

Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
You're lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely

The most wilful
The most beautiful
The most truly fantastic smile
I've ever seen

Sweet kisses
Three wishes
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
You're lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
You're lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely Bertie
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely

You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joy
You bring me so much joy
And then you bring me more joyEmbed
