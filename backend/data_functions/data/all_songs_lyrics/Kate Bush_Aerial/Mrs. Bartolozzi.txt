Mrs. Bartolozzi Lyrics
I remember it was that Wednesday
Oh, when it rained and it rained
They traipsed mud all over the house
It took hours and hours to scrub it out
All over the hall carpet
I took my mop and my bucket
And I cleaned and I cleaned the kitchen floor
Until it sparkled

Then I took my laundry basket
And put all the linen in it
And everything I could fit in
And all our dirty clothes that hadn't gone into the wash
And all your shirts and jeans and things
And put them in the new...

Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine

I watched them going 'round and 'round
My blouse wrapping itself around your trousers
Oh, the waves are going out
My skirt floating up around my waist
As I wade out into the surf
Oh, and the waves are coming in
Oh, and the waves are going out
Oh, and you're standing right behind me
Little fish swim between my legs
Oh, and the waves are coming in
Oh, and the waves are going out
Oh, and the waves are coming in
Out of the corner of my eye
I think I see you standing outside
But it's just your shirt
Hanging on the washing line
Waving its arm as the wind blows by
And it looks so alive
Nice and white
Just like it's climbed right out of my...
Washing machine
Washing machine
Washing machine

Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy
Get that dirty shirty clean
Slooshy sloshy slooshy sloshy
Make those cuffs and collars gleam
Everything clean and shiny

Washing machine
Washing machine
