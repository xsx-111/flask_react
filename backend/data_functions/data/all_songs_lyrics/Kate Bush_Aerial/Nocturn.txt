Nocturn Lyrics
On this Midsummer night
Everyone is sleeping
We go driving
Into the moonlight

Could be in a dream
Our clothes are on the beach
These prints of our feet
Lead right up to the sea
No one, no one is here
No one, no one is here
We stand in the Atlantic
We become panoramic

We tire of the city
We tire of it all
We long for just that
Something more

Could be in a dream
Our clothes are on the beach
The prints of our feet
Lead right up to the sea
No one, no one is here
No one, no one is here
We stand in the Atlantic
We become panoramic
The stars are caught in our hair
The stars are on our fingers
A veil of diamond dust
Just reach up and touch it
The sky's above our heads
The sea's around our legs
In milky, silky water
We swim further and further
We dive down
We dive down

A diamond night, a diamond sea
And a diamond sky

We dive deeper and deeper
We dive deeper and deeper
Could be we are here
Could be in my dream


It came up on the horizon
Rising and rising
A sea of honey, a sky of honey
A sea of honey, a sky of honey
Look at the light, and all the time it's a changing
Look at the light, climbing up the aerial
Bright, white coming alive, jumping off of the aerial
All the time it's a changing, like now
All the time it's a changing, like then again
All the time it's a changing
And all the dreamers are waking1Embed
