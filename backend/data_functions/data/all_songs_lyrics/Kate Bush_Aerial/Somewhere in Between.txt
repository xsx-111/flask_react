Somewhere in Between Lyrics
We went up to the top of the highest hill
And stopped, still

It was just so beautiful
It was just so beautiful
It was just so beautiful

This is where the shadows come to play
'Twixt the day and night
Dancing and skipping
Along a chink of light

Somewhere in between the waxing and the waning wave
Somewhere in between what the song and silence says
Somewhere in between the ticking and the tocking clock
Somewhere in a dream between sleep and waking up

Somewhere in between breathing out and breathing in
Like twilight is neither night nor morning

Not one of us would dare to break
The silence
And how we have longed
For something that would
Make us feel so...

Somewhere in between the waxing and the waning wave
Somewhere in between the night and the daylight
Somewhere in between the ticking and the tocking clock
Somewhere in between what the song and the silence say

Somewhere in between breathing out and breathing in

Goodnight, Sun
Goodnight, Sun
"Goodnight, Mum"2Embed
