November Baby LyricsThis skin hangs on me like a lampshade
Keeping all my light at bay
That night I banged at winter's doorstep
For just a look at your face
Let me in, I said, I know someone inside
I just haven't met them yet
November, please don't make me beg
Your big sad eyes
Your crooked smile
Your capped teeth
Your widow's peak
Oh, my November baby
Now everywhere I go, I see you
When I walk and when I sleep
I hear you on the tongues of strangers
I hang on every word they speak
I try to be just where you are
But summer takes you far from me
So just for now I place an angel
Atop an early Christmas tree
Your big sad eyes
Your crooked smile
Your capped teeth
Your widow's peak
Oh, my November baby
Oh, my November baby
Your big sad eyes
Your crooked smile
Your capped teeth
Your widow's peak
Oh, my November baby
Oh, my November babyEmbed
