Moon & Back LyricsLittle baby, if you're reading this
You're probably all grown the way most babies do
I'm sure your eyes are still their pretty blue
I'm writing to you from 1991
The year I gave you to
A mama with a girl and son
Please don't look at this like a hit and run
In a breath I felt you leaving like the setting sun
Life just thought that I should draw the shortest straw
But little baby, for a short time I had you to break my fall, fall, fall
Your new daddy, yeah, he loves you too
"To the moon and back" he said
When I laid you in his arms
And he kissed your soft blonde head
Please don't look at this like a hit and run
In a breath I felt you leaving like the setting sun
Life just thought that I should draw the shortest straw
But little baby, for a short time I had you to break my fall, fall, fall
Your new family knows
I did this all for you
Maybe one day you'll believe it too
Please don't look at this like a hit and run
In a breath I felt you leaving like the setting sun
Life just thought that I should draw the shortest straw
But little baby, for a short time I had you to break my fall, fall, fall
Please don't look at this like a hit and run
In a breath I felt you leaving like the setting sun
Life just thought that I should draw the shortest straw
But little baby, for a short time I had you to break my fall, fall, fallEmbed
