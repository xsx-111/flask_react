Jealousy And I LyricsWhat am I supposed to say, babe?
I’ll be up all night to tell the truth
Would you really have a stranger in your bed
Rather than let someone like me take care of you?
It’s no one’s problem but my own
I think I’ve always cared too much
I’m suffocating you I know
It’s just the only way I know to love, know to love

Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
‘Cause Jealousy and I
We’re two of a kind
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
You don’t owe me anything
But you’ve got to spell it out for me
‘Cause if you’re saying things that you don’t mean
Then you don’t really want me at your feet
At your feet

Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
‘Cause Jealousy and I
We’re two of a kind
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
I’ll never let her go
I’ll never let her go
Never let her go
I’ll never let her go

Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
Jealousy gets me sometimes
But I don’t mind, no I don’t mind
‘Cause Jealousy and I
We’re two of a kind
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mine
And she’s all mineEmbed
