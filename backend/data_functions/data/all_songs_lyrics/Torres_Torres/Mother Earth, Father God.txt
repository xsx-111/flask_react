Mother Earth, Father God LyricsI was born on bloody battleground
To the middle men between two realms
The hungry eyes linger as she twirls
Got hands lifted to heaven and her toes dipped in hell
Oh, Mother Earth, oh, Father God
The demons wager on my fall
The greatest trick I ever saw
Was them fooling us to think they were never here at all
Should I be held responsible
That it's come to this?
Was I blindsided after all?
I knew beforehand of the kiss
Oh, Mother Earth, oh, Father God
The demons wager on my fall
The greatest trick I ever saw
Was them fooling us to think they were never here at all
Should I be held responsible
That it's come to this?
Was I blindsided after all?
I knew beforehand of the kiss
You always warned me of the kiss
I have been betrayed by the kiss
Oh, Mother Earth, oh, Father God
The demons wager on my fall
The greatest trick I ever saw
Was them fooling us to think they were never here at allEmbed
