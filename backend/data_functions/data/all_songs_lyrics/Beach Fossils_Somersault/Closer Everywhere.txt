Closer Everywhere LyricsI'm crowded in the street
Feel like i’m floating on the air
(closer as we speak)
I sweat the morning heat
I know you’re somewhere over there
(closer everywhere)
I hear your voice inside my head
Can’t remember what you said
In the city that we know
Can you ever take it slow
Read all the magazines
I haven’t shed a tear for weeks
(closer as we speak)
They told the refugee
You know that nothing can be free
(closer everywhere)
I hear your voice inside my head
Can’t remember what you said
In the city that you know
Can you ever take it slowEmbed
