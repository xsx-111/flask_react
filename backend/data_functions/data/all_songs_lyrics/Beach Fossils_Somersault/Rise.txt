Rise LyricsTrying to find the time
For you
You put me in a point
Somewhere between here, there
And the true and living
Trying to think about the past
Second to none
Trying to
Make sense of this
And feel the way i feel
About you but still
See the past for what it was
Just tell me
A part of me you kept
A part of me i swept
Away from you
I wish it meant as much to me as it used to
It don't man, honestly
Does that make sense to you, you know
And that's what you said to me so
Honestly
Somewhere between trust and honesty
Out there somewhere
Between yourself
And the true and living
