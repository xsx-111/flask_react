This Year Lyrics
Turn 'round, time to be on the other way
I know you're gonna try and bring me down
Run 'round, my feet on the other way
Not gonna be in town when you're around

No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time

This year, I told myself it'd be a better one
Try not to fall back onto the knife
By now, I told myself I'd be a better friend
I'll meet you on the other side of life

No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time
No, I won't be there in time1Embed
