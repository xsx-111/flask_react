Sugar LyricsSo now you found the time to get away
But you don't know what to do about yourself
I see it but I look the other way
And i’m feeling like I’m falling out again
Cause I’m on the outside
On the outside
On the outside change your mind
I’m feeling nothing
Feeling nothing
On the outside change your mind
I lost it
I won’t say
I lost it
So now you turn to me to get away
But you haven’t figured out just what you want
You see those angels in the alleyway
Were they coming here to save me from myself
I'm lost in
The sugar
Found out you're
The only one
Go on now
Forever
Found out you're
The only one9Embed
