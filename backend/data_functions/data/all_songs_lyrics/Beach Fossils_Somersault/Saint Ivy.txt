Saint Ivy Lyrics
If you find a reason
I'll be gone in a matter of time
This was your decision
Oh you got me in a state of mind

I wish that there could be another way
But I know that you've made up your mind
You know there's nothing left for me to say
That could change your mind this time

Hard to find a reason
Television and another headline
Don't believe in Jesus
Heaven knows I'm wasting my time
Wanna believe in America
But it's somewhere I can't find

I wish that there could be another way
But I know that you've made up your mind
You know there's nothing left for me to say
That could change your mind this time2Embed
