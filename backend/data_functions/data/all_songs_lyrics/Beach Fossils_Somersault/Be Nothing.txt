Be Nothing LyricsAll you got
All you got
Is you never had nothing
You wish you had something
All you want
All you want
Is you always had something
You wish you had nothing
Gone to roam
To get back home
Did you find devotion
Or were you just floating
Now so strong
All along
I told you don’t rush it
'cause you’re never gonna trust it
Be nothing
Be nothing
All you want
All you want
Is you never had nothing
All you got
All you got
Is you always want something3Embed
