Social Jetlag LyricsYou say that you want me here
And I found the door
And then you open up my hand
Where you wanna go
Can we start all our time over again
Can we start all our time over again
Make our way onto the roof
Been awake for days
In the shadow of the night
I wanna fade away
Can we start all our time over again
Can we start all our time over again2Embed
