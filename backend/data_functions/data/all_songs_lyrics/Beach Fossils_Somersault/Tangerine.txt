Tangerine LyricsOur time together’s always blurry
After a while it’s all a story
And if you think you understand me
I guess you're right it’s all I can be
I know
All along
What i see
What i need
Nothing
In between
Everything
Tangerine
Tangerine
Deep in the hours after midnight
Skating underneath the streetlight
Lie down together while we get high
Ride to the water for the sunrise
I know
All along
What i see
What i need
Nothing
In between
Everything
Tangerine
