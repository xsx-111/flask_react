May 1st LyricsThe world is half asleep
And you’re just hanging on
To the friends that you keep
Out here on the road
Watch the land unfolding under my
Shadow
Sun goes down
Time rolls on
You went out with the wind
Dreary as you can be
You know you’re right in the end
Wherever you’ve been
I know that you can make it on your own
My friend
Sun goes down
Time rolls on3Embed
