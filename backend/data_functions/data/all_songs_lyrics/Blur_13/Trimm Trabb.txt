Trimm Trabb Lyrics
733 North West Knoll Drive
CA 90069
659, 7812, 3108
Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo

I got no style
I take my time
All those losers on the piss again
I doze, doze away
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

I've got trimm trabb
Like the flash boys have
And I can't go back
Let it flow, let it flow
I sleep alone
I sleep alone

85588, 30

Row MM
That's just the way it is
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
Just the way it is
That's just the way it is
I've got trimm trabb
Like the flash boys have
And I can't go back
Let it flow, let it flow
I'll sleep alone
I'll sleep alone
I'll sleep alone
I'll sleep alone

Choo, choo, choo, choo, choo
I've got no style
I'll take my time
All those losers on the piss again
I doze, doze away
That's just the way it is
That's just the way it is

I've got trimm trabb
Like the flash boys have
And I can't go back
Let it flow, let it flow
I'll sleep alone
I'll sleep alone
I'll sleep alone
I'll sleep alone

Just the way it is (x11)
