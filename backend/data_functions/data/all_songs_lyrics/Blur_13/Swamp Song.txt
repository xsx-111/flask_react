Swamp Song Lyrics
Bullshit

Give me good times
Give me saliva
Give me fever
I'm a believer
Yeah, yeah

Give me insane
Give me space brain
Give me music, give me love
Abandon us in love

Give me good times (I wanna be with you)
There no joke rhymes  ( I know you want me too)
Give me easy breathing  (I wanna be with you)
Give me everything (I know you want me too)
Everything, everything
Wakah, wakah
All the sounds 
What you call this sound? 
Making better sound 
Oh god 
Yeah!
Give me good times
And give me saliva
Give me fever
I'm a believer

Yeah, give me insane  (I wanna be with you)
And gimme space brain (I know you want me too)
Don't leave me ever  (I wanna be with you)
We'll live forever (I know you want me too)
Yes, we will
I know we will
(Whatcha, whatcha, whatcha say?) 
(Wakah, wakah) 

Give me good times
Give me saliva
Give me fever
I'm a believer
You know I am

Give me insane (I wanna be with you)
Give me space brain (I know you want me too)
Give me music, give me love (I wanna be with you)
Abandon us in love (I know you want me too)
Stick it in my veins
Stick it in my veins
Stick it in my veins

La la la la la la la la
I've got no fear 
Sleep, sleep, sleep7Embed
