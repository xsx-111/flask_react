Caramel Lyrics
I've got to get over
I've got to get over
I've got to get better
Will love you forever
I've got to find genius (caramel)
I've got to get better (caramel)
I've got to stop smoking (caramel)
I've got to get better (caramel, caramel)

Where is the magic?
I've got to get better
Oh lord, give me magic
I'll love you forever
I've got to find mounts hill (caramel)
And live by the mountain (caramel)
I'll love you forever (caramel)
You are (caramel)
And you are (caramel)
(Caramel, caramel, caramel, caramel)

Bye (bye), babe (bye) 
Low, low, low, low
Bye (bye), babe (bye)
Low, low, low, low
Low, low, low, low (low) 
Low, low, low, low 5Embed
