Battle Lyrics
Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, ooh
Battle, battle, battle, ooh
Battle someone, ooh

Completion search
Here, I love the bow
See me walk on down to
Adorn myself, it's a new song glory
'Cause see me, what do you think of now?

Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, ooh
Battle, battle, battle, ooh
Battle someone, ooh

Can turn your sights
Kill until sub-zero
See me, oh it turns you on
All my gawe
It's the end of yours
See me, take your last one now
Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, ooh
Battle, battle, battle, ooh
Battle someone, ooh

Ooh, ooh..
Ooh, ooh..
Ooh
Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, ooh
Battle, battle, battle, ooh
Battle someone, ooh
Battle, battle, battle, battle, battle
Battle someone, ooh
Battle, battle, battle, ooh
Battle someone, ooh

Keep sounds
Keep love about
See me overcome6Embed
