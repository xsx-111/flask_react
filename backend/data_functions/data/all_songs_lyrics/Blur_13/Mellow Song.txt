Mellow Song Lyrics
I left my street, I'm a guillotine
Pulling away, In my machine
Where have I been, now?
Not you
Shooting stars in my left arm, it's an alcohol low
Giving away time to Casio
Sun is slow, I got no soul

Is this where I'm going to?
We'll see
We'll see
We'll see

I kill this sleep
I'm the man in the moon
Walking on sand on my home high noon
In love with the moon, I love you

Because I left my street, I'm a guillotine
Pull it away, in my machine
Forget where I've been before, and forget you
Is this where I'm going to?
We'll see
We'll see
We'll see

I miss you
I miss you4Embed
