Freestyle
Ay, it's freestyle, 45
Freestyle

I'm a country boy, I got no soul
Don't sleep at night, the world's growing old
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones

Freestyle, 45
Freestyle

I'm a country boy, I got no soul
Don't sleep at night, the world's growing old
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones
I'm a country boy, I got no soul
Don't sleep at night, the world's growing old
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones
I lost my girl to the Rolling Stones4Embed
