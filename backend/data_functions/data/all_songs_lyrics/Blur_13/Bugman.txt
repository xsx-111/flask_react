Bugman Lyrics
Bugman, bugman

I am an ex offender
They let me out in the summer
I think I was in a coma
I didn't know what to do
Oh no

You go hang around, go 'round
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the bugman
You go hang around, around
I'll watch myself hang on
Look out for the bugman

I got no sense of existence
I know the nodding dogs
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah

You go hang around, go 'round (na, na, na na na)
I'll watch myself look out (na, na, na na na)
Look out for the bugman (na, na, na na na)
You go hang around, around (na, na, na na na)
I'll watch myself hang on (na, na, na na na)
Look out for the b-b-b-bugman (na, na, na na na)
The b-b-b-bugman
The b-b-b-bugman
The b-b-b-bugman
Oh bugman!
I go out in the city
I stay away from the bugs
Oh yeah

Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
I go out in the city
Look out for the Bugman
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs
Stay away from the ooh-ooh bugs

Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no
Na, na, na na na, oh, no

Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place
Space is the place6Embed
