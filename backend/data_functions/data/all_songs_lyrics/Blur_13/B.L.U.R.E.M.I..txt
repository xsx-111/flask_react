B.L.U.R.E.M.I. Lyrics
Groups using a loop
Of another pop group
Group shooting a hoop
And throwing it up in to the soup
I said I'm regular features
And Adidas trainers
Completing the cycle
Until the teenage maniacs
They bring it all back

B L U R E M I
B L U R E M I
B L U R E M I
B L U R E M I

Groups using a loop
Of another pop group
Completing the cycle
Until the teenage maniacs
They bring it all back
Chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-cupacha
(They bring it all back)
Chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-cupacha
(They bring it all back)
Chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-cupacha
(They bring it all back)
Chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-chuppa-cupacha
(They're bringing it all back)
