Hair of the Dog Lyrics
Heartbreaker... Soulshaker!
I've been told about you...
Steamroller, Midnight Shoulder...
What they've been sayin must be true...
Red Hot Mama
Velvet Charmer
'Times come to pay your dues...

Now you're messin' with...
A son of bitch!
(Now You're messin' with a son of bitch)

Talkin' jivey poison ivy...
You ain't gonna cling to me...
Mantaker...Born Faker...
I ain't so blind I can't see...
Red Hot Mama
Velvet Charmer
The time's come to pay your dues...
