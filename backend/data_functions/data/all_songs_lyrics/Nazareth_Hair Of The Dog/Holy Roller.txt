Holy Roller LyricsHoly Roller, lookin' down
Where you think you know
All the answers
Arrogance and pride are sin
Better look to your own chances
Holy Roller, can you save your own soul?
Can you save your own soul
Holy Roller
Standin' up for Jesus
That's your thing
But you're standin' on people's hearts
Charity is a virtue
To be praised
Better get back on Jesus' track
Holy Roller, can you save your own soul?
Can you save your own soul
Holy Roller
Holy Roller, practice what you preach
Heaven is still within your reach
Holy Roller, don't you judge
What you think is going wrong
Holy Roller, can you save your own soul?
Can you save your own soul
Holy Roller
Holy Roller, can you save your own soul?
Can you save your own soul
