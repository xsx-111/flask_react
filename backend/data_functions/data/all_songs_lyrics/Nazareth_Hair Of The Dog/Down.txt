Down LyricsAnother bridge I have burned
A lesson I learned
One more mistake to my cause
One more hand got lost
In a game
So I was up for awhile
Livin' in style
Feelin' high on the hog
And people just don't wanna know
I was down
Now some say I lost
His other soul
How barely a young man
Can sink so low
And I don't know... don't care at all
I had a similar dream
All of my dreams
I can't get through for a while
I thought I had wandered a mile
I was wrong
Now I'm on the way up
When you reach the top
It's no way, no way to go
And people just don't wanna know
When you're down
Now some say I lost
His other soul
How barely a young man
Can sink so low
And I don't know... don't care at allEmbed
