Miss Misery LyricsSince you came into my life
It's the same old situation
Empty days and lonely nights
Filled with bitterness and frustration
Walking lonely in the cold
Trying to find the answer
Spend my money on a crystal ball
And the charms of a gypsy dancer
Trying to break the spell you hold on me
Chorus:
You're miss misery
That song you lay on me
Set me free, set me free
Please, please, please
Every day is filled with shame
My nights are filled with anger
Hollow lies, forced denial
If you told the truth I can't remember
You know, I've got to find my way
Got to find a reason
Got to find your weakness
So I can end your witchin' season
Got to break this spell you hold on me
Chorus:
Lead
Can't think how I got myself
Caught up in this nightmare
Evil schemes, midnight screams
Come on somebody listen to my prayer
I'd give all I've got to give
Just to find my way out
Got it goin' but I can't let go
I'm trapped on this crazy roundabout
Tryin' to break this spell you hold on me
