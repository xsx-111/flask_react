Beggar Lyrics
She's fast asleep at Woden's feet
Whilst alms I seek from thronging fairfolk
As a whelp fast to the teat
She smote me then
We've ever since been shadows
Two beasts of one old soul

If you rely on the kindness of strangers
It helps to have a hound for a handmaid
Not only for the superior nose
Or companionship
Often people stop to talk with me
Having never seen before such a very beautiful snow-coloured collie

Working the fell - a most powerful eye
Part of the grass, fast as a lightning
Before the children were grown
They'd ride her like a pony
Through the nodding banners yesterday
She went in chase of a ship's rat
At my wit's end I finally located her
Under a whining bush, my poor old lady, seized by a fit
When the raiders came in their flaming carriages
She went running to her family
While I listened on, cowering behind a pile of logs
There's no denying it
I sold my shoes so I could buy a chicken
A penance and a treat on her final day
Now she is gone I carry her down to the sea
And scream to the sinking stars
"Can you ever forgive me?"Embed
