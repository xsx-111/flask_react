Soldier Lyrics
Here we are at the Fortress of Long Wings
My fellows bristling with anticipation
At slurp among their supperbowls
A map of steam in the rafters overhead
Shovelling it in
I don't taste a thing
Only a memory of
Kisses spilled upon my chin

I am tired
I am afraid
My heart is full of dread
I am tired
And I am afraid
My heart is full of dread

Even now on the evening of battle
I'm clammy with doubt of love
I'm really scared of going
How I yearn to hold you once again
In the morning we
March across the sea
To the sunken monastery
To face our faceless enemy
I am tired
I am afraid
My heart is full of dread
I am tired
I am afraid
My heart is full of dread

The rolling fields grow dark as the grave
And I am running for my life
Avowed to never draw another blade
I'll be back home just as soon as I can
Let's betroth without delay
Pack the horse and ride away
Find some better place where
We might raise a family

My heart is full of hope
I am tired
And I am afraid
My heart is full of hope1Embed
