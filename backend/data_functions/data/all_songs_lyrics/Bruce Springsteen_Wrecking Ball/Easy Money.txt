Easy Money Lyrics
You put on your coat, I’ll put on my hat
You put out the dog, I’ll put out the cat
You put on your red dress for me tonight honey
We’re going on the town now
Looking for easy money

There’s nothing to it mister
You won’t hear a sound
When your whole world comes tumbling down
And all them fat cats, they’ll just think it’s funny
I’m going on the town now, looking for easy money
I got a Smith & Wesson 38
I got a hell fire burning and I got me a date
Got me a date on the far shore
Where it’s bright and sunny
I’m going on the town tonight, looking for easy money

You put on your coat, I’ll put on my hat
You put out the dog, I’ll put out the cat
You put on your red dress for me tonight honey
We’re going on the town now
Looking for easy moneyEmbed
