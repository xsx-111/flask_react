Wrecking Ball LyricsI was raised outta steel
Here in the swamps of Jersey
Some misty years ago
Through the mud and the beer
The blood and the cheers
I’ve seen champions come and go
So if you’ve got the guts mister
Yeah, if you got the balls
If you think it’s your time
Then step to the line
And bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
C’mon and take your best shot
Let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball
Now, my home’s here in these meadowlands
Where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes
Here where the blood is spilled
The arena’s filled and giants played their games
So raise up your glasses
And let me hear your voices call
’Cause tonight all the dead are here
So bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
C’mon and take your best shot
Let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball
Yeah, we know that come tomorrow
None of this will be here
So hold tight to your anger
Hold tight to your anger
Hold tight to your anger
And don’t fall to your fears
Now, when all this steel and these stories
Drift away to rust
And all our youth and beauty
Has been given to the dust
When the game has been decided
And we're burnin’ down the clock
And all our little victories and glories
Have turned into parking lots
When your best hopes and desires
Are scattered to the wind
And hard times come and hard times go and
Hard times come and hard times go and
Hard times come and hard times go and
Hard times come and hard times go and
Hard times come and hard times go
Yeah, just to come again
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
C’mon and take your best shot
Let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
Bring on your wrecking ball
C’mon and take your best shot
Let me see what you got
Bring on your wrecking ball2Embed
