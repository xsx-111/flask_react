Death to My Hometown Lyrics
Well, no cannonball did fly, no rifles cut us down
No bombs fell from the sky, no blood soaked the ground
No powder flash blinded the eye
No deathly thunder sounded

But just as sure as the hand of God
They brought death to my hometown
They brought death to my hometown, boy

Now, no shells ripped the evening sky, no cities burning down
No army stormed the shores for which we’d die
No dictators were crowned
I awoke on a quiet night, I never heard a sound

The marauders raided in the dark
They brought death to my hometown, boys
Death to my hometown

They destroyed our families, factories
And they took our homes
They left our bodies on the plains
The vultures picked our bones
So listen up, my sonny boy, be ready when they come
For they’ll be returning sure as the rising sun
Now get yourself a song to sing and sing it till you’re done
Sing it hard and sing it well
Send the robber barons straight to hell
The greedy thieves who came around
And ate the flesh of everything they found
Whose crimes have gone unpunished now
Who walk the streets as free men now
They brought death to our hometown, boys
Death to our hometown, boys
Death to our hometown, boys
Death to our hometown2Embed
