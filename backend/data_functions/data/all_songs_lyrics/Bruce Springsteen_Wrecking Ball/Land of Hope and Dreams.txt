Land of Hope and Dreams Lyrics
(Whoa, whoa-whoa, this train)
(I'm ridin' this train)
(Don't you wanna ride)
(This train, this train)
(This train, this train)
(Whoa-whoa, get on, get on, get on, get on, get on)

Grab your ticket and your suitcase
Thunder’s rolling down this track
Well, you don’t know where you’re going now
But you know you won’t be back
Well, darling if you’re weary
Lay your head upon my chest
We’ll take what we can carry
Yeah, and we’ll leave the rest

Well, big wheels roll through fields where sunlight streams
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams

Well, I will provide for you
And I'll stand by your side
You'll need a good companion now
For this part of the ride
Yeah, leave behind your sorrows
Let this day be the last
Well, tomorrow there'll be sunshine
And all this darkness past
Well, big wheels roll through fields where sunlight streams
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams

This train carries saints and sinners
This train carries losers and winners
This train carries whores and gamblers
This train carries lost souls
I said this train, dreams will not be thwarted
This train, faith will be rewarded
This train, hear the steel wheels singing
This train, bells of freedom ringing

Yes, this train carries saints and sinners
This train carries losers and winners
This train carries whores and gamblers
This train carries lost souls
I said, this train carries broken-hearted
This train, thieves and sweet souls departed
This train carries fools and kings thrown
This train, all aboard
I said, now this train, dreams will not be thwarted
This train, faith will be rewarded
This train, the steel wheels singing
This train, bells of freedom ringing
Come on this train
People get ready
You don't need no ticket
All you gotta do is
Just get onboard
Onboard this train (This train, now)

People get ready
You don't need no ticket (Oh now, no, you don't)
You don't need no ticket
You just get onboard (People get ready)
You just thank the Lord (People get ready)
You just thank the Lord (People get ready)
You just thank the Lord (People get ready)
(Come on this train, people get ready)
(Come on this train, people get ready)Embed
