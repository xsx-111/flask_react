The Damage in Your Heart Lyrics
One more time, I have crossed the line
Now, you won't be mine anymore
One more dream vanished up in smoke
Now, I have no hope anymore

Let it go, the damage in your heart
Let it go, the damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

One more tear falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much to the world
One more loss in a losing life
Doesn't hurt so bad anymore

Let it go, the damage in your heart
Let it go, the damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

One more tear falling down your face
Doesn't mean that much to the world

Let it go, the damage in your heart
Let it go, the damage in your heart
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel
I can't tell you how the words have made me feel

I can't tell you, I can't tell you
I can't tell you how the words have made me feelEmbed
