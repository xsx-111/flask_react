Haunt You Every Day Lyrics
I don't feel the joy
I don't feel the pain
You were just a toy
I am just insane
Walking on my own
Leaving you behind
You were crying out
That you need to speak your mind

Oh, so alone in love
So alone in love
I'm going to haunt you everyday
Haunt you everyday

I am gonna kill
When I need a thrill
Eating at the heart
Until I've had my fill
When will stupid learn?
Fires gonna burn
Think of consequence
Then you move when it's your turn
Oh, so alone in love
So alone in love
I'm going to haunt you everyday
Haunt you everyday


Walking on my own
Leaving you behind
You are crying out
That you need to speak your mind

Oh, so alone in love
So alone in love
I'm going to haunt you everyday
Haunt you everyday

Haunt you everyday
Haunt you everyday1Embed
