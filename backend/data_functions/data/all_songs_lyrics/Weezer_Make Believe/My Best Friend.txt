My Best Friend Lyrics
When everything is wrong, I'll come talk to you
You make things alright when I'm feeling blue
You are such a blessing and I won't be messing
With the one thing that brings light to all my darkness

You're my best friend
And I love you (Love you)
And I love you (Love you)
Yes, I do

There is no other one who can take your place
I feel happy inside when I see your face
I hope you believe me
Because, I speak sincerely
And I mean it when I tell you that I need you

You're my best friend
And I love you (Love you)
And I love you (Love you)
Yes, I do

I'm here right beside you
I will never leave you
And I feel the pain you feel when you start crying

You're my best friend
And I love you (Love you)
And I love you (Love you)
Yes, I do
You're my best friend
And I love you (Love you)
And I love you (Love you)
Yes, I do

Yes, I do
Yes, I do8Embed
