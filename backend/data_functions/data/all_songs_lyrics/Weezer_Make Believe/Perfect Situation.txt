Perfect Situation Lyrics
What's the deal with my brain? Why am I so obviously insane?
In a perfect situation, I let love down the drain
There's the pitch, slow and straight, all I have to do is swing
And I'm a hero, but I'm a zero
Hungry nights, once again, how it's getting unbelievable
Cause I could not have it better, but I just can't get no play
From the girls, all around as they search the night for
Someone to hold onto and I just pass through

Singing, oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa
Singing, oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa

Get your hands off the girl, can't you see that she belongs to me?
And I don't appreciate this excess company
Though, I can't satisfy all the needs she has
And so she starts to wander, can you blame her?

Singing, oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa
Singing, oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa

Tell me there's a logic out there, leading me to better prepare
For the day that something really special might come
Tell me there's some hope for me, I don't wanna be lonely
For the rest of my days on the earth, oh!

Oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa
Singing, oohh-ho, oohh-ho, oohh-ho-whoa
Singing, oohhh-hoohh, oh, whoa, whoa
Oh, whoaaaa

(Perfect situation) Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
(Perfect situation) Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah
