We Are All On Drugs Lyrics
When you're out with your friends in your new Mercedes-Benz
And you're on drugs
And you show up late for school 'cause you think you're really cool
When you're on drugs
And you put on your headphones and you step into the zone
When you're on drugs
But the world don't care if you are or are not there
'Cause you're on drugs

Give it to me, we are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff, whoo!

And you twitch in your seat 'cause you wanna hit the street
When you're on drugs
And you cause such a fuss, 'cause there's no one you can trust
When you're on drugs
And the best of your days will all vanish in the haze
When you're on drugs
And you wish you could quit 'cause you're really sick of it
But you're on drugs
Give it to me, we are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff, whoo!

I want to reach a higher place
Where things will never be the same


Give it to me, we are all on drugs, yeah
Never gettin' enough (Never gettin' enough)
We are all on drugs, yeah
Give me some of that stuff, whoo!

We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)
We are all on drugs (We are all on drugs)9Embed
