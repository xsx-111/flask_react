This is Such a Pity Lyrics
How is your heart, little darling? I didn't mean to get so mad
Let me just hold you closely, how did things get so bad?

I know how to pick on you, you pushed me over the edge
We caused so much agony, we can't seem to move ahead

This is such a pity, we should give all our love to each other
Not this hate that destroys us (Destroys us)
This is such a pity (This is a pity)

What kind of future will we have? Will we ever find peace?
Everybody thinks we're crazy, they're about to call the police

I don't want to be a chump, you think I'm a fascist pig
Right now, everything is black, I don't think we'll ever give

This is such a pity, we should give all our love to each other
Not this hate that destroys us (Destroys us)
This is such a pity (This is a pity)

This is such a pity, we should give all our love to each other
Not this hate that destroys us (Destroys us)
This is such a pity (This is a pity)
This is such a pity, we should give

We should give, all our love (Destroys us)
All our love (Destroys us), all our love (Destroys us)
All our love (Destroys us), all our love (Destroys us)
All our love... (Destroys us...)3Embed
