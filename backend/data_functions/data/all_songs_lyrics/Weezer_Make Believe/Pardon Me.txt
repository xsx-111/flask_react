Pardon Me Lyrics
I tried my best, I gave my all
Sometimes my best wasn't good enough for you
Sometimes I let you go
Sometimes I hurt you so
I know that I can be the meanest person in the world

So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me, my friend

I never thought that anyone
Was more important than the plans I made
But now I feel the shame
There's no one else to blame
For all the broken hearts are scattered on the field of war

So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me, my friend

Sometimes I let you go
Sometimes I hurt you so
I know that I can be the meanest person in the world

So I apologize to you
And to anyone else that I hurt too
I may not be a perfect soul
But I can learn self-control
And in my heart, I feel it's true
So I will be there with you
So pardon me, pardon me
Pardon me, my friend
(I really want a friend)
Pardon me, my friend
(I really want a friend)
Pardon me, my friend
(I really want a friend)1Embed
