The Other Way Lyrics
I want to help you
But I don't know how
I want to soothe you
But I can't speak out

I have many fears about rejection
I have many memories of pain
I have always been a little shy
So I'll turn and look the other way

Other way, other way
I will turn and look the other way

I want to hold you
But I am afraid
I want to touch you
But I'm not that way

I have many doubts about my motives
I have many fears about my greed
I have always hurt the one that I love
So I'll turn and look the other way
Other way, other way
I will turn and look the other way


I have many doubts about my motives
I have many fears about my greed
I have always hurt the one that I love
So I'll turn and look the other way

Other way, other way
I will turn and look the other way
Other way, other way
I will turn and look the other way
Other way, other way
I will turn and look the other way

(Other way) The other way
(Other way) The other way
(Other way) The other way
(Other way) The other way3Embed
