Too Young to Know Lyrics
Well, I've stuck out in your street
And I'm lookin' for some kind of halo
When somebody says to me, hey boy
She's too young to know no

Well, I didn't make your time
I never said you were mine
Don't you think it would show so I
Guess I'll have to teach you rock n' roll

Met you outside school
When sure no one was lookin'
And your teacher looks at me
All his envy growin'

Well, I didn't make your time
I never said you were mine
Don't you think it would show so I
Guess I'll have to teach you rock n' roll

I said, take it easy baby
You sure know what's showin'
And I can't help myself
Without your friends all knowin'

Well, I didn't make your time
I never said you were mine
Don't you think it would show so I
Guess I'll have to teach you rock n' roll

Well, I didn't make your time
I never said you were mine
Don't you think it would show so I
Guess I'll have to teach you rock n' roll
You got a long, long way to goEmbed
