Oh My Lyrics
Well, I'm struttin' up and down tryin' to get my face in town
Wonderin' whether hang on or turn next time around
Look in your mirror just to see my face
Two way time, baby, it's no disgrace

Oh my, oh how the times have changed
Oh my, oh how the times have changed

Ladies used to dancin' but I move for real
Lookin' for reaction, something you can feel
When you dance I move and they look me in the eye
Two way time, baby, it's no lie

Oh my, oh how the times have changed
Oh my, oh how the times have changed


Oh my, oh how the times have changed
Oh my, oh how the times have changed
Oh my, oh how the times have changed
Oh my, oh how the times have changed
Oh my, oh how the times have changedEmbed
