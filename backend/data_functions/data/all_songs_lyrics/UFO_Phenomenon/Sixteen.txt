Sixteen LyricsShe was a wild thing
In labeled fashioned blue jeans
Lookin' for some answers
Didn't follow the scenes
It don't take time when you're sixteen, babe
You don't count the shots
It don't take time when you're sixteen, babe
Just so I can howl
Got down on my knees, baby, babe
Just to give me advice
I got down on my knees, baby, babe
Just to give me advice
It don't take time when you're sixteen, babe
You don't count the shots
It don't take time when you're sixteen, babe
Just so I can howl
She was a wild thing
In labeled fashioned blue jeans
Lookin' for some answers
Didn't follow the scenes
It don't take time when you're sixteen, babe
You don't count the shots
It don't take time when you're sixteen, babe
And just so I can howlEmbed
