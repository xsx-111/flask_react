Sweet Little Thing LyricsJust down here said hello
Tell me are you trying to get on
I said, "Hey, now, honey, I don't need your money"
Want you to push me around
You know I looked you in the eye
Said, "Hey, baby, show me which way to go"
What I intend to do, don't you make a move
I got an interest in you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Caught me by the arm, held on tight
I said, "Hey what you trying to do?"
If I'm gonna make it, I'll make it with you
I got nothing to lose
Much too strong need a little help
When you can help yourself
What I intend to do, don't you make a move
I got an interest in you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Just down here, said hello
Tell me are you trying to get on
Said, "Hey, now honey, I don't need your money
Want you to push me around
You know I looked you in the eye
Said, "Hey, baby, show me which way to go"
What I intend to do, don't you make a move
I got an interest in you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know you know I need
Sweet little thing like you
Well, you know, you know I need
Sweet little thing, sweet little thing
Sweet little thing like youEmbed
