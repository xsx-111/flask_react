Crystal Light Lyrics
Standin' by the roadside, views are in my hands
Coat I'm wearing's blowing cold
Turn my back to the wind
Winter mist along the coast
City lights closed down
Your empty station there
Train line cuts the ground
Train line cuts the ground

Crystal light shinin' bright
Shine on down for me
Moon is even passin' by, tryin' not to see
Like a fool I hit that road, did my time at sea
Life was only foolin' me

Cold, crisp air, it burns my lungs
Find it hard to breath
The hospital shut their gate
I can't get me no peace
Weak-eyed people stand and scream
Stumble in the road
Close my eyes, turn off the lights
Timeless, found a dream
Timeless, found a dream
Crystal light shinin' bright
Shine on down for me
Moon is even passin' by, tryin' not to see
Like a fool I hit that road, did my time at sea
Life was only foolin' me


Crystal light shinin' bright
Shine on down for me
Moon is even passin' by, tryin' not to see
Like a fool I hit that road, did my time at sea
Life was only foolin' me1Embed
