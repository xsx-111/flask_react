Time on My Hands Lyrics
Long, long year I've sat in this place
Baby, baby, what's good I've had
When you don't know where I wanna go
Find a reason love's left me cold

I've got it, time on my hands
Been drinkin' with the sailor boy
Been tryin' hard to understand
Lines here in my hand

Left me hopin' the wild thoughts I had
My lost feelin' made me so sad
Tried so hard, the smile on my face
Can't get it back again, back home with you

I've got it, time on my hands
Been drinkin' with the sailor boy
Been tryin' hard to understand
Lines here in my hand

Long, long year I've sat in this place
Baby, baby, what's good I've had
When you don't know where I wanna go
Found a reason love's left me cold

Oh, I've got it, time on my hands
Been drinkin' with the sailor boy
Been tryin' hard to understand
Lines here in my hand

Aah feelin' blue again
Aah feelin' blue againEmbed
