Space Child Lyrics
Goin' through pages and lookin' down lines and lines
Space of your life is only passing you by

Space child ages as he turns and faces the lie
Then after laughter was caught in his throat as he died

Fly on homeward


Worlds spinnin' by makes clouds in your eye tonight
The space of your life is only passing you byEmbed
