The Question Is To See It All LyricsHe trades truths for answers
So they call him for the answers he gives
All the answers he gives
All the silences he quenches
Oh, he trades truths for answers
So they call him the man with the gift
All the doubts he forgives
Full realities left vacant
If the question is to see it all
Or decide there's nothing there
The question is to see it all
Or decide there's nothing there
He trades truths for answers
So they call him for the answers he gives
All the answers he gives
All the silences he quenches
He trades truths for answers
So they call him the man with the gift
All the doubts he forgives
Full realities left vacant
If the question is to see it all
Or decide there's nothing thereEmbed
