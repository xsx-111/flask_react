Spiral LyricsAnd if it went into a spiral
Regardless of direction
There I saw your face
Staring blankly at the door
And at yourself
And at the fake candles
You bought at the shop
Your name is on the letters
They left on the counter
Based on their colors
I opened them
Dear madam
Or sir
To whom it may concern
Dear madam
Or sir
To whom it may concern
I might be the wrong one
To open the doorEmbed
