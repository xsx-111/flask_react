Narrow Road LyricsInside of man
A narrow road
A single line
And everywhere
The meaning combination
Father, Heaven, come and see
The warning of illusion
Brother, lawless, cover me
Inside of man
A single line
The meaning combination
The warning of illusion
Narrow road!
Everywhere, my brother!
My Heaven! My sea!
