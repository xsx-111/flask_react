The Limit Lyrics
I'm turning around
No, I can't see the ground
Don't sow what you reap
Don't feel what you see
Submit to the pace
The waters erase
Nothing left to see
I'm you and you're me
Don't single it out
Don't simplify it
Don't kill what you know
Don't speak when you reach

The limit
The limit

Current with no direction
Current with no direction
The limit

I'm turning around
No, I can't see the ground
Don't sow what you reap
Don't feel what you see
Submit to the pace
The waters erase
Nothing left to see
I'm you and you're me
Don't single it out
Don't simplify it
Don't kill what you know
Don't speak when you reach
The limit

Yo, tan cerca del río
Tan cerca del río
Pero sin respirar
Sin respirarEmbed
