Liberty Bell LyricsSome of me could see they're coming too
The house of a sinner gone, now come here too
See me alive
Put me in the sinner world
You want seminal roads
That's for people I can't see
They only got a song
For that scene
Rippled over leaves
The worst of me gets on
Running around, give up, on a knee
Later on, on his own
Written in eternity but the color is wrong
And anyone can see
Written all along
Yes, everyone can see
Written all along
They're written on, on her finger
Like the liberty bell
Shining in the night
An arrow that I drew
And a jockey dressed in black
Blood on the racehorse
Tell when to place the show
Announcing my mistake
Announcing my mistake
These are the pivots on the guardsEmbed
