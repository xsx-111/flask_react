Only Young LyricsDreaming only young when you find an eye can see
I'm only ending here, but we will see each other, I know
I know, I know
I know, I know
And Apollo sees an early end
And a prophecy he knows that you're gone
Apollo says return to the sun
Apologies you're on your own
Apologies you're on your own
Take a seat on the table
Throw a stone on the ground
Like the veil of a fable
Though you're gone you're still around
Still around, still around
Still around, still around
Don't kill what you find
The problem solves itself in a stranger's house
On a hidden road
Thе problem solves itself in a strangеr's house
On a hidden road
And Apollo sees an early end
And a prophecy he knows that you're gone
Apollo says return to the sun
Apologies you're on your own
And Apollo sees an early end
And a prophecy he knows that you're gone
Apollo says return to the sunEmbed
