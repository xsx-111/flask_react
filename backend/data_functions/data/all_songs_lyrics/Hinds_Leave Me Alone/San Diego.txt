San Diego LyricsYou couldn't stay here one more night
So take me to the beach, alright
You're getting blinder taking drugs
We didn't even say goodbye
You are alone, I can see why
Cause home is my grave at night
So why don't you just take my hand?
Stay close to me or know I'll die!
I'm staying, I'm staying
I'm staying, I'm staying
You couldn't stay here one more night
So take me to the beach, alright
You're getting blinder taking drugs
We didn't even say goodbye
You are alone, I can see why
Cause home is my grave at night
So why don't you just take my hand?
Stay close to me or know I'll die!
I'm staying, I'm staying
I'm staying, I'm staying
You couldn't stay here one more night
So take me to the beach, alright
You're getting blinder taking drugs
We didn't even say goodbye
You are alone, I can see why
Cause home is my grave at night
So why don't you just take my hand?
Stay close to me or know I'll die!4Embed
