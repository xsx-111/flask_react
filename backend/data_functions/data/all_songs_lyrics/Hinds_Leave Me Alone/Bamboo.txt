Bamboo Lyrics
I want you to call me by my name when I am lying on your bed (By my name)
I pray you to stay away while I'm talking with your friends (Stay away)
I need you to be around my legs and stop complaining about the rain

And how could I show you without looking freaking mad
That I am not always gonna be around
And how could I show you without losing all our time
That I am not always gonna run behind
And why, (oh why?) you are on my mind

I need you to feel like a man when I give you all I am (Like a man)
I know you're not hungover today, you are classifying your cassettes (Your cassettes)
And hey you just can't share my mistakes oh man I'm trying all my best (All my best)

And how could I show you without looking freaking mad
That I am not always gonna be around
And how could I show you without loosing all our time
That I am not always gonna run behind
And why, (oh why?) you are on my mind

I want you to call me by my name when I am lying on your bed (By my name)
I need you to feel like a man when I give you all I am (Like a man)
I know you're not hungover today, you are classifying your cassettes (Your cassettes)
Yeah, I want you around my legs
Alright yeah, I want you around my legs
Yeah, would you hold me
Around, around my bed
Around, around my bed
Around my bed, you just stay around my bed4Embed
