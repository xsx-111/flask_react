Fat Calmed Kiddos Lyrics
Planes keep fallin'
Trees stop growing
And I was half inside
Lips still hurting and
My fish doesn't know it (but)
You slept here for the last night
Texting me while you were drunk (yeah)
Whatever makes you happy might be fine
But if you grab me one more time
Texting me while you were drunken
I'd rather be fast, I'd rather be fast
Whatever makes you happy might be fine

Why?
You're always on my mind
I needed to risk because I needed to try
Oh man
And I needed a breath 'cause you were out tonight
Am I a waste of time?
You're on my mind
I've seen you waving goodbye
I've seen you waving goodbye
But please don't leave me
I miss her in the night
High salt level
Cries for treble
And sailors started to shot
Fat calmed kiddos
Touching all your pillows (all your pillows)
You can't run, you can't hide
Saving you, my love, could work
(I) can't touch the mysticism of your lies
You're not supposed to catch the signs
Texting me while you were drunken
But I don't mind, I don't mind
Whatever makes you happy might be fine

Oh, why?
You're always on my mind
I needed to risk because I needed to try
Oh man
And I needed a breath 'cause you were out tonight
You got me where you want
You're on my mind
I've seen you waving goodbye
I've seen you waving goodbye
But if you think that I won't cry
I'm only saying
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave meEmbed
