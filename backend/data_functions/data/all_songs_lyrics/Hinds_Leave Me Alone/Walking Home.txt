Walking Home LyricsSorry, you're the one that I love
I can tell you that you're my favorite song
And darling, you're the map to my toe
You're never walking home alone
I'm using your tee as a pajama
Your coffee tastes better than mine
But I can't get enough of your time
(Get enough of your time)

It was dirty
I don't say it to be rude
I say it 'cause it was pure
I wanna keep all the strings
That you changed me
Don't get yourself bogged down
I'm working to make you feel proud
And darling, you're the rice of my bowl
You've defined everything I want
And honey, you're the lime of my coke
You're the reason that I'm coming home
And can't you see I even like
The way you hide your fantasies
You can't speak while I try
That's why I can't get enough
(Get enough of your time)

It was dirty
I don't say it to be rude
I say it 'cause it was pure
I wanna keep all the strings
That you changed me
Don't get yourself bogged down
I'm working to make you feel proud
(You) still wait for me to come
And if this were a price you'd be the winner
And if this were a film you'd be my star
And I really really really love your eyes9Embed
