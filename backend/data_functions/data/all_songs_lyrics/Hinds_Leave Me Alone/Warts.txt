Warts Lyrics
It just started like a friend thing
It just started with a joke
She's pretending to be witty
But you are laughing with a frown
She acts too crazy
Absurdly wild
Always ready for a winky
She always burns her warts

Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes
Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes

She's becoming black and agile
She's gonna bit you bad
You pretend you are resistant
But she's wiser than a cat
And you innocent tender
But she's not a lover mind
She has more names to moan
But you only hear, ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes
Don't let her waste your smile
Don't let her curse your eyes

Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-ba2Embed
