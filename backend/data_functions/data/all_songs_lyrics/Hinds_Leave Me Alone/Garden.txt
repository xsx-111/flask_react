Garden LyricsHow many secrets you have that keep you smiling that way?
You better start to behave
And how many scars you don’t share, and why do I care?
Still, I can smell that something failed
And you robbed that map just to run away, and that car but “don’t turn off the lights yet”? you know that you’re afraid

And I feel like I’m freezing again
You won’t say you’re bored anymore
‘Cause I can take you dancing
Use me to feel home
It’s the same old story of the bad boy
Give me the keys and I’ll..
How many times did you come until I found you in this dirty spot, in this random place?
I can tell - I can tell that something failed
Give me the money, show me the game
Show me the rules again, because I’ll play it, I’ll play it, I’ll take it now

And I feel like I’m freezing again
You won’t say you’re bored any more
'Cause i can take you dancing
Use me to feel home
It’s the same old story of the bad boy
Give me the keys and I’ll show you how to fight for more3Embed
