And I Will Send Your Flowers Back LyricsSpace hit me in your face
I haven't counted to five
It doesn't mean I'm happy to go (away)
Space in decrease in my chest
We have three more nights
They're winning the ride
Their magnet is sharp
My crash has arrived
Honey
This is what we both were looking for, babe
I sadly found your gap in my chest
I finally know how I'm feeling after
Instead of move on, I'll search for your soul
It doesn't mean I'm happy to go away
Space, fucked up mess
We have two more nights
They're winning the ride
Their magnet is sharp
My crash has arrived
Space, what a fucked up mess
I haven't counted to five
(you haven't counted to five)
It doesn't mean I'm happy to stay
'Cause honey
This is what we both were looking for, babe
I sadly found your gap in my chest
I finally know how I'm feeling after
Instead of move on, I'll search for your soul
It doesn't mean I'm happy to go away
And I will send your flowers back
What goes around, comes around
What a fucked up mess
I haven't counted to five
(you haven't counted to five)
It doesn't mean I'm happy to stay
'Cause honey
This is what we both were looking for, babe
I sadly found your gap in my chest
I finally know how I'm feeling after
Instead of move on, I'll search for your soul
It doesn't mean I'm happy to go away
And I will send your flowers back
And I will send your flowers back
What goes around, comes around7Embed
