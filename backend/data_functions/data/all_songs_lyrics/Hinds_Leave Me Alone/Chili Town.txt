Chili Town LyricsI am touching without hands
Because you're deaf and blind
Don't try to reach my mind
Collecting my fake card
You're out of town, man!
I am swimming in the dark
Cause all your friends are sharks
Keep fighting for your truth, amazing feelings juice
You chose the wrong side!
All I'm asking for is you to make a move
All that I'm asking for is you to make a move!
I am stealing your cigars
Just cause they’re closer than mine
You’re having too much light
You’re missing panties’ clime
You’re in my hands now
I am flirting with this guy
So you can watch my crimes
Saliva mixed with ice
Your hat is oversized
You had a long night!
All I'm asking for is you to make a move
All that I'm asking for is you to make a move!
I am touching without hands, because your skin looks shy
Don’t try to reach my mind, you’re way too big inside
Come back to town, man!
I am flirting with this guy
Just to pretend I’m fine
Saliva mixed with lies my laugh is oversized
Forever yours, right?3Embed
