The Pelican Lyrics
Take it when I'm not looking!
Take it from my hook while it's still kicking!
Don't you feel it when I start reeling?
I guess some things never change
And I still hold the reins on what you're feeling
What you're feeling

Take it when, I'm enjoying!
Take it from my mouth while I'm still chewing!
Don't you feel it when I start pulling back?
I guess some birds never learn
One day these tides will turn and leave you nothing
Leave you nothing
"Okay!"

We're forced to lock our horns up
In some epic clash that we can't finish
On our own we'll have to settle
Swallow pride and hold our heads up high

Stake it when you feel threatened!
Stake your claim on land already taken!
Don't you feel it when I start throwing stones?
I guess some birds never learn
One day these tides will turn and leave you nothing
Leave you nothing
Take it!1Embed
