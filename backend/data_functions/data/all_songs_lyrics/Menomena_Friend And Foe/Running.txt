Running LyricsIt's safe to say
I'm walking a lot
It's safe to say
I'm thinner
It's safe to say
If we don't find food soon
We won't make it
Through winter
I'm walking
Now running
I'm picking up steam
I'm threatening
To expire
I'm going to make it
We're going to make it
Before the cows come home
Before the cows come home
Before the cows come home
It's safe to say
I'm walking a lot
It's safe to say
I'm thinner
It's safe to say
If we don't find food soon
We won't make it
Through winterEmbed
