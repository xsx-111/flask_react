West LyricsFace down in the chemistry
And silent sound
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
Face down in the chemistry
And silent sound
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
This bird is old and fat
It's sold its soul
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
(Chosen )
Between the skin and bone
Is where the west was won
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
Between the skin and bone
Is where the west was won
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
Swallowing all the bulls
By the horns
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
I would never have gone
(Honey, this will be your future)
Honey, this will be the future
You should care enough
To carve your heart into a tree
Initial it with someone special
Honey, this will be the future
You should care enough
To carve your heart into a tree
Initial it with someone
Honey, this will be the future
You should care enough
To carve your heart into a tree
Initial it with someone special
Someone specialEmbed
