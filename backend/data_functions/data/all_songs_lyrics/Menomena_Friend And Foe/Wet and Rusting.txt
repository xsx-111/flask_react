Wet and Rusting LyricsI made you a present, you'll never expect it
And when you unravel, the secret will travel
It's hard to take risks with a pessimist
I hope that this shaking will help us awaken
Separated by skin 'til we let ourselves in
It's hard to take risks, with a pessimist
It's hard to take risks
I hope one will burn me, I know you'll desert me
(This is the closest I'll come to touching you the way I want)
The hope can be painful, I'll try to be faithful
(It's hard to take risks, with a pessimist)
The hope can be painful, I'll try to be faithful
(It's hard to take risks, with a pessimist)
The hope can be painful, I'll try to be faithful
(It's hard to take risks, you're a pessimist)
(This is the closest I'll come to touching you)5Embed
