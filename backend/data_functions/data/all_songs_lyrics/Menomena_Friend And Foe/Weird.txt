Weird LyricsSay it again!
Say it again!
I know you love to
Hear yourself speak
Words that you think
I can't follow
And maybe that's the way
You and I will always relate
You always had
The quickest wit
The quickest quips
And I can't keep up
It's clear that you have
A rare gift of gab
And I'm just jealous
Maybe that's the way
You and I will always relate
But I won't let
How I sincerely
Feel, dear
Stand in my way
Cause there's
No love lost
That I can't
Find again
My dear friend
You always said that we're friends
But that must depend
Which way the wind blows
It's clear that you have
Your own set of plans
And I just follow
Maybe that's the way
You and I will always relate
So I won't let
How I sincerely
Feel here
Stand in my way
Cause there's
No love lost
That I can't
Find again
My dear friendEmbed
