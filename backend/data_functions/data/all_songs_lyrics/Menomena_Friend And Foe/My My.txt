My My LyricsWhat if all my enemies were dead
And I could forget everything they said
Could I be then who I really am?
What if I sold everything I own
And ran away from everyone I know
Could I make another place my home?
And if I let go all of my ghosts
Who would I dote over the most?
What if everyone is right?
Should've taken their advice
But I can't change my mind
If I let go all of my ghosts
(What if everybody else is right?)
Who would I dote over the most?
(Should've taken more of their advice)
If I let go all of my ghosts
(If I let go all of my ghosts)
Who would I dote over the most?
(Who would I dote?)1Embed
