Rotten Hell LyricsI've got a stranglehold on this decision
All those opposed can rot in hell
Any day now, the words will form a sentence
You'll be reduced to nothingness
I've got a stranglehold on this decision
All those opposed can rot in hell

Wading through this mess together
Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder
Some may stumble, some may fall behind
Wading through this mess together
Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder
Some may stumble, some may fall behind
(Some may stumble, some may fall behind)
Some may stumble, some may fall behind
Well it's high time we stepped outside
Drop the gloves and settle this like a man
Well, we might stall and hem and haw
We might not fight, but we won't walk away
No, we won't walk away
(Wading through this mess together
Hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder
Some may stumble, some may fall behind)Embed
