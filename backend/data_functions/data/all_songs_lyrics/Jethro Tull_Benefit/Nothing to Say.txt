Nothing to Say LyricsEvery day there's someone asking
"What is there to do?
Should I love or should I fight?
Is it all the same to you?"
"No," I say, "I have the answer
Proven to be true
But if I were to share it with you
You would stand to gain and I to lose."
Oh, I couldn't bear it, so I've got nothing to say
Nothing to say, nothing to say
Every morning pressure forming all around my eyes
Ceilings crash the walls collapse broken by the lies
That your misfortune brought upon us
And I won't disguise them
So don't ask me will I explain
I won't even begin to tell you why
No, just because I have a name well I've got nothing to say
Nothing to say, nothing to say
Climb a tower of freedom paint your own deceiving sign
It's not my part to criticize or to ask you to be blind
To your own pressing problem and the  you must unwind
And ask of me no answer there is none that I could give you wouldn't find
I went your way ten years ago and I've got nothing to say
Nothing to say, nothing to say
Nothing, nothing to say
Nothing, nothing to say
Nothing, nothing to say, nothing to say
Nothing, nothing to say, nothing to say
Nothing, nothing to sayEmbed
