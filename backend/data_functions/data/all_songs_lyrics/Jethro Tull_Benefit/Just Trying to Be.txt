Just Trying to Be LyricsThere was a time when you were so young and walked in their way
They made you feel they loved you all-seeing they say
You're going wrong if their game you don't play
And that the song I sing will lead you astray
Unfeeling, feel lonely rejection
Unknowing, know you're going wrong
And they can't see that we're just trying to be
And not what we seem
And even now believe that it's not real and only a dreamEmbed
