To Cry You a Song LyricsFlying so high, trying to remember
How many cigarettes did I bring along?
When I get down I'll jump in a taxi cab
Driving through London town
To cry you a song
It's been a long time
Still shaking my wings
Well, I'm a glad bird
I got changes to ring
Closing my dream inside its paper-bag
Thought I saw angels
But I could have been wrong
Search in my case
Can't find what they're looking for
Waving me through
To cry you a song
It's been a long time
Still shaking my wings
Well I'm a glad bird
I got changes to ring
Lights in the street
Peeping through curtains drawn
Rattling of safety chain taking too long
The smile in your eyes
Was never so sweet before
Came down from the skies
To cry you a songEmbed
