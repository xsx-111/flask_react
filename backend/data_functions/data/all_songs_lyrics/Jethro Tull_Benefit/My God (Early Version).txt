My God (Early Version) Lyrics
Unwind that string! There's a string that went ba-doi-oi-oi-oinnng!  You know, at the end?  Shit!  Take 2 ... or is it 122? There you go
People what have you done?
Locked Him in His golden cage
Golden cage
Made Him bend to your religion
Him resurrected from the grave
From the grave
He is the God of nothing
Which is all that you can see
You are the God of everything
Since Heâ€™s inside you and me
So lean upon Him gently
And don't call on Him to save
Call on him to save
You from your social graces
And the sins you wished to waive
You wished to waive
The Jewish Christian Muslim
Is waiting to be free
Each claiming just a part of Him
Also a part of me
And the graven image Catholic
With his plastic crucifix
You get it fixed
Confusing me as to who and where and why
As to how he gets his kicks
He gets his kicks
Confessing to the endless sin
With endless whining sounds
You'll be praying 'til next Thursday
To all the gods that you can countEmbed
