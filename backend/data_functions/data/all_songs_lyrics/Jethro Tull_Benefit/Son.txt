Son LyricsOh, I feel sympathy. Be grateful my son for what you get
Expression and passion. Ten days for watching the sunset;
When I was your age amusement we made for ourselves
"Permission to breathe sir". Don't talk like that, I'm your old man
They'll soon be demobbed son, so join up as soon as you can
You can't borrow that 'cause that's for the races and doesn't grow on trees
I only feel what touches me
And feel in touching I can see
A better state to be in
Who has the right
To question what I might do
In feeling I should touch the real
And only things I feel
It's advice and it's nice to know when you're best advised
You're only turned thirty, so son, you'd better apologize
And when you grow up, if you're good we will buy you a bikeEmbed
