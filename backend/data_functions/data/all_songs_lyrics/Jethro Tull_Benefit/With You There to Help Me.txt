With You There to Help Me LyricsIn days of peace
Sweet smelling summer nights
Of wine and song
Dusty pavements, burning feet
Why am I crying, I want to know
How can I smile and make it right
For sixty days and eighty nights
And not give in and lose the fight
I'm going back to the ones that I know
With whom I can be what I want to be
Just one week for the feeling to go
And with you there to help me
Then it probably will
I won't go down
Acting the same old play
Give sixty days for just one night
Don't think I'd make it, but then I might
I'm going back to the ones that I know
With whom I can be what I want to be
Just one week for the feeling to go
And with you there to help me
Then it probably willEmbed
