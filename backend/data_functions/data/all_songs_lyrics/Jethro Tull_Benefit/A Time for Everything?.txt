A Time for Everything? LyricsOnce it seemed there would always be
A time for everything
Ages passed I knew at last
My life had never been
I'd been missing what time could bring
Fifty years and I'm filled with tears and joys
I never cried
Burn the wagon and chain the mule
The past is all denied
There's no time for everything
No time for everythingEmbed
