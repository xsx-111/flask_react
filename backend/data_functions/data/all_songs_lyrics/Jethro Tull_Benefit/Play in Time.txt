Play in Time LyricsGot to take in what I can
There is no time to do what must be done
While I do some thinking
Sleeping is hard to come by
So we'll all sit down and try to play in time
And we feel like singing
Talking to people in my way
Blues were my favorite colour
Til I looked around and found another song
That I felt like singing
Trying so hard to reach you;
Playing what must be played, what must be sung
And it's what I'm singing
Talking to people in my wayEmbed
