Inside LyricsAll the places I've been make it hard to begin
To enjoy life again on the inside, but I mean to
Take a walk around the block
And be glad that I've got
Me some time to be in from the outside
And inside with you
I'm sitting on the corner feeling glad
Got no money coming in but I can't be sad
That was the best cup of coffee I ever had
And I won't worry about a thing because we've got it made
Here on the inside, outside so far away
And we'll laugh and we'll sing
Get someone to bring
Our friends here for tea in the evening
Old Jeffrey makes three...
Take a walk in the park
Does the wind in the dark
Sound like music to you?
Well I'm thinking it does to me
Can you cook, can you sew?
Well, I don't want to know
That is not what you need on the inside
To make the time go
Counting lambs, counting sheep
We will fall into sleep
And awake to a new day of living
And loving you soEmbed
