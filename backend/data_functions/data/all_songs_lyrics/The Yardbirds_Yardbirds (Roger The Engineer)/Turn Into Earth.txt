Turn Into Earth LyricsAh-ah-ah...
How your restless hungry eyes
Speak of cloudy summer skies
The morning dew
Turns into rain
Lonely winds will call my name
Dying leaves of seasons brown
Losing life as they drift down
Too soon in life
Return to earth
Only they can know their worth
Distant dreams of things to be
Wandering thoughts that can't be free
I feel my mind
Turning away
To the darkness of my dayEmbed
