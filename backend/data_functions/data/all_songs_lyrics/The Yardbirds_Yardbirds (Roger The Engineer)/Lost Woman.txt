Lost Woman LyricsDon't know where to run to
Don't know where to hide
See my future coming
Like the rising of the tide
But I lost you
Lost you woman
The only woman
Woman who was my kind
Made me lose my money
You made me lose my mind
It's people like you, baby
Going to rule mankind
But I lost you
Lost you woman
The only woman
Woman who was my kind
But if you come back
I won't be the same
What you did to me
You can hardly call humane
But I lost you
But I still love you
The only woman
Woman who was my kindEmbed
