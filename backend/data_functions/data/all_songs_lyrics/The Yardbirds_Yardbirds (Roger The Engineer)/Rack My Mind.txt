Rack My Mind LyricsBaby I got a problem
Don't know what to do
Baby I got a problem
I don't know what to do
Can't find the words to describe you, woman
None I got will do
I gonna search a dictionary
I find new words to use
Gonna search a dictionary
Find new words to use
Woman you defy me
Ain't no words to choose
Baby I'm rackin' my mind
Baby I'm rackin' my mind
Now I can't ( ?)
Baby rackin' my mind
I can't find
Any words
Tell me woman
Got a hold on my mind
My, my, my, my, my, mind
You sure are the strangest kind
Got no words for you baby
Ain't no words I can find
Now I know what to call you
Know what to call you, baby
I know what to call you
Know what to call you
You're the world's worst woman
The devil ever made
Now I know you baby
Now I know you girl
Now I know you baby
(You find some other guy ?)
I know baby
I sure raise my eyeEmbed
