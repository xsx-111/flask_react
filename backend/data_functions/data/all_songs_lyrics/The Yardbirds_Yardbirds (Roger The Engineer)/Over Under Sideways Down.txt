Over Under Sideways Down LyricsHey!
Hey!
Hey!
Cars and girls are easy come by in this day and age
Laughing, joking, drinking, smoking
'Till I've spent my wage
When I was young people spoke of im-mor-ality
All the things they said were wrong
Are what I want to be

(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
When will it end
(When will it end)
When will it end
(When will it end)
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
I find comment 'bout my looks irrelativity
Think I'll go and have some fun
Cause it's all for free
I'm not searching for a reason to enjoy myself
Seems it's better done
Than argued with somebody else
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
When will it end
(When will it end)
When will it end
(When will it end)
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
(Hey)
Over, under, sideways, down
(Hey)
Backwards, forwards, square, and round
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!Embed
