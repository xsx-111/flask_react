Bankrupt! Lyrics



Justice done

People in fashion, rattle, don't hesitate
A look of my own, your chances are slim
Victory lap, formal with feathery eyes
Dating vendetta, win small, spray pesticide

Justice done

Caledonian, rich and young, self-entitled portrait
Court in session, justice done, we'll rush into it anyway
Forever is for everyone else, we’re off a couple secrets
Another lonely Tuesday home, stolen kisses, is anyone near?
Caledonian, rich and young, self-entitled portrait
Court in session, justice done, we'll rush into it anyway
Forever is for everyone else, we’re off a couple secrets
Another lonely Tuesday home, stolen kisses, is anyone near?
Caledonian, rich and young, self-entitled portrait
Court in session
Justice done2Embed
