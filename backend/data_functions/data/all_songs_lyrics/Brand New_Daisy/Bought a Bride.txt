Bought a Bride LyricsTrees will make a forest, trees will make a bow
These are all the harder words you have to know
If everyone's a structure where their own savior sits
I'm a little red house, but no one's living in it
Cars are little blood cells, we are oxygen
City is the airways, suburbs appendages
She was feeling lonely, tired of the hive
Rented out a family and he bought a bride
Little cities' names on very lonely maps
They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks
Where are all the seedlings we grew for violins?
Down in Jersey lumber, still in prosthetic limbs
Should've been a soldier, I could've fought and died
There's no revolution, so I bought a bride
Coming down the aisle while the horns play Taps
They tied her up and laid her on the train tracks
If somehow I was new and everything was unsaid
I'd go and buy a hammer, never sing again
Sleeping on a stairway, dreamt I had a boat
Sailed it out the harbor, shot it full of holes
Folded up my prayer book, I couldn't see the lines
Drowning in a kelp bed, I bought a bride3Embed
