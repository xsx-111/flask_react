Noro LyricsLittle light, lead us through the night
And if we die, burn down the forest
Chariots, carry us
Distances we don't care to walk
I'm on my way to hell
I'm on my way to hell
Why doesn't anyone I know sleep?
Are they all just scared of their dreams?
When they lay their heads down at night
What are they haunted by?
Why won't anyone just close their eyes?
Could it hurt them to rest for a while?
Do they need their friends to be a lover?
Or a lover to be a friend?
Because I'm on my way to hell
Well, I've tried, God knows that I've tried
I'm on my way to hell
One time, two times, three times again
Getting dark, running out of luck
Our car's stuck on the train crossing
How am I ever gonna know peace?
How will I ever see your light through the trees?
I want to burn down everything we've begun
I want to kill and eat my young
I'm on my way to hell
Well, I've tried, God knows that I've tried
I'm on my way to hell
One time, two times, three times again
I'm on my way out
Well, I've tried, God knows that I've tried
I'm on my way to hell
One time, two times, three times again
I'm on my way to hell
"Oft times clouded is the ray
That toward heaven beckons me
Oft my wandering heart is lured
On some bypath far from thee
Father, when my footsteps stray
Guide me back into thy way
Father with thee, oh, let me be
On life's highway, god with thee"3Embed
