Vices Lyrics
"Far away from any road
Roams my heart in solitude
Where no passer by can see
On life's highway, God with thee
Knowing when all else doth fail
Thy compassion shall prevail
Father with thee, let me be
On life's highway, God with thee"
We need vices
We need vices
Where's all my hope and my marriage license?
(Where's my hay?)
Those days are dead (forgive me)
Those days are dead (forgive me)
Those days are dead (forgive me)
We need vices at fifteen thousand degrees
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
And jumped
Our good Creator (oh no)
The dog in the manger
Where is my shrink and my mind's eraser?
(we sing a sad song)
That forest burned (do you see smoke?)
That forest burned (a halo)
That forest burned
We need ten years on rewind so we can return
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
And jumped
We need vices
We need vices
We have neither the plans nor disguises
Those days are dead (forgive me)
Those days are dead (forgive me)
Those days are dead (forgive me)
We need vices and wheels to the funeral gate
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
She said goodbye to the ground
And jumpedEmbed
