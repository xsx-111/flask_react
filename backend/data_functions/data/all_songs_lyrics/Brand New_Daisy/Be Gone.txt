Be Gone LyricsIt's getting hard to stay up
I think I can hear God calling my name
He'll try to make my heart break
But I was told you'd call me tonight
They're calling my name
They won't slow the car down
I'm scared that I will keep it for my own
The one that is calling my name is telling "come down"
They're calling my name
They're calling my name
Calling my nameEmbed
