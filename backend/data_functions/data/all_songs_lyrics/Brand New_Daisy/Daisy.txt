Daisy Lyrics
And we sing this morning
That wonderful and grand old message
I don't know about you but I never get tired of it
Number 99: Just As I Am
I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a river that is all dried up
I'm an ocean nothing floats on
I'm a sky that nothing wants to fly in
I'm a sun that doesn't burn hot
I'm a moon that never shows its face
I'm a mouth that doesn't smile
I'm a word that no one ever wants to say

I don't wanna be
He wasn't finding anybody when he was on a shelf
I saw him in my dream
I'm a mountain that has been moved
I'm a fugitive that has no legs to run
I'm a preacher with no pulpit
Spewing a sermon that goes on and on and on

Well if we take all these things
And we bury them fast
And we pray that they turn into seeds
To roots and then grass
It'd be all right, it's all right
It'd be easier that way
Or if the sky opened up and started pouring rain
Like he knew it was time
To start things over again
It'd be all right, it's all right
It'd be easier that way
We’re dumb enough to retain
While you look down with a frown
We don’t know our right
Increase the flood…
Don’t say we weren’t scared
And don’t mention all the good
And don’t say he’s alone
Increase the flood…4Embed
