In a Jar LyricsStones in your eyes, stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes, stones in your mouth
Stones in your ears, stones in your mind
Stones in your eyes, stones in your eyes
We live in a jar, think the lids the sky
You're hoping for a savior on your cross outside
Stars are just a million little fireflies
The sun is just a hole, it's the light outside
No one save me cause I'm
Sinking, drowning but I'm
Struggling to save my life
Where you going?
Is it safe tonight?
Holding out for rest but on the seventh day
I've created nothing and I'm wide awake
So can I tie my key to your electric kite?
The rooster crowed twice and you kissed me goodnight
There's too many saviors on my cross again
I know I'm never going to be a perfect man
Everyone's an oyster with their grain of sand
I love you most in song, but now it has to end
No one save me cause I'm
Sinking, drowning but I'm
Struggling to save my life
Where you going?
Is it safe tonight?
Where you going?
Is it safe tonight?
Stones in your eyes, stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes, stones in your eyes
Stones in your eyes, stones in your eyes
I'll run a million miles if you win first prize
No one save me cause I'm
Sinking, drowning but I'm
Struggling to save my life
Where you going?
Is it safe tonight?
Where you going?
Is it safe tonight?
Where you going?
Is it safe tonight?1Embed
