Bed Lyrics
My head is lead I don't ever want to go to bed
Your hair is on fire
You snuff the blaze turn to vapor then you float away
We got into a bad fight

Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed

My eyes are lungs, I'm a prophet and I speak in tongues
I know how you'll die
Your sister groans, a usurper to the holy throne
To me she's just a dead spy

Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
I don't know what you feel like
Ambushed on the road, stole your gold, you're a rose and you're laughing now
Everything that I own starts to pile up
Like bones make the walls of a prison
Laid her on the bed
Later on the bed

I don't ever want to go to bed
You stay up for the fight
The champ goes down like a clown in the second round
I wish we'd had a better goodbye

Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends
Lie to all your friends

Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed
Laid her on the bed10Embed
