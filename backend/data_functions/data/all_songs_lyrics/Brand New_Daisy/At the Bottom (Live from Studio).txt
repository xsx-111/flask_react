At the Bottom (Live from Studio) LyricsWait, I watched you throw out your bouquet
Now I think about you everyday
I'm alone now in my bed
And there's a lake, and at the bottom you'll find all my friends
They don't swim 'cause they're all dead
We never are what we intend or invent
'Cause I made little lies, and then I pulled them apart
Think something dark's living down in my heart
And if I wanted to die before I got old
I should've started some years ago digging that hole
Well, I'll carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down, I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
A deer that a hunter shot in the heart
Some dogs that got hit by cars
All came to spill their guts
And we spoke about the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost
And which psalms we had loved the most
And then we all turned to dirt and dust
Some men die under the mountain
Just looking for gold
Some die looking for a hand to hold
Well, I'll carry this box to its proper place
And when I lower it down, I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
I stole bricks from the dam almost every day
Now I'm drowning in the flood I made
Well, explain myself to me on the other side
I'll watch from Heaven when I die
Well, I'll carry this box to the proper place
And when I lower it down, I let you fade away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)
Well, I'd serve you drugs on a silver plate
If I thought it would help you get away
I hope that you would do this for me
(I hope that you would do this for me)Embed
