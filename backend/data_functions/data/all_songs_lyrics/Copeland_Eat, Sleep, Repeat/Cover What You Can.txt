Cover What You Can LyricsOooh, you could run and hide
Oooh, in the street outside
And if you get caught in the rain
Just cover what you can and the rest it washes out
Like a bloodstain
Oooh, oooh
And if you get caught in the fire
Just think about what made your heart cry out for you to
Fight it allEmbed
