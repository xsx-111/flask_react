Careful Now Lyrics
Oh, maybe you should make a list for me
Of everything important in this world
In a note of urgency
Cause I don't know how to feel

Maybe you should stay a mystery
And I know you as well as anyone else
And you will appear the same to me
Cause I don't know how to feel
Ooh, ooh

Careful now, you'll hurt yourself
Careful now, you'll hurt, you'll hurt someone else


I threw everything out that doesn't make sense
To find a thousand more things that don't make sense
And I can't help but get lost in a fault like this
When I don't know how to hide myself in open air
Where I'm all alone, alone, alone
Careful now, you'll hurt yourself
Careful now, you'll hurt, you'll hurt someone
Careful now, you'll hurt yourself
Careful now, you'll hurt, you'll hurt someone else
Ooh, ooh
