Control Freak Lyrics
Do you lose control when you hold too tight
But turn your head long enough to let it bite?
Cause faith let me staring at the ceiling through the night
It's freaking me out

And when I fell asleep it plagued my dreams
And 30 bits of glass that become my teeth
They will break and each and every time I tried to speak it's freaking me out...

You're freaking me out (x2)
And I can run like a coward for the door
But I'll never get out
You're freaking me out

Do you lose your mind if you lose control?
It makes you feel ashamed for the hearts you've stole
And now your own heart's scared of an attack
Cause you can't give them back
You're stressing me out when you prove me wrong
You're wearing me out cause I've slept so long

Throw it all away
I threw it all away
And the best part is not knowing just what I threw away
I threw it all away, Hey!
Ooh ooh


Ooh ooh
You're freaking me out
But I keep running right back around for more
Cause I'm in love with my doubt
It's freaking me outEmbed
