By My Side LyricsIt's takin' time, all this fear I pushed back to move on
Beating me like a panic attack since you've gone
And if I never fear to be more alone, I do now
I turn to see my faded tracks in the snow
I've come so far with no idea where to go
And if I never fear to be more alone, I do now
I do now
I need you to tell me you'll be right by my side
When I feel alone, you'll be right by my side, ooh
It's takin' hold of a fool with a fondness for pain
And turn to run without a chance to explain
And if I never thought I'd fall like the rain, I do now
I do now
I don't look back to spot where I fell
Don't you look back, and don't you ever tell
'Cause we know pride, it doesn't heal all that well
All that well, all that well
I need you to tell me you'll be right by my side
When I feel alone, you'll be right by my side
In a crazy world, you'll be right by my side
I need you to tell me you'll be right by my side
When I feel alone, you'll be right by my side
In a crazy world...
And I need you to tell me you'll be right by my side
When I feel alone, you'll be right by my side
You'll be right by my sideEmbed
