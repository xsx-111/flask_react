The Last Time He Saw Dorie LyricsHe's in love with tragedy, in love with tragedy
She was a wreck, but he loved her
She was a wreck, but so was he
And the last time he saw Dorie, he didn't know what to say but
"Thank you because you loved me, it's all on me
Cause I didn't want to stay, I didn't want to stay..."
Live, live, live because you love, love, love
And love'll make you give, give, give
And give in when you break, break, break
But you just want to fix yourself
Just to break again...Embed
