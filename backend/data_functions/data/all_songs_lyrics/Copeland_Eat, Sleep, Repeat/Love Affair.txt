Love Affair Lyrics
Fell past a cheekbone hill
To a piece of her floor
The hope of the world
In an awkward spill

Oh she'd lie on her bed
And stare into harsh white light
And think that her heart's not right

Cause love took her hand like a thief
Took her heart like a robber
And the feelings that scare her
Become her relief
(x2)
Just let me run where I want to run
Just let me love who I want

In a flash a heart is slain
You have to ask in all this pain
Was your heart too soft?
Was your love in vain?
Was your kiss too weak?
Were your eyes too tight?
And much too young to be in love
Much too young to be in love
(x3)
Just let me run where I want to run
Just let me love who I want


There are no rules for this love
Just keep your head and don't give up
Like all the fools who play it smart
Lose your head just for your heart, just for your heartEmbed
