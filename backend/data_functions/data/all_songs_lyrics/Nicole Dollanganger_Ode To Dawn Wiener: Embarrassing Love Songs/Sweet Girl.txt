Sweet Girl Lyrics
You taste like sweet apple pie
With whipped cream on the side
Your cum is like warm milk
Your red cheeks are soft as silk
You taste like raisins in the pudding
Sweet soft bugs I'm chewing
Stuck between my teeth
Curling the toes on my feet
You're so sweet

So I take you to the movies
And then back to my house to sleep
You wear a used dirty band shirt and cute panties
Whisper secrets and you kiss me
Pull me close and tell me
That you think I'm so pretty
Well, I think you're a jewel
I think you're a ruby

Don't know who told you you had a cherry
In between your legs
The only thing I pop
Are the blood vessels on your neck
But if you want one, we can split a sundae
Tying knots with our tongues
Practice for later on the grass
When I lift your dress up
So I take you to the movies
And then back to my house to sleep
You wear a used dirty band shirt and cute panties
Whisper secrets and you kiss me
Pull me close and tell me
That you think I'm so pretty
Well, I think you're a jewel
I think you're a ruby1Embed
