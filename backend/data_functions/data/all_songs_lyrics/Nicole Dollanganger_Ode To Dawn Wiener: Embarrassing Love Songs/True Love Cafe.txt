True Love Cafe Lyrics
You have such a beautiful face
I've been dreaming about it between my legs
Come over and crawl into my bed
Kiss me, get me wet, give me head

Make me arch my back like ice cream sundae spoons
Give me afterglow as bright and daunting as the moon
Rub my feet with yours when we sit in a restaurant booth
Make me fall in love with you

Take me on a sticky sweet romantic date
Take me out to eat at the true love cafe
Ask for breakfast menus, order sunny side up eggs
Sneak your fingers in me underneath our plates

Make me arch my back like ice cream sundae spoons
Give me afterglow as bright and daunting as the moon
Rub my feet with yours when we sit in a restaurant booth
Make me fall in love with youEmbed
