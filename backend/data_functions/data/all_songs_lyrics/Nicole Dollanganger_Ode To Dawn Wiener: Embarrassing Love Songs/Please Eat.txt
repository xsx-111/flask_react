Please Eat Lyrics
If only I could love you enough to give you what you need
If only I could be for you the hand that feeds
'Cause I know you can only starve so much
'Til you like how it feels
Sitting on a throne of bones
Staring at that cold meal

It's not your body that I love
But it's the shell you're inside of
And you're killing it, you're killing
The only piece of you I can touch
It's not your body that I need
But that's what sleeps next to me
And you're killing it, you're killing it
You're killing it, please eat

If only I could make you believe you deserve everything
Every spoon and bite, anything you want to eat
'Cause I know you can only starve so much
Before you'll die
There's parts of you already gone
I can never revive
It's not your body that I love
But it's the shell you're inside of
And you're killing it, you're killing
The only piece of you I can touch
It's not your body that I need
But that's what sleeps next to me
And you're killing it, you're killing it
You're killing it, please eat1Embed
