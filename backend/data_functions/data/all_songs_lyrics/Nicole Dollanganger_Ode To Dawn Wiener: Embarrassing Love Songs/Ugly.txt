Ugly Lyrics
You said they made fun of your body
Humiliation in your eyes when you told me
Well, I'm gonna find them, don't you worry
I'll make sure they're really fucking sorry

You said you're embarassed of your body
You told me you think you're really ugly
Well, my love, I know you don't see what I see

Anything that is beautiful, people want to break
And you are beautiful, I'm afraid
Anything that is beautiful, people want to break
And you are beautiful, I'm afraid

You said you're ashamed of your body
You'd rather die than show me
But I would love you in any form you take

You said that they say you're disgusting
That they told you you were fat and unworthy
Well, my love, I hope you trust me
When I say you have a perfect body
Anything that is beautiful, people want to break
And you are beautiful, I'm afraid
Anything that is beautiful, people want to break
And you are beautiful, I'm afraid8Embed
