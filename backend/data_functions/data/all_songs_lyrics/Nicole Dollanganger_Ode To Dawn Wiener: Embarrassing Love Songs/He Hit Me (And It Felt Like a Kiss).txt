He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss) Lyrics
He hit me and it felt like a kiss - kiss - kiss - kiss

He hit me and it felt like a kiss
He spanked me as I laid over his leg
He put me on one knee and said
"Sweetie, I'll make this cute bum red"
And then he hit me and I was glad

Walked over in my knee highs and sat in his lap
Smiled wide for him and purred like a little cat
He said, "Tell me what you want me to do
Anything and I will"
So I told him to treat me like I'd been a real bad girl

He hit me and it felt like a kiss
He spanked me as I laid over his leg
He put me on one knee and said
"Sweetie, I'll make this cute bum red"
And then he hit me and I was glad

I got down on my hands and my knees
He said, "Yeah, you're a real bad girl
Who needs punishing"
I pouted like a child and gave him puppy eyes
He gave my ass a few more slaps
And made me apologize
And then he took me in his arms
With all the tenderness there is
And when he kissed me, he made me hisEmbed
