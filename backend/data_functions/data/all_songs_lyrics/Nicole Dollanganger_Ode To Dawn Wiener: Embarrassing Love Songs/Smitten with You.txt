Smitten with You Lyrics
When I see you, I can't find the words to speak
My cheeks go as red as two big cherries
I try to look beautiful for you
Stuffing my dress up with tissues
Hoping you'll notice but it's obvious
And get so embarrassed
I'm so smitten with you and everyone knows it
When you're not around, I clutch my chest and say
I'll look you in the eyes and not be so god damn shy
But I am, I can't find the words to speak

But in my dreams, I walk up to you and say
"Do you want a get a milkshake after the show?"
You say "sure" but first I take you to a bathroom stall
Give you a quick handjob and then we go
Walk across the street in the snow to the restaurant
Squeeze beside each other in the seat, share the same straw
Leave my lipstick on the cup and lick the foam off with my tongue
Flirting with the waiter when he comes
Twirling my hair and batting my eyelashes
Like a Hollywood starlet winking at the cameras
And when we go, I wear your coat around my shoulders
And you hold my hand, you walk me home
I take you in, peel off my dress
Throw you on the bed and do everything I imagined I did
When I masturbated and thought about you1Embed
