700 Club Lyrics
Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ
Think I just found the light in your eyes
Think I just became as religious as they come
I think I just found God
Dumbfounded by the glow of your gold halo
Oh God, I can't believe I'm staring at a living angel

Give me a Bible, I'll put my hand on it
Give me a pen to join the 700 club
Baptisms, baby, dip me in the lake
Pour the holy water I'll drink the whole cup, cup

'Cause I never believed there was a Heaven 'til I found you
And I never prayed like the church always told me to
But now you can count on me to get on my knees for you

Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ
Who would have thought all those church signs were right?
The Lord did come and He is my savior
I'm a good girl now, I'm a believer
I don't have blind faith 'cause I've got proof
I know angels are real now that I've found you
Give me a Bible, I'll put my hand on it
Give me a pen to join the 700 club
Baptisms, baby, dip me in the lake
Pour the holy water I'll drink the whole cup, cup

'Cause I never believed there was a Heaven 'til I found you
And I never prayed like the church always told me to
But now you can count on me to get on my knees for you
Yeah, now you can count on me to get on my knees for you1Embed
