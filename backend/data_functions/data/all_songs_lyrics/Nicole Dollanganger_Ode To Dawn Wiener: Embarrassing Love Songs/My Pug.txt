My Pug Lyrics
Anywhere I go, I'm gonna take you with me
Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Texas, and Kentucky
Buy a little trailer big enough for just you and me
Stay up watching Golden Girls and I Love Lucy
Cuddling in bed, I kiss and rub your belly
Listen to you snort and wheeze, whine in your sleep
Greeted with wet kisses in the early morning
Always fall asleep to the song of your snoring

And I don't know what I did
Before the day I met you
And I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you

Anywhere you go is the place I'll call my home
Painting welcome signs and growing flowers in the lawn
Eating junk and watching trash 'til the break of the dawn
A gentleman you are, always take me on long walks
A great big appetite, I like men who know how to eat
Slurping the same noodle when we share spaghetti
Eating peanut butter, dip the spoons in the jar
Buy a box of donuts glazed in icing sugar
And I don't know what I did
Before the day I met you
And I don't know what I'd do
If I ever lost you

You're the lumpiest, squishiest, fattest little thing
You're the sweetest little guy, my double-chinned baby
You're the only man I want and the only man I need
You're the only man I dream of late at night when I sleep
You're the cutest pug, the kind I spent my whole life dreaming of
Growing old together in a trailer park so in loveEmbed
