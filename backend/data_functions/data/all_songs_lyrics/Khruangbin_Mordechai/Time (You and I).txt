Time (You and I) Lyrics
That's life
If we had more time
We could live forever
Just you and I
We could be together
That's life
If we had more time
We could live forever
Just you and I
We could be together
That's life

We can play like children play
We can say like children say
Just you and I
Have we got the time?
We can wise when we grow old
Get slow when we grow old
Just you and I
Have we got the time?
Do you know?
Here we go

That’s life (Time)
If we had more time
We could live forever (Forever)
Just you and I (You and I)
We could be together
That's life (Time)
If we had more time
We could live forever (Forever)
Just you and I (You and I)
We could be together
That's life
We can rhyme like children rhyme
We can time like children time
Just you and I
Have we got the time?
Make a plan for when we get old
Reminisce when we get old
Just you and I
Have we got the time?
Do you know?
Here we go

That's life
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We can now
When we are here
We can then
When we are there
Ooh, ooh, ooh
We can now
When we are here
We can then
When we are there
We are here
We are there
That's life (Time)
If we had more time
We could live forever (Forever)
Just you and I (You and I)
We could be together
That's life (Hora)
If we had more time
We could live forever (La vida)
Just you and I (You and I)
We could be together
That's life (Pour)
If we had more time
We could live forever (Toujours)
Just you and I (C'est la vie)
We could be together
That's life (Vita)
If we had more time
We could live forever (Amore)
Just you and I (Qui!)
We could be together (Suonare)
That's life
