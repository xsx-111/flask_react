Dearest Alfred LyricsWhere are you now?
We hardly see or speak anymore
Your letter is the best gift
I am happy
Happy when you're here
Tell me about your friends
Write to me soon
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
Can you imagine my joy?
I received your wonderful letter
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
I love my joy very much
I've received
Another chance in ernest
Your letter is the best gift
I am so glad that you are here
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift
Your letter is the best gift1Embed
