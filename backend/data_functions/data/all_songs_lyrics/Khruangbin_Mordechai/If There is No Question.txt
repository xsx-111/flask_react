If There is No Question Lyrics
We cried from laughing
I'll go
You're not crazy
You're not crazy
Hearts will get broken
I'll go with you
You're not crazy
You're wild
But, you're not crazy

We're all in this world
Promises won't last
If there is no answer

Broken, and perfect
I'll go
You're not crazy
You're not crazy
The glass will shatter
I'll go with you
You're not crazy
You're wild
But, you're not crazy
We're all in this world
Promises won't last
If there is no question

Broken, and laughing
I'll go
You're not crazy
You're not crazy
The glass will shatter
I'll go with you
You're not crazy
You're wild
But, you're not crazy
You're not crazy
You're wild
But, you're not crazy
You're not crazy
You're wild
But, you're not crazy
You're not crazy
You're wild
But, you're not crazyEmbed
