Blank Tapes Lyrics
All that I know is
You'll be gone before I get home
I'll break a butterfly
On a wheel before I let go

Nothing left for us
Nothing is left but the blank tapes
Nothing left for us
Nothing is left but the blank tapes
In your car

Once I could hold you
And the world reflected back at me
We lost perspective
On the things that are and love that seems

Nothing left for us
Nothing is left but the blank tapes
Nothing left for us
Nothing is left but the blank tapes
In your carEmbed
