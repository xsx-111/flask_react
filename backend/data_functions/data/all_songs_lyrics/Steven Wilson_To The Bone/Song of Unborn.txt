Song of Unborn Lyrics
It's not what you'll possess
It's how you will express
The essence of you
It's not the wage you earn
It's about the things you learn
And the love that you feel
It's not what you'll conceal
It's all that you'll reveal
That will make you be you
The perfection of you

Now the shadows are long
And the cities are lost to rain
And when you wake up every day
To find nothing's changed
But before you can speak
You will learn that it's all the same
And the dreams that you will have
Are public domain
And the country lanes are decked
With the time to come

It's not the years you pass
It's about the moments that last
Forever in you
Now the shadows are long
And the cities are lost to rain
When you wake up every day
To find nothing's changed
But before you can speak
You will learn that it's all the same
And the dreams that you will have
Are public domain

Now the time that is gone
Doesn't matter to anyone
When the country lanes are decked
With the time yet to come
Well the world is exhausted
And the wreckage is all around
But the arc of your life
Could still be profound

Don't be afraid to die
Don't be afraid to be alive
Don't be afraid to die
Don't be afraid to be alive
Don't be afraid1Embed
