Detonation Lyrics
Great God, I don't believe in you
But still I will do what you want me to
Stand up and fight in the city streets
This much I know you expect of me

And the ones who are given it all
The good looks, the wealth
And the charm and the innocence
They are all gonna fall
But I will take it back

Pale God, I had a dream of you
And how you respond when your ego's bruised
They laugh and sneer 'cause they know you're weak
But I'll make them pay with an IED

And the ones who are given it all
The good looks, the wealth
And the charm and the innocence
They are all gonna fall
But I will take it back
Whining God, who the fuck are you?
Detonation for the greater good
Swim here, come and hear my heart
'Cause when the world breaks
You will feel the blastEmbed
