Detonation (Demo) LyricsGreat God, I don't believe in you
But still I will do
What you want me to
Stand up and fight in the city streets
This much I know
You expect of me
And the ones who are given it all
The good looks, the wealth
And the charm and the innocence
They are all gonna fall
But I will take it back
Hail God, I had a dream of you
And how you respond
When your ego's bruised
They laugh and sneak
As they know you're weak
But I'll make them pay
With an IED
And the ones who are given it all
The good looks, the wealth
And the charm and the innocence
They are all gonna fall
But I will take it back
I will take it back
I will take it back
I will take it back
I will take it back
Whiny God, who the fuck are you?
Detonation for the greater good
Sweating, can hear my heart
'Cause when the world breaks
You will feel the blastEmbed
