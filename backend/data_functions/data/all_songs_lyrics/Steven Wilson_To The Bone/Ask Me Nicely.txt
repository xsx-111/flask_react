Ask Me Nicely LyricsTake off your blindfold
Consumer of all
The rest of the wreckage
Is starting to fall
And if you're gonna ask me
Ask me nicely
If you can't be polite
Say nothing at all
Because you don't care
I choose to ignore you
Because you don't try
I show you the door
You're foul-mouthed and fragile
And want to avoid
Remember it all
Before it's destroyedEmbed
