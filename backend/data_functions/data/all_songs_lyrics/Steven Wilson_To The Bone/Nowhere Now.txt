Nowhere Now Lyrics
Six feet underground
We move backwards now
At the speed of sound
We are nowhere now
Too much time to kill
Too much wasted ink
Too much everything
There's no need to think

Here above the clouds
I am free of all the crowds
And I float above the stars
And I feel the rush of love
Looking down at Earth
It is luminous observed

We had every chance
But we never learn
We just make it worse
What we don't deserve
The principle of love
Has no meaning here
'Cause if you don't adhere
Better get out while you can
Here above the clouds
I am free of all the crowds
And I float above the stars
And I feel the rush of love
Looking down at Earth
It is luminous observed


Here above the clouds
I am free of all the crowds
And I float above the stars
And I feel the rush of love
Looking down at Earth
It is luminous observed

Six feet underground
We move backwards now
At the speed of sound
We are nowhere nowEmbed
