A Door Marked Summer LyricsA girl with the romanest nose on the planet
Crinoline runs down her face
The embers of firelight arrange into shadows
A black winter burned
By the summer gone
Down on it's luck
Now the wind blow the leaves around forever
Autumn strong
Candle blows out
Now she knows we gotta run to the shore
I drink in the spot I was wearily older
Sleeping to dreaming awake
The fish will still bite as the river gets colder
Rain drops against
As the sunlight fades
Lighting a match
Now the wind blow the leaves around forever
Autumn strong
The fisherman's catch
Now she knows we gotta run to the shore
A girl with the romanest nose on the planet
Crinoline runs down her face
The embers of firelight arrange into shadows
A black winter burned
By the summer gone
Down on it's luck
Now the wind blow the leaves around forever
Autumn strong
Candle blows out
Now she knows we gotta run to the shore
Light bleeds
Lighting a match
Now the wind blow the leaves around forever
Autumn strong
The fisherman's catch
Now she knows we gotta run to the shoreEmbed
