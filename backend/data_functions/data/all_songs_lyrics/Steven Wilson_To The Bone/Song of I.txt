Song of I Lyrics
I'm truly sorry but
This is my addiction
You're deep in my system
In my system

I gave it all up
I gave it up to show you that I care
To show you that I could
But don't you ever ask me to give up you

I gave up all the late nights
I gave up haunting bars
I gave up all the drinking
And trashing all the cars
Yeah
Yeah
I gave it all up

I gave up all the gambling
I gave up picking fights
I gave up saying sorry
I gave up being polite
I gave it up
I gave it all up
I give it up
You're in my
I give it all up
I give it up
You're in my
I give it up


I give it up
I give it all up
I give it up
I give it all up
I give it up
You're in my
I give it up
I give it up
You're in my
I give it up
T’es sous le sable
T’es dans l’eau
I give it all up
Give it up
J'abandonne
You're in my
You're in, you're in my
I give it all up
You're in my
You're in myEmbed
