Permanating Lyrics
Somewhere on the highway
With the luminous moon
Swimming after dark and then
Awaken to you

Hold on, hold onto the minute
And sing it, and live it
It's always there
Hold on, hold onto the minute
And feel it, believe it

And time is moving on
And listening to the song
We get older, together
And every time we breathe
Another moment leaves us forever, to the never

Hold on, hold onto the minute
And sing it, and live it
It's always there
Hold on, hold onto the minute
And feel it, believe it
Permanating, celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday, is the place where all your friends will always
Permanating, celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday, is the place where all your dreams are always


And time is moving on
And listening to the song
We get older, together
And every time we breathe
Another moment leaves us forever, to the never

Hold on, hold onto the minute
And sing it, and live it
It's always there
Hold on, hold onto the minute
And feel it, believe it
Permanating, celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday is the place where all your friends will always
Permanating, celebrating
Now we're levitating
High above the clouds
Yesterday is the place where all your dreams are always

Hold on, hold onto the minute
And sing it, and live it
It's always there
Hold on, hold onto the minute
And feel it, believe it
Hold on, hold onto the minute
And sing it, and live it
It's always there
Hold on, hold onto the minute
And feel it, believe itEmbed
