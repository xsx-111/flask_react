Pariah Lyrics
I'm tired of weakness
Tired of my feet of clay
I'm tired of days to come
I'm tired of yesterday
And all the worn out things that I ever said
Now it's much too late
The words stay in my head

So the day will begin again
Take comfort from me
It's up to you now
You're still here and you'll dig in again
That's comfort to you
It's up to you now
So Pariah, you'll begin again
Take comfort from me
And I will take comfort from you

I'm tired of Facebook
Tired of my failing health
I'm tired of everyone
And that includes myself
Well being alone now
It doesn't bother me
But not knowing if you are
That's been hell you see
So the day will begin again
Take comfort from me
It's up to you now
You're still here and you'll dig in again
That's comfort to you
It's up to you now
So Pariah, you'll begin again
Take comfort from me
It will take time

Don't you worry
Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause nothing really dies
Nothing really ends13Embed
