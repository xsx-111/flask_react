Pariah (Demo) LyricsI'm tired of weakness
Tired of my feet of clay
I'm tired of days to come
I'm tired of yesterday
And all the worn out words that I ever said
Now it's much too late
The truth stays in my head
Life in general
Goes on indifferently
Another glass of dust
In front of my TV
Put on a clean shirt
And an old pair of shoes
Face the shrinking day
With nothing left to lose
So Pariah you'll dig in again
That's comfort to you
It's up to you now
So the day will begin again
That's comfort to me
It's up to me now
I'm still here and I will live again
That's comfort to me
And I'm empty of history and soul
Love can save me
From almost anything
Except my stupid self
And the state I'm in
Well being alone
It doesn't bother me
But not knowing if you are
Well that's been hell you see
So Pariah you'll dig in again
That's comfort to you
It's up to you know
So the day will begin again
That's comfort to me
It's up to me now
I'm still here and I will live again
That's comfort to me
Look to the skies
Don't you worry
Don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause nothing really dies
Nothing really endsEmbed
