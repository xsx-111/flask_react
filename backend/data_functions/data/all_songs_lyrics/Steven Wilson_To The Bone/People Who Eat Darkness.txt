People Who Eat Darkness Lyrics
I live in the flat next door
And I can hear you fuck your girlfriend through the wall
But the only thing we share
Is the slightest nod as we're passing on the stairs

But behind the closed doors
The bees were buzzing
Inciting me to war
You're penitent maybe
But it's really not your fault you fail to see

We who eat the darkness
We who eat the darkness

I take out the trash at night
And on Thursday's I go shopping for supplies
I walk my son to school
And I seem to have the same problems as you

But what you will see
Are the threads of what I want you to believe
And all that you hold dear
Is under threat from someone all too near
We who eat the darkness
We who eat the darkness

Well you lost control
And your kids became confused
Among the powder kegs
With nothing left to lose
So now your chickens
Are coming home to roost


Do you think the fight is real?
Do you feel my teeth are snapping at your heels?
You who tell me how to live
And you feed me with your poison 'til I'm sick

Pretend that we're not here
If you look the other way we disappear
We want you to ignore
The people who eat darkness from next door
We who eat the darkness
We who eat the darkness
We who eat the darkness
We who eat the darkness

Well you lost control
And your kids became confused
Among the powder kegs
With nothing left to lose
So now your chickens
Are coming home to roost1Embed
