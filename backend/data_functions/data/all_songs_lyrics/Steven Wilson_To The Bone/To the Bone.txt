To the Bone Lyrics
Once we've made sense of our world, we wanna go fuck up everybody else's because his or her truth doesn't match mine. But this is the problem. Truth is individual calculation. Which means because we all have different perspectives, there isn't one singular truth, is there?

Hold on, down and deeper, down we're going
Way down through the floor
Oh oh, don't you wanna see what's at the core?

Truth is the icy clear stream we dream about
Drinking from
But it will liquidate liars should they rewire
It's smiling bomb

Hold on, down and down and down and down
We're melting down their throne
Ho-ho, down through every superstition
Virgin, whore, and crone
Ho-ho, down through all the fear gods
To the very truth alone
Hold on, down and down, we're going to the bone


Truth is the permanent path we laugh about
But then avoid
Thinkin' we all know the way we strayed behind
Self-destroyed
Hold on, down and down and down and down
We're drilling through their stone
Ho-ho, down through every fairy story
Built to keep us prone
Hold on, down through every government
With gun and guided drone
Ho-ho, down and down, we're going to the bone

Rain all the truth down
Down on me
Raining so much
You make a sea
You make a sea
A sea we can sail
Then sink like a stone
Down to the truth
Down to the bone
Down to the bone7Embed
