Mr. Record Man Lyrics
Mr. Record Man, I'm looking for a song I heard today
There was someone blue singing not someone who went away
Just like me, his heart was yearning for a love that used to be
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

There was something about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr. Record Man, get this record for me, won't you please?
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like me

I was driving down the highway with the radio turned on
And the man that I heard singing sounded so blue and all alone
As I listened to his lonely song, I wondered, "Could it be?
Could there somewhere be another lonely man like me?"

There was something about a love that didn't treat him right
And he'd wake from troubled sleep and cry her name at night
Mr. Record Man, get this record for me, won't you please?
It's a lonely song about a lonely man like meEmbed
