Where My House Lives Lyrics
Stop here across the street to your right
That's where my house lives, sometimes I stayed there at night
But mostly I was on the move, business first, you know
And she'd wait there in her lonely room, but oh that's been so long ago

She's gone now, she couldn't stand to be alone
And now it waits there, this house that used to be my home
I never go there 'cause it holds too many memories since she's gone
But right there is where my house lives all alone

She's gone now, she couldn't stand to be alone
And now it waits there, this house that used to be my home
I never go there 'cause it holds too many memories since she's gone
But right there is where my house lives all aloneEmbed
