One Step Beyond Lyrics
I'm just one step before losing you
And I'm just one step ahead of the blues
But I know that there's been pain and misery
Long before this old world ever heard of me
It will hurt me so much to see you go
But we'll just add one more heartache to the score
And though I still love you as before
I'm just one step beyond caring anymore

Guess that you're surprised that I could feel this way
After staying home and waiting night and day
For someone who cared so much for me
You'd come home just long enough to laugh at me
I don't know just when my feelings changed
I just know I could never feel the same
And though I still love you as before
I'm just one step beyond caring anymore2Embed
