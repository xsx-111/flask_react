Touch Me Lyrics
Touch me
Touch the hand of the man who once owned all the world
Touch me
Touch the arms that once held all the charms of the world's sweetest girl
Touch me
Maybe someday you may need to know how it feels when you lose
So touch me
And you will know how you'd feel with the blues

Watch me
Watch the eyes that have seen all the heartbreak and pain in the land
And be thankful
That you're happy though standing so close to the world's bluest man
Don't forget me
Take a good look at someone who's lost everything he can lose
Then touch me
And you'll know how you'd feel with the blues

Don't forget me
Take a good look at someone who's lost everything he can lose
Then touch me
And you'll know how you'd feel with the bluesEmbed
