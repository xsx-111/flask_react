Darkness on the Face of the Earth Lyrics
The morning that you left me was just another day
How could I see the sorrow that had found me?
Then you left and told me that I was in your way
And I turned and ran as heaven fell around me

I stumbled through the darkness, my footsteps were unsure
I lived within a world that had no sunshine
When you left me darling, my world came to an end
And there was darkness on the face of the earth

The stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
Why did you ever leave me? You knew how it would hurt
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth

The stars fell out of heaven and the moon could not be found
The sun was in a million pieces scattered all around
Why did you ever leave me? You knew how it would hurt
And now there's darkness on the face of the earth

And now there's darkness on the face of the earthEmbed
