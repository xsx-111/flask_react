Train Train Lyrics
All a-fucking-board!

Well, train, train
Lord, take me on out of this town
Yeah, train, train
Oh, take me on out of this town
That woman I'm in love with
Lord, she's Memphis-bound

Oh, I'm leavin' here
'Cause I'm just a raggedy hobo
Lord, I'm leavin' here
'Cause I'm just a raggedy hobo
Lord, that woman I'm in love with
Oh, she got to go
Oh, honey, just go, go

Oh, yeah

Goodbye, pretty mama
Get yourself a money man
Lord, goodbye, pretty, pretty mama
Get yourself a money man
You take that midnight train to Memphis
Lord, if you can
Oh, you take that midnight train to Memphis
Leave if you can
Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, this one's for the rebels, woahEmbed
