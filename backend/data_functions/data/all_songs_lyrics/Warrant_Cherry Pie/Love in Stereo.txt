Love in Stereo Lyrics
First time I went to California
Couldn't believe my eyes
Skirts were so short, nights were so long
Thought that I would probably die
Fresh our of Luckenbach, Texas
I didn't expect that pair
Both of them had one thing on their mind
Both of them were willing to share

I never had two women before
But I'm an open-minded person
So, baby, lock that door

Love
We're lovin' in stereo
And it's love
Love in stereo
It's love in stereo
Ooh, how can anything feel so good?
Lovin' from the bottom, lovin' from the top
Lovin' to the left and the right
Well, I'm a lover, not a fighter
But it looks like I'm gonna have to fight
To keep from losin' my mind, mind, mind
I never had two women before
But I'm an open-minded person
So, baby, lock that door

Love
We're lovin' in stereo
And it's love
Love in stereo
It's love in stereo
Ooh, how can anything feel so good?

It's love in stereo

Well, first time I went to California
I couldn't believe my eyes
Skirts were so short, nights were so long
Girls were comin' two at a time

Love
We're lovin' in stereo
And it's love
Love in stereo
It's love in stereo
And it's love
We're lovin' in stereo
And it's love
In stereo
It's love in stereo
Ooh, how can anything feel so good?
It's love in stereoEmbed
