Mr. Rainmaker LyricsYeah!
It could have rained for forty weeks, dear
And I'd never known the difference
When your life is one long downpour
You're not sure you'll go the distance
You came along with a patch of blue sky
Inside your arms, I found a place that's warm and dry
Mister Rainmaker, don't waste your time
'Cause I found a girl who is permanent sunshine
She is the little queen of all of my dreams
Carry on and find someone else to rain on
Love never rained down on me, dear
Only heartache and problems
Now through your arms, I can see clear
Ooh, it's only been rainin' water
You came along with a patch of blue sky
Inside your arms, I found a place that's warm and dry, yeah
Mister Rainmaker, don't waste your time, yeah
'Cause I found a girl who is permanent sunshine
She is the little queen of all of my dreams
Carry on, find someone else to rain on
Mister Rainmaker, don't waste your time
'Cause I found a girl who is permanent sunshine
She is the little queen of all of my dreams
Carry on and find someone else to rain on
Ooh, oh, yeah
Mister Rainmaker
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
