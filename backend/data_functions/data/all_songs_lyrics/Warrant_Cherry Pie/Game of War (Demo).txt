Game of War (Demo) LyricsLove is a game of war
Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I don't need anyone
'Specially someone who leads me on
If you want a piece of me, then come on
All I want is all I need
Little bit of lovin' guaranteed
And I don't know where
And I dont know if I care where we're goin'
And how can you change it?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Ain't nothin' strange
When you'd rather be making love
Ooh, yeah
We are like a game of war
We both try to hide it
Why don't we just call it a draw?
Don't wanna play it anymore, anymore
Hit me once, shoot me twice
Feel like I'm walking through a field of mines
One wrong step and a...ha! Goodbye
Well, come on, come on, don't be shy
I hate you, you hate me
I guess it ends in a tie
So let's kick down the wall
Start all over, yeah
How can you change it?
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Now, ain't nothin' strange
When you'd rather be making love
Whoa, yeah
We are like a game of war
We both try to hide it
Why don't we just call it a draw?
Don't wanna play it anymore, anymore
(Play it anymore, anymore)
Oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah
We are like a game of war
We both try to hide it
Why don't we just call it a draw?
I don't wanna play it anymore
Whoa, love is war
(Play no more)
