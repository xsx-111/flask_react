Song and Dance Man Lyrics
Ooh, yeah

Last night I felt a wind of change blow through me
It spoke of a million things before I die I should see

Open up your eyes, life is poetry in motion
Ride the open sky
I'll be okay as soon as I'm on my way

I am a song and dance man
Yes, I am a song and dance man

Woman, oh woman, sometimes I hear your voice
It calls out to me, makes my heart bleed
Haven't got any choice

Open up my eyes, life is poetry in motion
Ride the open sky
I'll be okay as soon as I'm on my way
I am a song and dance man
Oh, Lord, I am a song and dance man, yeah

Tokyo has rolling thunder
Beautiful women and warm summer rain
Honolulu has stars of fire
Words alone cannot explain

Open up your eyes
Spread your wings and fly

Oh, Lord, I am a song and dance man
Oh, Lord, I am, Lord, a song and dance man
That's what I am, a song and dance man

Life is poetry in motionEmbed
