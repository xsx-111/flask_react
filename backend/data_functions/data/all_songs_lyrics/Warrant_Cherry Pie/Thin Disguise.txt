Thin Disguise LyricsThis house used to feel so warm
The heater works, but I'm chilled to the bone
Oh, this room never felt so big
There's not enough conversation
To fill the empty spaces
Now, how can you love someone
And not know them at all?
It's a thin disguise
Living our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside
I talked, you used to hear me so well
Now all the best conversations are with myself
Oh, I wish I knew what's pulling you away
But the space that's grown between us
Gets a little bigger every day
How can you love someone
And not know them at all?
It's a thin disguise
Living our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside
It's a thin disguise
Living our life behind a thin disguise
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside
It's a thin disguise
Living our life behind a thin disguise, oh, yeah
One of these days if I got the time
I'll show you what I'm like on the inside, yeah
It's a thin disguise, yeahEmbed
