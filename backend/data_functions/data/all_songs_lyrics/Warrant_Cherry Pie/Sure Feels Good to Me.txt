Sure Feels Good to Me Lyrics
Well, Susie, oh, Susie
Come on and let me in
There's love in the air, love on my mind
Love in the pores of my skin
I worked real hard all week long
Kept on singin' the same damn song
There's one for the money, two for the show
Paid on Friday and I'm ready to go

And if I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
You bring out the worst in me
Uh-huh
It might be bad, but (But it sure feels good)
It sure feels good to me

Think I'm outrageous
And you think I'm insane
But everything I'm doin' tonight
Well, I'm doin' it screamin' your name
Susie, oh Susie, open up the door
We won't be able to walk tomorrow
So we might as well do it some more
Yeah, if I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
You bring out the worst in me
Uh-huh
It might be bad, but (But it sure feels good)
It sure feels good to me


Well, if I'm wrong or if I'm right
I don't give a damn tonight
You bring out the beast in me
Yeah, it might be dirty and it might be bad
But it sure feels (Sure feels)
It sure feels good to me, yeah
Oh, it sure feels good to me
Woah, yeahEmbed
