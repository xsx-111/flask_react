Bed of Roses Lyrics
On a dead-end street in a dead-end town
There's a motel that I call home
Just a few small hopes and a few small dreams
Are all that place is resting on
Desiree lives two doors down
She's been there for way too long, oh, yeah
Sometimes when she's feelin' down
You know, I hope she hears this song

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
Ooh, she deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

She comes home late every night
I can hear her walkin' down my hall
She don't talk on the phone too much
When she does, I hear it through my wall
Desiree don't have many friends
Woah, no, at least not many good ones
And I may be just an ordinary man
But least I'm someone to lean on
On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
Ooh, she deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight (Tonight)
Tonight, tonight, tonight (Tonight)
Ooh, yeah

On a bed of roses
Not beneath some motel light
On a bed of roses
Ooh, she deserves to sleep tonight
On a bed of roses
Oh, yeah
On a bed of roses
Oh, she deserves to sleep tonight
She deserves to sleep tonight

On a bed of roses
On a dead-end street
In a dead-end town
There's a place that I call home
On a bed of roses
Where I call home
On a bed of roses (Ooh, yeah)
Oh, I call it homeEmbed
