Blind Faith Lyrics
Darlin', I know you're sleepin'
But there's something that I've just got to say
Wonder if you'll hear me while you're dreamin'
You make a lifetime out of every day

Thanks to you, now I know
All my dreams can come true

Blind faith in you, oh, yeah
I got blind faith in you, oh, yeah

Your eyes keep things well-hidden
Just a hint of what you're holding inside
And the first day that I met you
I consider the first day of my life

Thanks to you, now I know
All my dreams can come true

Blind faith in you, oh, yeah
I got blind faith in you, oh
And I'm not sure that I deserve
A woman so true, but I love
That you think I do
You and faith beside me
Well, I'm feelin' stronger every day

Blind faith in you, oh, yeah
I got blind faith in you, it's true, oh, yeah
Blind faith in you, oh, yeah
I got blind faith in you
And I'm not sure if I deserve
A woman so true, but I love
That you think I doEmbed
