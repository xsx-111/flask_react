I Dream In Neon LyricsLet the sound of the city run
Let the sound of the city run
When the neon lights run and rain
Lord knows that I live to pay
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
Let the city lights rain on me
Let the city sounds rain on me
When the neon lights running free
Lord knows that I live to pay
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
As we follow, and we chase them
It's running all over our minds
Bringing me near
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mine
These neon dreams of mineEmbed
