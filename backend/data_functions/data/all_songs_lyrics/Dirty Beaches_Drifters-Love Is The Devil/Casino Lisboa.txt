Casino Lisboa LyricsLisboa
With your neon lights
And your neon streets
Walking in my dreams
Lisboa
With your diamond legs
Walking in my dreams
Against one of them white walls
In your neon dreams
And your neon streets
Bring me to my knees
In your neon dreams
And your neon streets
Bring me to my knees
Lisboa
With your diamond legs
Dance against the white walls
Walking in my dreams
All neon streets,
All my body and soul
Lisboa
Dancing in my dreams
Body and soul
In your neon dreams
And your neon streets
Bring me to my knees
In your neon dreams
And your neon streets
Bring me to my knees
