Elli Lyricselli, I see you walking
on the street
looking for me
elli, I hear you crying
in my dreams
waiting for me
at a house that's always empty
in my dreams I'm always with you
elli, looking at me, what do you
see
about me
what do you see
elli, elli, what do you see
about me
at a house that's always empty
in my dreams I'm always with you
elli, don't you cry
I'll be home,
to you
Not a house that's always empty
in my dreams I'm always with youEmbed
