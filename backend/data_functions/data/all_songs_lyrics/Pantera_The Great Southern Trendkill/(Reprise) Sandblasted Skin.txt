(Reprise) Sandblasted Skin Lyrics
Dead!
Ugh!

Scrape it, grind it, peel it, hide it!
The trend is over (The trend is over!)
And gone forever!
Shelf it, box it, save it, frame it!
You won't need that anymore, not anymore!
It's on sale at the fuckin' dollar store!

Waste of time! (Waste of time!)
Pantomime! (Pantomime!)
Circus doll! (Circus doll!)
At the local mall! (At the local mall!)
Exterminate, it's all fake!
Exterminate, it's all fake!
Sandblast yourself!
Sandblast yourself!
Sandblast yourself!
Ugh!
Ugh, ugh, ow!

Huah!
Rah!
Keep it, it's old!
(Everybody, can 'em...can 'em, )Embed
