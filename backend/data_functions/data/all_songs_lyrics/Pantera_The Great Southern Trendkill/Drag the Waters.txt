Drag the Waters Lyrics
A smack on the wrists is the words
From the mouth of the outsiders, lawyers, police
A small price to pay for the dope and the guns and the rape
It should all be O.K
Your father is rich, he's the judge, he's the man
He's the God that got your sentence reduced
But in the back of his mind, he well knows
What he'd find if he looked a little deeper in you
In you

Drag the waters some more
Like never before

Sweet is the slice and the lips
You're going to have that woman
She is your favorite lay
Promised you swore that no one had been there, and
She was going to keep it that way
Let it move in, you got thin, and got high, and
Your money went and so did your friends
But she's by your side, and her smile cannot hide
The premonition of the beckoning end
The end

In with it, out with it1Embed
