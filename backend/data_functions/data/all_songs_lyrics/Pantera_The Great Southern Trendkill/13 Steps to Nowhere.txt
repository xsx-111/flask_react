13 Steps to Nowhere Lyrics
Whores
Whores
Whores

Your windows boarded up
Your private lives exposed
The talk shows pump it up
Lab rats diseased for show
We're doomed to use the slang
Outbreak of drug roulette
A church burned to the ground
Not even noticed yet

13 
Steps
(To Nowhere)


A backwards swastika
The black skin riddled in lead
A Nazi Gangster Jew
It beats a dog that's dead
It's in to use the slang
Outbreak of gun roulette
The cross slants to the side
Will prove the damnedest yet

The backlash dislocates
An untimely reign of death
The wolf poked with the stick
Awaits with cancerous breath
Leads to nowhere
Outsiders still suppose
There's Holy streets to roam
The truth should not surprise
Your homes were built on lies
Lies, yeah
