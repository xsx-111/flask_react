Free Lyrics
I just wanna be free (Oh yeah)
I just wanna be free (Yeah yeah)

I wanna be free of all the hurt
I wanna be free of all the pain
I wanna just end these lonely hours
End these lonely days, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I just want to be free (Woo-hoo)
I just want to be free


I just want to be free (Come on baby, baby, yeah)
I just want to be free (You know I've got to be)
I just want to be free
I just want to be free (Yeah, yeah)
I just want to be freeEmbed
