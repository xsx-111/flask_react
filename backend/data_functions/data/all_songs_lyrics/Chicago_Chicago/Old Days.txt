Old Days Lyrics
Old days
Good times, I remember
Fun days
Filled with simple pleasure
Drive-in movies
Comic books and blue jeans
Howdy Doody
Baseball cards and birthdays

Take me back
To a world gone away
Memories
Seem like yesterday


Old days
Good times, I remember
Gold days
Days I'll always treasure
Funny faces
Full of love and laughter
Funny places
Summer nights and streetcars
Take me back
To the world gone away
Boyhood memories
Seem like yesterday

Old days
On my mind and in my heart to stay (Ah)
Old days
Darkened dreams of good times gone away (Ah)
Old days
Days of love and feeling fancy free (Ah)
Old days
Days of magic still so close to me (Ah)
Old days
On my mind and in my heart to stay (Ah)
Old days
Darkened dreams of good times gone away (Ah)
Old days
Days of love and feeling fancy free (Ah)
