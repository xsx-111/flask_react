Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon: II. So Much to Say, So Much to Give Lyrics
So hard to be
Free to
Love only you
People
Staring at me
Try to
Take you away
There's no
Time to delay
We've got to live for today, yeah
I've got
So much to give
And there is
So much to say
Night after night
Day after day
In spite of our words
They all turn awayEmbed
