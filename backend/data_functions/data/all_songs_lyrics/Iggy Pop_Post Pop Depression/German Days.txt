German Days Lyrics
Speak easy
Knock on the door
They'll check you out
Through a peep hole
There's a man
Who knows what you want
There's a girl
Who'll capture your flag

Glittering champagne on ice
Garish and overpriced
Champagne on ice
Garish, overpriced

Schnellimbiss
And Pope Benedict
Brilliant brains
And the end of pain
Germany
Must germinate
Germinate
In a German way
Garish and overpriced
Glittering champagne on ice
Berlin and Christ
Champagne on ice

German Days
German Days
