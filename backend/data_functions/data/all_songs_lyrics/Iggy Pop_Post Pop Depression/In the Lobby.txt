In the Lobby Lyrics
Breaking zee chain in the lobby
An ocean of bodies, and then there's me
And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight

And it's all about the hang
And it's all about the crowd that hangs
And it's all about the hook
Somebody is losing their life tonight

I followed my shadow and it lead me here
What is the problem if I disappear?
And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight

And it's all about the edge
And it's all about the fans and kids
And it's all about the sex
And it's all about guns

Yeah
I followed my shadow tonight
Out of the light
Yeah
I followed my shadow tonight
Out of the light
My shadow is walking in front of me
The longer the night, the shorter my leash
And it's a long, long night
And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight

And it's all about the kicks
And it's all about the dancing pricks
And it's all about the clowns
And it's all about guns

Yeah
I followed my shadow tonight
Out of the light
Yeah
I followed my shadow tonight
Out of the light

Out of the light
Get out of sight
Out of the light
Get out tonight
Out of the light
Get out of sight
Out of the light
Get out tonightEmbed
