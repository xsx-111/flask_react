Paraguay Lyrics
Wild, animals they do
Never wonder why
Just to do what they goddamn do
Yeah
Wild, animals they do
Never wonder why
Just to do what they goddamn do

I'm goin' where sore losers go
To hide my face, and spend my dough
Though it's a dream, it's not a lie
And I won't stop to say goodbye

Paraguay
Paraguay

See, I just couldn't take no more
Of whippin' fools, and keepin' score
I just thought, "Well, fuck it man
I'm gonna pack my soul and scram"

Paraguay
Paraguay
Out of the way, I'll get away
Won't have to hear the things they say
Tamales and a bank account
Are all I need, so count me out

Paraguay
Paraguay

I'll have no fear, I'll know no fear
So far from here, I'll have no fear
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tra-la-la
Tra-la-la
Tra-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-
Tra-la-la

Wild, animals they do
Never wonder why
Just do what they goddamn do
Wild, animals they do
Never wonder why
Just do what they goddamn do
There's nothing awesome here
Not a damn thing
There's nothing new
Just a bunch of people scared
Everybody's fucking scared
Fear eats all the souls at once
I'm tired of it
And I dream about getting away
To a new life
Where there's not so much fucking knowledge
I don't want any of this information
I don't want YOU
No
Not anymore
I've had enough of you
Yeah, I'm talking to you
I'm gonna go to Paraguay
To live in a compound under the trees
With servants and bodyguards who love me
Free of criticism
Free of manners and mores
I wanna be your basic clod
Who made good
And went away while he could
To somewhere where people are still human beings
Where they have spirit
You take your motherfucking laptop
And just shove it into your goddamn foul mouth
And down your shit heel gizzard
You fucking phony two faced three timing piece of turd
And I hope you shit it out
With all the words in it
And I hope the security services read those words
And pick you up and flay you
For all your evil and poisonous intentions
Because I'm sick
And it's your fault
And I'm gonna go heal myself now
Yeah!3Embed
