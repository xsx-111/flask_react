Break Into Your Heart Lyrics
I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I see where you begin

Time's so tight, it's closing in
Forty more hours to go
When the tumblers spin, I'm getting in
Gonna be time to blow

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I see where you begin

Hooks go deep, but it's make believe
But you're never gonna grow
Your heart is buried underneath
Mountains capped with snow

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I see where you begin
Break them all
Take them all
Fake them all
Steal them all
Fail them all
Touch them all
Break them all
Break them all

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna break into your heart
Till it all comes crashing down

I'm gonna break into your heart
I'm gonna crawl under your skin
I'm gonna break into your heart
And follow till I get under your skin
And the wall comes tumbling down
And you finally let me in
I'll break into yourEmbed
