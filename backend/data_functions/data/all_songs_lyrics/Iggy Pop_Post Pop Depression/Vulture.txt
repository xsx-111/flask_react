Vulture Lyrics
Okay, cool

Fat, black vulture
White head hung low
Chewin' dead meat
By the side of the road
His evil breath
Smells just like death
He takes no chances
He knows the dances

Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh


Vulture waiting
For a life to end
Proving the prophet
He's nobody's friend
If he gets near
Your bones he'll clear
He'll jump your bandwagon
'Til it's your corpse he's draggin'
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture
Vulture

Fat, black vulture
Has got no shame
He'll tell a lie
Cheat, steal, and frame
His poison whiff
Will kill you stiff
This toxic executive
Wants your guts in his grip

Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture, ooh
Vulture
Vulture
Vulture
Vulture
Whoa
Oh...1Embed
