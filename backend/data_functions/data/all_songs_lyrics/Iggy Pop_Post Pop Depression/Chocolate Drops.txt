Chocolate Drops Lyrics
When your love of life is an empty beach
Don't cry (Don't cry)
When your enemy has you in his reach
Don't die (Don't die)
When is painful to express the things you feel
(Inside)
When it hurts to share because they're bare and real
(So real)
So when everyday is judgement day, I won't pray
(Don't pray)
When there's no-one to share that empty chair, well OK
(Okay)

When you get to the bottom
You're near the top
The shit turns into chocolate drops
When you get to the bottom
You're near the top
The shit turns into chocolate drops

Drops
So fly (So fly)
So fly (So fly)
When your love of life is an empty beach
(Don't cry)
When is painful to express the things you feel
(Inside)

When you get to the bottom
You're near the top
The shit turns into chocolate drops
When you get to the bottom
You're near the top
The shit turns into chocolate drops

There is nothing in the stars if you fail to move
There is nothing in the dark, it's just some old excuse
Hanging on, let it go!2Embed
