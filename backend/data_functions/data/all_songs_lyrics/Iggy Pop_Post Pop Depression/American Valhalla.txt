American Valhalla Lyrics
I have no plans
I have no debts
The mind is not the carefree set
I'm looking for American Valhalla
So if it passes by
Give me a holler, please

I've shot my gun
I've used my knife
This hasn't been an easy life
I'm hoping for American Valhalla
But if I have outlived my use
Please drink my juice

Innocence
It's so hard to figure it out
Innocence
It's so hard to figure it out
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
It's so hard to figure it out
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Where is American Valhalla?
Death is the pill that's tough to swallow
Is there anybody in there?
Who do I have to kill?
I'm not the man with everything
I've nothing, but my name

Lowly, lowly deeds
That no one sees
Lowly, lowly deeds
That no one sees

Where is American Valhalla
Death is the pill that's hard to swallow
Is anybody in there?
And can I bring a friend?
I'm not the man with everything
I've nothing, but my name

I've nothing, but my name
I've nothing, but my name
I've nothing, but my name
I've nothing, but my name2Embed
