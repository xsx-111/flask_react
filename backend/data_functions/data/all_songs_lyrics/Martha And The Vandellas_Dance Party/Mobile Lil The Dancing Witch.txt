Mobile Lil The Dancing Witch Lyrics
Work out Lil
Keep stirring in the pot now
Mobile Lil keeps dancing hot

Now down in Mobile, there's a witch named Lil
The plainest witch I know
She don't do no evil spellin' or fortune tellin'
She just works out dancing more droves 
Now, Lil created the Pony, the Watusi
The Mashed Potatoes and the Fly
And at a certain hour, she's got the power
To make all the dancing start
Talkin' about

Mobile Lil, the dancing witch
Asking people if they're dancing here
Work out Lil
Keep stirring in the pot now
Mobile Lil keeps dancing hot

When the band starts groovin' and your feet start movin'
And you feel that you just can't stop
Now, don't be alarmed, it's just a magic charm
That Lil whipped up in her pot
She'll put in some snake thighs, some more lies
Frog lips and monkey hips
Fish arms and zombie eyes
She uses for some lucky charms
Talkin' about
Mobile Lil, the dancing witch
Asking people if they're dancing here
Come on Lil
Keep stirring in the pot now
Mobile Lil keeps dancing hot

Come on Lil (Mobile Lil)
(Keep stirring in the pot now)
Keep stirring in your pot, now
(Mobile Lil keeps dancing hot)
Come on, Lil (Work out, Lil)
(Keep stirring in the pot now)Embed
