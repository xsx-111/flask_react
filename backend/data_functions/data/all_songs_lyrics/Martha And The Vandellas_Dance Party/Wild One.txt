Wild One LyricsWild one
Wild one
Wild one
You're a rebel
And they say you're just no good
But they might change their mind
If they only understood
Wild one
I understand
I know you've never had a chance
You're a victim of circumstance
Can't you see
Just where you stand with me
I've given you my heart
I've given it to you
Don't you know where you go
I will follow you
So fight if you wanna
And go where you wanna
Be wild as can be
But save your love for me
Save your love for me
Wild one
Just let them talk
Be what you wanna be
Forget your love for me and find security
Wild one
You know that in my heart
You're the only one
No matter what you've done
Can't you see
Just here
You stand with me
I've given you my heart
I've given you my heart
Don't you know where you go
I will follow you
So fight if you wanna
And go where you wanna
Be wild as can be
But save your love for me
Save your love for meEmbed
