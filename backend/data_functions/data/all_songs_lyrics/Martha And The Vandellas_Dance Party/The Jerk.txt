The Jerk LyricsCome on everybody
Got a new kind of groove
It ain't hard to do
'Cause your feet don't move
Come on
Hold your hands up high (Hold your hands up high)
And kiss your troubles goodbye (Kiss your troubles goodbye)
Shake your hips (Shoop shoop)
You're on your own (Shoop shoop)
Just like your back ain't got no bone, hey baby
Now let your backbone slip
Like an old bullwhip
Come on, jerk, you're lookin' good
Now your feet don't move (Your feet don't move)
But you're in the groove (But you're in the groove)
Swing your hips 'cross your chest (Shoop shoop)
And let your back do the rest (Shoop shoop)
Whether you're young or old, you're as good as gold
Doin' the jerk, we got a thing going
Come on
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Come on (Come on)
Now, it's nothing new (Now, it's nothing new)
Something everyone can do (Everyone can do)
Come on, jerk (Shoop shoop)
Jerk and shake (Shoop shoop)
And pray that you're back on break
Hey baby (Shoop shoop)
Ain't nothin' to it
If your baby can do it
Come on, jerk (Jerk, jerk, jerk)
Now let your backbone slip
Like an old bullwhip
Come on, jerk, jerk, jerk
Whether you're young or old
You're as good as gold
Come on, jerk, jerk, jerkEmbed
