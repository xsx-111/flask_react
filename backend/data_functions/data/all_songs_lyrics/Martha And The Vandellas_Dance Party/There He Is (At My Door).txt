There He Is (At My Door) Lyrics
There he is at my door
I just can't let him in
Because I know that's when
Heartaches will start again

He keeps on knockin' at my door
(There he is)
He just came back to hurt me some more
I'm tryin' so hard not to hear
'Cause I know he don't really care

Maybe this time he'll say
He's gonna see things my way
And he won't ever stray or ever go away
Maybe he'll stay

But I hate to take that chance
(There he is)
Of opening that door
Because if I see him again
I know my foolish heart will let him win
Baby, this time he'll say
He's gonna see things my way

So I'm gonna push my pride aside
Put on a great big smile
So he won't know
I've been crying all the while

Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
Baby there's nothing I can do
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
Baby walk on through
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
If he walks on in
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
I know, I know, I know, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
If you walk on in
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
My foolish side will let you in
Baby, baby, baby, walk on in
If you walk on itEmbed
