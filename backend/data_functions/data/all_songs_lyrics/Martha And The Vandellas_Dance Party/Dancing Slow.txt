Dancing Slow LyricsDancing slow, lights are low
Soft music fills the air
No, I, I don't really care if the people stop and stare
We're floating on air
We're dancing slow, his arms around me
No, I don't really care
As long (oh yeah) as me and baby (oh yeah) are dancing slow
(Dancing slow)
I wanna say I'm giving up that wine dinner
And all that jumping around
'Cause it's time to settle down
I wanna dance slow, slow and easy, baby
No, you don't really have to move
All you gotta do is sway, sway with the groove
No need, need, baby, but dancing slow
Let's sing a song one time
We're dancing slow, lights down low
Nothing sweet as a groovy beat
Music everywhere, and we don't care
If the people stop and stare
We're dancing slow, his arms around me
Oh, I, I don't really care
Just as long as me and baby, we're dancing slow
I don't need no maybe
Oh, as long as me and baby, we're dancing slow
It's all groovin', come on
Dancing slow, lights down low
Nothing as sweet as a groovy beatEmbed
