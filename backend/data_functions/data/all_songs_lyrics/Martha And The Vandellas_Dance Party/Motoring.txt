Motoring LyricsHey everybody!
Come on let's go for a ride!
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)!
Grab your baby and put em right by your side!
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)!
Going over main-street and then we're going over the hill
(Motoring) motor baby!
Now we are going to have a lot of fun!
Turn your motor on and let it run!
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)!
Now put both hands on the wheel!
Like a real good driver should!
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)
Now lock your doors, make sure you check your hood
Be sure you're not moving too fast, we want this thing to last
(Motoring) motor baby
When it starts to rain
Turn your wipers on (woo!)
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)
Turn your motor on and rev if up fast!
Now put it in gear and step on the gas!
Now you're motoring
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)
Hey everybody!
Come on let's go for a ride!
(Motoring) motor baby (motoring)
Grab your baby and put em right by your side!
Now we are gonna motor all night long!
And when it starts to rain turn your wipers on (woo!)
Now we are gonna have a lot of fun!
Turn on your motor and let it run (woo)!Embed
