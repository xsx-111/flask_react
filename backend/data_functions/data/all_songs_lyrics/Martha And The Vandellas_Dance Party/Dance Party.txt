Dance Party Lyrics
Vandellas!
Dance party!
Vandellas!
Dance party!

We're inviting one and all
To gather around and have a ball
'Cause there's a party tonight
And everything's gonna be alright

There'll be no drag, no falls
There'll be no sneaking out
We're gonna jump and shout at the dance party
(Vandellas!
Dance party!
Vandellas!
Dance party!)

Come on my friend, forget your blues
Put on your dancin' shoes
'Cause there's a very good chance
That you will find romance
There'll be some dancing
Friends and we're chancing
There'll be some romancing at at the dance party
(Vandellas!
Dance party!
Vandellas!
Dance party!)
Come on, my my my my my my my
Oh, baby

Come on to our dance (Vandellas!)
Party (Dance party!)
(Vandellas!)
(Dance party!)

Now we're inviting one and all
To gather around and have a ball
'Cause there's a party tonight
And everything's gonna be alright

There'll be no drag, no falls
There'll be no sneaking out
We're gonna jump and shout at the dance
(Vandellas!
Dance party!)
Party
(Vandellas!
Dance party!)
Come on (Vandellas!)
Come on, come on (Dance party!)
To my party (Vandellas!)
(Dance party!)
Come on (Vandellas!)
(Dance party!)Embed
