All I Can LyricsThe sun is at stake
And I'm at your window
Beyond all sleep
And I can't speak
In all Tokyo
Translate memories
That I cannot free
But what will it take?
We all make mistakes
We all try to free
The sighs of the past
We don't want to last
Need love erase to let out my mind?
Wanting to love as new as I can
Wanting to show
I want my scars to help and heal
How much you wanted
So much you found
Try not to beg too much to be
Calling my heart and know you are real
But my memory steals every moment I can feel
What will it take?
We all make mistakes
Even though I try to 'stand
Even though it's slowly
I do all I can
But who is my man?
The memory or you?
The love or the due?
To carry a face (I cannot re-trace)?
I do all I can
We all make mistakesEmbed
