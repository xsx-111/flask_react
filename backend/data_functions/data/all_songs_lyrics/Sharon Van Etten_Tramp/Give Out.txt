Give Out LyricsThere were your eyes
In the dark of the room
The only ones shining
The only set I had met in years
It's not because I always look down
It might be I always look out
It might be I always look out
I am biting my lip
As confidence is speaking to me
I loosen my grip from my palm
Put it on your knee
In my way, I say
You're the reason why I'll move to the city
Or why I'll need to leave
You're the reason why I'll move to the city
Or why I'll need to leave
There was your breath
On the back of my neck
The only one holding
The only one I had felt in years
It's not because I always hold on
It might be I always hold out
It might be I always hold out
I'm biting my lip
As confidence is speaking to me
I loosen my grip from my palm
And put it on your knee
In my way, I say
You're the reason why I'll move to the city
Or why I'll need to leave
You're the reason why I'll move to the city
Or why I'll need to leave
So what's with the eyes in the back of the room?
The only ones trying
The only ones I have let in years
It's not because I always give up
It might be I always give out
It might be I always give out
It might be I always give out
It might be I always give out3Embed
