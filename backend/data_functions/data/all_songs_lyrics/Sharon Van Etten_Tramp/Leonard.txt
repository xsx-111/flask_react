Leonard Lyrics
There he goes
He finally closed the door
I turn the lock feeling more confused than before
What gives?
I thought that you would love more
Now you're a coward, sure
Then he rings
Look in his eyes
He loves you

Well, well, I am bad
Well, well, hell, I am bad

He's smart
He leaves me wanting more
Knowing that I gave less
And knowing why
Time, time is what I would need
Full of myself indeed
Just walk away
Surprised
He loved you
Well, well, I am bad
Well, well, hell, I am bad at loving

Trust
You know that I trusted you
But I cannot let you do, to just fall in
Try
I wanted to try for you
Wanted to die for you
Dramatic things
The lies
I loved you

Well, well, I am bad
Well, well, hell, I am bad at loving you

Surprised
Just look in my eyesEmbed
