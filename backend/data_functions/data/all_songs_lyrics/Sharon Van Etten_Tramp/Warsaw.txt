Warsaw LyricsYou, when you listen
In a color of sorrow
You're over me
You, with eyes through me
Leaning torwards, but not giving in wholly
You, you're something
You mean something
Genuinely, showing me
Genuinely open to you
Here, sing me yourself
Tell me you want to be shown or
You only listen
To an endless sea you want to be over
He is over you
He is over you
I want to be over you
I want to show you
Pull me over you
Arms are over you
I want to show you
I love you silently1Embed
