In Line LyricsI was a child
I wasn't worried
Tempted in dark
Waiting for love
I was late
Don't let love wait
And don't let love weigh anything
When you were on my side
The world was shitty then
All gray
To my right I look to you
Telling me what to do
Tumbling right into ghosts
It's not such a sin
Thought you should know
I was just a child then
Standing in my own line
In line
In line
In line
In line
In line
In line
See the light in line
Distant light in line
And now it's coming through
It's coming through
It's coming through
It's coming through
Even in line
I wait for another
Don't you?Embed
