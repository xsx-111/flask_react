We Are Fine Lyrics
Trying hard to breathe
Head between my knees
Take my hand and squeeze
Say I'm alright

Whisper in my ear
Happy you are here
Everything seems clear
And we're alright, we're alright

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight
You are walking in my guided light
Take my hand and help me not to shake
Say I'm alright, I'm alright
Say I'm alright, I'm alright

It's okay to feel
Everything is real
Nothing left to steal
Cause we're alright, we're alright

Tell me not to trip or to lose sight
You are walking in my guided light
Take my hand and help me not to shake
Say I'm alright, I'm alright
Say I'm alright, I'm alright1Embed
