Magic Chords Lyrics
You're talking too loud
Won't you walk over, whisper
Motion hands, or bat a lash?
You gotta see there's too many eyes
You're walkin' too fast
Why the hurry, let me pace myself
No need to run a lap, you gotta lead
You gotta lead
You gotta lead

You got to lose
You got to lose
You got to lose, sometime
You got to lose
You got to lose
You got to lose, sometime

Hear what I say
When you waltz over, whistle
And you try to have your way
You gotta see you felt the same
You come in today
With a hop in your step
You kinda marvel at yourself
You gotta breathe
You gotta breathe

Cowardice
You felt it yourself
You're tellin' lies
You said too much

You got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose, this time
You got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing to lose, this time
You got nothing to lose
Nothing to lose
Nothing to loseEmbed
