Fortune Teller LyricsWent to the fortune teller
Had my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head
Took a look at my palm
She said, "Son, you feel kind of warm"
She looked into a crystal ball
She said, "You're in love"
How could that be so?
I thought of all the girls I know
She said, "When the next one arrives
You'll be looking into her eyes"
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Mmm
Left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next day I discovered
That the fortune teller told me a lie
I hurried back down to that woman
As mad as I could be
I said I didn't see nobody
Why had she made a fool out of me?
Then something struck me
As if it came from up above
While looking at the fortune teller
I fell in love
Ah ah ahaha
Ah ah ahaha
Ah ah ahaha
Ah ah ahaha
Now I'm a happy feller
'Cause I'm married to the fortune teller
And I'm as happy as we can be
And now I get my fortune told for free
Ah ah ahaha
Ah ah ahaha
Ah ah ahaha
Ah ah ahaha
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Ooh, yeah
Oh oh, yeah
Ooh, yes, I did
Oh oh oh, oh yeah1Embed
