Stick with Me Baby LyricsEverybody's been talkin'
They say our love wasn't real
That it would soon be over
That's not the way I feel
But I don't worry, honey
Let them say what they may
Come on and stick with me, baby
We'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way
Everybody's been talkin'
Yes, the news travels fast
They said the fire would stop burnin'
That the flame wouldn't last
But I don't worry, honey
Let them say what they may
Come on and stick with me, baby
We'll find a way
Yes, we'll find a way
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, baby
Come on and stick with me, babyEmbed
