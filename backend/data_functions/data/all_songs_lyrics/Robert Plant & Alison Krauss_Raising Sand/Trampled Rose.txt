Trampled Rose LyricsLong way going to get my medicine
Sky's the autumn grey of a lonely wren
Piano from a window played
Gone tomorrow, gone yesterday
I found it in the street, at first, I did not see
Lying at my feet, a trampled rose
Passing the hat in church
It never stops going round
You never pay just once
To get the job done
What I done to me, I done to you
What happened to the trampled rose?
In the muddy street
With the fireworks and leaves
A blind man with a cup, I asked
Would he sing 'Kisses Sweeter Than Wine'
I know this rose like I know my name
The one I gave my love, it was the same
Now I find it in the street
A trampled roseEmbed
