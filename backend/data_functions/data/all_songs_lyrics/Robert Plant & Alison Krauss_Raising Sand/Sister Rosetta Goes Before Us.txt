Sister Rosetta Goes Before Us LyricsStrange things are happening everyday
I hear the music up above my head
Though the sight of my heart has left me again
I hear music up above
Secrets are written in the sky
Looks like I've lost the love I've never found
Though the sound of hope has left me again
I hear music up above
Standing in my broken heart all night long
Darkness held me like a friend when love wore off
Looking for the lamb that's hidden in the cross
The finder's lost
I know I loved you too much
I'll go alone to get through
I hear Rosetta singing in the night
Echoes of light that shine like stars after they're gone
And tonight she's my guide as I go on alone
With the music up aboveEmbed
