Killing the Blues LyricsLeaves were falling just like embers
In colors red and gold, they set us on fire
Burning just like a moonbeam in our eyes
Somebody said they saw me
Swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud
Killing the blues
Now I'm guilty of something
I hope you never do, because there is nothing
Sadder than losing yourself in love
Somebody said they saw me
Swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud
Killing the blues
Now you ask me just to leave you
To go out on my own and get what I need to
You want me to find what I've already had
Somebody said they saw me
Swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud
Killing the blues
Somebody said they saw me
Swinging the world by the tail
Bouncing over a white cloud
Killing the bluesEmbed
