Through the Morning, Through the Night LyricsBelieve me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me, little darling
Through the morning, through the night
The bond has been broken
The promise you gave
The words that were spoken
"I cannot be your slave."
But to know that the trust you had in me is gone
Hurts me, little darling
Through the nighttime, through the dawn
I dreamed just last night
You were there by my side
Your sweet, loving tenderness
Easing my pride
But then I awoke, dear, and found you not there
It was just my old memory of how much I care
Believe me when I tell you
I will try to understand
Believe me when I tell you
I could never kill a man
But to know that another man's holding you tight
Hurts me little, darling
Through the morning, through the nightEmbed
