Gone, Gone, Gone (Done Moved On) LyricsSome sunny day, baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find that you're alone
'Cause I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone, gone
'Cause you done me wrong
And everyone that you meet, baby
As you walk down the street, baby
Will ask you why you're walkin' all alone
Why you're on your own
Just say I'm gone
Gone, gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone
'Cause you done me wrong
Ooohhh now
Come on, yeah
Ah
Ah
And if you change your way, baby
You might get back to stay, baby
You better hurry up if you don't wanna be alone
Or I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone, gone
'Cause you done me wrong
You done me wrong, but I'm out
Ah
Ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Some sunny day, baby
When everything seems okay, baby
You'll wake up and find that you're alone
'Cause I'll be gone
Gone, gone, gone
Really gone
Gone, gone, gone
'Cause you done me wrong
Hmm, you done me wrong
Hmm, you done me wrong
Well, well, well, well, well, well yeahEmbed
