Flatness Lyrics
Beer makes you weary
But you need something to get along
As you stare at the flatness
Beside your dark home
They'll not hear you whisper
"This isn't where it ends"
Your hand holds the bottle
Which has become your last
And only friend

And I've lost all hope
There's hope for you
If not just in the possibility
Of a better next day
If not just in the simple fact
There's no other way

You lie on that couch
And try to dream once more
But your only goal is to sleep
Until the news is over
And outside leaves are all changing
But you drink to forget
Someone you once met
Stands blocking the bright orange sunset
And I've lost all hope
There's hope for you
If not just in the possibility
Of a better next day
If not just in the simple fact
There's no other way

So open up those curtains
And drink up the daylight
Just by the brightness
Open your door wide
'Cause things don't get better
But some people do
There's darkness in this life
But the brighter side we also may view
There's darkness in this life
But the brighter side we also may viewEmbed
