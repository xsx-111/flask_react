Graveyard Shift Lyrics
Hometown, same town blues
Same old walls closing in
Oh, what a life a mess can be
I'm sitting here thinking of you, won't you give
Any thought to me?

Well, time won't wait
Better open the gate
Get out and start what needs to be done
It's winding down, there's much you missed
Working on that graveyard shift

Well, I'm not saying there's nothing wrong
As the day comes along
If what I see is true I could learn to believe
Can't look away
The powers that be
Might take it all away
Together we'll burn, together we'll burn either way

Some say a land of paradise
Some say a land of pain
Well, which side are you looking from?
Some people have it all, and some have it all to gain
Well a man in a tie'll bum your dime
'Fore he'll break his 20 dollar bill
There's plenty of reasons in this world
For movin' along or standing still

But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong
As the day comes along
If what I see is true I could learn to believe
Can't look away
The powers that be
Might take it all away
Together we'll burn, together we'll burn either way

There's too much time spent looking for a reason
It seems the simple ones beat the most truth
Oh, what a life a mess can be
I'm sitting here thinking of you, won't you give
Give a thought to me

Well, time won't wait
Better open the gate
Get out and start what needs to be done
It's winding down, there's much you missed
Working on that graveyard shift
But I'm not saying there's nothing wrong
As the day comes along
If what I see is true I could learn to believe
Can't look away
The powers that be
Might take it all away
Together we'll burn, together we'll burn away2Embed
