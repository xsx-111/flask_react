Screen Door Lyrics
Down here, where we're at
The weather changes, that's the way it goes
Sometimes it snows, when everything's wrong
Sometimes it snows, but when it does it doesn't last long

Down here, where we're at
All we do is sit out on the porch
And play our songs, and nothing's wrong
Sometimes friends come around, they all sing along

Down here, where we're at
Everybody is equally poor
Down here, we don't care
We don't care what happens
Outside the screen door

Down here, where we're at
Sweat drips from the tip of your nose
You wear loose clothes, and you try to stay cool
We all still have a lot of fun, never saw much school

Down here, where we're at
Everybody is equally poor
Down here, we don't care
We don't care what happens
Outside the screen door
The screen door
