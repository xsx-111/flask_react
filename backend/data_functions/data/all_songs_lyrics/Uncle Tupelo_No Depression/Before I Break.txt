Before I Break LyricsOn liquor I spend my last dime
Sunday morning, 8 am
Just cursing myself again
Drinking like this one might be my last
Blurred memories of making toasts
To the cheapest beer and talk-show hosts
Funny then, but that's fading fast
Here's to waking up at night
Half-drunk in a ditch by the side of the road
You're still thinking
That you can't go on like this
Headed for a breakdown
You keep saying thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I can't live
Thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I've had enough
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night
On liquor I spend my last dime
A worried man drinks a healthy drink
But he drinks nine or ten until he's done
Then he'll tell you his life story
But he won't stop until he's told you and everyone
Here's to waking up at night
Half-drunk in a ditch by the side of the road
And you're still thinking
That you can't go on like this
Before I break down
You keep saying thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I can't live
Thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I've had enough
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night
On liquor I spend my last dime
Blurred memories of making toasts
To the cheapest beer and talk-show hosts
Funny then, but it's fading fast
Here's to waking up at night
Half-drunk in a ditch by the side of the road
You're still thinking
That you can't go on like this
Headed for a breakdown
You keep saying thanks for tomorrow, I can't live
Thanks for tomorrow, 'cause I've had enough
Well, it'd do me just fine to make it through the night
On liquor I spend my last dimeEmbed
