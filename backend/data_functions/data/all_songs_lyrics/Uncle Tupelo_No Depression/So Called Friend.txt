So Called Friend Lyrics
Never again
Your so-called friend
Will leave you
Sick and dry
This friend has a name
Knows the gutter and shame
This so-called friend of you and I

Oh, great soul
The long-term goals
Are to leave this friend behind
He knows what I lack
Is a place under the sack
For every other tie that binds

This last night on the town
Might be your last above ground
And you think to yourself
"There must be a better way
Than the same routine
For more than once
You pay"
More than once, you pay
Butt full of lead
Stuck in your web
Held captive by the stream
The thoughts in your head
They made a nice bed
And you still had time to dream

This last night on the town
Might be your last above ground
And you smile
At things and wave goodbye
More excuses
To never even try
As you wave goodbye

Forget what I said
Your friend's not dead
He's only gone for a while
Come back to that crack
Between what's white and what's black
And give you one last smile

This last night on the town
Might be your last above ground
And you think to yourself
"There must be a better way
Than the same routine
For more than once
You pay"
More than once, you payEmbed
