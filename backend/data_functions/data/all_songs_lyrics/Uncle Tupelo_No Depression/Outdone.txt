Outdone Lyrics
Everything's fine for now
No one's really laughing
Everything's just all right, or is it now?
Turn up to the round
But keep moving on
We can cut the cord now
Just drag it along

Now there's too many people trying too hard
Not to be outdone
They follow close behind their proud
Smoking gun

Well, it's up to you and me whether to pay 'em any mind
Some people turn to tomorrow, and some
A bottle of wine
Remember back when there could be no wrong?
Well, it's different for everyone until it's gone

Now there's too many people trying too hard
Not to be outdone
They follow close behind their proud
Smoking gun
Things are breaking down
Not being patched up
Think it over again

The dreams come and go
But one thing remains
In the back of your mind
Won't go away
Saying, "Take a look around and tell me everything's just fine
Well, from what I can see now
We'd be fools or lying"

Now there's too many people trying too hard
Not to be outdone
They follow close behind their proud
Smoking gun

Well, they say
"Take relief
From the common heat"
First look around past the college grounds
Were people aware
Of more than themselves, they'd careEmbed
