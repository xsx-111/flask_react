Who Is It Lyrics
I gave her money, I gave her time
I gave her everything inside one heart could find
I gave her passion, my very soul
I gave her promises and secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows we'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

Who is it?
Is it a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take this stuff no more
I am the damned, I am the dead
I am the agony inside the dying head
This is injustice, woe unto thee
I pray this punishment would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows we'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see, what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
Is it my brother?
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely
Hee-hee, hee-hee
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, I never would
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

Who is it?
It is a friend of mine?
Who is it?
To me, I'm bothered
Who is it?
Somebody hurt my soul now
Who is it?
I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely

And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (You can really say I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me (Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else? (Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right (This won't cut it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure (Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day (Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away (Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night (She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day (She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter (She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away (Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune (Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else? (I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)24Embed
