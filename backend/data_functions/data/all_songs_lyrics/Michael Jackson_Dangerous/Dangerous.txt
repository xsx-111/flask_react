Dangerous Lyrics
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(You know my name!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hee-hee!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Hoo!
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Woah!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
My baby
You been, you take, uh
You don't, don't, don't
You turn, my baby
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Dan'gerus
Dan'gerus, dan'gerus
Hoo!
Dan'gerus, dan'gerus
Hoo!21Embed
