Keep the Faith Lyrics
If you called out loud
Would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis?
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
Give yourself a chance

Because you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it, brother
You got it
And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone?
And you can go by the feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try

So keep the faith (Oh)
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world ya got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be better, but you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it brother
You got it
I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has to make it right
Makes it, uh, makes it right

So keep the faith (Go)
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

And better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith
Look at yourself and what ya doin' right now
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together 'cause you got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith) Go on
Don't let nobody take you down, brother (Keep the faith)
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life
You best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got ta keep the faith

(Keep the faith) Go'n keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith (Keep the faith)
Go'n keep it sister (Keep the faith)
You got to keep the faith
Now, now

I showed my brotha
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head
And show the world you got pride
Go for what you want (Keep the faith)
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
If you keep'a the faith
Straighten out yourself (Keep your faith)
And get your mind on track (Oh yeah)
Dust off your butt
And get your self-respect back
You've known me too long (Oh yeah)
To know that I don't play (Oh yeah)
Take it like you wanna
But you got to keep the faith

(Keep the faith) Go on
Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize (Keep the faith)
And get your feet back on the ground
So keep the faith, baby, yeah (Keep the faith)
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
But til' that day
I say you've got to keep the faith (Hmmm)10Embed
