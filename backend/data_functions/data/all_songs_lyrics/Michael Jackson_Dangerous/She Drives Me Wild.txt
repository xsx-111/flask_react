She Drives Me Wild Lyrics
She's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine
She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater
I know the girl is fakin' cause
I've seen her look better
She's composition, she's statistical fact
Got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking in the back
She's got the look

She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Come to the place, shocktacy
And you know damn well you know what I mean
Hot in the face, one to three
Like a pleasure trip like you've never seen
Uh-huh!
Satin lace and a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'Cause she knows she looks hot
She's got position, she's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

Please, no, keep back, I can't take it
You're drivin' me wild
I might not make it
Uh-huh!
You got me lookin' like buckwheat, oh
Hair pulled every which way but me
Uh-huh!
Far from Medusa, but your looks are deadly
You're walkin' soft, still I hear the medley
Uh-huh!
Uh, shiver my timberland boots, cramped my style
She drives me wild

She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Ought to know better
She's got the look
And she's driving me wild6Embed
