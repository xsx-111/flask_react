Riverdeadbank LyricsLike dust
I'm lost in the world
I thought that I had a place
Between the heavens and the earth
Between the starred sky
I feel the crunch of dirt
I smell the scent of flowers
My aimless feet
To be in the world
And not a part of it
That's the aim of the pain
I'm sorry that there seems
No happiness in life
I'm sorry that there seems
No one
Passing streams
Dying dreams
There seems to be no joy
There seems to be no joy
You cannot see the ships sailing
You cannot see the sails sailing
Amassing as Christ on the horizon
Outstretched
Outstretched...1Embed
