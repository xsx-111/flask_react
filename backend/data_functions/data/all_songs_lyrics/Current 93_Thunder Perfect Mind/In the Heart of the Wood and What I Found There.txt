In the Heart of the Wood and What I Found There LyricsIn the heart of the wood
In the closed forest
Christ appeared to mein several forms
One, two, three, four
Swastika I'm told
On the cliffs of Moher, I walked with Mary
Behind the eyes of his innocence or guile
The young old man talks of the brittle walls
That held his son pinioned pinioned pinioned
Mary walks on the cliffs but not on waters
Then Christ appeared as wind
Mary runs down from the high wall
Christ appears as flowers
Down long path she walks
Christ appears as the rubble
That holds the stones
That holds the paths
That holds the feet to the bones of the earth
Oh if she waits
If she waits
If she waits
If she wakes
Christ manifests slowly
As the dust on her eyes
Before she falls again into fields of sleep
I would like this anger to dissolve
And i wait for another
Revolution or revelation
It doesn't too much matter
Whether i see blood in wheals
All shall be well she said
But not to me
Not to me
Thee skeleton of the universe
Barbed wire of bruised dead stars
Remains unmoved
When the mother ocean covers me
I rush to drown with her breakers
All shall be well she said
She said all shall be well
But not for me
But not for meEmbed
