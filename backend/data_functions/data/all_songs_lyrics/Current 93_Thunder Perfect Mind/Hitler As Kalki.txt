Hitler As Kalki LyricsThese are the dregs
Of the last grains of the age
It may be the hourglass
Of earth covering earth
But not in Bethlehem
Not in Jerusalem
Not in Chorazaim
And not in Bethsaida
We will not again see
God humbled on an ass
But see, see
On a white horse he comes
Blazing sword in burning hand
"Lo, I am become death
The destroyer of worlds"
His hands are backed up
They're straining at his neck
What colour shall we rank in him?
What face shall we deliver him?
There may be the black dog
There may be the white dog
Hitler comes as Kalki
Hitler comes as Kalki
Kalki comes as Hitler
Kalki comes as Hitler
Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth
But meaningless lights
Still hold our attention
We think that the holy books
Are written in blood and fire
But what if it's water?
The fire's turned to blood
The blood's turned to water
And the water's turned to what?
Milk? Piss? Lies? Dust?
Hitler comes as Kalki
Kalki comes as Hitler
Everything becomes emptiness
But goes through fire
Secret mother (gsang yum chen mo)
Secret father (gsang yab chen po)
Hitler becomes Kalki
Kalki becomes Hitler
White horse and red horse
Christ twists on the cross
Hitler smiles in the guttering rubble
He brings not peace but a sword
And maybe the ocean roars immaculate
Maybe the stars fall incomprehensible
Oh these all tell me
These all spell to me
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler
Where's your god now?
I'll point out his varied forms to you:
One: He hangs on the end of a tree
Two: He's nailed to the arms of
This self-same tree
And three: He spins and soars
And laughs through space
One day the world sees
One day the world sees
Hitler as Kalki
Hitler as Kalki
And he lies matted
Half in time and half in space
Through the rising incense smoke
I see him in a crowded room
I see him crossing the mountain range
If we see man at his most bloody
If we see man at his most base
Shall we point then and there:
"This is reality; this is his nature"?
What makes the pain
More real than the joy?
Both are so mingled now
And muddied together
To pull them apart
We butcher the essence
And cripple its meaning
God is on the cross
Or three gods perhaps
If they are all one
Neither coming nor going
Neither waning nor waxing
But immense in their unity
Matter and space
He rides between the spaces
And he rides between the pain
In the secret heart of becoming
In the secret modes of darkness
His eyes are now shuttered windows
Oh man, man, man, man, man
Man with his claws and his lies
With his peace and his pain
With his love and his sorrow
With his candle of hope
That stutters and dies
No liberation through hearing
When the sound of the world's collapsing
Deafens deafens deafens deafens deafens our ears
And pierces our heart
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler
Rolling and roaring
Swooping and soaring
Exultant and trembling
Sorrow sorrow sorrow
Where the eagle flies
Where the eagle shudders
Where the eagle drops
Where the eagle plummets
All things merging, dissolving
Then stars collapse
The vortex commences in space
The rubble collects
The debris gathers
Time starts to shiver
My heart's blood
If I dissolve into your body
If I hope to find
White light in your soul
If together we fall into forever
Would we not notice the turbulence
That no longer waits?
First he comes
From on a hill
Then he's running
Throughout the town
Then he stands
Devoid of peace
Devoid of place
Devoid of pity
Oh my dear Christ
Carried broken from sad, brown earth
Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth. Teeth
Hitler as Kalki
Hitler as Kalki
Kalki as Hitler
Hitler as Kalki
Hitler as Kalki
