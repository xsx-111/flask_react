Thunder Perfect Mind I LyricsI am the first and the last
I am the honored one and the scorned one
I am the whore and the holy one
I am the wife and the virgin
I am the mother and the daughter
I am the members of my mother
I am the barren one and many are her sons
I am she whose wedding is great and I have not taken a husband
I am the midwife and she who does not bear
I am the solace of my labor pains
I am the bride and the bridegroom and it is my husband who begot me
I am the mother of my father and the sister of my husband and he is my offspring
I am the slave of him who prepared me
I am the ruler of my offspring
But he is the one who begot me before the time on a birthday
And he is my offspring in due time and my power is from him
I am the staff of his power in his youth and he is the rod of my old age
And whatever he wills happens to me
I am the silence that is incomprehensible and the idea
Whose remembrance is frequent
I am the voice whose sound is manifold and the word whose appearance is multiple
For i am knowledge and ignorance
I am shame and boldness
I am shameless I am ashamed
I am strength and I am fear
I am war1Embed
