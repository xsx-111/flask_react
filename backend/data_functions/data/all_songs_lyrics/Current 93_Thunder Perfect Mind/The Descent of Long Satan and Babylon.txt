The Descent of Long Satan and Babylon LyricsLong Satan and Babylon are walking
They're talking of fire and of ice
Of the silence that stalks in the forest
And a Christ spun out of the worlds
Long Satan and Babylon are moving
Through a world ripped away from its center
They shear through the rushes
They follow the night night night night
They want want want want want want
Everything
Long Satan and Babylon are rushing
They are hurtling away
From the center of things
They are running from the inside
The wind cries full and in them
Cuts through their emptiness
Hoof on stone
Claw against sun
Where to look in an unknown
Where to search in the vast whole
Piggy-back cross oh piggy-black cross
Into the silence thundering
As they only hear the silence
They do not hear the pain
But Christ sees everything
The little children are falling
They'll topple till the end of the world
Long Satan and Babylon keep running
Through a universe empty of sound
Though the world makes dark shadows
You must look in your heart
In the dark
You must look in your heartEmbed
