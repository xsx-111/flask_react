Rosy Star Tears from Heaven LyricsThere are broken birds scattered over the white cliffs of Dover
Once i read and so i thought
(Firstly the red dragon rises in the east)
So i sat and still i thought
(Then the white dragon rises from the north)
I start to walk and my mind turns
(Out of clouds a smoke-ish dragon rises from the west)
It seems to me the world is dying
(Smiling teeth and black dragon rises in the south)
Whilst rosy stars fall from heaven
(Turn to starry roses in greening grasses)
Burnt burning smiles lovers' tokens
(Soft white breasts unveiling nature)
My mother sighs my father lies
(With scattered pebbles dying horses)
The moon is violent violent and vaporous
(Seas of horses buildings tumble)
Once i read and so i thought
(Firstly the red dragon rises in the east)
I shall move and still i'll think
(Then the white dragon rises from the north)
All this world is such a bind
(Out of clouds a smoke-ish dragon from the west)
It seems to me people smile
(Smiling teeth and black dragon rises in the south)
Whilst rosy stars fall from heaven
(Turn to starry roses in greening grasses)
Burnt burning smiles lovers' tokens
(Soft white breasts unveiling nature)
My mother sighs my father lies
(Scattered pebbles the world falls)
The moon is violent violent and vaporous
(Seas of horses part for me)Embed
