All the Stars Are Dead Now LyricsBloody smoke
Foggy smoke
Beginnings and endings...
There's a heart of the world
In the bowed bony Burren
There's a trip-hole to her heart
In soaring Sn√¶fellsness
And the crack of the world
The moist ruddy lips of her
Thee slit of the mother fallen
Sliced from the stars
By the slicing discus
At Kamarupa
At Kamarupa
At Kamarupa
From her mouth at the end
Of the worlds
From her mouth at the end
Of the times
The shapes that form the ends
Of the wheelings
The forces that shape the forms
Of the breaths
That cover the clouds
Of the green world's last dancing's
Flicker forth like spring-heeled jackals
All laughing and bloody and wrathful
And peaceful and shining and pallid
And burning and liquid and sadness
And joy
And joy
(Mansour is smiling teethly at the stars
John sits on the stairs with me
His eyes are shining -
Mother - come to me)
Little lovely licking tongues of fire
Smiling and slyly emerge from the stones
The air is now very very viscous
In the distance Sunday children play pipes
The air is now very violent
Birds do not fill the air
Laughing does not fill the air
No bodies fill the air
But the sun filters slowly through the air
As if it has turned to sticky sweet mud
All flowers die
Except for some few
A chain of burning bloody flowers
Follow my eyes crying tears
(Lilith is smiling at the corpse of a cow
And in that corpsey cow
The corpse of another
And so on and so on
And perhaps forever
If times were not folding and falling
Over each other
And so on and so on and so on
And certainly endless)
Mene mene tekel upharsin
We have been weighed and lost
We have been weighed and lost
(I slept I dreamt I dreamed a dream:
London bright fires smiling and burning
Light roads road through the starlacked night
Many dark suns are falling falling down
London Bridge is destroyed)
In my mind pigs and rubble gnaw
In the dark heights and hearts of Albion
Shudderings in the heart
Cruelty in the heart
And this is over
All over now
In Kamarupa
In Kamarupa
My eyes my mind spinning
Spinning back and forth
Eyes in London
Mind in a hole
Oh they come they come
They run out
Fleeing from what
They come out running
Running
Great Babylon has fallen fallen fallen
Jerusalem has fallen fallen fallen
The great great beast
Is dead dead dead dead
Simon, Simon is dead dead dead dead
And some other bleeding children
Are smiling
They're dead in the rubble
They're dead dead dead dead
And Mercury rises
And Mercury falls
And how dead dead dead dead
Dead dead are you
Summertime
When the living is easy
Summertime
When the dying is easy
The world shudders on
Black tree against a bruised blue sky
The fairground is all shabby and silent
Red sky at night
Red sky at night
Danger
Christ is crying
Christ's tears leaving
His heart and night
All the many faces we have worn
All the many faces we have borne
And dead dead dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead dead are we
Though once I thought
Oh once I read
The hidden god plays hide and seek
Whilst others still run from him
From the world's stomach
The goddies emerge
And who comes to judge us
And who comes to push us
The bloody master
Is bloody dead dead dead
And who comes to strike us
And who comes to hold us
Where is his colour
Where is her cover
And What is her nature
And where does he shine from
(Broken birds move through the air -
They all drink blood)
When Christ smiles his smile is broken
Holly ivy old dead trees
Dead dead dead
Holy and ivy dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead
Rainbow lovely arc lovely lights
Dead dead dead dead
Horn stag cross meets hunter
Dead dead dead dead
(Oh Saint Eustace ora pro nobis)
Old woman old woman old woman
Old and dead dead dead dead
Now no summers left
This side of boxwood
Crosses broken in my midsummer
The south is dying
The north is dying
The west is dying
The east is dying
There are four corners to the world she said
And every one
Is dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead dead
And all the planets
They're dead dead dead dead
And all my heart
Is dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead dead dead dead
Dead dead dead dead dead dead dead
It's all dead dead deadEmbed
