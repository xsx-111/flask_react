Guilty as Charged Lyrics
Angel in the courtroom, eagle on the ceiling
My baby's sitting front row, witnessing my hearing
I tried to burn the record book collection
I tampered with the local lie detection

I'm guilty as charged
I'm guilty as charged
You know I'm guilty as charged
Go on and punish me

But if I gave you what you're asking for
You know you wouldn't want it anymore
If I gave you what you're asking for
You know you wouldn't want it anymore

So I won't
No, no, no, no, no, I won't
So I won't
No, no, no, no, no, I won't

Footprints in the carpet, cameras on the ceiling
My baby's swearing on the bible in stolen golden earrings
The creaky floor set off the fire alarm
And I never wanted to do any harm
But I'm guilty as charged
I'm guilty as charged
I'm guilty as charged
You know I'm guilty as charged
Go on and punish me

But if I gave you what you're asking for
You know you wouldn't want it anymore
If I gave you what you're asking for
You know you wouldn't want it anymore

So I won't
No, no, no, no, no, I won't
So I won't
No, no, no, no, no, I won'tEmbed
