Wrong Opinion Lyrics
Overhead and underfoot
If you cut it down, then it'll never grow
I lay my guts out on the table
Lay my guts out and she said no
You got a wrong opinion
Wrong opinion

If you don't get it
You don't get to have it
If you don't get it, it's fine by me
'Cause I see sun
I see sun

Over the counter, underground
And through the world that you will never know
But to stay and contemplate could make you late
So you take a photo
You got a wrong opinion
Wrong opinion

If you don't get it
You don't get to have it
If you don't get it, it's fine by me
If you don't get it
You don't get to have it
If you don't get it, it's fine by me
'Cause I see sun
I see sun
You don't get it
You don't get it

Yeah, the leaves grow where light goes
I see the sun rising over the edge
Did you miss it or ignore it?
I see beginning where you see the end
Yeah, the leaves grow where light goes
I see the sun rising over the edge
Did you miss it or ignore it?
I see beginning where you see the end

I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun
I see sun...3Embed
