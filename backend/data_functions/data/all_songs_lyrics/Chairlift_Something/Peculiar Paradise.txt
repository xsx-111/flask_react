Peculiar Paradise Lyrics
I'm in hiding
In peculiar paradise
In the shadows
Of electrical lanterns
Wearing blinders
Every time that you call me up
As if pictures
Spoke louder than action

I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise
I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise

I'm a hostage
Of a shyness that no one knows
So forgive me
If I never answer
The extension
Of your invitation
Is so intriguing
But, oh, what a hassle
I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise
I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise

Come on, come on, come on, you said
Don't be a stranger
Come on, come on
Self-defense is the ultimate danger

I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise
I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise
I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradise
I kick you out of my heart, but you get back in
Into peculiar paradiseEmbed
