Grown Up Blues Lyrics
In the waiting line where I'm paying dues
Got the grown up blues
Got the grown up blues
At the dinner party, at the DMV
Got the grown up blues
Got the grown up blues

When you talk to me as one
When you talk to me as one
When you talk to me as one
When you talk to me like one

I can never see how, will I ever get out
Now I know how it all got this way
From the inside and out, I know what it's all about
Each of us is the same in our way
A lonely madness inside is what they're trying to hide
What they can't goes all away
It's a story to wake up to each day
It's a story to wake up to each day

On the cellophane, on the BCC
Got the grown up blues
Got the grown up blues
It's the bottom line of the bigger picture
Be a lady, be gentleman
When you talk to me as one
When you talk to me as one
When you talk to me as one
When you talk to me like one

I can never see how, will I ever get out
Now I know how it all got this way
From the inside and out, I know what it's all about
Each of us is the same in our way
A lonely madness inside is what they're trying to hide
And what they can't goes all away
Is a story to wake up to each day
Is a story to wake up to each day1Embed
