Take It Out on Me Lyrics
You're here, early but here
On a morning so clear and blue
Is fate up for debate?
And does my love only count if it's proved?

Forget forgiveness, forget all the rules
Just please don't do it here
Bring on the fire, 'cause business is cruel
And Sophie's got somewhere to be

I'm not afraid
So take me outside
I know what you're here to do
Shotgun up familiar sleeves
Undercover but nobody's fooled, no
Got no time, no time for goodbyes
Oh god, just let my love survive

Forget forgiveness, forget all the rules
Just please don't do it here (Don't do it here)
Bring on the fire, 'cause business is cruel
And Sophie's got somewhere to be
Take it out on me
Take it out on me
Forget forgiveness, forget all the rules
Just please don't do it here (Don't do it here)
Bring on the fire, 'cause business is cruel
Just please don't do it here
Take it out on me
Take it out on me (Please don't do it here, don't do it here)
Bring on the fire, 'cause business is cruel
And Sophie's got somewhere to be
Take it out on me
Take it out on me1Embed
