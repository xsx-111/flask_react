Amanaemonesia Lyrics
You lost your focus, but I got a plan for it
With a secret ingredient
And you are infinitely invited
Just leave alone the Geminis
Two of them and four of eyes
And you are infinitely invited

(No one could not agree)
It's unanimously decided
(They've come for you and me)
That we are dangerously surrounded
(Their boats are full of flames)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(They paint the grasses green)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(Repeating history)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(They don't say what they mean)

Is it amnesia? Amanaemonesia?
Mistaken for magic?
(Mistaken for magic)
Silver hours, silver hours
Becoming a habit?
(Chasing the rabbit)
Is it amnesia? Amanaemonesia?
Mistaken for magic?
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
Spacing out in a nook and cranny
It's officially uncanny
It's a fish in a sea of granite
Just leave alone the Geminis
Two of them and four of I's

(No one could not agree)
It's unanimously decided
(They've come for you and me)
That we are dangerously surrounded
(Their boats are full of flames)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(They paint the grasses green)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(Repeating history)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
(They don't say what they mean)

Is it amnesia? Amanaemonesia?
Mistaken for magic?
(Mistaken for magic)
Silver hours, silver hours
Becoming a habit?
(Chasing the rabbit)
Is it amnesia? Amanaemonesia?
Mistaken for magic?
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
There's a system of symbols that no one will vouch for
Everyone uses and no one believes
There's a dog in the yard with a manner that's rough
Yet there's something about you that he understands
The girl at the window covered in ashes
Smiles grotesquely in the light of the day
Singing in German, the cold summer warning
But I can't remember what I meant to say

Is it amanaemonesia?
(Mistaken for magic)
Amanaemonesia
Oh-oh, oh
(Chasing the rabbit)
Amanaemonesia
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)
(Mistaken for magic)8Embed
