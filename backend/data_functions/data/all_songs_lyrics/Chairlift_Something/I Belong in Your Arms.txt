I Belong in Your Arms Lyrics
Crossing my heart, open wide
You're my crystal and clover
All of me, honestly
Is dedicated to hold you

Swear to god, double knot
What would you do if I stole you tonight? (Ah ah)
Why waste time? (Ah ah)

'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I-I-I belong in your arms
I-I-I belong in your arms

Feelings are good, nothing to say
Just want my head on your shoulder
Banana split, honestly
You're my remote controller, ah ah

Between you and me, suddenly
Something, something, something
Is on my mind
'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes and no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I-I-I belong in your arms
I-I-I belong in your arms

(Ay)
Woo!
(Ay)

'Cause the world goes on without us
It doesn't matter what we do
All silhouettes with no regrets
When I'm melting into you
'Cause I-I-I belong in your arms
I-I-I belong in your arms

I belong
I belong3Embed
