Met Before Lyrics
Did I just catch your eyes?
Like familiar fish in the water
It could be anywhere that we've passed each other by
Were you at that one party?
The one up on the ninth floor
Were you the quiet one who stopped to hold the door?

Have we met before?
Amongst the buzzing of billions
Clear like yesterday
When you look at me and smile

Was that you on the screen?
Or just in line for the movie
'Cause my heart is beating fast
And I wish that I knew why

Have we met before?
Amongst the buzzing of billions
Clear like yesterday
When you look at me and smile
Have we met before?
Amongst the buzzing of billions
Clear like yesterday
When you look at me and-

Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-da-ba-ba, ba-ba-da-da-ba-ba

Have we met before?
Amongst the buzzing of billions
Clear like yesterday
When you look at me and smile
Have we met before?
Amongst the buzzing of billions
Clear like yesterday
When you look at me and smile
Oh, you look at me and smile
Oh, you look at me and smile1Embed
