Ghost Tonight Lyrics
Tell me, can you see
See the walls through me?
'Cause how could a love so crazy be, oh, so easy to ignore?

Hollow, heavy eyes, woah-woah
Follow in your light, woah-woah
I'm a ghost tonight, woah-oh-oh, woah
Woah-oh-oh, woah

The starry night is clear
Can you feel me near?
Under the bed, I disappear
Like a secret that you know
Some wounds never mend
Lilies bloom and bend
White as teeth, I swim beneath the footsteps in the hall

My hollow, heavy eyes, woah-woah
Follow in your light, woah-woah
I'm a ghost tonight, woah-oh-oh, woah
Woah-oh-oh, woah
Yeah, 'cause my heart is a stone
Until you make it right
I could live forever, forever, forever, forever
So tell me, can you see
See the walls through me?

Hollow, heavy eyes, woah-woah
Follow in your light, woah-woah
I'm a ghost tonight, woah-oh-oh, woah

Oh, no, no, no
'Cause my heart is a stone
Until you make it right
I could live forever, forever, forever, forever

So tell me, can you see
See the walls through me?
'Cause how could a love so crazy be, oh, so easy to ignore?1Embed
