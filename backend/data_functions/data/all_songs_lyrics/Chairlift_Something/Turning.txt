Turning Lyrics
In the dark we unroll an inner vision
I'm turning into someone else
The cage starts fitting
There's something in the water
I'm turning into someone else

I never thought I could reach this far
I never thought I could reach this

In the dark we unroll an inner vision
I'm turning into someone else
The cage starts fitting
There's something in the water
I'm turning into someone else

I never thought I could reach this far
I never thought I could reach this

In the dark we unroll an inner vision
I'm turning into someone else
The cage starts fitting
There's something in the water
I'm turning into someone else
(To someone else)
I could reach this far (In the dark we unroll)
I never thought I could reach this (In the dark we unroll)

In the dark we unroll an inner vision
I'm turning into someone else
The cage starts fitting
There's something in the water
I'm turning into someone else

I never thought I could reach this far (In the dark we unroll)
I never thought I could reach this far (In the dark we unroll)
(In the dark we unroll)
I never thought I could reach this far (In the dark we unroll)
(In the dark we unroll)
I never thought I could reach this (Oh, in the dark we unroll)Embed
