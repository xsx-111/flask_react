Silica Lyrics
I'm lost in the tube of private glass rooms
Four-cornered face grows up fast
Perfume won't compute
The trends made us new
I recognize your line and transform it into mine

Silica
I'm everywhere at the same time, oh
Silica
But I'm addicted to your life, oh


I'm so far away
My night is your day
How, I need proof
That you're mine
But silica's there
To shadow your stare
To mimic your desire
Through kilometers of wire

Silica
I'm everywhere at the same time, oh
Silica
But I'm addicted to your life, oh
Silica
I'm everywhere at the same time, oh
Silica
But I'm addicted to your life, oh

Don't sleep
K-k-k-keep me
Don't 
Don't sleep
K-k-k-keep meEmbed
