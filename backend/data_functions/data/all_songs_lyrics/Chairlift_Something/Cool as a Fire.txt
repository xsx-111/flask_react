Cool as a Fire Lyrics
Wasted the morning again
The world at the window is dead
The look in your eye says you don't love me anymore

Cool as a fire
I'm alive, I'm alive, I know

But now that I found you, I don't have a choice
With or without you, I don't have a choice

When nobody's watching, I'm coiled in question
Hiding the signs
'Cause weakness wins if weakness shows

Cool as a fire
I'm alive, I'm alive, I know

And now that I found you, I don't have a choice
With or without you, I don't have a choice
Now that I found you, I don't have a choice
With or without you, I don't have a choice
Gone with the weather
Nothing ever lasts forever
Gone with the weather
Nothing ever lasts forever1Embed
