Blue and Lonesome (Live - At the Gate of Horn version) Lyrics
Run here baby, run here baby
Sit down here on your Daddy's knee, oh
Well run here baby, well sit down on Daddy's knee
I just wanna tell you how you mistreated me

I'm blue and lonesome, I'm blue and lonesome
Don't know what to do
Well I'm so blue and lonesome, baby and I don't know what to do
It's you that I'm lovin', baby you just won't be true


Can't you see baby, can't you see baby
What you have done to me, oh
Well can't you see baby, baby what you have done to me
You've got me blue and lonesome, now you're runnin' out on meEmbed
