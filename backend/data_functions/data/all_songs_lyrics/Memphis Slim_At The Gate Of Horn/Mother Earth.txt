Mother Earth Lyrics
You may play race horses
You may own a race track
You may have enough money baby
To buy anything you lack

Don't care how great you are
And I don't care what you worth
'Cause when it all end up
You got to go back to Mother Earth

You may high-hat me all the time
You may never go my way
But Mother Earth is laying for you
That's the debt you got to pay

Don't care how great you are
And I don't care what you worth
When it all end up
You got to go back to Mother Earth

You may own a half a city
Even diamonds and pearls
You may buy that plane baby
And fly all over this world

Don't care how great you are
And I don't care what you worth
Because when it all end up
You got to go back to Mother EarthEmbed
