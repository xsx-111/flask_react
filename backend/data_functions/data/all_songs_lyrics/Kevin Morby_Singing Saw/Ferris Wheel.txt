Ferris Wheel LyricsRiding on that ferris wheel
A chair up in the sky
Riding on that ferris wheel
Well I lose my mind sometimes
Round and round the carousel
A horse so strong and white
Round and round the carousel
Without grace and without style
Well I lose my mind sometimes
Well I lose my mind sometimes
Daughter of the water
Transcending time and space
I take back everything I said
As the tears fall from your face
Meet me in the morning
Hold my head and pray for rain
Meet me in the morning
When all will remains the sameEmbed
