Black Flowers LyricsOh, no!
There goes, there goes my head
There goes my head
Throw ten on in, in the swear jar
In the swear jar
Outside storms cry, inside now
Not much better, stormy weather
I am writing a song book on a mountain
In the garden where we built a home
Black flowers
In the stories, the lies that they wrote
Escape me
And the winged horses that we once rode
Have stopped breathing
In the garden where we built a home
Black flowers
One, two, three, four

In the garden where we built a home
And the stories, the lies that they wrote
And the winged horses that we once rode
Are all strung out and spun out y'know
In the garden where built a home
And the roads that we built all corrode
In the garden where we built a home
Once a river, a sea now a mote
And the black flowers grow all around
And the angels who died in our sound
Now nothing will come of this now
For nothing can grow from the ground
And no one we know now will save us
Like no one we know would try
Like everything once is now over
Just as everything once has died
In the garden where we built a home
And all those we kept in tow
The weeper with his tiny piano
The willow with her singing saw
The jeweler with her cast iron hammer
Oh, the ivy, the crows, and the law
In the garden where we built a home
All's dark inside the tower
In the garden where we built a home
Black flowers
Black flowers
Black flowers
Black flowers
Black flowers
Black flowers
Black flowers
