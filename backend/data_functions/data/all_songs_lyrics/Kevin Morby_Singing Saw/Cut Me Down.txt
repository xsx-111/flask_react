Cut Me Down LyricsBirds will gather at my side
Tears will gather in my eyes
Throw my head and cry
As vultures circle in the sky
And you're going to do
What you came here to do
So why not do it now
Oh, and cut me down
No one, nowhere to go
Step out of my shadow
Take me as I am
A man
And they're going to do
What they came here to do
I can see it in them now
They're going to cut me down
Looking for a fire, I'm looking to burn
Looking for the water, for the water I wept
Looking for the dance, for the dance that I did
Looking for the dead, the dead that I leftEmbed
