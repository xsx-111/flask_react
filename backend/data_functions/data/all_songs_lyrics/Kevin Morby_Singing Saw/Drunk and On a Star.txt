Drunk and On a Star LyricsOh, I'm drunk and on a star
Hangs above just where I was
Holding court while watching over
Keeping fort, a midnight soldier
And, oh, I'm drunk and on a star
Hangs above just where I was
Going now, mouth full of laughter
Eyes like beams, head full of dreams
Have you heard my guitar singing?
As it rises from the earth
And the company it's bringing
Is beautiful and nothing worse
And I'm pale like a moon
Oh, I'm empty like a room
I've gone dizzy like a ship
When that water comes into it
Have you heard the schoolyards singing?
I swear they're calling out your name
And beauty is something that's fleeting
It comes to touch, never to claim
And have you heard my guitar singing
As it rises from the earth
And the company it's bringing
Is beautiful and nothing worseEmbed
