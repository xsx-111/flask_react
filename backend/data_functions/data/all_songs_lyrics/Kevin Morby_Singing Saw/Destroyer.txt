Destroyer LyricsHave you seen my lover
With her long blonde hair?
Everything we did just went so wrong
Last time that I saw her
She was standing there
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone
Where she's gone, lord
Where she's gone, lord
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone
And have you seen my mother
She's out looking for my father?
Didn't think that she'd be gone this long
He's gone where you can't go
But I let her have her fun
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone
Where she's gone, lord
Where she's gone, lord
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone
And what about my sister
She looks just like me
Looking into her is like a mirror
And when we were young
We weren't two but one
Sometimes I come to wonder where she's gone
Where she's gone, lord
Where she's gone
Without a kingdom
Without a bird over my head
Don't believe what they told you
Believe what you heard
Or what I said
And now I go down towards the water
In which we cried
And now I go down towards the dirt
In which we died, died, died, died
Destroyer
Destroyer
And, oh, what about me?
I'm out wandering the streets
Silently carrying a song
Until it gets too loud
And it comes rushing out of my mouth
Oh, you'll probably wonder where I've gone
Where I've gone, lord
Where I've gone, lord
Oh, you'll probably wonder where I've gone
