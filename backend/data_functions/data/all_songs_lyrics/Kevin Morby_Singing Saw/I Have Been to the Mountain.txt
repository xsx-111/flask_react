I Have Been to the Mountain Lyrics
Calling out
Demanding answers
Pleading skies
Cry for hours
Dropping peace bombs
Collecting prayers
A sky that mirrors
A sky that stares as I sing

I have been to the mountain
And I have walked on his shore
I have seen but I can't see him no more

Round 'em out, make an echo
Destroy the destroyer
And do it fast
That man lived in this town
Til that pig took him down
And have you heard the sound
Of a man stop breathing, pleading?

I have been to the valley
And I have sung all her songs
Watch me sing
Watch me sing along
And I say
I have been to the mountain
And I have walked on his shore
I have seen but I can't see him no more2Embed
