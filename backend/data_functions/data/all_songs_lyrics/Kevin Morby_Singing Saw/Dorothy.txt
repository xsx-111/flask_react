Dorothy LyricsRunning my mouth off at the storm
Yelling "man, what the hell did you do that for?"
And I was watching the old men fish
And they'd all give their catch away
And I could hear a woman singing
And I could hear that piano play
It'd go like
"Where did you get your bad breath?
I want some, oh, a drag off your cigarette"
And I was thinking about a song
That I heard when I was young
And I was wondering 'bout its trumpeter
How he could get those horns to tongue
Something like
Tears will gather in my eye
"Hold my head, and babe y'know I'll cry"
And I was thinking 'bout the places I'd been
With you always at my side
Like a baby, oh I held my head and cried
"C'mon Dorothy, y'know we could go all night"
"Hey, it's nighttime and you know
It's getting cold so babe put on some clothes"
Oh, let's go hit the town
And we could fill the room up with smoke
You know I got the first round
As we tell all those stories told
And I would pretend you were new
Like I was just introduced to you
And all the music in my ears
Sounds beautiful down here
And I could hear that drummer roll
As I listened to that choir cry
And I could hear a guitar weeping
I could feel those pipers pipe
And all the beauty I couldn't see
Well it just cut me at my knees
And I was watching the old men fish
And they'd all give their catch away
And I could hear a woman singing
And I could feel that piano play
Tears will gather in my eye
Hold my head, oh, and babe you know I'll cry
Like a baby, oh, I held my head and cried
C'mon Dorothy, you know we could go all night2Embed
