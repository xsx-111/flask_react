Water Lyrics
My body was sleeping
While my poor mind was dreaming
When they woke me up
I didn't know that I'd been screaming

And my old heart was pounding
For the devil had found me
Trapped me in a corner
Of my mind

And my legs were both shaking
From the pain they'd been taking
Picked my body up
And aimed for home

But these boots have seen better
Can't make sense of this weather
Rolling over me
Up in the sky

But I was warm like a fire
For I was full of desire
To hold on
To not let go
Thought of friends, thought of family
And all who surround me
Those enemies I danced with, so long ago
Let them know

If you find water
Please call my name
Put me out like a fire
Cover me in rain

Thought of stars and the planets
Wondered how they could have planned this
And what were they thinking
How could they have known?

I felt small but full of pride
I felt tall for my size
My eyes were black
And fixed on the night

And your name just hung
From a song I had sung
There in the air
Suspended by beauty
There are words that get spoken
Oh, and lives they leave broken
Some stone breaks in half
And some stone shatters

But my speech had been fleeting
Like the company I'd been keeping
I never asked for their names
They never asked for mine

Just a polluted highway
Or a clouded skyway
I'm a mess, I confess
Now send me the maid

If you find water
Please call my name
Put me out like a fire
Cover me in rain

Thought of stages with their singers
Oh, and painters with their fingers
I was strong like a horse
In carrying my song
To drop it off in some stable
When I was young I was able
To never turn around
To never look behind

To grow old, to grow distant
Like a mare in the distance
Bothering no one, so let her live
Until she dies

Picture lilies, picture willows
And a wide open window
To a room with a view
And both of us laughing

Just children, so young
Oh, at least, in the scheme
With our hair still there
And you keep my teeth clean

I sing, “Who is my creator?”
Not my mother, nor my father
But before the universe burst
Wide on open

If you find water
Please call my name
Put me out like a fire
Cover me in rain
And if you find water
Won't you call my name?
Put me out like a fire
Cover me in rainEmbed
