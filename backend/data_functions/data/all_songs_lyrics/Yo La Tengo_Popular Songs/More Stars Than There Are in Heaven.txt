More Stars Than There Are in Heaven LyricsWe'll walk hand in hand
Never understand
Take the hidden wish to death
And laugh and laugh and catch your breath
And forget that every word's been said
We'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand
As the world expands
The pair must face the final fling
The hook and ladder, a fatal swing
The sign looks missed, the marks we've placed
The playful grin that won't erase
We'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand
Across a foreign land
See your face with sultry pearls
In heaven snow makes caroler girls
Until when any burnoff glows ablaze
We'll walk hand in hand
We'll walk hand in hand
Never as we planned
And even those we never knew
Fast they disappear from view
Fading world without a price
Right before our very eyes
Melts before our very eyes
Dies before our very eyes
And even though we feel the burn
We careen past the heavy turn
Push, then pull to scale the hill
Then miss the cliff, don't take the spill
Until we can't withstand
We'll walk hand in hand
Running from the pull of tide
Fumbling from the creeping time
Running out...of whim and rhyme
We'll walk hand in hand
Till we understand
And everything to be despised
Right before our very eyes
Forced before our very eyes
Dies before our very eyes
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
We'll walk hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)
Hand in hand (we'll walk hand, hand in hand)Embed
