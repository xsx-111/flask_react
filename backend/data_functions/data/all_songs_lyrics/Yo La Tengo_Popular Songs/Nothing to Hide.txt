Nothing to Hide LyricsWe all decide
How to draw the line
We've all got something to hide
Stairs suprise
Glazes of any size
We've all got something to hide
We've all got something to hide
Well gonna wait, wait
We're gonna see what comes after
We're gonna see what comes after
Wait wait, harder not faster
Harder not faster
We fight the tide
Set us straight like 
We've all got something to hide
Clear the drive
Morsels not in sight
We've all got something to hide
Well wait, wait
We're gonna see what comes after
We're gonna see what comes after
Wait wait, harder not faster
Harder not faster
Well wait, wait
We're gonna see what comes after
We're gonna see what comes after
Wait wait, harder not faster
Harder not faster
We all decide
We all like to draw the line
We've all got something to hide
We've all got something to hideEmbed
