Avalon or Someone Very Similar LyricsAvalon, how did these things happen?
Avalon, tell me all you know
The perfect crime we laughed about it
Laughed the whole night through
When we were caught, it was because of you
Talking about all that we once knew
Avalon, the clock is falling back now
Avalon, we'd be if we could
You used to say "the water's fine, never mind the view"
I didn't mind as long as I have you
Talking about all that we've been through
Somedays, somedays we might be tired of being tired
We claim, we claim to be one of one of one
We didn't know the things we said would turn out untrue
The day would come when I'd be somewhere new
And what about you?
Times have changed for me
And times have changed for you, for you
Talking about all that we once knewEmbed
