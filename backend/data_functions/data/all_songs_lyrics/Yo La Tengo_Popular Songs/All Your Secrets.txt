All Your Secrets LyricsAll of the thoughts we thought would stay unsaid
Have made their way here instead, before the riot
As the days ahead become behind
Replace the tape as we rewind, before the riot
Tell me all your secrets
Say it slowly and clear so you don't have to speak twice
And if there's things that I'm afraid to know
I should have learnd them years ago, before the riot
I don't believe we're hopeless as we fear
Or as good as we appear, before the riot
I could be strong inside your sleeping eyes
Unafraid of truth, unafraid of lies, before the riot
Think of what we're missing
Well take that thought and put it out of your head
And if we can stop a restless night
Won't give up without a fight, before the riot
I can feel the time is coming, sure it's coming soon
Do what we do, hiding out from view
Sure it's coming
Say the worst should happen
Would we plan for that even if we could?
And if we can stop a restless night
Won't give up without a fight, before the riot
Here it comes, before the riot2Embed
