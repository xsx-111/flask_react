Periodically Double or Triple LyricsNever read Proust
Seems a little too long
Never used the hammer
Without somehow using it wrong
I've got time on my hands
That I can't wash off
I'm guzzling vitamin C but
I can't shake this cough
Walls are closing in
They often do
I'm seeing double and triple
Does this ever happen to you?
I don't have to make it rain
But I never argue with improving the view
Never wear a helmet
When I'm riding a bike
Never recall a face
To me, they all look alike
I've got a hole in my brain
Where what I meant to say lives
I'm livin' in the past
The gift that gives and gives
Walls are closing in
They often do
I'm seeing double and triple
Does this ever happen to you?
I don't have to make it rain
But I never argue with improving the view
Sometimes
In the future tense
I hope that you are safer
Put up an electric fence
Then and only then
We can all get along
Get it down in writing
Judge Judy tell me if I'm wrong
Walls are closing in
They often do
I'm seeing double and triple
Does this ever happened to you?
I don't have to make it rain
But I never argue with improving the viewEmbed
