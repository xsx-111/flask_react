Here to Fall LyricsThere will be some happy endings
There'll be dreams that don't come true
But in the times ahead, there's love and dread coming
All in all, it makes it that much harder for you
I know you're worried, I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?
You'll push back against the sorrow
Wait for the sun and we get through
And if it glares too bright, we'll pull the shades but dim the lights
That's just the way it is, but it makes it that much harder for you
I know you're worried, I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?
What else is there for us to do?
I know you're worried, I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?
I know you're worried, I'm worried too
But if you're ready, I'm here to fall with you
I'm here to fall with you, I'm here to fall with you
I'm here to fall with you
What else is there for us to do?1Embed
