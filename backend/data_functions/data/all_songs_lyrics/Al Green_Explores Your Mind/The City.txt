The City LyricsI can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me how can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one
No one ever told us about the sorrow
So how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And sometimes I've got to say
Tell me help me mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win, baby?
Please help me mend my broken heart
I think I'll let me live again
So how can you mend this broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Help me mend my broken heart
And let me live againEmbed
