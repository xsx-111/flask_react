Take Me to the River Lyrics
I'd like to dedicate this song to little Junior Parker
A cousin of mine who's gone on, but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name
I sing

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul? Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Hold me, love me, please me, tease me
Till I can't, till I can't, can't take no more

Take me to the river

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all the things that you put me through
The sixteen candles are burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know, can't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

I wanna know
Take me to the river
I wanna know
Want you to dip me in the water
I wanna know
Won't you wash me in the water?
Wash me in the water
Wash me in the water
Won't you wash me in the water?
Feeling good2Embed
