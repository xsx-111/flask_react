Love Needs a Heart Lyrics
Maybe the hardest thing I've ever done
Was to walk away from you
Leaving behind the life that we'd begun
I split myself in two
Proud and alone, cold as a stone
Rolling down that hill into the night
I could see the surprise and the hurt in your eyes
There behind each flashing city light

Love needs a heart and I need to find
If love needs a heart like mine

Love won't come near me
She don't even hear me
She walks by my vacancy sign

(Hey love) Love needs a heart
(Hey heart) Trusting and blind
(Hey love) I wish that heart was mine

Proud and alone, cold as a stone
I'm afraid to believe the things I feel
I can cry with the best
I can laugh with the rest
But I'm never sure when it's real
(Hey love, hey heart, oh love)
And it may be the hardest thing I've ever done
But apart from all that I hope to find
Where's the heart that's been looking for mine?
I hope it finds me in time
(Hey love) Love needs a heart
(Hey heart) And I need to find
(Hey love) If love needs a heart like mineEmbed
