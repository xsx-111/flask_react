You Love the Thunder Lyrics
When you look over your shoulder
And you see the life that you have left behind
When you think it over, do you ever wonder
What it is that holds your life so close to mine?

You love the thunder and you love the rain
What you see revealed within the anger is worth the pain
And before the lightning fades and you surrender
You've got a second to look at the dark side of a man

You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
I know you wonder how you ever came
To be a woman in love with a man in search of the flame

Draw the shade and light the fire
For the night that holds you and calls your name
And just like your lover knows your desire
And the crazy longing that time will never tame

You love the thunder and you love the rain
You know your hunger like you know your name
I got your number if it's still the same
And you can dream but you can never pay back the way you came
You love the thunder (You love the rain)
You know your hunger (You love the rain)
You love the thunder (You love the rain)
I got your number (You love the rain)
Ah la la la la la la la la
Ah la la la la la la la laEmbed
