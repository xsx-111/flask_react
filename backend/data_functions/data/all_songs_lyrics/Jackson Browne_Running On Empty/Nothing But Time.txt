Nothing But Time Lyrics
Rolling down 295 out of Portland, Maine
Still high from the people up there, feeling no pain
Gonna make it to New Jersey, gonna set it up and do it again

I got a bottle of wine (Pass it over)
I got a broken white line (I'm still sober)
There ain't nothin' but time between this Silver Eagle
And that New Jersey line

Well it's a rock and roll band or a movie you can take your pick
It ain't bad work if you can get it
But you gotta make it stick
But getting any kind of sleep on this rolling motel, that's the trick

I got a bottle of wine (Pass it over)
I got a broken white line (I'm still sober)
There ain't nothin' but time between this Silver Eagle
And that New Jersey line


It's just a bottle of wine (Pass it over)
It's just a broken white line (I'm still sober)
It's just a whole lot of time in the twilight zone
Between me and these friends of mine
Thank you. I'd like to do a song, I've never played it in public before. It's a brand new song. This is sort of a tribute to, uh, the friends of mine that come out here on the road, and to you too.Â Embed
