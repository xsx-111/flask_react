Cocaine Lyrics
You take Sally and I'll take Sue
There ain't no difference between the two
Cocaine, running all 'round my brain

Headin' down Scott, turnin' up Main
Looking for that girl who sells cocaine
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain

Mmm momma come here quick
That old cocaine 'bout to make me sick
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain

Late last night about a quarter past four
Ladanyi come knockin' down my hotel room door
Where's the cocaine?
Said it's runnin' all 'round my brain

I was talking to my doctor down at the hospital
(What'd he say?)
He said, "Son, it says here you're twenty-seven
But that's impossible
Cocaine, you look like you could be forty-five"
Now I'm losing touch with reality and I'm almost out of blow
It's such a fine line I hate to see it go
Cocaine, runnin' all 'round my brain

Blood on the highway. 
Gotta take either more of it or less of it. I can't quite figure out which one. 
Well, I tell ya what it does take. It takes a clear mind is what it takes. 
You mean it takes a clear mind to take it or a clear mind not to take it?
It takes a clear mind to make it. Embed
