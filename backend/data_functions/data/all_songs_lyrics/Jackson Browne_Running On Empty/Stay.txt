Stay Lyrics
People stay just a little bit longer
We wanna play just a little bit longer
Now the promoter don't mind
And the union don't mind
If we take a little time
And we leave it all behind and sing
One more song

Oh won't you stay just a little bit longer
Please, please, please, say you will
Say you will

Oh won’t you stay just a little bit longer
Oh please please stay just a little bit more
And the promoter don’t mind
And the roadies don’t mind
If we take a little time
And we leave this all behind and sing
One more song

And thank you all again. Embed
