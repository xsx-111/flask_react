Coney Island Baby LyricsEvery night she comes to take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest man in the town
She's a rose, she's a pearl, she's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes
She's my Coney Island baby
She's my Coney Island girl
She's a princess in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me
She's my Coney Island baby
She's my Coney Island girl
Every night she comes to take me out to dreamland
When I'm with her, I'm the richest man in the town
She's a rose, she's a pearl, she's the spin on my world
All the stars make their wishes on her eyes
She's my Coney Island baby
She's my Coney Island girl
She's a princess in a red dress
She's the moon in the mist to me
She's my Coney Island baby
She's my Coney Island girl
She's my Coney Island baby
She's my Coney Island girlEmbed
