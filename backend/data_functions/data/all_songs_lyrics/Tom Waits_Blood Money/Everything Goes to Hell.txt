Everything Goes to Hell LyricsWhy be sweet? Why be careful? Why be kind?
A man has only one thing on his mind
Why ask politely? Why go lightly? Why say please?
They only want to get you on your knees
There's a few things I never could believe
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
And everything goes to hell anyway
Laissez-faire, mi amour, c'est la vie
Shall I return to shore or swim back out to sea?
The world don't care what a sailor does in the town
It's hanging in the windows by the pound
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
And everything goes to hell anyway
I only want to hear your purr and to hear you moan
You have another man who brings the money home
I don't want dishes in the sink
Don't ask me what I feel or what I think
There's a few things I never could believe
A woman when she weeps
A merchant when he swears
A thief who says he'll pay
A lawyer when he cares
A snake when he is sleeping
A drunkard when he prays
I don't believe you go to heaven when you're good
Everything goes to hell anyway
Everything goes to hell anyway
Everything goes to hell anywayEmbed
