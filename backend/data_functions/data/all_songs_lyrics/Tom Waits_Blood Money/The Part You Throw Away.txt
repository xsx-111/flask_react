The Part You Throw Away LyricsYou dance real slow, you wreck it down
Then you walk away, you turn around
What did that old blonde gal say?
That is the part you throw away
I want that beggar's eyes, a winning horse
A tidy Mexican divorce
St. Mary's prayers, Houdini's hands
And a barman who always understands
Will you lose the flowers? Hold on to the vase
Will you wipe all those teardrops away from your face?
I can't help thinking as I close the door
I have done all of this many times before
The bone must go, the wish can stay
The kiss don't know what the lips will say
Forget I've hurt you, put stones in our bed
And remember to never mind instead
Well, all of your letters burned up in the fire
Time is just memory mixed with desire
That's not the road, this is only the map
I said gone just like matches from a closed-down cabaret
In a Portuguese saloon, a fly is circling around the room
You'll soon forget the tune that you play
'Cause that is the part you throw away
Oh that is the part you throw awayEmbed
