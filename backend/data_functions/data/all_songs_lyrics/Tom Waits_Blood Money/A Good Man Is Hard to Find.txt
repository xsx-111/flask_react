A Good Man Is Hard to Find LyricsI always play Russian Roulette in my head
Seventeen black or twenty-nine red
How far from the gutter? How far from the pew?
I will always remember to forget about you
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
And my favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is red
A long-dead soldier looks out from the frame
No one remembers his war, no one remembers his name
Go out to the meadow, scare off all the crows
It does nothing but rain here, nothing grows
A good man is hard to find
Only strangers sleep in my bed
And my favorite words are good-bye
And my favorite color is
My favorite color is
My favorite color is redEmbed
