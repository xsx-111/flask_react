All the World is Green LyricsI fell into the ocean when you became my wife
I risked it all against the sea to have a better life
Marie, you are the wild blue sky, men do foolish things
You turn kings into beggars and beggars into kings
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world is green
The face forgives the mirror, the worm forgives the plow
The questions begs the answer, can you forgive me somehow?
Maybe when our story's over, we'll go where it's always spring
The band is playing our song again, all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
Can we bring back the old days again
When all the world is green?
The moon is yellow silver, oh the things that summer brings
It's a love you'd kill for and all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond on a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves when all the world is green
Pretend that you owe me nothing
And all the world is green
We can bring back the old days again
When all the world is green
He is balancing a diamond on a blade of grass
The dew will settle on our graves when all the world is green2Embed
