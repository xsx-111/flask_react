Misery Is the River of the World LyricsThe higher that the monkey can climb
The more he shows his tail
Call no man happy till he dies
There's no milk at the bottom of the pail
God builds a church, the devil builds a chapel
Like the thistles that are growing round the trunk of a tree
All the good in the world, you can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me
If there's one thing you can say about mankind
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitchfork
But it always comes roaring back again
Misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world
The higher that the monkey can climb
The more he shows his tail
Call no man happy till he dies
There's no milk at the bottom of the pail
God tempers all the ruins for the new shorn lambs
The devil knows the Bible like the back of his hand
All the good in the world, you can put inside a thimble
And still have room for you and me
If there's one thing you can say about mankind
There's nothing kind about man
You can drive out nature with a pitchfork
But it always comes roaring back again
For want of a bird, the sky was lost
For want of a nail, a shoe was lost
For want of a life, a knife was lost
For want of a toy, a child was lost
Misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world
Everybody row! Everybody row!
Misery's the river of the world
Misery's the river of the world
Everybody row! Everybody row!
Everybody row!Embed
