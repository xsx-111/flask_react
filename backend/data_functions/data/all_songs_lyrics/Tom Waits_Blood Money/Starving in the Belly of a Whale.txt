Starving in the Belly of a Whale LyricsLife is whittled, life's a riddle
Man's a fiddle that life plays on
When the day breaks and the earth quakes
Life's a mistake all day long
Tell me who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In the crooked old world
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Don't take my word, just look skyward
They that dance must pay the fiddler
Sky is darkening, dogs are barking
But the caravan moves on
Tell me who gives a good goddamn
You'll never get get out alive
Don't go dreaming
Don't go scheming
A man must test his mettle
In the crooked old world
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
As the crow flies, it's there the truth lies
At the bottom of the well
E-o-leven goes to heaven
Bless the dead here as the rain falls
Don't trust a bull's horn, a doberman's tooth
A runaway horse or me
Don't be greedy, don't be needy
If you live in hope, you're dancing to a terrible tune
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whale
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly
Starving in the belly of a whaleEmbed
