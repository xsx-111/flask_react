What Can I Do If The Fire Goes Out? Lyrics
This is the sound of a soul in tune
To a savage desire for a soul made new
It's a savage desire for a soul untamed
A definitive cry in the present age

Do I throw my clothes in the fire?
Do I throw my hopes in the fire?
Do those things grow in the fire
Or burn just to keep me complying?
Can you still show me the way?
Can you still show me a light?
'Cause I was only a kid
When I fell and you tossed me aside, hey

What can I do if the fire goes out?
'Cause I don't know if I can live without

I wanna taste and see if the Lord is good
I wanna know if I'm heard and if I'm understood
See if the savage desire is some stupid thing
Or if having desire is summoned deep within
Do I throw my clothes in the fire?
Do I throw my hopes in the fire?
Do those things grow in the fire
Or burn just to keep me alive?
Can you still show me the way?
Can you still show me a light?
'Cause I was only a kid
When I fell and you left me behind, oh


What can I do if the fire goes out?
'Cause I don't know if I can live without2Embed
