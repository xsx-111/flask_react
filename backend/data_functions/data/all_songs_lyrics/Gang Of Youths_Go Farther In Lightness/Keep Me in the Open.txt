Keep Me in the Open Lyrics
I don’t know if I blame you for being so distant
But I’m tryna be real with you, and God, it’s been a hell of a week
And I just wanna relate to you in a true way
If it means being here with you, then hey, I am trying to be
I’ll always struggle to think of you in a harsh way
I know that it’s weird but I still see you for the human beneath
I wish that I was in love with your endless bullshit
But I’m a "heart in the gutter" type, asleep on a stranger's knee
I’m getting used to the sleepless hours from sundown
The terrible dreams that lead me inward to terrible truths
But in my blood, some electric holy yearning
Carries an impulse to get shit-faced on you

Tell me how I can do this thing
Tell me how I can help this thing go easily
'Cause I’m trying, honeybee
Tell me how I can beat this thing
Tell me how I can make this beast die easily
Goddamn it, honeybee

And get a load of the kid in the Gang Green t-shirt
They were the gateway band, a pastor and the teacher to me
I used to wanna be real with the things they believed in
But since we've been talking, I'm not sure if I believe anything
Take a look at the girl with the long range rifle
The one with the crew cut, she reminds me of a version of you
Laying low in a field some place in Mosul
Wholly emulsified by fear and aversion to truth
When did everything get this weird?
How the fuck did it start?
Did you ever believe in me?
Was it always so hard?
Tell me how I can do this thing
Tell me how I can help this thing go easily
'Cause I’m trying, honeybee

The line is close, the wait is hardly normal
So just be real in any way you can be
The heart is closed, but keep me in the open
'Cause I deserve better than this
The line is close, the wait is hardly normal
So just be real in any way you can be
The heart is closed, but keep me in the open
'Cause I deserve better than this
Yeah, I deserve better than this
And I deserve better than this
'Cause I deserve better than this
And I deserve better than this
'Cause I deserve better than this3Embed
