Atlas Drowned Lyrics
I'm not leaving tonight
Cram the armour and chains where the sun will not shine
And who's to say they won't bitch out and shoot me on sight?
Get that thing out my face
I don't care what it says, this is my goddamned place
A traitor to country and glad, 'cause my country's disgraced

I'm not bleeding tonight
In the shadow of truncheons with smoke in my eyes
You will close in on madness and madness is not civilised
There's no reason now
I'm not dumb and you people can't dick me around
And the whole institution is rigged and the ship's going down

I'm cool to let Atlas drown
Galt, you can shake
You can cry, you can quake
You can rot in your sleep
You can shrug, you can weep
And I'll watch as you bleed

Hey, you jackbooted sheep with your elephant caps
I have come for my shit and I won't take less than that
Why believe you are full
When you still get your meals from the trash?
To you bells in the curve
I will love you, but love not the powers you serve
Do not grow complacent and take less than what you deserve
I'm cool to watch Atlas burn
Galt, you can shake
You can cry, you can quake
You can rot in your sleep
You can shrug, you can weep
And I'll watch Atlas bleed
And we'll laugh as he shakes
And we'll go off and breed
And we'll spit on his grave

In the heart of redemption, there's some furious song
And the herd is no place for the brave and the strong
But I bear no contempt for the ones who just want to belong
And these chosen whites are anaemic and small
And are truly the lowliest sheep of them all
And their eminence is fixed upon things we could burn in one go

I'mma let Atlas fall
I'mma watch Atlas fallEmbed
