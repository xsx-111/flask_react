Do Not Let Your Spirit Wane Lyrics
So I have this dream, it comes like twice in a week
It’s been so for years and years on repeat
And since then I’ve not had a full night of sleep
'Cause it plays out the same way
I live with this girl and our kid
I’m as happy as a pig rolled in shit
It’s postcard, I’m settled, a pirate no more
A gypsy at most with no mortgage
It’s boring but in the most exquisite of ways
No carcinogenic and humdrum malaise
And it’s strange, all the things that I’ve run from
Are the things that completeness could come from

So anyways, we’re happy and impossibly so
It’s earth and it’s heaven, all simpatico
Floorboards laid out and the walls painted white
My dream self and I like the same things
They’re all set to leave and I kiss them goodbye
They go and get groceries or something and I
Am drinking alone in the basement
And pray I’m not hallucinating

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Let your life grow strong and sweet to the taste
'Cause the odds are completely insane
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane
No, no, no, no, no, no
In love, I am careful to mostly reserved
And this dream is a life I don’t think I deserve
My girl and our kid are impossibly bright
And I am just drunk in my basement
See a car, see my girl and look at our kid
Approaching a corner, with rain and a skid
Then a phone call to me from the ICU ward
"Sir, I’m so sorry to say this"
I’m walking alone through the hospital door
ID their bodies, collapse to the floor
Numb and relentlessly broken
Then I wake up the very next moment

Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Do not let this thing you got go to waste
The pain and the beauty, so strange
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane

Cut me out, take me home
My hands are tired, my legs are broke
And the ruptured chrome plus the deep unknown
Turn my insides out and my head face down
Cut me out, take me home
My hands are tired, my legs are broke
And the ruptured chrome plus the deep unknown
Turn my insides out and my head face down
Do not let this thing you got go to waste
Do not let your heart be dismayed
It’s here by some random disclosure of grace
From some vascular, great thing
Get the fuck out of your head if it says
“Stay cold and be deathly afraid”
Do not let your spirit wane
Do not let your spirit wane9Embed
