Our Time Is Short Lyrics
We’ll make it down slowly, discover our hearts are dumb
There’s nothing that holy in loving like drunk kids love
And I’ve forgotten where I was
I see you in spotlights, in visions I’m saving now
Before we are parted by rivers of words somehow
I’m still besotted, but sobered up

So let’s drink, drink the best wine now
While we’re strong and we are proud
Until lightning strikes us down
And you’ll eat, eat 'til you are full
Cutting straight through all the bull
I will accept you, warts and all

It’s weird and unnerving, forsaking my old life now
'Cause this is a burden I can’t seem to do without
When time is rotten, we soldier on
I wanna be nearer, I wanna be close behind
A little bit clearer, a little bit hard to find
And I’ve forgotten who I was

So let’s drink, drink the best wine now
While we’re strong and we are proud
Until lightning strikes us down
And you’ll speak, speak ’til you are whole
What is clear is what is gold
You’re only human after all
Our time is short
Our time is short
Our time is short
Our time is shortEmbed
