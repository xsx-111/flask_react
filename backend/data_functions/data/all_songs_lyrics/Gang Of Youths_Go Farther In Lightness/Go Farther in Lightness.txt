Go Farther in Lightness Lyrics
All the strangest things keep happening
All by my father's old magnolia tree
And the Sydney sky is rainless and sings off-key
But it's cool in a weird way that I wish I could be
It's the weirdest high and the lowest peak
God, Iâ€™m an alien on my own goddamned street
I climb some wall and curse out my favourite team
And stare at the freeway, inveterately free

Go farther in hope, go farther
Go farther in lightness
Go farther in hope, go farther
Go farther in lightness1Embed
