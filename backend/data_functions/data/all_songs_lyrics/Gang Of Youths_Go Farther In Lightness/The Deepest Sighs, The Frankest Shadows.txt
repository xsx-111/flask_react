The Deepest Sighs, The Frankest Shadows Lyrics
There’s a sky full of lights and none of them stars
But each white, silvery flicker’s a faithful reminder to us
Of a weight that’s in youth that makes a dick of us all
If it happened today, then it’s probably happened before
In a crowd unfamiliar, I just wanna touch a familiar face
And make friends at the parties I’ve feared the likes of an age
To be wanted with truth and make formidable love
See light in myself that I see inside everyone else I know

It’s not a lacking of spine, nor of physical pulse
It’s just a feeling of distance akin to a feeling of loss
Of love in the youth of my limited life
That passed in a violent and ritual screwing inside
And the years unfamiliar are made of increasingly digital days
And I am grieving the loss of myself with frightening malaise
When there’s weightness in youth and the sum of it’s small
Just stand in the darkness and laugh with your heel on its throat

'Cause not everything means something, honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
And if everything is temporary
I will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being
Alone in my house, frozen in time
But don’t get me wrong now, honey, I am trying

There’s a warmth in the eyes and a clearness of thought
When the deepest of sighs and the frankest of shadows are gone
We’re pushing a stone up a mountainous waste
And the lines at the store look like lines on a beautiful face
See, I’m not so assured
Nor unusually strong or outstandingly brave
I’m more just fumbling around in the dark for the bulk of my day
When there’s weight that’s in youth and the sum of it’s small
I will stand in the darkness and laugh with my heel on its throat

And not everything means something, honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
And if everything is temporary
I will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being

Alone in my house, frozen away
But don’t get me wrong now, honey, I’m okay

Ah, cast me a line
Ah, honey, cast me a line
Won’t you fear me tonight?
Goddamn do you fear me tonight?
Ah, pass me a light
Ah, honey, pass me a light
Won’t you feel me tonight?
Goddamn do you feel me tonight?
'Cause not everything means something, honey
So say the unsayable, say the most human of things
If everything is temporary
I will bear the unbearable, terrible triteness of being5Embed
