The Heart Is a Muscle Lyrics
Break me off a piece of that
And mix it in with a little wine
With someone warm and smart, I guess
With a heart in first and a soul behind
And I won't give in
'Cause I wanna try again

There will be no years of silence in the shadow of regret
I won’t let it so betray me, though my soul got used to it
I will look at love as more than just an instrument of pain
And will give myself completely to the moving and the strange
'Cause I wanna overcome
And try to love someone

I will not spend the years depleted of my willingness to try
It won’t hurt this way forever, it ain’t worth the overtime
I’m not looking for redemption nor some shallow kind of bliss
Lay me down and kiss me deeply, show me everything I missed
I haven’t had enough
And I wanna love someone

I will not hurt like this forever, I’m responding to the call
While there's speakers in the outfield
Blasting out my favourite song
I will not play this out discreetly, it is real and unashamed
I am human now, and terrified, but want it all the same
'Cause I wanna overcome
And try to love someone
'Cause the heart, the heart, the heart
The heart is a muscle
And I wanna make it strong
'Cause the heart, the heart, the heart
The heart is a muscle now
I wanna make it strong

I let bad love betray me once
But I was barely outta high school then
And I guess I fear the same results
That none will take me as I am

I wanna be loved, I wanna be whole again
So tuck my hair behind my ears and touch my soul again
The window is wide, the post unfulfilled
And I just ask you to be patient if you'll have me still
'Cause I wanna open up
And try to love someone
'Cause I wanna overcome
And try to love someone

The heart, the heart, the heart
The heart is a muscle
The heart, the heart, the heart
The heart is a muscle now
The heart, the heart, the heart
The heart is a muscle now
I wanna make it strongEmbed
