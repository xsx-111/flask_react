To Here Knows When Lyrics
Kiss
Your fear
Your red button
Falls from my mouth
Slip
Your dress
Over your head
It's been so long

Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move

Move
On top
Because that way
You touch her, too
Turn
Your head
Come back again
To here knows when
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
Move, move
