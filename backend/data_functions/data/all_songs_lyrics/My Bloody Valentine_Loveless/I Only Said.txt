I Only Said Lyrics
See you there, run away, you said
To go you were there, you were there
To lay underneath the red sky there
To lay under her, I want her there

See you there, under her, and under
To go, you were there, I only said
To lay under her and I'm slow, oh
To lay under her, I've grown away, oh6Embed
