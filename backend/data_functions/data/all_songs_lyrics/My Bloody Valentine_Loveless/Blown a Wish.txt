Blown a Wish Lyrics
Midnight wish
Blow me a kiss
Holding onto you
Make like this
Trying to pretend it's true
Ooh

Show me all your favorite things
Show you all mine too
Wake and wish
I'll give them all to you
Ooh

Hold on to your promises
Hold on to mine too
Caught like this
I'll turn it in with you
Ooh

Fall apart my beating heart
Nothing left to do
Once in love
I'll be the death of you
