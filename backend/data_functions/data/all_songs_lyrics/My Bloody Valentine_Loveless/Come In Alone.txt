Come In Alone Lyrics
Come in alone
You'll love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide

Why I don't need to believe
What you see
To look up and around
You were gone
Words came out to a sound

Feel I'm alive
You will see
Why and why
Felt like crying
Over her
I will go
To the wall
(Ohh)
Run from some
Come in alone
You'll love to let go
And I'll turn you around
When your hopes gave me doubts
(Ohh)
Run and hide7Embed
