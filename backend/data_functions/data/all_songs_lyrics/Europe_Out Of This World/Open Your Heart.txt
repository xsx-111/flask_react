Open Your Heart LyricsDays filled with joy and days filled with sorrow
I don't know just what to do
Am I happy today, am I lonely tomorrow
Everything depends on you
And I've been waitin'
For the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin'
That everything could be like before
Open your heart and tell me what's wrong
Why can't you talk like you used to do before
I don't know if I'm weak, I don't know if Im strong
Hey girl I can't cope anymore
And I've been waitin'
For the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin'
That everything could be like before
Yeah, open your heart, let me hear you
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call
Open your heart, want to come near you
Make up your mind, before we lose it all
Maybe that time has its own way of healin'
Maybe it dries the tears in your eyes
But never change the way that I'm feelin'
Only you can answer my cries
And I've been waitin'
For the angels to knock on my door
I've been hopin'
That everything could be like before... oh, yeah
Open your heart, let me hear you
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call
Open your heart, want to come near you
Make up your mind, before we lose it all
Oh, open your heart, yeah, let me hear you
Make up your mind, I want to hear you call
Open your heart, want to come near you
Make up your mind, before we lose it all1Embed
