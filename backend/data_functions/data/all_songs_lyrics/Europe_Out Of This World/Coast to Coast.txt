Coast to Coast LyricsYou look out that window
For someone you know
But it all looks the same and time and again
It hurts you so
You wonder if always
You'll stand on your own
But bear in your mind, you'll get through this time
You're not alone
When time seems so lonely
And the day seems too long
You wonder if you will ever get through
And still be strong, yeah
With eyes full of sadness
You stand on your own
It tears you apart, but you know in your heart
You're not alone, no
Coast to coast and land to land
We're together hand in hand
More coast to coast and land to land
We're together hand in hand
Coast to coast and land to land
We're together hand in hand
Yeah
Coast to coast (You're not alone)
And land to land ('Cause we're still together)
We're together hand in hand (Oh yeah)
More coast to coast (Now, you're not alone)
And land to land ('Cause we're still together)
We're together hand in hand!Embed
