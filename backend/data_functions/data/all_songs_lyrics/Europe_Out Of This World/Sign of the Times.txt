Sign of the Times LyricsWhen the word is out from the other side
She turns around
'Cause day and night she's waited patiently
Now a different kind of world out there
Is to be found
It's over now for everyone to see
This is the way it's meant to be
It's the way that we make things right
It's the way that we hold on tight
I know, it's the sign of the times
It's the way that we make things turn
It's the way that we live and learn
I know, it's the sign of the times
It wakes him up, he turns around
And now he's gone
He's been waitin' for this moment desperately
Now the time is right, he's turnin' back
He's going home
It's over now for everyone to say
"Oh, this is the way it's meant to be"
It's the way that we make things right
It's the way that we hold on tight
I know, it's the sign of the times
It's the way that we make things turn
It's the way that we live and learn
I know, it's the sign of the times
And every time it's on my mind
I feel so insecure
It worries me to end up here alone
But every time I realize I need her more and more
I'd never make it on my own, oh yeah
Yeah, it's the way that we make things right
It's the way that we hold on tight
I know, it's the sign of the times
It's the way that we make things turn
It's the way that we live and learn
I know, it's the sign of the times, yeah, yeah
Oh, it's the way that we make things turn
It's the way that we live and learn
I know, it's the sign of the times, yeah, yeahEmbed
