Green Light Go LyricsGreen light
Green light, go
Go!
Aim for
Aim for stars
Go!
They’re all out there waiting for me
So just give them what they want
The suits and ties
The filth and flies
Just give them what they want
Green light
Green light, go
Go!
Wake up
Wake up now
Go!
Go out and break their hearts
While faking every part
Go!
In the end we just won’t know
If you say stop when I say go
And in the end we both won’t know
If you say stop when I say go
And in the end you’ll never know
If you say stop when I say go
And in the end we just won’t know
If you say stop when I say goEmbed
