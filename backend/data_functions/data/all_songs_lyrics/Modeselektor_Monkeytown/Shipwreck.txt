Shipwreck Lyrics
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose…
From the back of the arm she comes
The back of the arm she comes
You flat fall you blank yourself
You flat fall to blank yourself
So let's have a pretty truth
You flat fall, you blank yourself
You laugh, slap on your face
Then she laughs, slap on the cake
And so lets have all a pretty truth
You laugh slap on your face
And they laugh slap on your face
And they laugh, slap on, slip on the tracks

We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose, (Ship, ship, Ship, shipwreck)
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked we chose
You asked we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose,( ship, ship, ship, ship…)
We chose, we chose, we chose…
Death dances comes to you
Just whatchya going to do?
Ship lost in triangles
Death dances up to

Love will drown into the void
Love will drown to the void
Love will drown to the void
Drop a rhythm on the decks
Drunken rhythm on the decks
For the chance of a kiss
(ship, ship, ship, ship, wreck)
We chose, you asked
We chose, you asked
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose, (ship, ship, ship, ship, wreck…)
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked…

Oh shit, I am sinking
That's not meant to happen
Flies will be your cousins
Truly, truly something
Won't death be around me?
Won't death be around?
That's not meant to happen
Truly, truly something
Close up for the winter
Close up for the winter
Caught hook,  line and sinker
Close up for the Winter
We chose (Ship, ship, ship, ship, wreck)
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose, (Ship, ship, ship, ship, wreck)
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose, (Ship, ship, ship, ship, wreck)
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose
We chose, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose…
We chose, we chose, we chose...
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose...
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
You asked, we chose
We chose, we chose, we chose...Embed
