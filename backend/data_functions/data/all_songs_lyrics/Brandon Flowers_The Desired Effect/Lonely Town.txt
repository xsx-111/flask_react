Lonely Town Lyrics

I've been working overtime
And I can't get you off my mind
I sleep in the pouring rain
When will you come home again?
Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did

I'm hanging on to the end of this rope
Somewhere on the outskirts of hope
Life without you not around
Another kid in Lonely Town
And I'm

Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Now I'm standing outside your house
And I'm wondering, Baby
Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you feel the thud when I fall?
Do you hear the crack when I break?
Did you lock the door when it shut?
Did you see the knife when it cut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground?
For the kid in Lonely Town (Lonely Town)
Lonely Town
Kid in Lonely Town (Lonely Town)
Lonely Town

Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did
Spinnin' like a Gravitron
When I was just a kid
I always thought that things would change
But they never did

Do you hear the phone when I call?
Do you hear the crack when I break?
Do you lock the door when it shut?
Do you keep your ear to the ground?
For the kid in Lonely Town (Lonely Town)
Lonely Town (Lonely Town)
Lonely Town
