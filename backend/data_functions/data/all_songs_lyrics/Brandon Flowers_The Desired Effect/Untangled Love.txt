Untangled Love Lyrics
Well let's say that now's the time to start
And blessed are the young at heart
She's just here to look the part
In the fruit of all this labor land
On Friday nights and football stands
Been fumbled by so many hands

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
And I always hoped I'd see the light
And break the bad luck in my life
Untangled love, yeah (I see it in your eyes)
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love, ooo (I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes)

It's been twenty-one years since I left home
I'm still looking for a place to call my own
I see the silver lining shining like polished chrome

I've been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
And I always hoped I'd see the light
And break the bad luck in my life
Untangled love, yeah (I see it in your eyes)
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love, true (I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes)
Blue Skies
And if a landslide
Tumbles down today, I'm on your side
And if a twister  sweeps it all away
I'm on your side

Stay close, my love
This ain't right, look out trouble, we've had enough
Been looking for untangled love
But it's hard to get a handle on
It took a lot of faith, it took a lot of lies
But I finally came to realize

Untangled love (I see it in your eyes)
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love (I see it in your eyes)
You keep me by surprise
Untangled love, yeah (I see it in your eyes)
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love, ooo (I see it in your eyes, I see it in your eyes)
Untangled love (I see it in your eyes)
I can see it in your eyes
Untangled love (I see it in your eyes)
You took me by surprise
Untangled love (I see it in your eyes)
It took me by surpriseEmbed
