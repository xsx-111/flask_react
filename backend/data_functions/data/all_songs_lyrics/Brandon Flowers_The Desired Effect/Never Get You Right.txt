Never Get You Right Lyrics
It's a coin toss, it's a game on
You were born lost and dirt blonde
No curfew with a drunk mom
No one to stop you now

And I'll give you my opinion
It's the only one I got
They'll turn you into something
Whether you are it or not

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
They should tremble at your sight

These bad dreams and back seats
High beams through the dark streets
A good angel with bad wings
No one to help you out

And I'll give you my opinion
It's the only one I got
They'll turn you into something
Whether you are it or not
Through a microscope lens
Dissecting your whole life
But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
They should tremble at your sight
But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by
They should tremble at your sight
But they'll never get you right

Everybody talks
From the wrong side of the mask
Gliding through the universe
As the world goes rolling past
Don't give into the pressure
'Cause it isn't gonna stop
The world goes on around you
Whether you like it or not
(Around you around around)
(Whether you like it or not)

But they'll never get you right
I've been watching you all night
And the people passing by you
They should tremble at your sight
They'll never get you right
Get you right
Well, they're never gonna get you right
Get you right
Well, they're never gonna get you right
Get you right
Well, they're never gonna get you right
Get you right
Well, they're never gonna get you right3Embed
