Still Want You Lyrics
Everyone’s got a combination
If you put in the time
The numbers come like a revelation
You show me yours, I'll show you mine
And when you're down, girl, you got to know this
Nobody else is in your room
We'll make it through

Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before

I used to think that I knew the big time
Before you came around
But I was up in the velvet goldmine
And you put my feet back on the ground
A peace of mind is a lot to ask for
These silly days, but we got it made
Don't let it fade, oh no
Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before

And when your mind's made up
I'm gonna bring it down
And when you've got no time
You're gonna see it found
Your heart grows cold
There’s something on the line
It’s hard for me to show
There’s something you should know

Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
Nuclear distress, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did before
Time is passing by, I still want you
Crime is on the rise, I still want yo
Nuclear distress, I still want you
Climate change and debt, I still want you
The Earth is heating up, I still want you
Hurricanes and floods, I still want you
Even more than I did
Even more than I did before2Embed
