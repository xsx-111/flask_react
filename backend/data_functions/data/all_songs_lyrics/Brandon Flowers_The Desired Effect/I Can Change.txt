I Can Change Lyrics
When your time runs out and you're looking for a place to land
I'll step from the shadow into the palm of your hand
When you're out of luck, I'll be what you're looking for
Even if it's not who I am
When you're out of luck, I'll be what you're looking for
Even if it's not who I am

I can change, I can change for you
I can change, I can change for you

I can bend, I can break, I can shift, I can shake
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you, I can change for you
Woo ooh, Woo ooh
Woo ooh, Woo ooh

When your time runs out, and you don't know where to stand
I'll step from the shadow, I'm at your command
And when you're looking for change
I'll be what you're looking for
Even if it's not who I am
I can change, I can change for you
I can change, I can change for you

I can bend, I can break, I can shift, I can shake
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you
I can slip, I can slide, I can run, I can hide
Blaze a trail through the driving rain
Girl, I can change for you

I'll be what you're looking for
I'll be what you're looking for

I can change, I can change for you
I can change, I can change for you

Woo ooh, I can change, Woo ooh
Oh-wooh, I can change, oh-wooh
I can bend, I can break, I can shift, I can shake
Place the trail through the drive of rain
I can slip, I can slide, I can run, I can hide
Place the trail through the drive of rain
Girl, I can change for you
I can change for you
I can change
I'll be what you're looking for
Oh-wooh, oh-wooh, oh-wooh6Embed
