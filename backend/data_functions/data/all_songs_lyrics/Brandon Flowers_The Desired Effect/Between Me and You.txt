Between Me and You Lyrics
Between me and you
I've been thinking about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now (hey)

Between me and you
I've been worried about the future and
Between me and you
I think I'm losing it now

And all my life, I've been told
Follow your dreams but the trail went cold
And the heart don't lie, and that's a good luck charm
But I'm watching it tear out of my arms
And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know

These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes its like a bullet came
And blasted me right of out of the blue
But I'm doing my best not to let it get
Between me and you (Hey)
Between me and you (Come on, child)
I've been struggling just to carry the weight (Get up and fly)
Between me and you (Come on, child)
I think I'm losing it now (Hey, You got to fly)

The first time that I saw your face
Time stood still, I found my place
Now I'm watching it tear out of my arms
And there's a power in letting go
I guess I didn't want to let you know

These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And chasing every dollar, girl, is this what I was born to do?
But I'm doing my best not to let it get
Between me and you

I remember you in white in the garden (Come on, child)
It's been trial after trial (Get up and fly)
Through the ringer in the back, out the window off the track
I was just too proud to know (Come on, child)

There's a power in letting go
Never thought it'd be so hard
These hours I'm working ain't nearly enough
And sometimes it's like a bullet came
And blasted me right of out of the blue
And I don't feel like I've got nothing to show for this life
And I've been wondering, "What am I supposed to do?"
But I'm doing my best not to let it get
Yeah, I'm doing my best not to let it get
And I'm doing my best not to let it get
Between me and you4Embed
