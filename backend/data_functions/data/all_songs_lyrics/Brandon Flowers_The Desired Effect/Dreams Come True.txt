Dreams Come True Lyrics
The highway was teasing me
With promises and visions of a country unseen
In a black limousine
For the better part of my twenties
On the corner of this dirty street
A decade in the making
Just a loser on two tender feet

Saying dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true

She wasn't having anything
No birds or any bees, girl
Don't go shooting all your dogs now
Just cause one's got fleas
I'll bite what turns you sour baby
I've got miles per hour lady
Make up your mind
You never know what you might find

When dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yes they do
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Dreams come true
Yes they do
Dreams come true
Punch the clock, baby on the nightstand
You close your eyes, waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life, bracing for the crash land
You forget, baby it's a dreamland
Baby it's a dreamland

A natural believer
I don't carry any bones
If you see things a little different
I'm not casting any stones
You're taking it for granted
I've got the right to speak my mind
I'll overcome the dark
Just like the dead, the lame, the Leper, and the blind man
Like Lazarus or the mother of Peter's wife

Punch the clock, baby on the nightstand
You close your eyes, waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life, bracing for the crash land
You forget, baby it's a dreamland
Take a chance, underneath the streetlight
Touch my heart, everything is alright
I don't waste my time, on "Where do I park the car?"
I don't stand in line
It's treated me alright so far
If dreams come true
I get to drink the cup
But one fine day
We'll find a better way
(Gonna have a lot to say)

Punch the clock, baby on the nightstand
You close your eyes, waiting for the Sandman
Spend your life, bracing for the crash land
You forget, baby it's a dreamland
Take a chance, underneath the streetlight
Touch my heart, everything is alright

In the blackness of the night
Everything is alright
Woah oh, hey oh! Hey oh! Woah oh, hey oh
Woah oh, hey oh! Hey oh! Woah oh, hey oh
Woah oh, hey oh! Hey oh! Woah oh, hey oh
Woah oh, hey oh! Hey oh! Woah oh, hey oh3Embed
