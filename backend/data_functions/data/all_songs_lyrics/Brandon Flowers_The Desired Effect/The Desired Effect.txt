The Desired Effect Lyrics
She was raised a protestant I was raised by wolves
Both of us saw dignity in vain
The stretching out in paradise
It wasn’t in the cards
See neither of us were ready for the rain

Guess I was caught off guard
When I heard the news last week
Ran into a friend of mine
With the word on the street

That the life that you chose to lead had the desired effect
That you hit the ground running the day that you left
That you’re playing for every side
That you’re going for every kill
But I don't believe it and I never will, never will

Lately it’s all dogs and bones
Chasing every tail
And howling at the injustice of the night
And if I misjudged you, well honey that’s on me
But I really do hope you found a way to get what you need
And the life that you chose to lead had the desired effect
That you hit the ground running the day that you left
That you’re playing for every side
That you’re going for every kill
Well I don’t believe it I never will

Are you wondering where it all goes?
Are you living the way you should?
Are you taking the time to listen?
Is it doing you any good?
Are you wrestling with the demons?
Are you moving the party forward in your time?
(Take your time, any old time)
Are you looking to change the world?
Or have you already changed your mind?
Are you keeping the ten commandments?
Or are you leaving them all behind?
Are you practicing your pirouettes?
Or are you going in blind this time?

Did the life that you chose to lead have the desired effect?
Did you hit the ground running the day that you left?
Are you’re playing for every side?
Are you’re going for every kill?
Well I don’t believe it, I never will
The desired effectEmbed
