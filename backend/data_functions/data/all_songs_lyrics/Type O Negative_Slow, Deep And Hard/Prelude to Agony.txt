Prelude to Agony Lyrics

There is no pain like that of desire
Is there no difference between women and fire?
One burns the spirit, the other the flesh
Is sex worth the price of certain death?
Absolution
I am whole
Absolution
I am
Open her loins and into the hearth
Don't let her flames consume your heart
For the quest of holy copulation
The end result? Self immoilation
Absolution
I am whole
Absolution
I am
Love is life
Life is love
Love is pain
Pain is death
Agony and ecstasy
Your cries of pain, my pleasure
Know my machine internally
Your torment I treasure
Lifeblood combines with semen
Your screaming, my laughter
The compressor's running smoothly
'Tis vengeance I am after
Begging becomes your lovesong
You're dying, haha! I masturbate
For the crime of burning me
I give to thee jackhammerape!

Pain
Pain
Pain
Pain
I hope you enjoy this
