Unsuccessfully Coping with the Natural Beauty of Infidelity Lyrics
"Trust and you'll be trusted,"
Says the liar to the fool
Lust, so what if you're busted?
In love and war, there ain't no rules
Do you believe in forever?
I don't even believe in tomorrow
The only things that last forever
Are memories and sorrow
Kenny!

Alright, check this out

Out of sight, out of mind
The motto of betrayal
The prophets preach to forgive and forget
I'm sorry, but I am unable


Hey, don't think I don't know what you're doing, you stupid twat
You went to L'Amour Saturday night
Red nails and lipstick, dress two sizes too tight
His tongue down your throat, his hand up your skirt
Yeah, I'm a man, but it still hurts
(Slut!)
(Whore!)
(Cunt!)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
You had cock on your mind, and cum on your breath
Inserted that diaphragm before you left
Practicing freelance gynecology
Where there's a womb, there's a way, with you, it's for free
(Slut!)
You fucking whore! (Whore!)
You're a cunt! (Cunt!)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
You've done it before, time after time
Refused to learn your lesson
Gave 'til it hurt, thought it was right
Only fools make mistakes twice
Wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, ho
Wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, wo
So you sit home, drinking alone
Empty bottle in your hand
Don't even try to sort out the lies
It's worse to try to understand
Wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, ho
Wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, wo, ho, ho, wo!
You! You make me hate myself!
Argh! Ah!
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
I know you're fucking someone else
(He knows you're fucking someone else)
I know
(He knows)
I said I know
(He said he knows)
I know (he knows)
I know (he knows)
I know (he knows)
I know (he knows)
I know (he knows)
I know (he knows)
I know!!!
