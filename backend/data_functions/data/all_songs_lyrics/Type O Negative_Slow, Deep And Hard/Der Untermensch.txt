Der Untermensch Lyrics
Hey, you on public assistance
Why don't you get a job?
Sell some dope and buy some pride
The only thing you couldn't rob
Socioparasite!
Socioparasite!
How does it feel to live for free?
Get off society's back
Skells like you allowed to live
You wonder why we're attacked?
Socioparasite!
Socioparasite!

Waste of life!
You're a waste of life!
Getting fucked up on Classon Avenue
Smoking crack and drinking booze
Spike in your arm, no money for food
But there's plenty of gas in your BMW
There's a dopewhore waiting at home
Dealing your shit on the telephone
Poor Tawana's got a birth defect
But it only increases your welfare check
Been doing some thinking, I have an answer
To arrest the spreading cancer
Send you back to where you're from
Get the fuck rid of you subhuman scum
If you don't pay taxes, you shouldn't vote
So get in line and get on the boat
I'd love to tear down all the projects
Kiss my ass, Home Relief reject
Waste of life!
You're a waste of life!
You're a waste of life!Embed
