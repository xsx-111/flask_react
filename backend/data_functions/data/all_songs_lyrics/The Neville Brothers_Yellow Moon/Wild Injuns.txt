Madi Graa injuns down in New Orleans

Madi Graa injuns down in New Orleans
The Yellow Pocohantus
Madi Graa Injuns down in New Orleans
The pretty White Eagles
Madi Graa Injuns down in New Orleans
Here tome the ninth ward hunters
Madi Graa injuns down in New Orleans
Oh de Golden Eagles
Under the yellow moon
While the sky is black and dark
All the Injuns head uptown
To meet in Shakespeare Park
They all gonna be pretty
Have no kind of fear
They all sew them brand new suits
To mask in every year
Wild injuns down in New Orleans
Gotta a bloody catapillo
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Oh we wop de willow
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Singing mighty cooty fiyo
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Charlie put fiyo on day biyo
You shoulda seen Big Mama
She was the queen of the Melpomene
Chief Jolly were his golden crown
She wore black and green
As the sun started rising
And the sky got clear and blue
They met all the other injuns gangs
Wearing their new suits too
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Curay malindo
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Chocki mo findo
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Jump up and down now
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Turn all around now
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Lil Booby from the Bella
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Aw I walk a Nella
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Singin' coo-cootchi malay
Wild Injuns down in New Orleans
Big Chief JollyEmbed
