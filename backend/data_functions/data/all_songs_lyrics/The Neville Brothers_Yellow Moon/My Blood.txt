My Blood LyricsBrother blood, brother blood
We're of the same spirit, of the same mud
Brother blood, brother blood
We" re from the same water, we're from the same
I've got scars from living, scars from love
Strike me dead if I'm lying
I've got brothers below, and brothers above
With all of our blood we are trying
I keep trying for everything
It comes a piece at a time
I've got a mountain I'm determined to climb
But I took the heat, created the beat
And I've got the heart of a lion
I've got friends who are dead, friends in jail
I've got friends who are policemen
And the girls I know now, the girls I knew then
I still make my music to please them
I keep trying for everything, I don't count the cost
But I see an ocean I'm determined to cross
'Cause I look the heat, created the beat
And I've got the strength of a dragon
I've got dims of the jungle, drums of the street
Dims of the Indian chief
I've got the fire of the gospel, a river of blues
And I got the soul of belief
And I keep trying for everything
It's been a long, long road
I've got a song that's about to explode
I was born to the beat that pounds like the heat
And I've got the drums of the spirit
Brother blood, brother blood
We're of the same spirit, of the same mud
Brother blood, brother blood
We're from the same water, we're from the same
