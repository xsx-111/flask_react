Wake Up LyricsOur world has begun to spin
Like a Ferris wheel
The threat of world annihilation
Is getting very real
And what of hope and happiness?
Are they forever lost?
Or will Jah step in
And prevent another holocaust
Everybody better wake up
Everybody better wake up
The superpowers better wake up
The world powers better wake up
We're living in the times
The Bible calls Revelation
It seems keeping peace on Earth
Is man's greatest tribulation
But you know the greatest crime of all
You know the greatest sin
The next war will be the final conflict
And no one's gonna win
Everybody better wake up
Everybody better wake up
The superpowers better wake up
The world powers better wake up
Now when I lay me down to sleep
I pray the world last just one more week
You know, it keeps me feeling sad
The good's gonna suffer with the bad
Oh Jah know it is so
Everybody better wake up
Everybody better wake up
The superpowers better wake up
The world powers better wake up
Everybody better wake up
Everybody better wake up
The superpowers better wake up
The world powers better wake up
Everybody better wake up
Everybody better wake up
The superpowers better wake up
The world powers better wake up
Everybody better wake up
Everybody better wake up
The superpowers better wake up
The world powers better wake upEmbed
