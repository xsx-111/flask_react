Yellow Moon LyricsYellow moon, yellow moon
Why you keep peeping in my window?
Do you know something I don't know?
Did you see my baby
Walking down the railroad tracks?
You can tell me if the girls
Ever coming back
Is she hid out with another
Or is she trying to get back home?
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms?
Or is the girl somewhere all alone?
Can you see if she is missing me
Or is she having a real good time?
Has she forgotten all about me
Or is the girl still mine all mine?
With your eye so big a shiney
You can see the whole damn land
Yellow moon can you tell me
If the girl's with another man?
Man?
Man?
Oh yellow moon, yellow moon, yellow moon
Have you seen that creole woman
You can tell me
Now ain't you a friend of mine
With your eye so big a shiney
You can see the whole damn land
Yellow moon can you tell me
If the girl's with another man?
Oh yellow moon, yellow moon, yellow moon
Have you seen that creole woman
You can tell me
Now ain't you a friend of mineEmbed
