Fire and Brimstone LyricsI had a dream last night
While I was lyin' on my bed
The world was standin' still
And the moon was turnin' red
I saw a sign in the sky
I have come to set you free
There's a light shinin' bright
Shinin' down, down on me
(Chorus)
I saw fire
Fire and brimstone comin' down
On my head
I saw fire
Fire and brimstone comin' down
On my head
I saw life, I heard a voice sayin' come to me
I heard a rumblin' beneath my feet
And a whole world was shakin' free
I came to dark and still
And in the dark I could see
(Chorus)
I saw fire
Fire and brimstone comin' down
On my head
I saw fire
Fire and brimstone comin' down
On my head
I turned around, I saw ice
I heard a voice sayin' come to me
I saw the sun standin' still
Everything was dark
But I could see
(Chorus)
I saw fire
Fire and brimstone comin' down
On my head
I saw fire
Fire and brimstone comin' down
On my head
