Voodoo LyricsOh, you must a put Voodoo on me
Oh, you must a cast a spell
The way I'm loving you girl
Ain't no tongue can tell
Oh you must a been burning candles
Oh to make a love so strong
You must a sprinkled dust all around my bed
You must a had a black cat bone
Just at a glance
You know you put me in a trance
Oh, when I look into your eyes
Girl you have me hypnotized
Oh, you must a put Voodoo on me
Oh, you must a cast a spell
The way you got me loving you girl
Ain't no tongue can tell
Oh, if I call on Magnolia
Could she break this spell on me
Father Black Hawk or Mother Dora
I wonder could they set me free, free
Oh you must a put Voodoo on me
Oh you must a cast a spell
The way you got me loving you girl
Ain't no tongue can tell
Voodoo woman
Voodoo woman
Voodoo woman
