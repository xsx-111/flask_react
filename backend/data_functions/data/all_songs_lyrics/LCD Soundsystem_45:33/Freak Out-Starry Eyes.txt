Freak Out/Starry Eyes Lyrics
 x5
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
If we do it again, I'm gonna freak out
So do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

 x2
Starry eyes, doot doot

Late night, miss the train
Waiting in the rain
All night on the floor
And my feet are sore

Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more
 x4
Starry eyes, doot doot

Fool's out on the make
School's out and it's late
It's you I'm waiting for
Want to see you more, see you more

Uh huh
Uh huh
 x2
Starry eyes, doot doot

Bright lights in my eyes
Got me hypnotised
Late night on the floor
Wanting so much more, so much more
 x5
Starry eyes, doot dootEmbed
