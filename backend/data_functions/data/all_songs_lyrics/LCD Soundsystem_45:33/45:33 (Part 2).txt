45:33 (Part 2) LyricsShame on you
Shame on you
Hey, your love away from me
You can't hide

Hey
Your love away from me
Hey
Shame on you
Your love away from me
You can't hide
Hey
Your love away from me
Shame on you
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely
Oh no, still you can, and I'll be lonely

Shame on youEmbed
