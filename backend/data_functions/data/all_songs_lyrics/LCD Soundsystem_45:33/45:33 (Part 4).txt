45:33 (Part 4) LyricsMy favorite song
My favorite song
Reminds me of the first time I went to space
It was such a long journey
It took hours, days, years
But when it was over...
Oh, it takes me back
That takes me back to the first time
I stepped into space
You were there
You were there with all my best friends
I remember
I remember the look on your face
The way you said, with your eyes
You said

And then I slipped out of the Sun's sphere of influence
Nothing was happening
It was so dizzying
And then you took everything from me
I was left here, a shell of my self
I was left here to pick up the pieces
And every piece was...
Love, give me love
That's when you saved me
At the last possible moment
You brought your big hand out
And scooped up my ship
And took me home
That day you gave a new faith
In how people can save one another
Instead of always putting out their hands
To crush

When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na

When you're out in space
You feel so light
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
When you're out in space
You feel so light
