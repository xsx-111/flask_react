So Like Candy Lyrics
Here lies the powder and perfume
The pretty clothes are scattered 'round the room
And it's so like Candy
Here lies the lipstick and the face
The colored tablets keep it all in place
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy

What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one that I have to love
So like Candy?

Here lies a picture of a girl
Her arms are tight around that lucky guy
And it's so like Candy
And in her eyes a certain look
I thought I'd seen the last of long ago
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy

What did I do to make her go?
Why must she be the one that I have to love so?
I remember the day that that picture was taken
We were so happy then, but that's so like Candy
She seemed so sweet to me I was mistaken
Oh no, not that again, but that's so like Candy
She just can't face the day
So she turns and melts away

Here lie the records that she scratched
And on the sleeve I find a note attached
And it's so like Candy
"My Darling Dear it's such a waste"
She couldn't say "goodbye", but "I admire your taste"
And it's so like Candy
So like Candy
So like Candy
So like Candy
So like CandyEmbed
