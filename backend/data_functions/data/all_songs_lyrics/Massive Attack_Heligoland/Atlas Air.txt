Atlas Air Lyrics
Yes, shall we take a spin again in business?
This time is fixed, let's sweeten our facilities
It took all the man in me
To be the thug you wanted me to be
Shall we take a spin again, no witnesses?
This time is fixed seven three seven is
You won't feel a thing
Begging until you give it up and sing

Fish like little silver knives
Make the cuts on my inside
Yeah, let him feast my heart is big, my heart is big
My blood will slide in metal studs
Tourniquet will hold its groove
Tourniquet will keep its grip
It took all the man in me
To be the thug you wanted me to be

Yeah, let him feast my heart is big
My heart is big, my blood will slide
You let him feast my heart is big
My heart is big, my blood will slide
Got nothing to lose but my chains
Internet feeds on my brains
Head in the sand, feet in the clay
And time is still like grease it slips
Sucking in, spitting pips, yeah, spitting pips
Nothing to lose but my chains
Internet beats on my brains
Head in the sand, feet in the clay
A place to piss, a place to pray

A little money should get me on my feet
This gun of smoke is slaying me
And time is still like grease it slips
Sucking in, spitting pips, yeah, spitting pips
My heart was big and like my pride
Let them feast on my insides
And when the filled had spilled its guts
Gently open then it shuts

I'm in the hole
Three thousand days
A buried soul
They live the dream
In terminal
No war too mean
I know the drill
Got cells to burn
I'm dressed to kill
A mortal coil
And time is still
On secret soil
Yeah, pay the bills
Cells to burn
Mouths to fill
On Boeing jets
In the sunset make glowing threats
