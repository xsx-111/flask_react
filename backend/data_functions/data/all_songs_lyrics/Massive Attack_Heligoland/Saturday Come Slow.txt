Saturday Come Slow Lyrics
Lost in the magic
From the last time
This town turning
My arrows to desire

Saturday come slow
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Is there nothing there?

In the limestone caves
In the southwest lands
What towns in the kingdom
Beneath us understand?

Saturday come slow
Do you love me?
Do you love me
Or is there nothing there?

Saturday come slow
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Is there nothing there?2Embed
