Splitting the Atom Lyrics
The bed it was warm nettles and ferns
The evening it chokes the candle it burns
This disguise covers bitter lies
Repeating the joke the meaning it dies
Pass me a coat I'm not afraid to leave
I'm letting you know I know what you need
I'll turn you around this beautiful town
And then you'll believe it when your eyes then deceive you

Its easy, dont let it go
Its easy, dont let it go
Its easy, dont let it go
Don't lose It

Its getting colder outside your rented space
They shadowbox and they paper chase
It never stops and we'll never learn
No hope without dope the jobless return
The bankers have bailed the mighty retreat
The pleasure it fails at the end of the week
You take it or leave or what you receive
To what you receive is eternited leave
Its easy, dont let it go
Its easy, dont let it go
Its easy, dont let it go
Don't lose it

Incandescent light at doors
In adolescent menopause
In little clicks you got the music stops
The needle sticks and the penny drops
The summer's gone before you know
The muffled drums of relentless flow
You're looking at stars that give you vertigo
The sun's still burning and dust will blow
Honey scars I'll keep you near
Our blood is gold nothing to fear
We killed the time and I love you dear
A kiss of wine we'll disappear
The last of the last particles
Divisible invisible
The last of the last particles
Divisible invisible4Embed
