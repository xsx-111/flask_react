Flat of the Blade Lyrics
I'm not good in a crowd
I've got skills I can't speak of
Things I've seen will chase me to the grave

I'm not good in a crowd
I've got skills I can't speak of over there
Things that I've seen will chase me to the grave

Led with your hands tied
Fed to the sandflies
You stumble the dunes
Complain to the moon

Back's to the wheel
There's granite to shove
Take it
They give it
So rivet for rivet
I will build for my family a bulletproof love

How does it feel
The weight of the steel?
The weight of the steel
Of the flat of the blade
How does it feel
To kneel at the feet
To kneel at the feet
Of the choices you make
I'm not good in a crowd
I've got skills I can't speak of
Things I've seen will chase me
To the grave

Back's to the wheel
There's granite to shove
Take it
They give it
And rivet for rivet
I will build for my family a bulletproof love3Embed
