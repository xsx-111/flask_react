Babel Lyrics
Say it was our babel
Say it was my babel
It was my babel
Tell your people

Now you know it's over
Rolling off her shoulder
You can take a ladder to the shadows
And forget
Was it how she kissed you?
And then dismissed you?
Was it purposeful and
Was it just to hook you in?

Hallucinating, chasing, changing, racing
Breaking, hating 'til you lost it all
Well you lost your girlfriend
She was not going
Where you were going
You were on your own

He was quick to burning
He was slow to learning
Though his eyes were misted
He still kissed her when she cried
You did your best to please her
You didn't up and leave her
You befriended the harsh way it ended, now sleep tight
Hallucinating, chasing, changing, pacing
Bracing, breaking, till you lost it all
Would you listen to see
She led you to me
We felt it truly
As we could in love

I wanna be the one who should've said "truth" and not "dare"
I'm running so far out of my head
This rain of heart that ripples my pain
You can never settle by thinking away, awayEmbed
