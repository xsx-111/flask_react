Girl I Love You Lyrics
Girl, I love you but your loving has gone
Forever
Gonna miss you but my love has gone
Forever

I said, I love you but your loving has gone
Forever
Gonna miss you but my love has gone
Forever

Girl, I'm back in Spanish town
Ain't no trouble coming around
You promise you will never let me down
If you love me that much you will stick around

It's hard to tell that your love exist
But I know this one is for real

Girl, I love you but your loving has gone
Forever
