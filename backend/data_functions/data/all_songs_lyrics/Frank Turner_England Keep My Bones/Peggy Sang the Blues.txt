Peggy Sang the Blues Lyrics
Peggy came to me in my sleep
In the middle of the night, on a Friday night last week
She whispered, "Hush, child, now don't be scared
I got me a few words of wisdom that I came back to share"
And she said
It doesn't matter where you come from
It matters where you go
No one gets remembered
For the things they didn't do

I said "Peggy, won't you stay here for a while?
"We can drink whisky, we can play cards, and we can get wild"
She said, "We'll play poker and we'll play for keeps
I've only played angels lately and they never let me cheat"

It doesn't matter where you come from
It matters where you go
No one gets remembered, in this listless life
For the things they didn't do

And you can say I had a good start
And you can say I had class
And you can say that I was born beneath a ceiling made of glass
But I always kept an open house
And yeah, I always did right by my friends
And when I got to St. Peter's gate, I told the keeper
"I'm not the one who needs to make amends"
'Cause better times are coming
Better times ahead
And no one gets remembered, my deathless child
So don't waste too long in bed
And Peggy said

It doesn't matter where you come from
It matters where you go
No one gets remembered, in this listless, loveless life
For the things they didn't do, no, no, no, no, no

While Peggy sang the blues, as I drifted off
Peggy sang the blues, as I drifted off
While Peggy sang the blues, as I drifted off
While Peggy sang the blues
Peggy sang the blues6Embed
