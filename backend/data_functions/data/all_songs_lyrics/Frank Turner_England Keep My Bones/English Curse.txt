English Curse Lyrics

Many years back when the old oaks were young
Not long after the Northmen had come
A low and evil deed was done
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

From the shores of Normandy King William came
To Albion fair, King Harold to slay
With greed in his heart and his scurrilous claim
He took the land for his own
He took the land for his own

Now John was a blacksmith, an honest old man
He raised up his children and he worked with his hands
At his family's forge in a patch of land
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

King William rode out after his victory
To ravage the land in his hunger to thieve
For hunting grounds in the Wessex trees
He took the land for his own
He took the land for his own
But if you steal the land of an Englishman
Then you shall know this curse
Your first born son's warm blood will run
Upon the English earth

Now King William's son was called Rufus the Red
He took up the crown when his father was dead
And he rode the hunting grounds in his stead
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest

But John's curse, it called out and Walt Tyrrell fired low
His arrow struck Rufus with a sickening blow
And he fell from his horse to the ground below
And the land took him for its own
The land took him for its own

So if you steal the land of an Englishman
Then you shall know this curse
Your first born son's warm blood will run
Upon the English earth
Many years back when these old oaks were young
Not long after the Northmen had come
A low and evil deed was done
In the dark of the New Forest
In the dark of the New Forest6Embed
