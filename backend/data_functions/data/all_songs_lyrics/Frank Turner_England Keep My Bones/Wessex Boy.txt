Wessex Boy Lyrics
Rolling yeah one two
C'mon one two one two three four

Let me tell you all a little story of the things I've found
Hanging out and drinking with my friends in the cathedral grounds
And later dodging drunks as we dance along Jewry Street
As we wander up town to The Railway, our friends to meet

There's something about coming back to your hometown again
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends
And though none of them still live here, and I've got nowhere to go
I'm a Wessex Boy, and when I'm here, I'm home

Let me tell you all a little story of the things I've lost
Huddling for warmth on the top step of the Buttercross
Sitting on the benches by the bridges at the riverside
Of counting down the hours for the buses 'cause I missed my ride

There's something about coming back to your hometown again
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends
And though none of them still live here, and I've got nowhere to go
I'm a Wessex boy, a Wessex boy, and when I'm here, I'm home
And one day I will hear this song anonymous and sweet
Ringing out from a busker's guitar on the ancient city streets
I'll pause a while and smile before I continue on the lawn
And somebody else will sing the words and I'll feel like I'm home

There's something about hometowns that you never can escape
The triumphs and the tragedies, the tortured little fates
The welling of nostalgia and a feeling kind of strange
'Cause despite the little changes, yeah, this place still feels the same

There's something about coming back to your hometown again
The place where you grew up and where you found your firmest friends
And though none of them still live here, and I've got nowhere to go
I'm a Wessex boy, I'm a Wessex boy, and when I'm here, I'm home3Embed
