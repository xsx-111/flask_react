If Ever I Stray Lyrics
Forgive me, someone, for I have sinned
And I know not where I should begin
And some days it feels like you just can't win
No matter what you do or say

Things didn't kill me but I don't feel stronger
Life is short but it feels much longer
When you've lost that fight
Yeah, you've lost that hunger
To pull yourself through the day

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me on back to shore!
'Cause love is free and life is cheap
And as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Some clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more
So come on, everybody sing it 1, 2, 3, 4

So we all have secrets that we hold inside
Yeah, the worst little things that you never confide
And the worst one of all that you just can't hide
Is that you're never quite as strong as you sound
So I'm sorry, baby, for the times I've hurt you
Sorry, friends, for the times I desert you
Most days it feels like I don't deserve you
And I wonder that you're all still around

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me on back to shore!
'Cause love is free and life is cheap
And as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Some clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more
So come on, everybody sing it 1, 2, 3, 4

Come on and join me in the water
And we'll swim for home
Sometimes it's hard to remember
I couldn't do this on my own

But if ever I stray from the path I follow
Take me down to the English Channel
Throw me in where the water is shallow
And then drag me on back to shore!
'Cause love is free and life is cheap
And as long as I've got me a place to sleep
Some clothes on my back and some food to eat
Then I can't ask for anything more
I won't ask for anything more
The path I chose isn't straight and narrow
It wanders around like a drunken fellow
Some days it's hard for me to follow
But if you've got my back, I'll go on
If you've got my back, I'll go on3Embed
