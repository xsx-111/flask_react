Eulogy LyricsNot everyone grows up to be an astronaut
Not everyone was born to be a king
Not everyone can be Freddie Mercury
Everyone can raise a glass and sing
Well, I haven't always been a perfect person
And I haven't done what mom and dad had dreamed
But on the day I die I'll say, "At least I fucking tried"
That's the only eulogy I need
That's the only eulogy I need6Embed
