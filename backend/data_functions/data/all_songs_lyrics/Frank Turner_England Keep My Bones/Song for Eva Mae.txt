Song for Eva Mae LyricsEva Mae
I remember the day that you were born
It was the summer
Your mum and dad called me up to say how proud
They were
Voices ringing with the love of a new born child
Light shining in their eyes, expectant smiles
Eva Mae
Well, your father and I have been friends
Many years
Watched the world around us change
Hoped our hopes, feared our fears
He asked me to watch you as you grow
To hold your hand through the highs and lift you up through the lows
Now Eva Mae
Don't you judge me too hard
I've tried to be a good man, to make the best with what I've got
And Eva Mae
I will teach you what I know
And watch over you everywhere that you go
Eva Mae
I have made many mistakes
In my time
Burned my share of bridges and broken hearts
I've told lies
I have not always followed my own advice
I've fallen flat
But Eva, darling, sometimes that's just life
Eva Mae
With the way that I am I might not
Much be around
But I'll stop in from time to time to share
The things I've learnt
You should keep your friends and family close
And always always always always try to say yes
And we can none of us ever be perfect
But darling, we can try our best
Now Eva Mae
I won't ever judge you hard
Just try to be a good girl and make the best with what you got
And Eva Mae
I will teach you what I know
And watch over you everywhere that you go
Everywhere you go1Embed
