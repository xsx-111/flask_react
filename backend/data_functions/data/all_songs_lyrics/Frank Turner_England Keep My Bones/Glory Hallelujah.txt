Glory Hallelujah Lyrics
Brothers and sisters, have you heard the news?
The storm has lifted and there's nothing to lose
So swap your confirmation for your dancing shoes
Because there never was no God
Step out of the darkness and onto the streets
Forget about the fast, let's have a carnival feast
Raise up your lowered head and hear the liberation beat
Because there never was no God

There is no God
So clap your hands together
There is no God
No heaven and no hell
There is no God
We're all in this together
There is no God
So ring that victory bell

No cowering in the dark before some overbearing priest
No waiting until we die until we restitute the meek
No blaming all our failings on imaginary beasts
Because there never was no God
No fighting for a land your distant fathers told you of
No spilling blood for those who never spread a drop of love
No finger pointing justified by phantoms up above
Because there never was no God

There is no God
So clap your hands together
There is no God
No heaven and no hell
There is no God
We're all in this together
There is no God
So ring that victory bell

And I know you're scared of dying, man, and I am, too
But just pretending it's not happening isn't gonna see us through
If we accept that there's an end game and we haven't got much time
Then in the here and now then we can try and do things right
We'll be our own salvation army, and together we believe
In all the wondrous things that mere mortals can achieve
Well, I've known beauty in the stillness of cathedrals in the day
I've sung, "Glory Hallelujah! Won't you wash my sins away?"
But now I'm singing my refrain, and this is what I say
I say there never was no God
There is no God
So clap your hands together
There is no God
No heaven and no hell
There is no God
We're all in this together
There is no God
So ring that victory bell
One more time

There is no God
So clap your hands together
There is no God
No heaven and no hell
There is no God
We're all in this together
There is no God
So ring that victory bell3Embed
