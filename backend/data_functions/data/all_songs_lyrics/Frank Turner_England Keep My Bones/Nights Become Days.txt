Nights Become Days Lyrics
We soared in the dawn from the roof of the bar
When nights become days, then you've gone too far
We've listened to songbirds and rush hour cars and welcomed in the day
Peace in London in summertime is great
On days like this I feel like I can escape
And things that I've done and mistakes that I've made
I can wash it all away

We bathed like swimmers in the morning sun, and waited for our night to end
We knew that one of us would come down hard and one of us would start again

We started out curious, it started out fun
We smoked in the woods when we were young
And secretly slipped something under our tongues
And danced the night away
But everyone stumbles on old cocaine
It burns up the best, and it burdens the brain
â€˜Til brown comes and whispers away the pain
And you find you've lost your way

We bathed like swimmers in the morning sun, and waited for our night to end
We knew that one of us would come down hard and one of us would start again
You'd sink in the river for your death
You'd sleep with the fishes, and draw no breath
You'd swallow forever, till nothing's left
Take no rest
Oh, my friend, if you made for the shore
You'd see us here
We're all waiting
Just cast your eyes down to the floor
You'll see us here
We're waiting
Don't sink in the river for your death
You can sleep in the shade, and draw some breath
You could start fresh tomorrow, and leave what's left
Please, draw breath
Please, draw breath
Let's let nights become days

So come down, kid, the roof's not safe now
All your friends are waiting for you to get some rest4Embed
