Wanderlust LyricsI have wept until I've slept
Into the lap of the lady that I love
And though she begged and she cajoled
I couldn't tell her what I was thinking of
I didn't choose, no, I was chosen
By a life that must be lived in passing through
And though she changed so much for me
Changing this is the one thing I cannot do

Darling, I'm leaving
The distance keeps calling me on
Darling, come morning
I'll be gone
She is beauty, she is graceful
In a poison, she is gentle in her care
She is the calm in the centre of my storm
She has her fingers through my hair
She has my heart but it is breaking
Cause it knows that deep inside she still believes
That there will ever come a morning when I'm staying
And not gathering to leave

Baby, let's get out of the city
We need to breathe some cleaner air
That creeping feeling starting like I miss you
And we're both of us still here
There's a sadness in your smiles now
And an edge of desperation in your voice
We have all this independence
But it still feels like we never had a choice
Darling, I'm leaving2Embed
