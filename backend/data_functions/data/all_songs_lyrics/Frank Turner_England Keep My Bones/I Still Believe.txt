I Still Believe Lyrics
Hear ye, hear ye
Friends and Romans, countrymen
Hear ye, hear ye
Punks and skins and journeymen
Hear ye, hear ye
My sisters and my brethren
The time is coming near
Come ye, come ye
To soulless corporate circus tops
Come ye, come ye
To toilet circuit touring stops
Come ye, come ye
To bedrooms, bars, and bunker squats
The sound is ringing clear

Now who'd have thought that after all
Something as simple as rock and roll would save us all
Now who'd have thought that after all
It was rock and roll

Hear ye, hear ye
Now anybody could take this stage
Hear ye, hear ye
And make miracles for minimum wage
Hear ye, hear ye
These folk songs for the modern age
Will hold us in their arms
Right here, right now
Elvis brings his children home
Right here, right now
You never have to feel alone
Right here, right now
Teenage kicks and gramophones
We hold them in our hearts

Now who'd have thought that after all
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all?
Who'd have thought that after all
It was rock and roll?

And I still believe in the saints
Yeah, in Jerry Lee and in Johnny and all the greats
And I still believe in the sound
That has the power to raise a temple and tear it down
And I still believe in the need
For guitars and drums and desperate poetry
And I still believe that everyone
Can find a song for every time they've lost and every time they've won
So just remember, folks, we're not just saving lives, we're saving souls
And we're having fun
And I still believe

Now who'd have thought that after all
Something as simple as rock 'n' roll would save us all?
Now who'd have thought that after all
Something so simple, something so small
Who'd have thought after all
It's rock and roll?6Embed
