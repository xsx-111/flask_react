Dogchild LyricsSticky leather and wedding bells
Relieving happy Holly of her lotus cells
Idle daughters
Faceless lovers
I'll find love where vulture hovers
I know that itchy trigger finger's waiting for some voodoo
Take your ass to the countryside and bag yourself some moo-moo
Daisy thinks she's hot
The way she make her tail sway
I'll show that bitch what's hot
With my uzi and my AK
A million stupid cows
Just praying for a drive-by
An RPG up a bovine butt will make those T-bones fly
The first absolute
Has a damaged section
The awful truth
Of a rodent erection
Prima donna's pink cocoon
Bridal leakage prism tune
We will increase beneath your heat
Sadly missing
Badly pissing
Away our family time spent fishing
He arrived in Lullaby Land today
And his wife will be here by Sunday
Butterfly demon
Descend from hiding
Laughing heathen
Kiss the lightning
Pheromones of rodent war
Will drift away to every shore
Mary Kay lady, teenage whore
Leisure time forevermore
We will increase beneath your heatEmbed
