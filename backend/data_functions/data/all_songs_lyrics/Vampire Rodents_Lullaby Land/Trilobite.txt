Trilobite LyricsCome up with something original
Steal, steal
Steal decent shit if you're going to steal
Strip, strip
Strip down to scrap and fuck the rest
Drop, drop
Drop popular and don't resist
Recycle sense, but burn the box
Get inside
Reclaim, refuse to fuel the cause
Now it's mine
Survival based on what is overlooked
Fed with the waste of the throwaway civilized
And it will persist
It continues to grow
On and on...
Come on, come on
It's feeding time
Take a trilobite
It exists because we forget
What we forgot wasn't meaningless
There's something living in the sediment
Something alive in the sediment
Come on, come on
It's feeding time
Take a trilobiteEmbed
