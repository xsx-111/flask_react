Crib Death LyricsThere's a simple U.N. formula now
Need a quarter million body count
Before they send the blue boys out
Neutered league of nations
It's cowardice repaid
Brave Muslims wake their asses up with a mushroom over Belgrade
Gold, opium for plutonium
Warheads cross the lines
Snakes before each nation's gate
Options out of time
A soldier out of combat
Is a child without a face
Don't covet them as guardians
That can't be replaced
A world war economy
Is what this order needs
Combat cable channels
Will sow them with our seedsEmbed
