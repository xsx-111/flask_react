Nosedive LyricsOne hundred percent ordinary
I never learned no concern
I never thought twice about anything
Accepting it all with nothing to say
I'm on my way
The system in which we live is designed to protect us
It's for our own good
And why question that?
I agree with the way they evaluate my life
I'd compromise anything of mine to satisfy
I don't mind the hatred around me
I never even noticed it
I don't need to fight with nothing to say
The fate corporation has me enslaved
It's out of my hands
I never even tried
