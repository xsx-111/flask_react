Scavenger LyricsThe father's irrelevance makes the lineage distinct
No one apologizes if their chromosomes are linked
A meaning outside of function means
The white man has defective genes
We're just waiting for you to die
Crucified Serbians line the road
The crow roost rustles and rodents roam
Butchered Bobby
Brick by brick
For trick or treat
He took the trick
Crawling Neptune twixt her thighs
Count the scars beneath her lies
Righteous wrath of words unmoving
Memory is drunk and soothing
Dream crime delirium
Fast approaching waters
Sleepwalk to the guillotine of your fathers
Greetings comfort woman soldier
Vengeance grows as it gets older
Begging deaf to stalking mask
Mercy moves beyond your grasp
We're just waiting for you to die
Surrounded and tethered
Bored human feelings
Stale, old, and weathered
The red rain congealing
No emotion
No remorse
No compassion
Only comedy
We're just waiting for you to dieEmbed
