Dervish LyricsShapeshifter, virus saviour
Black elf blinds the angel's neighbor
Liberate the sugar gene
Redemption for the flesh machine
Are you feeding something to your family?
Are you feeding your family to something?
Horrible thing to believe
Tommy locked in the closet
Sappho's cannibals grieve
And their wardogs will devour it
Gothic leprechaun orgasm
Devil-fish invade the Galleon
Fattened imps miscalculate
Ripper leap-frogged the chambermaid
Asphalt lizard's an acrobat
In misshapen Dorothy's pubis
Fossilized and free of fat
They've hidden the heretic's hubris
Cemetery walls intact
Dogs have disemboweled the cat
Shapeshifter, virus saviour
Black elf blinds the angel's neighbor
Neolithic grotto gnome
From pungent herring made a home
Shimmering nightmare smegma man
If we can't find you - he sure can
Skeletons framed by angled stakes
Shepherd eats what mother makes
Perfect meter and casserole
I'm going home to dig a hole
Gingersnap, labia net
Luring home our teacher's petEmbed
