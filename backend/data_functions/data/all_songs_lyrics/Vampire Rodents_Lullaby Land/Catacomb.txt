Catacomb LyricsDreamtime linen
Dragging tremor
Shadows eat all I remember
Silver gaze robotic
Engine pulse narcotic
Saw her from the cockpit
Just before the missiles hit
Black-winged angels coming down
They are coming to your town
Chiseled leather-face technician
Barometric detonator
Slabs of fat piled in the kitchen
Mother is a traitor
Bamboo in the roses
Border in our sight
Eclipse never fades
Flame consumes the night
Cold gray stone to cheek
Touchwish pressure seek
Wounded beast in a gutted crescent
An evil past
A hollow present
We will know where you have been
We can smell your starving sinEmbed
