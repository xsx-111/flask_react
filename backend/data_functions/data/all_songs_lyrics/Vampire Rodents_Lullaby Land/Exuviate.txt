Exuviate LyricsBack again for another treat
Ashes grow beneath our feet
War in Zurich
Chaos rules
Dada steers the ship of fools
Fire, air
Molten waves beneath the ocean
Sinking vacuum corridor
Damaged relay, child emotion
Uncertain what instinct is for
Di decadimento determinano
I break, I twist, I burn, I laugh
I break, I twist, I burn, I laugh
Fire, the well is dry
Air, the wolves are coming
Fire, a fear of flowers
Air, always blooming
Property does not exist
A spider laugh
A broken fist
Di decadimento determinano
Warm embrace from leather wings
Cold nose smells your private things
I break, I twist, I burn, I laugh
Concealed from the inner
The outer reversed
In the house of Venus
Mars is cursed
Flesh and mortar
Brick and bone
In Babylon they'll make their home
Di decadimento determinano
Listen children and listen well
Or see the ice cream man in hell
Treat the mice with great respect
You haven't seen their cousins yetEmbed
