Allergies Lyrics
No one wants to talk about the fight we had in June
And when December rolls around, I won't be next to you
You used all the Afterpay and I got no returns
Don't let me stop all your fun, there's lessons to be learned

Call me in the morning
Put me in my place
I did my best to love you
I did my best to stay

The characters we used to play are walking off the stage
There's nothing left to organise, all your shit is safe
I picked up these allergies somewhere on my own
I'm scratching off my skin again, I rub down to the bone

Call me in the morning
Put me in my place
I did my best to love you
I did my best to stay
I did my best to stayEmbed
