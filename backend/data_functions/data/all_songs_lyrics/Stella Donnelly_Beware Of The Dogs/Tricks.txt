Tricks Lyrics
You had dinner at Jude's and you broke all the plates
Telling your favourite joke where you break all the plates
You threw all of your clothes off the back of the boat
You said that you’re gonna quit, but we know that you won't
You won't, you won’t

You only like me when I do my tricks for you
You wear me out like you wear that Southern Cross tattoo
You said I'd look much better if I dropped the attitude
Leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone, ah

You've got all of your ducks lined up in a row
Driving back from the job with Kyle and Jackie O
You want all of us to pull you out of the muck
You're always wanting a kiss and then you want to get laid
Get laid, ah, get laid

You only like me when I do my tricks for you
And you wear me out like you wear that Southern Cross tattoo
You said I'd look much better if I dropped the attitude
Leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone
Oh, oh
Yoo-hoo

You only like me when I do my tricks for you
And you wear me out like you wear that Southern Cross tattoo
I'd look better if I dropped the attitude
Oh, leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone
Leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone, leave it alone3Embed
