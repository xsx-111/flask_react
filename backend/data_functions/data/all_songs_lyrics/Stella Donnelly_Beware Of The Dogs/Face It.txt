Face It Lyrics
I don't think I will ever forget, but it will get easier
To leave and come back home, act like I'd never gone
I don't think I will ever forget, but it will get easier
To watch you from the furthest city in the world

My eyes are painted on
My eyes are painted on

If I put all the evidence and the arguments aside
Leave the fear behind, I'll chase you through the calendar
I have questioned everything that I never would before
You crashed down all the walls
And watched me scramble out of bed

My smile is pasted on
My smile is pasted on

I'm locked out of my body and all its usual common sense
I'll be here in the end, playing with myself again1Embed
