Watching Telly Lyrics
Signs are telling me that I'm not right
I'm not worthy of the choice to make my own choices for my body
He was twenty-seven, I was twenty-one
He liked Ernest Hemingway, I liked watching telly

I needed someone
They told me I'm wrong
God loves his children
But God loves men, Jesus Christ
She's just trying to get by
Threw her lover out tonight
'Cause he can't seem to get it right
Get it right

Took the long way home from the doctor
Only spoke to a few friends before the surgery
Threw up on my birthday
They tape dollar signs to our bodies
And tell us not to show our skin
If it's good enough for the boys, it's good enough for us

I needed someone
They told me I'm wrong
God loves his children
But God loves men, Jesus Christ
She's just trying to get by
Threw her lover out tonight
'Cause he can't seem to get it right
Get it right

I needed someone
They told me I'm wrong
God loves his children
But God loves men, Jesus Christ
She's just trying to get by
Threw her lover out tonight
Oh, he can't seem to get it right
Oh, God loves men, Jesus Christ
Love this country, love my wife
We're waiting in the chemist line
'Cause we can't seem to get it right
Get it rightEmbed
