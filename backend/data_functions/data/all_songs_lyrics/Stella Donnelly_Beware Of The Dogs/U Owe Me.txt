U Owe Me Lyrics
I don't think I'll ever be coming back
To work for you, so you can tell them that
You just turned out to be a bellyache
I don't believe a single word you say

You owe me, ya owe me
You owe me, ya owe me
You owe me, ya owe me

You put your great ideas up your nose
Then try to tell me where the fuck to go
You're jerking off to the CCTV
While I'm pouring plastic pints of flat VB, oh, ah

You owe me, ya owe me
You owe me, you owe me
You owe me, ya owe me

I don't think I'll ever be coming backEmbed
