Bistro LyricsYou walk away
You walk away
You never loved enough
You're never home enough
You walk away
You walk away
You never loved enough
You're never home enough
You walk away
You walk away
You never loved enough
You're never home enough
You walk away
You walk away
I never loved enough
You're never home enough
You walk away
No, you walk away
I never loved enough
I'm never home enough
You walk away
No, you walk away
I'm never home enough
You never loved enoughEmbed
