Mosquito Lyrics
I got sick of waiting, Tuesday afternoon
"K" Line sea containers thunder past my room
I use my vibrator wishing it was you
I was thinking of ya, Tuesday afternoon

'Cause you're a pretty light and I'm so attracted to ya
A malaria mosquito buzzing in the shadow
Your name is up in lights, and baby, you deserve it
I wanna bring you cake back home from work, but you're allergic


You're a pretty light and I'm so attracted to ya
A malaria mosquito buzzing in the shadow
Your name is up in lights, and baby, you deserve it
I wanna bring you cake back home from work, but you're allergic
You're a pretty light and I'm still attracted to ya
A malaria mosquito coming in the shadow
Your name is up in lights, and baby, you deserve it
I wanna bring you cake back home from work, but you're allergicEmbed
