Old Man Lyrics
He's reading sport on the news
White man, white teeth in a suit, he's got that style
And then alone in his house
He wants to take baby out, "Give us a smile"
Boy, if you touch her again
I'll tell your wife and your kids about that time
'Cause this is not '93
You lost your spot on the team, you're out of line

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I've worked too hard for this chance
To not be biting the hand that feeds the hate
So have a chat to your friends
'Cause it's our words that'll keep our daughters safe
Your personality traits don't count
If you put your dick in someone's face
And no, it's never too late
We sat there silently while you kept your job
And your place and your six-figure wage

Oh, are you scared of me, old man?
Or are you scared of what I'll do?
You grabbed me with an open hand
The world is grabbin' back at you
Oh, are you scared of me, old man?
Or are you scared of what I'll do?
You grabbed me with an open hand
The world is grabbin' back at you
Oh, are you scared of me, old man?
Or are you scared of what I'll do?
You grabbed me with an open hand
The world is grabbin' back at you
