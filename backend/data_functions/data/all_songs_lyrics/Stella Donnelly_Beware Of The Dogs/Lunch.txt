Lunch Lyrics
Cracking my neck in the consulate line
While a homesick American flag's hanging by
In the fluorescent light
Up close, I see how they stitched on the stars and stripes
If I were honest, and if you were brave
You’d ask me a question and stay for the answer
I like the way that you tell all your tales
Would it kill you to listen?

And I get homesick before I go away
I get homesick before I go away, away

La-la
La-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la

Green origami, needles and grapes
You cry like an army, you drive like P-plates
There is much to be said for
The way that you brake when a red light's in front of you
You ask me to give you my world, ah, the day (You ask me to give ya, world, ah, the day)
We'll do this together
We got years to waste (Got years to waste)
You got lots of persuasions, and time to explain (Time to explain)
But I’ve only got time for lunch
And I get homesick before I go away
I get homesick before I go away
Before I go away
Before I go away

Oh, oh (Hey)
La-la
La-la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la1Embed
