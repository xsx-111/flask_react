Die Lyrics
Look me in the eye, tell me that you're fine
Let me see your face, I know what you like
You know that I love you
Wanna buy you more shit, but I can't afford it
You know that I miss ya, fighting like a Taurus
Look me in the eye, tell me that you're fine
I'm not here to taste all your cheese and wine
All my friends are Virgo
Safety is important, you can trust me, baby
But you're always driving all over the road and

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I'm looking forward, but you're falling behind
And I can't help myself
I know when you're telling lies
I don't wanna seem unkind
But what the hell is going on?
I don't buy it


I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I'm looking forward, but I'm falling behind
And I can't help myself
I know when you're telling lies
I don't wanna seem unkind
But what the hell is going on?
I don't buy it
Look me in the eye, tell me that you're fine
I can see your face, I know what you like
You know that I love you
Wanna buy you more shit, but I can't afford it
But I can't afford it, but I can't afford it
And I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die2Embed
