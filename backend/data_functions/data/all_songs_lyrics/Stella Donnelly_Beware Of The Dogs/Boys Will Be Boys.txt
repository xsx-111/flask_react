Boys Will Be Boys Lyrics
My friend told me of a secret
Told me that she blames herself
You invaded her magnificence
Put your hand over her mouth

"Why was she all alone
Wearing her shirt that low?"
They said, "Boys will be boys"
Deaf to the word "no"

Your father told you that you're innocent
Told ya, "Women rape themselves"
Would ya blame your little sister
If she cried to you for help?

"Why was she all alone
Wearing her shirt that low?"
They said, "Boys will be boys"
Deaf to, deaf to
Deaf to the word "no, no, no, no"

Like a mower in the morning
I will never let you rest
You broke all the bonds she gave ya
Time to pay the fucking rent5Embed
