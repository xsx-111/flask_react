Angel Eyes (Live) LyricsHey, drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me
Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My old heart ain't gaining any ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes, that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all of you people
Order anything you see
And have fun you happy people
The drink and the laughs on me
Pardon me but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now the number one
And why my angel eyes ain't here
Excuse me while I disappearEmbed
