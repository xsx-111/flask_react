Get Me To The Church On Time (Live) LyricsI'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-dong the bells are gonna chime
We'll have a whopper, pull out the stopper
Get me to the church on time
I've got to get there in the morning
Spruced up and lookin' in my prime
Girls come and kiss me, say that you'll miss me
Get me to the church on time
If I am dancing, roll up the floor
If I am whistling, out the door
I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-ding-dong they're gonna chime
Don't lose your compass, kick up a rumpus
Get me to the church, get me to the church
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time
If I am dancing, roll up the floor
If I am whistling, right out the door
I'm gettin' married in the morning
Ding-dong they're gonna chime
Girls come and kiss me, say that you'll miss me
Get me to the church, get me to the church
For Pete's sake, get me to the church on time
Ding-dong
Ding-dong
