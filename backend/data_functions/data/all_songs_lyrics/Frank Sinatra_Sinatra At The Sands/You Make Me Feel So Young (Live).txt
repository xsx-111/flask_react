You Make Me Feel So Young (Live) LyricsYou make me feel so young
You make me feel like spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
Such a happy individual
The moment that you speak
I wanna run and play hide-and-seek
I wanna go and bounce the moon
Just like a toy balloon
You and I, we're just like a couple of tots
Runnin' around the meadow
Pickin' up all those forget me nots
You make me feel so young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Bells to be rung and a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
Because you make me feel so young
You make me young
You make me think that spring has sprung
Every time I see you grin
I'm such a cuckoo individual
The moment that you speak
I like to run and play hide-and-seek
I'd like to go and bounce the moon
Just like a big balloon, because
You and I, we are just like a couple a tots
Who are runnin' around the meadow
Snatchin' up all those forget me nots
You make me young
You make me feel there are songs to be sung
Lots of bells to be rung, and a wonderful fling to be flung
And even when I'm old and gray
I'm gonna feel the way I do today
Because you, you make me feel so
Man, I just feel so
You make me feel so young
So youngEmbed
