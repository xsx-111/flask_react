Come Fly With Me (Live) Lyrics(How did all these people get in my room?)
Come fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away
If you can use some exotic booze there's a bar in far Bombay
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly away
Come fly with me, we'll float down to Peru
In llama-land there's a one man band and he'll toot his flute for you
Come on fly with me, we'll float down in the blue
Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry eyed
Once I get you up there I'll be holding you so near
You might hear all the angels cheer because we're together
Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
Just say those words, we'll beat those birds down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll, we'll fly...
Once I get you up there where the air is so rarefied
We're gonna glide absolutely petrified
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so awfully near
You might even hear a gang of angels cheer just because we're together
Weather-wise it's such a groovy day
You just say that word and I'll beat your bird down to Acapulco Bay
It is perfect for a flying honeymoon they do say
Come on fly with me, we'll fly, we'll fly...
Pack up - let's fly away
And don't tell yo papa!Embed
