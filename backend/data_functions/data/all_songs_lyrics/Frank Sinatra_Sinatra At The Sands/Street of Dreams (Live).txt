Street of Dreams (Live) LyricsLove laughs at a king
Kings don't mean a thing
On the street of dreams
Dreams broken in two
Can be made like new
On the street of dreams
Gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
For there ain't nobody poor, long as love is sure
On the street of dreams
All the gold, silver and gold
All you can hold's up there on a moonbeam
For nobody's poor, long as love is sure
On the street of dreamsEmbed
