Fly Me To The Moon (Live) LyricsNow, this man here is gonna take me by the hand and he gonna lead me down the right path to righteousness and all that other mother jazz - in the right tempo!
Fly me to the moon
Let me swing among those stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss me
Fill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you....Jump! Rock!
Why don't you fill my heart with song
Let me swing forever more
Because you are all I long for
All I worship and I adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, in other words
I -I love...
YOU!Embed
