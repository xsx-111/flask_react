One For My Baby (And One More for the Road) (Live) LyricsIt's quarter to three
There's no one in the place 'cept you and me
Set em' up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know
We're drinkin' my friend
To the end
Of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And another one for the road
I know the routine
Put another quarter
In the machine
I feel kinda bad
Can''t you make the music
Easy and sad
I could tell you a lot
But it's not in a gentleman's code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road
You'd never know it
But buddy I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And if I'm gloomy
Please listen to me
Till' it's talked away
Well, thats how it goes
And Joe I know you're gettin'
Anxious to close
Anyway, thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind
My bending your ear
But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned
Or it's gonna explode
Make it one for my baby
And another for the road
The long, it's damn long...
It's so long...Embed
