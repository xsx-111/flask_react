The Gun LyricsThe man has a gun
He knows how to use it
Nine millimeter browning
Let's see what he can do
He'll point at your mouth
Say that he'll blow your brains out
Don't you mess with me
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
Don't you mess with me
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
Don't mess with me
Ooohhh, carrying a gun
Get over there
Move slowly
I'll put a hole in your face
If you even breathe a word
Tell the lady to lie down
I want, ah, you to be sure to see this
I wouldn't want you to miss a second
Watch your wife
Carrying a gun
Shooting with a gun
Dirty animal
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
Watch you face
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
The animal dies with fear in his eyes
With a gun
Don't touch him, don't touch him
Stay away from him, he's got a gunEmbed
