Underneath the Bottle Lyrics
Ooohhh-wheee, look at me
Looking for some sympathy
It's the same old story
Of a man and his search for glory
And he found it, there underneath the bottle

Things are never good, things go from bad to weird
Hey gimme another scotch with my beer
I'm sad to say
I feel the same today as I always do
Gimme a drink to relax me

Ooohhh-wheee, liquor set me free
I can't do no work, the shake's inside me
Ahhh, shucks
I got the lousiest luck, I'm sick of this
Underneath the bottle

Seven days make a week, on two of them I sleep
I can't remember what the heck I was doing
I got bruises on my leg
From I can't remember when
I fell down some stairs, I was lyin' underneath the bottle
Ooohhh-wheee, son of a B
You get so down, you can't get any lower
So long world, you play too rough
And it's getting me all mixed up
I lost my pride and it's hiddin' there underneath the bottleEmbed
