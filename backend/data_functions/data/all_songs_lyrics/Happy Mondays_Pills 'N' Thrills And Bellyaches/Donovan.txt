Donovan LyricsSix cheap people in an empty hotel
Every last one with a story to sell
Give them all pills, so their heads won't swell
We were born to a woman whose husband did quite well
Oh sunshine, shone brightly
Through my window today
Could have tripped out quite easy but I decided to stay
"Hold out your hand" said whitey with the blame
I'm gonna bring you up so you really dig the pain
Take you under my wings so you'll never be the same
'Cos your wife is so much older and both her legs are lame
A sunbeam shone brightly through my window today
Could have gone twenty miles but I decided to stay...
Uh, all my flock has packed up and flocked back off to hell
Open up the doors so the place don't start to smell
Carry on with what your doing 'cos you don't to it that well
I've been umpteen different people and no one else can tell
Oh, sunshine shines brightly through my asshole today
Could have tripped out quite easy, man, but I decided to stay
To stay a while
To stay a while
Come up and see me make me smile
Come up and see me make me smileEmbed
