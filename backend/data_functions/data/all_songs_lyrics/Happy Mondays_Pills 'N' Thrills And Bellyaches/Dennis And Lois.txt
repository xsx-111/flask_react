Dennis And Lois LyricsWe all learn to box at the Midget Club
Where we punch with love and did someone some good
It's good to see ya, to see ya nice
If you do me once, well we'll do it twice
We're twice as likely we're twice as bright
You say it's wrong but we know it's right
Right
Right on, right on
Right
Right on, right on
We all learn to wash at the scrubbers club
Where we ring out the dirt with rub a dub dub
Tell me how you think if you think it's good
Say it loud and clear so it's understood
You take it how you make it like I knew you would
Let it bleed let it heal let me sleep it's no good, so...
Let's ride
Right on right on
Let's ride
Right on right on
Honey how's your breathing
If it stops for good we'll be leaving
And honey how's your daughter
Did you teach 'er what 'e's taught yer
And if you didn't well you ought to do it now
So let's ride
Ride on ride on
Let's Ride
Ride on ride...
Honey how's your breathing
If it stops for good we'll be leaving
And honey how's your daughter
Did you teach 'er what 'e's taught yer
And if you didn't well you ought to do it nowEmbed
