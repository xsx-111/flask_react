Devil and the Deed LyricsI won't act until she's gone the way of violence
Stare at pictures that I'm hiding in their attic
How do you know
How could you have another?
There's a man who got caught in a trick match
And I never see her lips being kissed on
How do you know
How could you have another?
Maybe now it's harder
If it was 40 years ago
I would need it to sleep over
Between the devil and the deed
But I can't live without
Her, I got nothing else
I could never let
Her get out of my hands
You could never handle if she was into magic
You could never stand it if she couldn't speak your language
She wouldn't like this again, mistaken for your whole plan
Shake it at your big fat head
Maybe here it's harder
And it's a backwards country
Where you need to sleep together
I'm between the devil and the deedEmbed
