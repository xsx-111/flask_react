Demon Road Lyrics
I don't believe in much
I know that it's a problem
Like being romantic
I've never been no good at bringing flowers to you
Never believed in fate
Think this whole accidental
Unsentimental trait
Built up so many walls I have that stand in our way

All hell is gonna break loose
Find out what I'm into
All hell is gonna break loose
Find out what I'm into

Not into reading stars
Some days I rarely look up
But I know that you are
Mystical in your outlook so I stop complaining

All hell is gonna break loose
Find out what I'm into
All hell is gonna break loose
Find out what I'm into
All hell is gonna break loose
Find out what I'm into
All hell is gonna break loose
Find out what I'm into

Demon road, demon road
Make me feel hopeful
Come change my tune
Take me home, please
Demon road, demon road
Make me feel hopeful
Come change my tune
Take me home, please
Demon road, demon road
Make me feel hopeful
Come change my tune
Take me home, please
Demon road, demon road
Make me feel hopeful
Come change my tune
Take me home, please
Demon road
Make me feel hopeful
Come change my tune
Take me home
Make me feel hopefulEmbed
