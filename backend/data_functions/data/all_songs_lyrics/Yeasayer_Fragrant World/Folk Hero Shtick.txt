Folk Hero Shtick LyricsHow many of them can you string along?
How many of them can you bring to us?
How many of them can you string along?
How long before they all wisen up?
How many of them can you string along?
How many of them can you bring to us?
Turn it up Ringmaster your final lullaby
Let's see how your genius is fully realised
The Emperor's standing naked, how much longer, can he fake it
All night, repeat it ten times we've, we've got it
I know what is expected here, I'm not a child and I won't be blindsided
I know what is expected here
You're the one detached from daily existence
And I don't like your foolish suits, folk hero shtick
Micro-manage, take the sky from touch, the people feed the ego
But look me in the eyes to spout your bullshit
Darling of every muse or fair weather friend
Prance around amphitheaters in your swelled head
Smoke clears and mirrors shatter, a bargain Broadway, a mock Mad Hatter
Pack it in, please pack it in now, I've got this
I know what is expected here, i'm not a child and, i won't be blindsided
I know what is expected here
You're the one detached from daily existence
And I don't like your foolish suits, folk hero shtick
Micro-manage, take the sky from touch, the people feed the ego
But look me in the eyes to spout your bullshit
How many of them can you string along?
How many of them can you bring to us?
Would it kill you to lose attention?
How many of them can you string along?
How long before they all wisen up?
Would it kill you to lose attention?
How many of them can you string along?
How many of them can you bring to us?
Would it kill you to lose attention?Embed
