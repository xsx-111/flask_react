Blue Paper LyricsShe used to clean up nicely, play dress up
Now she's throwing her clothes away, says she needs the added space
She used to walk on concrete, now the sidewalk
Isn't green enough for her, says she misses Mother Earth
She keeps on telling me I'm not made for this
So they never give you the time of day, but do you really care?
Oh no, I don't buy it for a second
Now you say you're finished up with the finer life of trawlers and yet
Oh no, I don't buy it for a second
Now you say you can't find the time to figure out your left amends
Oh no, I don't buy it for a second
Now you say you want peace and quiet, but could you really stand
Before your halcyon days were numbered
Make a move become tax exiles, in the desert
You don't choke on the winter's end, and the sky isn't hidden there
You don't need to leave the house when, it's a palace
And there's no one to offend, take a walk every now and then
She keeps on telling me I'm not made for this
So they never give you the time of day, but do you really care?
Oh no, I don't buy it for a second
Now you say you're finished up with the finer life of trawlers and yet
Oh no, I don't buy it for a second
Now you say you can't find the time to figure out you left amends
Oh no, I don't buy it for a second
Now you say you want peace and quiet, but could you really stand
Before your halcyon days were numbered, that's another, whole problem
Turn me on your mirror
The other side looks clearer
Write it on blue paper
Think about it later
Turn me on your mirror
The other side looks clearer
Write it on blue paper
Think about it laterEmbed
