Glass of the Microscope LyricsYesterday was nice
And today looked fine
And quickly the sky opened up
The moon came crashing down
I wish that I, could tell you
That it's, all alright
I wish that I, could tell you
That it's, all alright
But in truth, we're doomed
Consumed by all the truck fumes that will kill you without uttering a sound
In truth, we're doomed
Entombed by oil spills, the wicked lawmen and the benzene underground
The architecture ruining this town
Tilt your head back, and don't choke
Under the glass of the microscope
Tilt your head back, and don't choke
Under the glass of the microscope
Over and over
Over again
I wish that I, could tell you
That it's, all alright
I wish that I, could tell you
That it's, all alright
But in truth, we're doomed
Consumed by all the truck fumes that will kill you without uttering a sound
In truth, we're doomed
Entombed by oil spills, the wicked lawmen and the benzene underground
The architecture ruining this town
Tilt your head back, and don't choke
Under the glass of the microscope
Tilt your head back, and don't choke
Under the glass of the microscope
Tilt your head back, and don't choke
Under the glass of the microscope
Tilt your head back, and don't choke
Under the glass of the microscope
Over and over
Over again
We're going to
(Over and over)
We're going to hell
(Over again)
We're going to
We're going to
We're going to...Embed
