Fingers Never Bleed LyricsAll around, a boring job
Mid-summers to fall asleep
Expertise on air guitar
So your fingers never bleed
I know you think you could do this without me
But I know I could do without you
A failed ambition's held up on tridents
Hope predictions of future come true
All the tin can buildings rattle the sidewalk
All the cars upturned talk like the trains
Ten thousand red balloons all around New York
Hope the bridges all burn your life away
So you bade a friend farewall
Took the night off from disease
White collar criminal
So his fingers never bleed
I know you think you could do this without me
But I know I could do without you
A failed ambition's held up on tridents
Hope predictions of future come true
All the tin can buildings rattle the sidewalk
All the cars upturned talk like the trains
Ten thousand red balloons over New York
Hope the bridges all burn your life away1Embed
