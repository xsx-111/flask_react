Henrietta LyricsFever in the night, and the tremors come on
But it's you who'll survive, just like nobody thought
Nails turnin' red, lying cold on the bed
And now it turns out, death's not the end
She was a bone, we sharpened our teeth
A magnificent drone, was serving under our feet
You'll make a man rich, he'll throw you away
And after he's gone, oh HeLa's here to stay
Radiation makes you weak, tired okays leave your speech
The world owes more than they'll pay, in the wind I heard them say...
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on forever
Ohh Henrietta, we can live on foreverEmbed
