Damaged Goods LyricsHer eyes are waiting
This calls to panels stained brown
Everyone's tiring
September thudding quickens with a serious low
We're in it together but no one pulls
As soon as the circus disappears
Damaged goods, damaged goods
The saints only preach when the coast is clear
Damaged goods, damaged goods
The lines in your palm shouldn't give you grief
Damaged goods, damaged goods
And quickly the bloom on the rose does leave
Damaged goods, damaged goods
No matter what he thought she was
No matter what he thought she was before
Professional, a working stiff
It's over now, damaged goods
As soon as the circus disappears
Damaged goods, damaged goods
The saints only preach when the coast is clear
Damaged goods, damaged goods
The lines in your palm shouldn't give you grief
Damaged goods, damaged goods
And quickly the bloom on the rose does leave
Damaged goods, damaged goods
No doubts, no doubts
What's done is done
No doubts, no doubts
What's done is done
No doubts, no doubts
What's done is doneEmbed
