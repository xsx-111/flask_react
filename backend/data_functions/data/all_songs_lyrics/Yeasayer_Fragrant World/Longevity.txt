Longevity LyricsHarmonizing, with a ghost off the ape vase
Just like the old days
Golden seaplane, dollar tusk in the tape bin
What a bargain
All the time up in Yellowknife
Found oysters from the beach
Undressed from the waist
My girl says that
All the rain promises
Is to give life to the seeds, see
Live in the moment
Never count on longevity, please
Ribbons, showing, very, plainly on her skin
A kind of warming
Heels over head, with her, never monetized
My love, the space case
All the time down in perigee
Legs bruised up from the beast
Undressed from the waist
My girl says that
All the rain promises
Is to give life to the seeds, see
Live in the moment
Never count on longevity, please1Embed
