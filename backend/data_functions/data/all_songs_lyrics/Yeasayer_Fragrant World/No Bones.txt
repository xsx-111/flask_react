No Bones LyricsMy mind is a-comin' again outta my mouth
My tongue is a pill that I can't spit out
But make no bones
About it
We're older now
Than I like to admit
My midnight image casts double shadow
In over-tested ears our past will grow
But make no bones
About it
We're older now
Than I like to admit
Suppose it's the right time
Suppose it's the right time
Suppose it's the right time
Suppose it's the right time
Each step's pain fills my lungs (?)
Aloe'd soon by a slip of the tongue
No thoughts, no turning back ah
She knows me better than that
No plots, no schemin'
It's energy wasted
But make no bones
About it
We're older now
Than I like to admit
Suppose it's the right time
Suppose it's the right time
Suppose it's the right time
Suppose it's the right timeEmbed
