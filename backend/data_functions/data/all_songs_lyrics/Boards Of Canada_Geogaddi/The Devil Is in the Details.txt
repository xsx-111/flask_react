The Devil Is in the Details LyricsJust relax
And enjoy this pleasant adventure
Here you are, secure and protected
In this, your special place
Letting my voice flow into your mind
You don't need to concentrate
Just gently as you go
Suggestions are going into your unconscious mind
Open yourself up to the greater wisdom and understanding
So now you're letting the sound of my voice reach the inner
Healthy, receptive center of yourself
See yourself now, in your imagination
You are being transformed in a positive
Healthy way
Slowly you are programming your unconscious mind
Gaining new insight to your directions in the future
Allow yourself to be more aware of your pathway through this life
Enjoy new opportunities
As the days go by
You will feel it in your mind
You are allowing this to happen
These things are happening day-by-day
Just as I am telling you they're happening
Wherever you are
See this happening
And trying to become a part of you
More and more rapidly
More and more surely
More and more powerfully each day
When it is necessary
You can program yourself
And be able to dream the information you require
This awareness will come gradually at your own rate
It will never be more than you can cope with
This guidance will help show you the way
This will only happen
If you choose
It will be so
Ready, nowEmbed
