Julie and Candy LyricsYou're putting me on!
We're going to try it, you ever try it?
You're putting me on!
I'm turning you on!
You're putting me on! Where did you get that stuff?
Oh, Nikki's growing a patch out in the backyard
Come on, you're putting me on
Yeah, he's putting you on, he's a brat!
Uh-huh
Sure, sure!
You're putting me on!
We're going to try it, you ever try it?
You're putting me on!
I'm turning you on!
You're putting me on! Where did you get that stuff?
Oh, Nikki's growing a patch out in the backyard
Come on, you're putting me on
Yeah, he's putting you on, he's a brat!
Uh-huh
Sure, sure!1Embed
