Energy Warning Lyrics
Energy is becoming one of our country's greatest concerns
If we don't start working on energy conservation, there may not be enough energy to go around by the time I'm a parent
We're going to learn about how we can solve some of our problems through alternative energy sources
You can learn more about energy, too
Call your county cooperative extension service for more information
Conserving energy is everyone's responsibility
Call 4H to find out how you can do your partEmbed
