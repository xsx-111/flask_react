Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World Lyrics
One-two-three-four

Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes, I am
I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland
Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes, I am
I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland

Little German boy
Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German town

Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes, I am
I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland
Well, I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes, I am
I'm a Nazi Schatzi, you know I fight for the fatherland

Little German boy
Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German
Eins-zwei-drei-vier

Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world
Today your love, tomorrow the world1Embed
