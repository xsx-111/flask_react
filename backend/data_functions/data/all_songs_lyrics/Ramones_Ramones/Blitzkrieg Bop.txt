Blitzkrieg Bop Lyrics
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight one
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They're generatin' steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey, ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They're generatin' steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop
Hey, ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop
They're pilin' in the back seat
They're generatin' steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go
Hey, ho, let's go11Embed
