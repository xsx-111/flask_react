Havana Affair Lyrics
PT boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Now I'm a guide for the C.I.A
Hooray for the U.S.A

Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo

Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop, Havana-go-go
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Hooray for Havana

Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo

PT boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Now I'm a guide for the C.I.A
Hooray for the U.S.A
Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo

Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop: Havana-go-go
I used to make a living, man, picking the banana
Hooray for Havana

Baby, baby make me loco
Baby, baby make me mambo2Embed
