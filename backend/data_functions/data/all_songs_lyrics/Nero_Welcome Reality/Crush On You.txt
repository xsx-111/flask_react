Crush On You LyricsHow did you know cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush on you
How did you know cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush, crush, crush, crush
How did you know cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush on you
How did you know cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush, crush, crush, crush
How did you
You found out
You found out
I've got a crush on you
How did you
How did you
I've got a crush, crush, crush, crush
How did you know cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
I've got a crush on you
You must have heard it
From my best friend
She's always talkin' when she should be listenin'
Can't keep a secret
To save her life
But still I trusted her with all I felt inside
I never knew, a rumor could spread so fast
Cause now the word is out
All over town
That I'm longing for you
How did you
You found out
You found out
I've got a crush on you
How did you
How did you
I've got a crush, crush, crush, crush
How did you
You found out
You found out
How did you know cause I never told
You found out
I've got a crush on you
No more charades
My heart's been displayed
You found out
I've got a crush on youEmbed
