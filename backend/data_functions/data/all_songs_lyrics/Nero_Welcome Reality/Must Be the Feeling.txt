Must Be the Feeling Lyrics
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move-move
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do
Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move-move
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do
(What to do, what to do, what to do)
(What to do, what to do, what to do)

(Must-must-must-must)
Must-must-must-must

Must be the feeling, it brings to you
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
Must be the feeling
Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move-move
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do
Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move-move
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do

Time for you to break it all down, do it all around
Time for you to break it all down, do it all around
Time for you to break it all down, do it all around
Time for you to break it all down, do it all around

Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
Every time, every time, every time, every time, every time
(Time, time, time)

Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move-move
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do
Every time I hear this groove
It makes me wanna move-move
Must be the feeling, it brings to you
That makes you feel what to do (Do, do, do)
That makes you feel what to do (Do, do, do)
That makes you feel what to do
(What to do, what to do, what to do)
(What to do, what to do, what to do)Embed
