Promises Lyrics
You got me so wild
How can I ever deny
You got me so high
So high I cannot feel the fire

And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these

Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself

You got me so wild
Why should I be so surprised?
You got me so high
Don't you see it in my eyes?

And you keep telling me
Telling me that you'll be sweet
And you'll never want to leave my side
As long as I don't break these
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself
They are so wasted on myself

Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself
Promises, and they still feel all so wasted on myself3Embed
