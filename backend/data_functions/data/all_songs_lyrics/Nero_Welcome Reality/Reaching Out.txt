Reaching Out Lyrics
Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)
Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)
(Reaching out, reaching out, reaching out)
Reaching out, reaching out, reaching out
Reaching out, reaching out, reaching out
Reaching out, reaching out, reaching out

Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)

Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)

Though it seems I laugh when I can’t find (Find, find)
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know (You know)
What I'm looking for
Though it seems I laugh when I can’t find (Find, find)
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know (Know)
Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)

(Something to hold, something to hold, something to hold)
For something to hold
(Something to hold, something to hold, something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)
Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)

Though it seems I laugh when I can’t find (Find, find)
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know (You know)
What I'm looking for
Though it seems I laugh when I can’t find (Find, find)
What I'm searching for
And I still believe that you know (Know)

Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(Something to hold, something to hold, something to hold)
Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)
Reaching out for something to hold
(For something to hold, for something to hold, for something to hold)
(For something, for something, for something)2Embed
