Surrender LyricsI was at my weakest state and you kept me pushing on
You gave me something to believe in
And it keeps me standing strong
Yeah these lessons that I've learned, these things I'll carry on
And when you're gone I'll honor you each day, however long
This glimmer of hope was never enough
To guide me through the darkness like a diamond in the rough
I held out for and I received a pain that never left with no reprieve
Like a toast at a table where resentments run free
There can't be any truth where there's no honesty
Like an apple from the tree you were lock jawed in your ways
A reminder of myself in those long forgotten days
Thought you'd stayed off my path
But I just couldn't see that the blood that's in your veins
Is the same that runs through me
This glimmer of hope was never enough
To guide me through the darkness like a diamond in the rough
I held out for and I received a pain that never left with no reprieve
Like a toast at a table where resentments run free
There can't be any truth where there's no honesty
I had it all but lost my faith, and then you lead me to it
Today I'll carry on
I had all but lost my faith, and now I've renewed it
These things I'll carry onEmbed
