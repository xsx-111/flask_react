The Thick Skin of Defiance LyricsThis is how you fight the system
This is how you right the wrongs
This is where you look for justice pointing
Fingers where they don't belong
Is is where your futures brightest
I think it's where it falls apart
No ones gonna hear you crying lying down
With your broken bleeding heart
You're gonna fight the world-
How about facing you
This is where you look for justice when things
Aren't changing fast enough for you
One more shot at useless vengeance
Reparation for your shattered soul
Dull your past with deadly products
They fit the bill but can they fill the hole
Another chance to salvage something
Another chance to do your part
But the thick skin of defiance makes you wage a
War you didn't start
You're gonna fight the world-
How about facing you
This is where you look for justice when things
Aren't changing fast enough for you
You're gonna fight the world-
How about facing you
Reparation for your shattered soul
They ain't changing why don't we start with youEmbed
