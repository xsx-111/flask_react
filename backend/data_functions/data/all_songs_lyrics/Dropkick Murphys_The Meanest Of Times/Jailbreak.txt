Jailbreak LyricsTonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in this town
See, me and the boys, we don't like it
So we're gettin' up and goin' down
Hidin' low, lookin' right to left
You see us coming, I think it's best
To move away, do you hear what I say
From underneath my breath?
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
Some of us won't survive
See, me and the boys mean business
Bustin' out, dead or alive
I hear the hound dogs on my trail
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
Like the game, if you lose
Go to jail
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So woman, stay with a friend
You know it's safer
Breakout!
Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
Into the city zones
Don't you dare to try and stop us
No one could for long
Searchlight on my trail
Tonight's the night, all systems fail
Hey you! Good lookin' female
C'mere!
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
Somewhere in the town
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
So don't you be around
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
I'm gonna find myself in
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
So woman, stay with a friendEmbed
