Never Forget LyricsIn a child's eye there's something I hope someday you'll know
A friend's dedication, it's something to behold
A mother's smile, it makes everything alright
To a women's caring hand I'll be holding on tonight

When you got love and you got family
When you got love and you got family
Keep 'em close and don't forget
To hold them right there in your heart
When you got love and family
(Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!)
(I'll remember you today)
To my father's stern direction
And the lessons that he taught
My grandmother's affection, and the faith I always fought
To the kids at the shows, the way you sing it back at us
And the boys down the park
When we were young and life was nuts

(Whoa!, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!)
(I'll remember you today)
To all the single parents who keep holding down the fort
To all your sons and daughters
Be thankful for what you've got
To everyone with no one, may good fortune turn your way
To everyone whose had someone, remember them today
