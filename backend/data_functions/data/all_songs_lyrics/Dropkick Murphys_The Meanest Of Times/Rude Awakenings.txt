Rude Awakenings LyricsThe bed was still warm where I slept
From these hours I wish to forget
With the night still fresh on my breath
I awoke to the grim face of death
I thought it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
I thought it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
As I crawled across the floor for the door
From one room I don't know to the next
There was nothing familiar around
And it just ain't my style to leave the seat down
I thought it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
I thought it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
I pulled on my clothes still half in a dream
As I struggled with my conscience & a multidirectional stream
(What ya take her for?)
I buried my loneliness with her for the night
Then I left with new symptoms no antidepressant could cure
(What ya take her for?)
She took me for all I was worth
May I remind you that ain't much at all
A meaningless gesture in the meanest of times
As it turns out you weren't worth the call
I though it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
I though it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
But now I'm left with a daily reminder of you
With equal surprise she opened her eyes
Sat up and shouted "for christ sakes who the hell are you?"
(What she take ya for?)
She cooked me my breakfast then called me a cab
Shoved me out the door and threw the five dollar fare in my face
(What she take ya for?)
She took me for all I was worth
May I remind you that ain't much at all
A meaningless gesture in the meanest of times
As it turns out you weren't worth the call
I though it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
I though it was all just a nightmare, I guess it was true
But now I'm left with a daily reminder of youEmbed
