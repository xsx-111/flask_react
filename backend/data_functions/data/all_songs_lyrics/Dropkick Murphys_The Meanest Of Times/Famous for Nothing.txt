Famous for Nothing LyricsThe barrel fire's fading, my pals are disappearing
Another night is passing but I won't go
It's 2AM at townie and things are going my way
Three buds, a glove and a foot of snow
There's two little shits selling joints on the hill
And the kids down the lot are burning cruisers for a thrill
See we had each other, it was us against the world
Famous for nothing, yeah nothing was our world
Well these lies won't save me
Don't you know, don't you know
From the time that made me
Here we go, here we go
The courts are filling up, all the kids are coming down
For a head start on the troubles of a long night on the town
Yeah, thank God it's Saturday ad half my problems go away
Sure the big ones on the way, but I know how to handle them
9 to 3 on weekdays, on the hour Sundays
The good lord was calling me but I wasn't up
From the convent to the rectory and over in the sacristy
I'm a goddamn travesty and that's just my luck
Well these lies won't save me
Don't you know, don't you know
From the time that made me
Here we go, here we go
Here we go! Yeah!
Their gang went my way for basketball
My gang went their way for alcohol
When we met it wasn't pretty at all
Still the bells of St. Mary's kept ringing
9 to 3 on weekdays, on the hour Sundays
Jesus Christ was calling me
Here we go! Yeah!
Their gang went my way for basketball
My gang went their way for alcohol
When we met it wasn't pretty at all
Still the bells of St. Mary's kept ringing
Their gang went my way for basketball
My gang went their way for alcohol
When we met it wasn't pretty at all
Still the bells of St. Mary's were ringing
The bells of St. Mary's were ringingEmbed
