Loyal to No One LyricsI first met this man by the Capen Street tracks
In no shape for success headed nowhere too fast
He may have been someone once by the sound of his call
Now he answers to no one, no one at all!
"We all die alone", he shouted as he passed
With no sense of regret, see he never looked back
For his pride was wounded, his ego was strong
Yeah that was his trouble, and this is his song

You said we die alone, in this case you were right
No friends by your side, or family in sight
There'll be no talking your way out this time
So don't count the cash cause you leave it behind
His friends come and go like the seasons and tides
He can't keep a women they all realize
He loves them, leaves them, takes what he needs
He's loyal to no one, no one at all
You were brought up well, still in spite of it all
You're touched by nothing, watch a man fall
Put a foot on his back to get a better view
Cause your loyal to no one, no one but you!

He was broken and tired, wouldn't take a hand
Their kindness was simple but he couldn't understand
See it's hard to have faith in something so new
When your loyal to no one, no one but you!

You said we die alone, in this case you were right
No friends by your side or family in sightEmbed
