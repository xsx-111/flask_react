Breakdown LyricsCan't you see me cruising down highway 95
Ripping up the turnpike, trying to chase down my lie
Always in a hurry when i'm doing what I think is right
Tryin to help myself but I'm breaking down tonight
Over and over and over again!

Won't you help me understand?
Won't help me take my hand?
Everybody needs someone to help them off the ground
It's Friday night and I'm coming down Blue Hill Ave
Try and not kill to make it to the Mattapan Line
This mess in the mirror they're coming up fast behind
Yeah its another night caught in the breakdown lane
Over and over and over again!

Won't you help me understand?
Won't help me take my hand?
Everybody needs someone to help them off the ground

Over and over and over again!
Help them off the ground
Over and over and over again!
Try to keep ourselves from breaking down tonight!Embed
