Shattered LyricsSomething's gone wrong with the world today
What's the matter with the human race?
Everybody's fighting for more power and money
Braveheart's a racist, the paperboy's a junkie
And what's with the role models for all our boys and girls
Anorexic skinny monsters who seem to rule the world
The ball players you loved as a kid are gone
They've been replaced by steroid fed Neanderthals
Replaced by Neanderthals!
Shattered, shattered, when people aren't always what they seem
It turns out the lyrics that you live by are a fraud
When your favorite band's singer
Got arrested with a tranny on his job
Meanwhile little Danny down the block's all alone
He's been abused by the Parish priest
He's embarrassed and ashamed
Thinks he disgraced the family name
He's gonna buy a gun and settle the score
Yeah then who you're gonna call
The local cop stalking girls down the mall
Or the world's greatest crooks from the FBI
The crooks from the FBI!
Shattered, shattered! When people aren't always what they seem
Shattered, shattered!
When the ones that we rely on break their word
Shattered, shattered! When people aren't always what they seem
Shattered, shattered!
When the ones that we rely on break their word
Dad's never home, he says he's working overtime
Meanwhile Mommy's head's in the sand
She thinks everything is fine
She says "Now Dad's important kids, so stay out of his way"
But little did she know that the governor was gay
She didn't know that the governor was gay!
Shattered, shattered! When people aren't always what they seem
Shattered, shattered!
When the ones that we rely on break their word
Shattered! Shattered! Whoa!
Shattered! Shattered! Whoa!
Shattered! Shattered!
When the ones that we rely on break their word!Embed
