Forever 2007 LyricsAll of my dreams seem to fall by the side
Like a discarded thought or the day's fading light
But I know that if I could just see you tonight
Forever
At times we may fall, like we all tend to do
But I'll reach out and find that I've run into you
Your strength is the power that carried me through
Forever
Your kindness for weakness I never mistook
I worried you often, yet you understood
That life is so fleeting, these troubles won't last
Forever
You inspired me truly you did from the start
To not be afraid and to follow my heart
There's a piece of you with me they can't tear apart
Forever
At times we may fall, like we all tend to do but your strength is the power that carried me through
Forever
Forever I'll find you, forever we'll be
Forever your power and strength stays with me
Forever I'll find you, forever we'll be
Forever your power and strength stays with me
Forever I'll find you, forever we'll be
Forever your power and strength stays with me
Forever I'll find you, forever we'll be
Forever your power and strength stays with me Forever
Forever
Forever
