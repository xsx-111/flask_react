Uniform Lyrics
There was a sense of disappointment as we left the mall
All the young people looked the same
Wearing their masks of cool and indifference
Commerce dressed up as rebellion

Because we're so handsome and we're so bored
So entertain us, tell me a joke
Make it long, make it last, make it cruel, just make me laugh
We can't be hurt, we can't be hurt

Drink to forget your blues on the weekend
Think about more things to buy
The TV taught me how to sulk and love nothing
And how to grow my hair long

Because we're so handsome and we're so bored
So entertain us, tell me a joke
Make it long, make it last, make it cruel, just make me laugh
We can't be hurt, we can't be hurt

So why do you go picking fights that you will lose?
(When you have entertainment
When you have things to pass the time?)
So why do you go thinking thoughts that are above you?
(You can be happy, just play dumb)
(You can be happy, just play dumb)
Well I was brave and unique
Intelligent, a snowflake
I could have been a hero
No-one can be trusted over the age of 14
Tattoo our arms, Converse shoes
Cynical, but we still do it
We tell ourselves we're different
I've gotten so good at lying to myself

All, all my pain and honour is used up
All, all my guns are rusted
So when are you going to realise
Those are not your wrongs to right?
Have another line, have another drink
(Pop songs won't change the government)

I am a martyr, I just need a motive
I am a martyr, I just need a cause
I'm a believer, I just need a moment
I'm a believer, I just need a cause
We're finding it hard to break the mould
We're finding it hard to be alone
We're finding it hard to have time by ourselves
We have nothing at all to say
Uniform, uniform, uniform

There was a sense of disappointment as we left the mall
All the young people looked the sameEmbed
