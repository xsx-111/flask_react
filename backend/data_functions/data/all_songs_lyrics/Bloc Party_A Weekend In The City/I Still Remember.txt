I Still Remember Lyrics
I, I still remember
How you looked that afternoon, there was only you
You said "It's just like a full moon"
Blood beats faster in our veins
We left our trousers by the canal
And our fingers, they almost touched

You should have asked me for it
I would have been brave
You should have asked me for it
How could I say no?

And our love could have soared
Over playgrounds and rooftops
Every park bench screams your name, I kept your tie
I'd have gone wherever you wanted
(I still remember, I still remember)

And on that teachers' training day
We wrote our names on every train
Laughed at the people off to work
So monochrome and so lukewarm
And I can see our days are becoming night
I could feel your heartbeat across the grass
We should have run, I would go with you anywhere
I should have kissed you by the water

You should have asked me for it
I would have been brave
You should have asked me for it
How could I say no?

And our love could have soared
Over playgrounds and rooftops
Every park bench screams your name, I kept your tie
I'd have let you if you asked me
(I still remember, I still remember)
(I still remember, I still remember)5Embed
