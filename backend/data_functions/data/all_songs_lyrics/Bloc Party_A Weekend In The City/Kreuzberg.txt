Kreuzberg Lyrics
There is a wall that runs right through me
Just like this city, I will never be joined
What is this love? Why can I never hold it?
Did it really run out in those strangers' bedrooms?

I
I have decided
At 25
That something must change

Saturday night, in East Berlin
We took the U-Bahn to the East Side Gallery
I was sure I'd found love with this one lying with me
Crying again in the Hauptbahnhof

I
I have decided
At 25
That something must change

After sex, the bitter taste
Been fooled again, the search continues
After sex, the bitter taste
Been fooled again, the search continues
After sex, the bitter taste
Been fooled again, the search continues
Concerned mothers of the west
Teach your sons how to truly love1Embed
