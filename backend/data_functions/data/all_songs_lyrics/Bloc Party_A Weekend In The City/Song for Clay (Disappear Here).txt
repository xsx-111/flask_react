Song for Clay (Disappear Here) Lyrics
I am trying to be heroic
In an age of modernity
I am trying to be heroic
As all around me history sinks
So I enjoy and I devour
Flesh and wine and luxury
But in my heart, I am lukewarm
Nothing ever really touches me

At the Les Trois Gar√ßons
We meet at precisely 9 o'clock
I order the foie gras
And I eat it with complete disdain

Bubbles rise in champagne flutes
But when we kiss, I feel nothing
Feasting on sleeping pills
And Marlboro Reds (self-pity won't save you)

Oh, how our, how our parents
They suffered for nothing
Live the dream, live the dream, live the dream
Like the '80s never happened
People are afraid, are afraid
To merge on the freeway
Disappear here
We stroll past the queue
Into the magazine launch party
I'm handed a pill
And I swallow it with complete disdain

Kick drum pounds, off-beat high hats
Remember to look bored
We suck each other's faces
And make sure we are noticed (cocaine won't save you)

Because East London is a vampire
It sucks the joy right out of me
How we long for corruption
In these golden years

Oh, how our, how our parents
They suffered for nothing
Live the dream, live the dream, live the dream
Like the '80s never happened
People are afraid, are afraid
To merge on the freeway
Disappear here
Disappear here, disappear here
Disappear here, disappear here2Embed
