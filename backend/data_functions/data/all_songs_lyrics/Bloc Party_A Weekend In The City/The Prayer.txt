The Prayer Lyrics
Lord, give me grace and dancing feet
And the power to impress
Lord, give me grace and dancing feet
Let me outshine them all

Is it so wrong to crave recognition?
Second best, runner-up
Is it so wrong to want rewarding
To want more than is given to you? Than is given to you

Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm, I will slice
I will dazzle them with my wit
Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm, I will slice
I will dazzle, I will outshine them all

Standing on the packed dance floor
Our bodies throb in time
Silent on the weekdays
Tonight I claim what's mine
Is it so wrong to crave recognition?
Second best, runner-up
Is it so wrong to want rewarding
To want more than is given to you?
Than is given to you

Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm, I will slice
I will dazzle them with my wit
Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm, I will slice
I will dazzle, I will outshine them all

Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm, I will slice
I will dazzle them with my wit
Tonight make me unstoppable
And I will charm, I will slice
I will dazzle, I will outshine them all4Embed
