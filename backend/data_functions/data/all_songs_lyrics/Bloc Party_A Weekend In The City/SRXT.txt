SRXT Lyrics
Walking in the countryside
It seems that the winds have stopped
I took down the posters from my wall
Left letters for you all
I remember moments of happiness
Endless summer, acoustic guitars
Being a man made me coarse
When I wanted to be delicate

I called up Eugene
Told him I was drowning
I called up Eugene
Told him I was drowning

Like a castaway on a warm ocean
Waiting for a purpose to rise
They say it's not becoming
For a boy my age
If you want to know what makes me sad
Well it's hope, the endurance of faith
A battle that lasts a lifetime
A fight that never ends
Walking in the countryside
It seems that the winds have stopped
Tell my mother I am sorry
And I loved her1Embed
