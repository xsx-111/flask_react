Waiting for the 7.18 Lyrics
Waiting for the 7:18
January is endless
Weary-eyed and forlorn
The Northern Line is the loudest
Sitting in silence in bars after work
I've got nothing to add or contest
Can I still kick a ball a hundred yards?
We cling to bottles and memories of the past

(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments) Not hours or days
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments)

Grinding your teeth in the middle of the night
With the sadness of those molars
Spend all your spare time trying to escape
With crosswords and Sudoku
If I could do it again, I'd make more mistakes
I'd not be so scared of falling
If I could do it again, I'd climb more trees
I'd pick and I'd eat more wild blackberries
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments) Not hours or days
(Give me moments) Just give me moments
(Give me moments)

Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend

Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend
Let's drive to Brighton on the weekend1Embed
