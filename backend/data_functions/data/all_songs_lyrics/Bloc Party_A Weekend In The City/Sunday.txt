Sunday Lyrics
Heavy night, it was a heavy night
Feels like we come back from the dead
Heavy night it was a heavy night
I cannot remember what I said to anyone

If we get up now we can catch the afternoon
Watch the under 15's playing football in the park
Let's sit in St. Leonard's on this alcoholic day
We're doing the best with what we've got

I love you in the morning, when you're still hung-over
I love you in the morning, when you're still strung out
I love you in the morning

I work hard all week, and so do you
We deserve to let off some steam
Less orthodox, creeping
When we need to rage through this life

There might be ones who are smarter than you
That have the right answers, that wear better shoes
Forget about those melting ice caps,
We're doing the best with what we've got
I love you in the morning, when you're still hung-over
I love you in the morning, when you're still strung out
I love you in the morning

When I'm with you I am calm
A pearl in your oyster
Head on my chest, a silent smile
A private kind of happiness
You see giant proclamations are all very well
But our love is louder than words
When I'm with you I am calm
A pearl in your oyster
Head on my chest, a silent smile
A private kind of happiness (I love you in the morning)
When I'm with you I am calm (I love you in the morning)
A pearl in your oyster (I love you in the morning)
Head on my chest, a silent smile (I love you in the morning)
A private kind of happiness (I love you in the morning)
When I'm with you I am calm (I love you in the morning)
A pearl in your oyster (I love you in the morning)
Head on my chest, a silent smile (I love you in the morning)
A private kind of happiness (I love you in the morning)
I love you in the morning, I love you in the morning
I love you in the morning, I love you in the morning
I love you in the morningEmbed
