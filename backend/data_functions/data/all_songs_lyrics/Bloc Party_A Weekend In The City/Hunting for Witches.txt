Hunting for Witches Lyrics
I'm sitting on the roof of my house
With a shotgun
And a six pack of beers
Six pack of beers, six pack of beers

The newscaster says "the enemy's among us"
As bombs explode on the 30 bus
Kill your middle class indecision
Now is not the time for liberal thought

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

90's, optimistic as a teen
Now it's terror
Airplanes crash into towers
Into towers, into towers

The Daily Mail says "the enemy's among us
Taking our women and taking our jobs"
All reasonable thought is being drowned out
By the non-stop baying, baying, baying for blood
So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

I was an ordinary man with ordinary desires
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
There must be accountability
Disparate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place

So I go hunting for witches
I go hunting for witches
Heads are going to roll
I go hunting for

I was an ordinary man with ordinary desires
I watched TV, it informed me
I was an ordinary man with ordinary desire
There must be accountability
Disparate and misinformed
Fear will keep us all in place7Embed
