On Lyrics
I am on, switched on
A sudden clearness, a clarity
Hidden away, in every locked toilet
I've been waiting for you in the Joiners Arms

I know your name, I know your name
I've danced with you, we're all friends here
Silver slugs lined up like bullets
Rolled up twenties, they disappear

You make my tongue loose, you make my tongue loose
I am hopeful and stutter-free
You make my tongue loose, you make my tongue loose
I am hopeful

Friday night I do all the talking
A pint and a fight, the dance floor is mine
Truth serum and limbs that won't listen
Drunken "I love you"s, on top of the world

And when it runs out
We're chasing something we'll never catch
And when it runs out
We buy more
A flatness so bleak
I've been bitten by a vampire
A flatness bleaker
Than the one it replaced

You make my tongue loose, you make my tongue loose
I am hopeful and stutter-free
You make my tongue loose, you make my tongue loose
I am hopeful

I can charm, I can charm them all
I can charm them all
I can charm, I can charm them all
I can charm them all

You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am hopeful and stutter-free
You make my tongue loose
You make my tongue loose
I am hopeful

I can charm, I can charm them all
I can charm them all
I can charm, I can charm them all
I can charm them allEmbed
