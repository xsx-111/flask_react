Hocus Pocus Lyrics
(Well if youâ€™re out and about on the freeways this morning, no dinosaurs to worry about)

So many ways
To wait behind the lines that border us from them
Don't take a shot
A smoke to trigger just a little bit from them
Can't be a crime to meddle
Can't be wrong to push the pedal
Queasy and grime, no fettle
Standing bones don't up the level

So many times
The prints don't match the brush that painted it from them
Don't take a forge
Or wait to dazzle as a conjurer from them
Behind the drape, un-aging
Behind aims of rearrangements
Stuck in the slime, no paddle
Guarded life, don't tend to dabble

Legalise this principle
Jump into a spot not visible
Bring it closer to the middle
What's alright with control
 
Wander from the cynical
Take a look at views atypical
With an answer to the riddle
As a tightening grip, just when it starts to let go
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
So many ways
Can't be a crime
Behind the drape/drab

Wander from the cynical
Take a look at this atypical
With an answer to the riddle
As the tightening grip, just when it starts to let go
Jump into a spot not visible
Bring it closer to the middle
What's alright with control
A slipping grip must let go

Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
Focus (Hocus Pocus)
