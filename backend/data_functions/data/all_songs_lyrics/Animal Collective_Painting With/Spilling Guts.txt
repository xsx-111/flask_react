Spilling Guts LyricsSpilling guts
Takes some time to waste a guy
Must be mad
OK, a smoldering burn
Must be bad
Cut deep and festering day by day
No one wants a free for all
Just a chance
A break, a lift to climb
On a back
Tough luck a pebble short of quit
Only those that get into the way back
Way, way back before the thumb
Was a way
A path, a reckoning
Like a catch
Sewn deep and gesturing day by day
Take a guy, an everyman
Must be glad
Well off, a gentle ease
Underneath
A film that’s cracking bit by bit
Only those that get into the way
That’s that
Or maybe keep in mind
Take the hit or take the fall
Fall back Embed
