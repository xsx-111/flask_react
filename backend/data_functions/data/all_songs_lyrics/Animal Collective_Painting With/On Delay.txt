On Delay LyricsI hear it doubly clear
There’s a doubled exposure
Just waiting to happen
I’m sitting and fading
Rain tapping together
Two licks of the dog bone
Me slipping through belt loops
You running ahead of
The sound coming after
I hear it doubly clear
Two mannequins in the window
Suit up like twins on day one
Loud harks in the grandest canyon
Natural slap the world back at ya
It’s placing the mirror
And you will hear her
Throw two hacks
Attempting to chip it
Return of the bat crack
In a place called Camden
(On delay) The two of us together
(On delay) The sweet of the double
(On delay) Me right behind you
(On delay) My steps will follow
(On delay) Two eyes that appeared there
(On delay) You saw them both times
(On delay) Looking at reflections
(On delay) And you were one of them
And it was so nice
And it happened twice
And it was so nice
And it was nice
And it happened twice
And it was nice
And it happened twice
And it was
And it was
A place that’s thrice best
Leading me right into a feedback zone
In which I lose time
I’m finding new rhythms to hold on
A place that’s thrice best
Leading me right into a feedback zone
In which I lose time
I’m finding new rhythms to hold on
So turned on by the delay
So turned on by the delay
So turned on by the delay1Embed
