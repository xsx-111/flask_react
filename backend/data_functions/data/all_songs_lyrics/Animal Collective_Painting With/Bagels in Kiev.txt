Bagels in Kiev LyricsGrandpop we had sweet days on the beach in Ventnor I remember
Wish we could walk along and you could watch the waves and talk the current Septembers
These days I’m not so sure who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn’t there when Moses parted the sea I wasn’t there with you grandpop back in Kiev
With the ladies dressed so nice in their ornate reds and satin textures
Have you since found some peace? It's like we can’t escape all the noise and violence
These days I’m not so sure who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn’t there when Moses parted the sea I wasn’t there with you grandpop back in Kiev
Let's just speak love
Bagels for everyone that’s the kind of thing you would have wanted
There should be lots to eat or how can they expect to get a tiring job done?
These days I’m not so sure who is getting along or if they were before
I wasn’t there when Moses parted the sea I wasn’t there with you grandpop back in Kiev3Embed
