Lying in the Grass Lyrics
All the pieces where they ought to be
But it's clear that he don't look like me
Pick a place around the table talk
Make a push to wake the comatose
Say you pause to say what's wrong
And quickly blow up the cover
There’s a way through fogs as long as there’s a light to discover (it)

Like a twisted stick, let's dig through the sick
And find a level space
Cinch to say

It's a gut that fears all things unknown
And a link within the brain you know
Not a shame to say the instinct's there
But a virtue to deny the bait
Know the cause and move to gauze and deftly
Tratar o sangue
In the lawn there's room to move
As there's a need to uncover it

As a choker sucks, let's sift through the muck
And lift this dingy veil
Same old tale
Get mixed in this crippling fixture
Try and approach the hidden mixtures
Get mixed in this crippling fixture
Try and approach the hidden picture

For a misplaced stash, let's search through the trash
And write this ignorant lurch
Wicked urge

Raise the gab above a whisper
Speak to salve a spoiling blister
Raise the gab above a whisper
Talk to cure a blister picture5Embed
