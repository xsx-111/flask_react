The Burglars LyricsI could be a hare and I’d
Sneak into my private rivals
Dreaming I’m a burglar
Quick as any day in my
Fleeting little chest of hopefuls
Lost it to the burglars
I can be aware and yet
Maybe I’m the same like pirates
Likened to the burglars
Threat on any day and I’m
Hiding from the hare who’s also
Hiding from the burglars
I didn’t catch his name pow
Shot him on the range yow
'Cause he was a burglar
Happens in the parks boohoo
Even in the old days
Stinking of the burglars
Happens in my home
I never see it coming
When I was young
We used to put
Alarms on our doors
And screens like a burglar net
Now that I’m older
I’m sure that’s absurd
That’s the word for the man
Who collects who’s he stealing from next
When I was young
My parents yelled
"Beware of the ivory man
That will steal and sell"
Now that I’m older
Those words are still pure
Not the look of a crook in his books
What’s he taking from you?
And worried peeps go on about it
Say a lot of changes better come
A pocket full of change is emptied by
A little gawky bright and bubbly bird
Lots of heroes out there thinking 'bout it
But minutes of their lives are ticking down
And bottles full of love are drunken by
A tricky trite and thirsty hungry bird
Blooming tips on tulip cones that
Don’t pay out they keep on growing
Costume thieves who never hand back
Half of what you end up owing
Has this town really gotten much better?
Are the burglars gonna keep on trying to meddle with it? (x4)
Probably driving your car with someone
Close up your head cause they
Are they reading your letters
Come on pack up the bed for betters
(What you think you own, you don’t)
Stealing from the day
Didn’t take a second
Listened to a record
And they got away
Sneaky are the burglars
When I cross their way
Like a helpless chicken
Bones will soon be clinking
Wearing me for play
Bracelet on a burglar
Thought I was okay
Not as bad as some
Sunset on the slums
See another day
Happy are the burglars
Brush it all away
Or do I let it sink in?
Is it my ambition
Just to turn away?
Freedom for the burglars
What you think you own, you don’t
Watch out the burglarsEmbed
