Recycling LyricsDon’t care whether this ship sails or sinks into the meat
Don’t know if a lesson matters less than what’s to eat
While you got it you figure why not launch off of the very highest rope
Not trying to be short side scoping breaks to score a ride
More like causing fractures from the deep to make the tide
Who needs slicker tools to build a portrait out of place
Not trying to be sneaky when it’s wanting face to face
When you’re rotten you figure why not stick up for the very finest dope
Don’t care if a lesion’s clotting up or ceases to bleed
Don’t know if a lesson is a pleasure or a need
While you’re huffing you figure why not soak up all the craze instead of cope2Embed
