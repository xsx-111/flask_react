Needles and Pins Lyrics
How neat, I'm impressed
How did you come to be so blessed?
You're a star, you blaze
Out like a sharp machine
Like a whale's moan
I'm here if that's what you want

Here we are
You're pins, I'm needles, let's play
Here we are
You want this? Then come on

Tune out everyone in the crowd
'Cause now it's just me and you
Come fall in love with the sound
Make a pact to each other
When no one's around
Put the cross between me and you
Who wants to fuck with us now?

Here we are
You're pins, I'm needles, let's play
Here we are
You want this? Then come on
Tune out everyone in the crowd
'Cause now it's just me and you
Come fall in love with the sound
Make a pact to each other
When no one's around
Put the cross between me and you
Who wants to fuck with us now?

Who wants to fuck with us now?
Who wants to fuck with us now?
Who wants to fuck with us now?
Who wants to fuck with us now?1Embed
