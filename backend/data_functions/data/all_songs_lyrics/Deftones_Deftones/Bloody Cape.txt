Bloody Cape Lyrics
In waves the ships have all sailed to the sea
Well, do you wanna wait or leave with me tonight
Cross your heart and pray
The ocean will take us all the way in

First we are ever to fall off of the Earth
We must be the
First ones in the world to fall off of the Earth

We could be, soon as our needs are fed
You'll give in to me and the whole heartache
Makes me feel alive, same typical offering
And you always knew we make it all the way in

First we are ever to fall off of the Earth
We must be the
First ones in the world to fall off of the Earth

It could be soon, as
The carnivals empty, I need you to take me home
God help me, God help me, God help me, God!
God help me, God help me, God help me, God!
God help me, God help me, God help me, God!
God help me, God help me, God help me, God!
God help me, God help me, God help me, God!2Embed
