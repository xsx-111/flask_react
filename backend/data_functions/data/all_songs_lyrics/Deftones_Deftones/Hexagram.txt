Hexagram Lyrics
Paint the streets in white
Death is the standard breach for a complex prize
I think it's sweet of you and your parents are proud
But I would expect it from anyone now to protect life's indigenous sound

Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play
Worship, play
Worship, worship, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play
Worship, worship

How the streets they swell
While the animals make their way through the crowds
If you keep listening you can hear it for miles
God I trust everyone quicker with every faint smile

Worship, play, play
Worship, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, worship, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, worship, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play, play
Worship, play
Worship, worship
And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God, it's so sweet of you and I know you're proud
And the car bomb hits quick, click, click, click, faint smile

It's the same sound
It's the same, same sound

And the crowd goes wild
And the camera makes you seasick
God, it's so sweet of you and you know I'm proud
And the car bomb tick ticks with the same sound
It's the same sound
With the same sound3Embed
