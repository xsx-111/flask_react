Anniversary of an Uninteresting Event Lyrics
No more gold lights
For the queen Earth
To keep you warm
In your kingdoms

High on the waves
You make for us
But not since you left
Have the waves come

The bar is dead
And the rocket's rain
Is keeping you wet
In your deathbed

So high on the waves
You made for us
And not since you left
Have the waves come
High on the waves
You made for us
Not since you left
Have the waves come1Embed
