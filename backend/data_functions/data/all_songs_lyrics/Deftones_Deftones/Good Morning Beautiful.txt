Good Morning Beautiful Lyrics
One of these days
You'll break me of many things
Some cold white day
But you're crazy if you think I would leave you this way

You, you should wake up
Before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off
Before the wrath comes soon

One of these days
I pray it will be sometime soon
On a day like today
You'd be crazy not to want me to teach you the way

You, you should wake up
Before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off
Before the wrath comes soon

Well I know what you're like
I've read it on the walls
You're too tired
You choose Heaven over the Earth and me
But come on please
You, you should wake up
Before the wrath comes
Me and you could take off
Before the wrath comes soon

Maybe you should take off
Yeah you should take off1Embed
