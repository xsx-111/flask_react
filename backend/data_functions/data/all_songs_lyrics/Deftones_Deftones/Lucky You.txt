Lucky You Lyrics
They'll come soon
I keep waiting
And I wait
Won't somebody save me

And if you're feeling lucky
Come and take me home
And if you feel loved
If you feel lucky
If you feel loved
If you feel lucky
If you feel loved

You've crossed the walls, excelled
Further along through their hell
For my heart, I watch you kill
You always have, you always will

Spread your wings and sail out to me
Spread your wings and sail out to me

So if you're feeling lucky
Come and take me home, come and take me home
Come and take me home, come and take me home
Come and take me home, come and take me home
If you feel
If you feel loved (if you feel lucky)
You've crossed the walls, excelled (if you feel loved)
Further along through their hell (if you feel lucky)
For my heart, I watch you kill (if you feel loved)
You always have, you always will (if you feel lucky, if you feel loved)

Spread your wings and sail out to me
(If you feel lucky, if you feel loved)
(You always have you always will)
Spread your wings and sail out to me
(If you feel lucky, if you feel loved)
(You always have you always will)1Embed
