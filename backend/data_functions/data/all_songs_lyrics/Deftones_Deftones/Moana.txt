Moana Lyrics
Somehow calm
As she walks onstage
Her entire empire
Becomes your taste
Your taste
Show me

Come
Let me know what you're like
Let me know what you're like
What's your taste?

I bet she carves your heart
When she walks onstage
Her empire slowly
Becomes your place
Your place
Show me

Come on
Let me know what you're like
Let me
Know what you're like
In your place
Your place
Somehow calm
As she walks offstage
An entire empire
Recall your face
Your face
Show me

Come
Let me know what you're like
Let me
Know what you're like
Your face3Embed
