Battle-Axe Lyrics
I want to sleep
If you are awake
Still making believe
That you aren't at all crazy

And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud
Still you love to think you have always been this way
But you're all wrong

And you only sleep
When you've lost cause
Well I still believe
That the cause was always me

And if you don't believe I think you should
You make me so proud
Still you love to think you have always been this way
Well I'd love to think you will someday feel the same
And you love to think it will always
Always
If you still believe it will always be this way
Well you're all wrong
Yes you are
You will see3Embed
