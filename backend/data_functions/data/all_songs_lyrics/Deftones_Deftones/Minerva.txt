Minerva Lyrics
I get all numb
When she sings that "It's over"
Such a strange numb
And it brings my knees to the earth

And God bless you all
For the song you sang us

You're the same numb
When you sing "It's over"
Such a strange numb
It could bring back peace to the Earth

So God bless you all
For the song you sang us all
For the hearts you break
Every time you moan

I get all numb
We're the same numb
And it brings our knees to the earth
So God bless you all
For the song you sang us all
For the hearts you break
Every time you moan

And God bless you all
