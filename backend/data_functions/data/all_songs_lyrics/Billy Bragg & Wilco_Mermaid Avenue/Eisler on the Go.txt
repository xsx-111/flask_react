Eisler on the Go Lyrics
Eisler on the go
Eisler on the move
Brother is on the vinegar truck
And I don't know what I'll do

Don't know what I'll do
I don't know what I'll do
Eisler's on the come and go
And I don't know what I'll do

Eisler on the farm
Eisler on the town
Sister in the tickly bush
And I don't know what I'll do


Eisler on the boat
Eisler on the ship
Daddy on the henhouse roof
And I don't know what I'll do

Eisler in the jailoe
Eisler back at home
Rankin scratch his head and cry
And I don't know what I'll do


Eisler him write music
Eisler him teach school
Truman him don't play so good
And I don't know what I'll do


Don't know what I'll do
I don't know what I'll doEmbed
