Christ for President Lyrics
Let's have Christ our president
Let us have him for our king
Cast your vote for the Carpenter
That they call the Nazarene

The only way
They can ever beat
These crooked politician men
Is to cast the moneychangers
Out of the temple
Put the Carpenter in

Oh it's Jesus Christ our president
God above our king
With a job and pension for young and old
We will make hallelujah ring

Every year we waste enough
To feed the ones who starve
We build our civilization up
And we shoot it down with wars
But with the Carpenter
On the seat
Way up in the capitol town
The USA
Be on the way
Prosperity bound1Embed
