One by One Lyrics
One by one, the teardrops fall as I write you
One by one, my words come falling on the page
One by one, my dreams are fading in the twilight
One by one, my schemes are fading fast away

One by one, the flowers fading in my garden
One by one, the leaves are falling from the trees
One by one, my hopes are vanished in the clouds, dear
One by one, like snowflakes melting in the breeze

One by one, my hair is turning gray
One by one, my dreams are fading fast away
One by one, I read your letters over
One by one, I lay them all away

One by one, the days are slipping up behind you
One by one, the sweetest days of life go by
One by one, the moments stealing up behind you
One by one, she'll come and find not you or I

One by one, I hear the soft words that you whispered
One by one, I feel your kisses soft and sweet
One by one, I hope you'll say the words to marry
One by one, to one by one forever beEmbed
