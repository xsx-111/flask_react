Hamburger Fields LyricsNow here comes daddy (Now here comes daddy)
And here goes mummy (And here goes mummy)
The baby's pretty (The baby's pretty)
His name is Johnny (His name is Johnny)
Now here comes daddy...
Hamburger Fields, Hamburger Fields
Sixty years in the Hamburger Fields
Hamburger Fields, Hamburger Fields
Sixty years in the Hamburger Fields
Hamburger Fields, Hamburger Fields
Hamburger Fields, Hamburger Fields
Sixty years in the Hamburger Fields
A child is born (A child is born)
Let's celebrate (Let's celebrate)
Well it's a date! (Well it's a date!)
Let's eat popcorn (Let's eat popcorn)
This child gonna live (This child gonna live)
In the Hamburger Fields (In the Hamburger Fields)
Yeah, he's gonna live (Yeah, he's gonna live)
In the Hamburger Fields (In the Hamburger Fields)
In the hand of fate (In the hand of fate)
He'll be educated (He'll be educated)
In the Hamburger Fields (In the Hamburger Fields)
In the Hamburger Fields (In the Hamburger Fields)
Over the soda river (Over the soda rivers)
In front of the gasoil sea (In front of the gasoil sea)
Havin' T.V. dreams (Havin' T.V. dreams)
Under the air conditioned skies
Fly, fly, my baby fly
No matter if your daddy cries
Fly, fly, my baby fly
Over the Hamburger Fields
A child is born (A child is born)
Let's celebrate (Let's celebrate)
Well it's a date! (Well it's a date!)
Let's eat popcorn (Let's eat popcorn)
In the hand of fate (In the hand of fate)
He'll be educated (He'll be educated)
In the hand of fate (In the hand of fate)
He's gonna live (He's gonna live)
In the Hamburger Fields
In the Hamburger Fields
In the Hamburger Fields
In the Hamburger Fields
A child is born
Well it's a date!
In the Hamburger Fields
In the Hamburger Fields
In the Hamburger Fields
In the Hamburger Fields
A child is born...Embed
