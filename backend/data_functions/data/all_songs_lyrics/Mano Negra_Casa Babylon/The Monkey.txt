The Monkey Lyrics
サウンドマーケットのスタジオは、すっかりマノ・ネグラとそのファン達に占領されてしまいました。
(Loooooooooord!)
I said, yeah! (Monkey!)
Monkey (Yeah)

Now three little monkeys sat on a coconut tree
Discussing things as they are said to be
Said the one to the other, now listen you two
There's a silly rumor that can't be true
That that man descended from our own noble race
The funny idea is a big disgrace
No monkey ever deserted his wife
His baby and run for life

I said, yeah (Yeah!)
Monkey speaks his mind
I said, yeah (Yeah!)
Monkey speaks his mind

And another thing you will never see
A monkey build a fence around a coconut tree
And let all the coconuts go to waste
Forbidding all the other monkeys to come and taste
Now if I build a fence around this tree
Starvation will cause you to steal from me
I said, yeah (Yeah!)
Monkey speaks his mind
I said, yeah (Yeah!)
Monkey speaks his mind
(Loooooooooord!)

There's another thing a monkey won't do
Go out at night and get on a stew
Or use a gun a club or a knife
To take another monkey's life (I said, yeah!)
Yes, man descended from the worthless bum
But brothers from us he did not come

Yeah (Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind
I said, yeah (Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind

(Loooooooooord!)
Yeah (Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind
I said, yeah (Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind
(-ooooord!)(Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind (Monkey!)(Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind (Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind (Monkey!)(Yeah!)
The monkey speaks his mind (Monkey!)
The monkey speaks his mind (Monkey!)(Loooooooooord!)
The monkey speaks his mindEmbed
