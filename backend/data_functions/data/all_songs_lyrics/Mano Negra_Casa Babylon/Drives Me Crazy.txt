Drives Me Crazy LyricsNo fun baby
No place to be
Dancin' and drinkin'
You and me
And it drives me crazy
Maybe I'm just
An half grown boy
This town for me
Is a broken toy
And it drives me crazy
Here comes that thunderstorm again
My temperature's risin' all in vain
And it drives me crazy
Goodbye Paris
I'm leavin you
Nothing they said
About you is true
They say that you're
The city of joy
They say that you're
The real MC COY
Don't wanna be
Your lonely boy... and it Drives me crazy
Drives me crazyEmbed
