Love & Hate LyricsI love your lips
And I love your legs
I love your eyes
Baby you got style
I love your clothes
And I love your smile
I love you, I love you
I love you while
You don't even look at me
And I go crazy
For all the women
That I never had
I sing my song
Of Love and Hate
I hate the boys
Walkin' by your side
I hate my dreams
They're not satisfied
I hate me, babe
For being too shy
I hate you, I hate you
I hate you while
You don't even look at me
And I go crazy
For all the women
That I never had
I sing my song
Of Love and Hate
You neighbour's sweetheart
You magazine girl
You striptease bird
From the underworld
You sweet sixteen
You little dames
You late thirties
Sweet japaneses
Ornella Muti
Si jolie mademoiselle
Vous etes ma folie
Vous etes si belles
For all the women
That I never had
I sing my song
Of Love and Hate
For all the women
That I never had
I sing my song
Sé que nunca fuiste mía
Ni lo has sido ni lo eres
Pero de mi corazón
Un pedacito tú tiene
Tú tiene, tú tiene
Tú tiene, tú tiene
Y no lo sé, no lo sé
No lo sé, corazón
A mí nada me arde
I love your body
Baby you got style
You fly so high
When you're passin' by
It makes me laugh
And it makes me cry
It makes me want to die
When there's no reason why
For all the women
That I never had
I sing my song
Of Love and Hate
I Sing my songEmbed
