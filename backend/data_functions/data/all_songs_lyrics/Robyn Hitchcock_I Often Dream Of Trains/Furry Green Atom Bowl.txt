Furry Green Atom Bowl LyricsFurry green eye
In a furry green hole
It's a furry green atom bowl
Furry green eye
In a furry green bowl
It's a furry green atom bowl
Spread-dud-dust, spread-dud-dust
Spread-dud-dust in a reaching way
As the dead bug flares, dead bug flares
Dead bug flares in a swollen glow
Furry green mole
In a furry green hole
It's a furry green atom bowl
Um...
Um...
Verdigris, verdigris
Verdigris, verdigris
Verdigris, verdigris
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
The lid comes off like a casserole
(The lid comes off like a casserole)
The steam comes up the devil's nose
He knows, he knows, he always knows
He sits there in a silver cone
Drumming his fingers on a golden throne
He loves that smell
He loves that smell
Um...
Um...
That swollen bowl it blew up whole
(That swollen bowl it blew up whole)
And the black was hungry when it came down
So it et the world for miles around
Sticky black meat (sticky black meat)
Will flood your street (will flood your street)
Sticky black oil
Will boil your soil
Furry green eye
In a furry green hole
It's a furry green atom bowl
Furry green eggs
On furry green legs
Big ones, small ones, out they roll
Gonna shake my pie, gonna bake my soul
It's a crusty old pie (it's a crusty old pie)
But it's a crusty old world (it's a crusty old world)
And underneath (underneath)
There's roots and bulbs (roots and bulbs)
Gonna mix 'em all up (gonna mix 'em all up)
In the atom bowl
Big ones, small ones, out they roll
Big ones, small ones, out they roll
Big ones, small ones, out they roll
In a new formation
In a new formation
In a new formation
Spell a brand new world with the same old letters
Um...
Um...
Um...
Um...
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
Roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
Roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
And that's the way to stay
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
And that's the way to stay
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
There's roots in the earth and kidneys in the body
And that's the way to stayEmbed
