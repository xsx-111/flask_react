Ye Sleeping Knights of Jesus Lyrics(Okay, one, two, three, four)
I have seen the sleeping knights of Jesus
Gazing out across the open sea
I have seen the sleeping knights of Jesus
And they look extremely tired to me
Dyin' of starvation in the gutter (in the gutter)
That is all the future holds for me (holds for me)
Or alcoholic poisoning in the toilet of my choice
That's all there is, as far as I can see
Fried to death in seconds by the Russians (by the Russians)
Or if you're lucky just a sudden stroke (sudden stroke)
A lingering death from fallout as your teeth and hair fall out
A certain death from cancer if you smoke
But I have seen the sleeping knights of Jesus
Gazing out across the open sea
I have seen the sleeping knights of Jesus
And they look extremely tired to me
Put your faith in God, he won't expect you
Put your faith in death because it's free
If you believe in nothing, honey, it believes in you
For God's sake don't waste any faith on me
When he comes to judge us in his glory (in his glory)
Then we'll see how old a man can get (man can get)
He must be feeling ancient up there on the rim of space
Two thousand years and he ain't been back yet
But I have seen the sleeping knights of Jesus (rub their eyes)
Rub their eyes and gape at what they see
I have seen the sleeping knights of Jesus (and it looks as though)
And it looks as though they've noticed me
And it looks as though they've noticed meEmbed
