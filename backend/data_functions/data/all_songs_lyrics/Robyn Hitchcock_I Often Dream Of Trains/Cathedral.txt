Cathedral LyricsDo you wonder, like I do
What goes on inside of you?
In the cathedral of the mind
All the worshippers are blind
Like a toilet from outside
A cathedral from inside
There behind your open face
Lies an awful lot of space
And if I ever look into your open eyes again
I'll remind myself to stare until I'm looking through your eyes
When I'm hurt, you feel the pain
You've been in my head again
You're projecting onto me
What you'd like yourself to see
Now the clock is beating fast
Every moment wanders past
And fades away
Then comes back another day
Do I go, or do I stay
Inside your mind?Embed
