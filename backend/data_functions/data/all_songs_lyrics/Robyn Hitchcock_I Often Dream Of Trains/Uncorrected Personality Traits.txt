Uncorrected Personality Traits LyricsUncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child
May prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult
Lack of involvement with the father, or over-involvement with the mother
Can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual peers
And in homosexual leanings, narcissism, transexuality
(Girls from the waist up, men from the waist down)
Attempts to be your own love object
Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once!
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man, but this tends to get overlooked By our mother-fixated, overweight, sexist media
So, uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child
May prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult
If you give in to them every time they cry
They will become little tyrants but they won't remember why
Then when they are thwarted by people in later life
They will become psychotic and they won't make an ideal husband or wife
The spoiled baby grows into
The escapist teenager who's
The adult alcoholic who's
The middle-aged suicide. (Oy!)
So, uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child
May prove to be ugly in a fully grown adultEmbed
