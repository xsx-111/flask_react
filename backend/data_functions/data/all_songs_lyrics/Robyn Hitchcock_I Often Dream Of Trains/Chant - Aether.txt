Chant / Aether Lyrics
Ah...

I'm going back into my body
While it's in my control
Back into this person
Playing a role that I call me
I'm going back into my body
Back out of my dream
Dressed up as a human
With a routine, calling it me
I've been on the aetheric plane
Above all pleasure and all pain
And it feels so bizarre
Looking down on where you are
I think I'm going back again
I'm going back into my body
Back into my heart
Back into my lifeline
Playing a part -- what can I be?
I've been on the aetheric plane
Where there's no dog and there's no chain
And it feels so bizarre
Looking down on where you are
I think I'm going back againEmbed
