I Often Dream Of Trains (Demo) Lyrics(-And the Belle Stars, waiting to perform live here at the Lyceum. So let's kick off first with three girls, known to pop fans as Bananarama, singing "Shy Boy!")
I often dream of trains when I'm alone
I ride on them into another zone
I dream of them constantly
Heading for paradise
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains when I'm awake
They ride along beside a frozen lake
I know what they're meant to be
Symbols of destiny
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains when I'm away
I have to change at Woking on the way
And there in the buffet car
I wait for my destiny
Or Basingstoke
Or Reading
I often dream of trains when I'm with you
I wonder if you dream about them too
Maybe we'll meet one night
Out in the corridor
I'm waiting for
You baby
Baby
