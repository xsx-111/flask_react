Sometimes I Wish I Was a Pretty Girl LyricsSometimes I wish I was a pretty girl
So I could- urk! -myself in the shower
Sometimes I wish I was a pretty girl
So I could- urk! -myself in the shower
Been on my own so long
I can't tell left from wrong
Bloody red bats squelching offal

Sometimes I wish I was a pretty girl
So I could- urk! -myself in the shower
Sometimes I wish I was a pretty girl
So I could- urk! -myself in the shower
Been on my own all night
I can't tell left from right
Baby come back, give me fever

Sometimes I wish I was a pretty girl
So I could- urk! -myself in the shower
Sometimes I wish I was a pretty girl
So I could (stab) myself in the shower
Sometimes I wish I was a
So I couldEmbed
