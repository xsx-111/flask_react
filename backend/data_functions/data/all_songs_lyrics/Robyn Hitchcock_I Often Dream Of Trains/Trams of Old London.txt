Trams of Old London LyricsTrams of old London
Taking my baby into the past
And its trams of old London
Blow my mind
Ludgate, Fenchurch, Highgate Hill
Rolling slowly up there still, uh-huh
Waterloo and Clerkenwell
Out to Aldgate East as well, uh-huh
On a clear night you can see
Where the rails used to be
Oh it seems like ancient myth
They once ran to Hammersmith
Trams of old London
Taking my baby into the past
And its trams of old London
Blow my mind
Through Electric Avenue
Brixton down in SW2, uh-huh
Teddington and Kennington
Twickenham and Paddington, uh-huh
In the Blitz they never closed
Though they blew up half the roads
Oh it hurts me just to see 'em
Going dead in a museum
Trams of old London
Taking my baby into the past
And its trams of old London
Blow my mind
Trams of old London
Taking my baby into the past
And its trams of old London
Blow my mindEmbed
