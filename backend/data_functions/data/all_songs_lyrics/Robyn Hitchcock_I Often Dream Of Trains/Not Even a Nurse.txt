Not Even a Nurse LyricsI'm not even a nurse in a world with a curse
I'm not even a doctor or knight
I can't help you at all, I just stand as you fall
And I hope that you're falling allright
A long time ago when we first said hello
I thought you'd be cured right away
But I tried for so long and it all came out wrong
And you're sicker than ever today
Hold hard with your face to the wind
And with your music all over my spine
Hold hard with your face coming in
And you're mine
So take care of your sheep and take care of your sleep
And take care of your mother and friends
If I see you again, I'll explain it all then
If I don't then you know how it endsEmbed
