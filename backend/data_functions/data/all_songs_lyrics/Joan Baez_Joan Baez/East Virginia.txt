East Virginia Lyrics
I was born in East Virginia
North Carolina I did roam
There I met a fair pretty maiden
Her name and age I do not know

Her hair it was of a brightsome color
And her lips of ruby red
On her breast she wore white lilies
There I longed to lay my head

Well, in my heart, you are my darling
At my door, you're welcome in
At my gate, I'll meet you, my darling
If your love I could only win

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun refused to shine
Than to see you be another man's darling
And to know that you'll never be mine

Well, in the night, I'm dreaming about you
In my day, I find no rest
Just the thought of you, my darling
Sends aching pains all through my breast
Well, when I'm dead and in my coffin
With my feet turned toward the sun
Come and sit beside me, darling
Come and think on the way you doneEmbed
