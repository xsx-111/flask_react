Rake and Rambling Boy LyricsWell I'm a rake and ramblin' boy
There's many a city I did enjoy
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life
Oh, she was pretty, both neat and gay
Caused me to rob the broad highway
Oh, yes, I robbed it, I do declare
And I got myself ten thousand bail
Well I'm a rake and ramblin' boy
There's many a city I did enjoy
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life
Oh when I die don't bury me at all
Place my bones in alcohol
And at my feet place a snow white dove
To let the world know I died for love
Well I'm a rake and a ramblin' boy
There's many a city I did enjoy
And now I've married me a pretty little wife
And I love her dearer than I love my life
And I love her dearer than I love my lifeEmbed
