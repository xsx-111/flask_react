House of the Rising Sun Lyrics
There is a house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun
And it's been the ruin for many poor girl
And me, oh God, for one

If I had listened to what my mother said
I'd have been at home today
But I was young and foolish, oh God
Let a rambler lead me astray

Go tell my baby sister
"Don't do what I have done"
But shun that house in New Orleans
They call the Rising Sun

I'm going back to New Orleans
My race is almost run
I'm going back to spend my life
Beneath that Rising Sun1Embed
