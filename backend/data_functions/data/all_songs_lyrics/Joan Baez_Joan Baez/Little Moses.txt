Little Moses Lyrics
And away by the waters so blue
The ladies were winding their way
When Pharaoh's little daughter stepped down to the water
To bathe in the cool of the day
And before it was dark, she looked in the ark
And found sweet infant was there
And before it was dark, she looked in the ark
And found sweet infant was there

And away by the waters so blue
She carried that beautiful child
To his tender mother, his sister and brother
Little Moses looked happy and smiled
And she called him her own, her beautiful son
And sent for a nurse that was near
And she called him her own, her beautiful son
And sent for a nurse that was near

And away by the sea that was red, so red
Little Moses, the servant of God
Before him subsided, the seas were divided
When upward he lifted his rod
And the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh's host
Were drownded in the waters and lost
And the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh's host
Were drownded in the waters and lost

And away on a mountain so high
The last one that he ever did see
With Israel victorious, his hopes were most glorious
Someday all Jordan be free
When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens above
When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And rested in the Heavens aboveEmbed
