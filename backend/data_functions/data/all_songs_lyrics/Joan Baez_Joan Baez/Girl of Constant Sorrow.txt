Girl of Constant Sorrow LyricsI am a girl of constant sorrow
I've seen troubles all my days
I'm going back to California
The place I was partly raised
All through this world, I'm bound to ramble
Through sun and wind and driving rain
I'm bound to ride the western railways
Perhaps I'll take the very next train
Your friends may think that I'm a stranger
My face, you'll never see no more
There's one promise that is given
I'll see you on God's golden shore
I am a girl of constant sorrow
I've seen troubles all my days
I'm going back to California
The place I was partly raisedEmbed
