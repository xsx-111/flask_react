I Know You Rider LyricsI know you, rider, gonna miss me when I'm gone
I know you, rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Gonna miss your pretty mama from rolling in your arms
I love you, rider, and I know you must love me some
I love you, rider, and I know you must love me some
You put your arms around me like a circle around the sun
I laid down and I tried to take my rest
I laid down and I tried to take my rest
My heart was rambling like wild geese in the west
Going to the river, I'm gonna sit down on the log
I'm going to the river, I'm gonna sit down on the log
If I can't be your honey, but I sure wanna be your dog
Sun's gonna shine in my backyard some day
Sun's gonna shine in my backyard some day
The west wind's gonna rise up and blow my blues awayEmbed
