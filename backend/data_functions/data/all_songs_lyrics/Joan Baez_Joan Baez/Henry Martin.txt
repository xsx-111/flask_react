Henry Martin Lyrics
There were three brothers in merry Scotland
In merry Scotland there were three
And they did cast lots which of them should go
Should go, should go
And turn robber all on the salt sea

The lot it fell first upon Henry Martin
The youngest of all the three
That he should turn robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea
For to maintain his two brothers and he

He had not been sailing but a long winter's night
And a part of a short winter's day
When he espied a stout lofty ship
Lofty ship, lofty ship
Come a-bibbin' down on him straight way

"Hello! Hello!" cried Henry Martin
"What makes you sail so nigh?
I'm a rich merchant ship bound for fair London Town
London Town, London Town
Would you please for to let me pass by?"
"Oh no! Oh no!" cried Henry Martin
"This thing it never could be
For I have turned robber all on the salt sea
Salt sea, the salt sea
For to maintain my two brothers and me"

Come lower your tops'l and brail up your mizzen
Bring your ship under my lee
Or I will give to you a full cannonball
Cannonball, cannonball
And all your dear bodies drown in the salt sea

Oh no! We won't lower our lofty topsail
Nor bring our ship under your lee
And you shan't take from us our rich merchant goods
Merchant goods, merchant goods
Nor point our bold guns to the sea

Then broadside and broadside and at it they went
For fully two hours or three
Till Henry Martin gave to them the death shot
The death shot, the death shot
And straight to the bottom went she
Bad news, bad news to old England came
Bad news to fair London Town
There's been a rich vessel and she's cast away
Cast away, cast away
And all of her merry men drownedEmbed
