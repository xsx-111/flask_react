Wildwood Flower Lyrics
I will twine with my mingles of raven black hair
With the roses so red and the lilies so fair
The meadow so bright with its emerald hue
And the pale amelita and eyes look so blue

I will dance, I will sing and my life shall be gay
I will charm every heart, in his crown I will sway
I woke from my dream and all idols was clay
And all portions of lovin' had all flown away

He told me to love him and promised to love
And cherish me over all others above
My poor heart is wondering, no misery can tell
He left me no warning, no words of farewell

He taught me to love him and called me his flower
That was blooming to cheer him through life's weary hour
How I long to see him and regret the dark hour
He's gone and neglected his frail wildwood flowerEmbed
