Wild Eyed Southern Boys Lyrics
It's a hot night at the juke joint
And the band's pumpin' rhythm and blues
Gonna spill a little rock and roll blood tonight
Gonna make some front page news

And the ladies hate the violence
Still they never seem to look away

'Cause they love those
Wild eyed southern boys
Wild eyed boys
Wild eyed southern boys

It's a southern point of honor
You gotta get right in on the action
You can hear the outlaws holler
Fightin' for the lady in black

And she's just one in a million
But she's all I need tonight
'Cause she loves those
Wild eyed southern boys
Wild eyed boys
Wild eyed southern boys

Wild eyed boys
Ooh yeah
Wild eyed boys

A man of wealth and power
Is out on the dance hall floor
He's got a champagne Eldorado
Parked outside the door

And he's looking for a honky tonk angel
But he don't stand a chance in hell

'Cause he ain't no
Wild eyed southern boy (Wild eyed southern boy)
Wild eyed boy
Wild eyed southern boy (Wild eyed southern boy)
Wild eyed boy
Wild eyed southern boys (Wild eyed southern boys)
Wild eyed boys
Wild eyed southern boys (Wild eyed southern boys)
Wild eyed boys
Wild eyed southern boys (Wild eyed southern boys)
Wild eyed boys
Wild eyed southern boys (Wild eyed southern boys)
Wild eyed boysEmbed
