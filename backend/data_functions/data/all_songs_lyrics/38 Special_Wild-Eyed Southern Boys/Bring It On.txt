Bring It On LyricsI been betrayed, cause I been away
Why can't you ever see it my way?
C'mon baby, you know what I mean
I been eleven years doin' long hard work
We're finally getting' what we deserve
I said, C'mon baby, I'm not to blame
I said a one night stand takes a certain kind of man
But we do it
It's a hell of way, you learn to live for the day
If you choose it
That's why I say now
Take it from me, it's not like it seems
Someday I'll give ya all that you need
But a tense word, baby, you just gotta believe
I said a one night stand takes a certain kind of man
But we do it
You know I'm not much at home
We live that danger zone
But you knew it
That's why I say
Bring it on
Bring it on
I'll deal with trouble when I get home
Bring it on
Bring it on
I'd rather fight it than go it alone. Growl
Lead Break
The jealousy's got you too blind to see
It ain't fair what you're doin' to me
I say, c'mon baby, I'm tired of tryin' to please
Lonely nights and cocaine highs
If that don't getcha then you'll pay the price
C'mon baby, that's all a part of me
I say one night stands take a certain kind of man
But we do it
Lord, how we do it
I'm not much at home, we live that danger zone
That's why I say
Bring it on
Bring it on
I'll deal with trouble when I get home
Bring it on
Bring it on
I'd rather fight it than go it alone
Bring it on
Bring it on
I'll deal with trouble when I get home
Bring it on, (Bring it on)
Bring it on
I'd rather fight it than go it alone
Bring it onEmbed
