Hold On Loosely Lyrics
You see it all around you
Good loving gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had

And my mind goes back
To a girl I left some years ago
Who told me

Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in

So damn easy
When your feelings are such
To overprotect her
To love her too much

And my mind goes back
To a girl I left some years ago
Who told me
Just hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in

Don't let her slip away
Sentimental fool
Don't let your heart get in the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah

You see it all around you
Good loving gone bad
And usually it's too late when you
Realize what you had

So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Your baby needs someone to believe in
And a whole lot of space to breathe in
So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose it
You're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly
You're gonna lose control
Hold on loosely, but don't let go
If you cling too tightly to her
You're gonna lose control
Yeah, yeah, yeah4Embed
