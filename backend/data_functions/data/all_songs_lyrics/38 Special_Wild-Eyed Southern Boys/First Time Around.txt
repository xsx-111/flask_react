First Time Around LyricsPeople might say that I'm no good
Livin' like I do
Well I stake my life on my future
Can you say that you feel like I do?
Now, if there's any room for doubting
You better look some more
'cause I made my mistakes while I know it
I know you've heard it all before
But it's your first time around
Sometimes the runnin' can sure get you down
It's your first time around
Don't get trapped by the life that you found
If you find your life at a dead end
Sweatin' and breathin' for room
You never crawl before you walk
You gotta take the bad with the good
But it's your first time around
Sometimes the runnin' can sure get you down
It's your first time around
Don't get trapped by the life that you found
The life you found...
People might say that I'm no good
Livin' like I do
I stake my life on my future
Can you say that you feel like I do?
So if you find your life at a dead end
Sweatin' and breathin' for room
You better crawl before you walk
You gotta take the bad with the good
You should be lookin' for some answers
You think you have them all
I got news for you, brother;
Ain't nobody too big to fall
But it's your first time around
Sometimes the runnin' can sure get you down
It's your first time around
Don't get trapped by the life that you found
It's your first time aroundEmbed
