Throw Out the Line LyricsWhoa
I'm runnin' around in a circle
Never know where to stop
'Cause I'm lookin' for
A special kind of lady
Hopin' that she'll change my luck
I took a chance, asked you to dance
Wanted just to take you home
I'm holdin' steady, I know I'll be ready. Will you be comin' if I call?
Throw out the line
And make a believer
Just give me the time
You know I won't leave ya
Someday you'll be mine
I can't give ya up
Throw out the line
Oh won't you throw out the line
So I, I make my move
I might break all the rules
The strategy's my only game
I can't fake it
My heart won't take it
I'm hopin' that you'll feel the same
Throw out the line
To make a believer
Just give me the time
You know I won't leave ya
Someday you'll be mine
I can't give you up
Throw out the line
Won't you throw out the lineEmbed
