Honky Tonk Dancer Lyrics
Lady in red, what'cha doin'?
Who the hell you think you're foolin'?
Why you actin' so cold?
You're the angel of town, you keep sayin'
"Gotta work, no time for playin'"
But what the others don't know

When the clock strikes five, you really come alive
Forget about who you are
Forget about the week and all the bus'ness heat
Tonight, you become a star
That's what you are

You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
You're a queenie when you take the floor
You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
Star attraction, that's for sure
That's what you are!

Listen here, now
Monday mornin's comin'
Routine, you're out there runnin'
Boss man likes his coffee sweet
Ain't no life for you, baby
Soon or later, gonna drive you crazy
Moonlightin' ev'ry week
When the sun goes down, you really come around
Forget about who you are
You're a nighttime girl
When you're showin' all the world
Tonight, you're gonna be a star
That's what you are

You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
You're a queenie when you take the floor
You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
Star attraction, that's for sure
Whoo! Yeah

Oh, Monday mornin's comin'
Routine, you're out there runnin'
Boss man likes his coffee sweet
Ain't no good for you, baby
Tell the man he must be crazy!
You gotta moonlight ev'ry week

When the clock strikes five, you really come alive
Forget about who you are
Forget about the week and all the bus'ness heat
Tonight, you become a star
That's what you are
You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
You're a queenie when you take the floor
You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
Star attraction, that's for sure

Listen here, now
You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
You're a queenie when you take the floor
You're a honky tonk nighttime dancer
Star attraction, that's for sure
That's what you are, now

Honky tonk dancer
That's what you are
Honky tonk dancer
Ballroom star
Honky tonk dancer
One time for me
Honky tonk dancer
