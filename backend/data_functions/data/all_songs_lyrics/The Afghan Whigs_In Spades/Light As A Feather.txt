Light As A Feather LyricsSay you're coming for the rest of me
Sounds good, I like what you're doing
Let me demonstrate
And though I've said it before-
I'm gonna be breaking your heart, baby
Now if your limits should convince the sky
You sidle up proper, baby
You will never die
I know I've said It before-
I'm gonna be breaking your heart, baby
Cross the river to get next to meÂ­-
You're like the dawn
You're either gonna let go
Or come get some more-
Don't ever let go-
Come get some more
Our love from mouth to mouth-
My kingdom from the South
So come collect your feelings
Light as a feather, child
I got nothing to lose-
O, no
These consequences-Embed
