Into The Floor LyricsWhen It burns-
And falls into the floor
Feel it rise-
And come and get some more
I'll remember you always this way
When it seems-
Your back's against the wall
Tilt the sky-
And under you will crawl
I'll remember you-
Is It late-
Or is it yet to come?
Will it wait-
Or burn into the sun?
I'll remember you always this way
And suddenly-
It was meant to be
When it burns-
And falls into the floor
Feel it rise-
And come and get some more
I'll remember you always this way
And suddenly-
A summer breeze...Embed
