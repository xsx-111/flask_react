Birdland LyricsI was a child-
An open letter
To be read aloud to the throng
Caught in a spell of stormy weather
Mnemonic lines to the fore
Whatever it is that's kept us together-
I look to the sky and it's gone
Save one for me and I'll never forget you-
You're coming alive in the cold-
Coming alive in the cold
Coming alive in the cold
(And I say-)
So in a haze of feverish lights
The satyr arrives to the throne
We'll come together when the feeling's right-
We're coming alive in the cold-
Coming alive in the cold-
Coming alive in the cold2Embed
