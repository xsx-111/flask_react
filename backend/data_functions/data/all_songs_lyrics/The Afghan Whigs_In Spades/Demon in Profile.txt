Demon in Profile LyricsCriminal-
I'll bet your best
See the knife in the water
Send you back to bed
All over your body-
This electricity
It was all that I wanted-
Now it's killing me
You say you're ready-
If I'm an animal
Let's get a room real soon-
And we'll call the supernatural
All over your body-
Now say it back to me
Some call it chemical
I call it bittersweet
Sympathy-
If your lies should go unseen
But I'll be there to share
If you don't mind the company
All over your-
Bet your best
I'm so far inside you now
I am your silhouette
And you can believe me now-
This isn't happening
You're not the first to be stolen-
You're not the last to believe
Sympathy-
If your lies should go unseen
If you're not ready now
You're never gonna be-
-all over me
-all over me
-all over me
If you're not ready now
You're never gonna be1Embed
