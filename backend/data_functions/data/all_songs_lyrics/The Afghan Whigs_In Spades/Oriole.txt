Oriole LyricsLight the candle
Lock the door, too
Draw the circle
I'll fall into you
Divination-
Cleromancy-
Comes the card that-
I refused to see
The was a violence In my head
I was surrounded In my bed
And from a slender perch
I vowed that I would fly forever
Flying
Flying
Flying
Through love, I wander
Seek my thunder
Slip my number
Undercover
Free at last
Cage burned
Cages burn
So true, unglued
Where and when no matter-
I will find you
Until then-
Hang on, hang on
So true, unglued
Where and when no matter-
I will find youEmbed
