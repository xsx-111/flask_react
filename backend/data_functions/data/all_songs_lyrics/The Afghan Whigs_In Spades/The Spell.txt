The Spell LyricsIt was sabotage until-
Dream transcended purpose
In time the revelator comes for thee
Who cut the demons down?
Laid bare to show you how-
One comes a distant memory
Play dead for a moment, child ...
I wanna go deep down-
To where my soul lets go
And take my fantasy
And lay it on the table
And are you gonna see the light?
Or are you gonna be the light?
I wanna free the light-
And lose control
And lose control
Here come flat top candy cane
He come slitherin' down again
If I'm on fire-
Then you best follow me home
If black is invisible, baby-
And fact indivisible, baby-
Be the light-
O, Iord
Free the light
O, lord
Day not wasted-
Dream not tasted
There's no faking lust this time
Be the light-
Free the light
-And so it goes
-And so it goesEmbed
