Copernicus LyricsNaked but for tears-
While the sky falls down
Panting for the rush-
Hissing thru the crowd
Waving at the wheels
But I can't slow down
I'm riding-
Riding thru your town-
So say what you got to say
Play, but you got to pay-
Heavy is the head-
But you wear no crown
Hang it In the sky
And step inside your dream
I know what I know
And with the lights down low
I'm riding-
Riding down your street
So say what you got to say
Play, but you got to pay-
She went to California
Painted in light
Til all the colors ran­-
Wild
You came to mesmerize her-
She came with consequences in her eyes-
In her eyes-
Deep in her eyes
Listen in the distance-
As the sky begins to fall
Raining down like crystalline
Apocalypse in thrall
Rolling under-
Torn asunder-
Blinded by it all
Once there was a way­-
Then you were goneEmbed
