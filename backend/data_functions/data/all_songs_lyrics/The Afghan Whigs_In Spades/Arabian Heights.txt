Arabian Heights LyricsRun-
Seek thy fear
All come down
Disappear
Don't be deceived
Be not blind
All fall down-
Under the weight of the world
I'll see you as-
You come a little bit closer
A silhouette-
Of what you don't wanna know
Breathe-
My desire
Make no sound
And we'll escape in each other
Throw a spider
On the corner of the dance floor
And a body on the sister with her head down
If it's quiet on the corner
Give em three part harmony
Ole!
But don't you cum when they call for me
Cuz they'll sit you down
And wanna know what you know
Then you'll swing on a string
If it breaks then you might feel better
Let the night decide
If you remain in this world
Run-
Taste your fear
They rely
On volunteers
Don't you cum when they call for me
Get around it, love
Don't let em know what you know
Hypnotize-
Synthesize-
Love is a lie
Like a hole in the sky
Then you dieEmbed
