Toy Automatic LyricsWhite light-
Conceit-
If I saw what you say that you see in me
Allez-
My Love
Too late-
My lie-
Had been cast to the dark side of-
Do or die
Allez-
My love-
My dear-
My love-
My tears
Too soon-
Too late-
Complete
And from way down deep inside
Like a wave I had crashed on the
Reason I-
Was there
My love-
My dear-
My love-
My tears-
Come see-
Tell me, is this real?
Everything I feel?
Tell me this is realEmbed
