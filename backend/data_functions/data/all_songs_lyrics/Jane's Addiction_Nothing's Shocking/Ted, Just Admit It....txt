Ted, Just Admit It... LyricsCamera got them images
Camera got them all
Nothing's shocking...
Showed me everybody
Naked and disfigured
Nothing's shocking...
And then he came
Now sister's
Not a virgin anymore
Her sex is violent...
The T.V.'s got them images
T.V.'s got them all
It's not shocking!
Every half an hour
Someone's captured and
The cop moves them along...
It's just like the show before
The news is
Just another show
With sex and violence...
Sex is violent...
Sex is violent...
Sex is violent...
Sex is violent...
Sex is violent...
Sex is violent...
Sex is violent!
I am the killer of people
You look like a meatball
I'll throw away your toothpick
And ask for your giveness
Because of this thing!
Because of this thing!
Because of this thing!
That's in me
Is it not in you?
Is it not your problem?
A baby to a mother...
You talk too much
To your scapegoat
That's what I say
He tells you everyone is stupid
That's what he thinks!
Snapshots
Make a girl look cheap
Like a tongue extended
A baby's to a mother
Sex is violent!
Sex is violent!
Sex is violent!
Sex is violent!Embed
