Ocean Size Lyrics
â€¦Three, four!

Wish I was ocean size
They cannot move you, man
No one tries
No one pulls you
Out from your hole
Like a tooth aching a jawbone
Oh

I was made with a heart of stone
To be broken with one hard blow, oh, oh, oh
I've seen the ocean break on the shore
Come together with no harm done

It ain't easy livin'

I want to be
As deep
As the ocean
Mother Ocean, yeah
Aah-aah
Aah-aah
Aah-aah

Mmm, aah-aah-aah
(Aah-aah-aah)

I want to be
As deep
As the ocean
Mother Ocean, yeah

Some people tell me home is up in the sky
In the sky, lives a spy-aye-aye
I wanna be more like the ocean
No talkin', man, all action
No talkin', man, all action
Suday, (Suday) sudoo (Sudoo)
Sudah-aah-aah
Suday, (Sudoo) sudoo (Sudoo)
Sudoo
Oh

Get up, hey
Get up, hey
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Aah, ooh1Embed
