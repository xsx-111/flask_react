Mountain Song Lyrics
Comin' down the mountain
One of many children
Everybody has
Their own opinion
Everybody has
Their own opinion
Holding it back
Hurts so bad
Jumped out of my flesh
And I said

Cash in!
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby!
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh!

I was comin' down the mountain
Met a child, man, she had pin eyes
We had the same opinion
Had the same opinion
She was holding it back
It hurts so bad
Jumping out of my flesh
And I said
You better cash in!
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby, yeah
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby!
Oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh!


Uh-uh, wow-wow-wow-yeah
Uh-uh, wow-wow-wow-yeah
Uh-uh, wow-wow-wow-yeah
Uh-uh, wow-wow-wow-yeah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah1Embed
