Pigs in Zen LyricsPig's in the mud
When he tires
Pig's in zen
Pig's in zen
Pig is nude
Unashamed
Pig's in zen
Pig's in zen
Talkin bout the pig
The pig
The pig - uh
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pig
Goddamned pig
Pig mounts sow
When he's wound
Pig's in zen
Pig's in zen
Pig eats shit
But only when he hungers
Pig's in zen
Pig's in zen
Talkin bout the pig
The pig
The pig - uh
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pig
Goddamned pig
Oh, I know about war
But I just wanna fuck
I know about pain and suffering and being cold
But I just wanna fuck
The pig is led to the slaughter
Pig is led to the slaughter
This he says
Is the price some pay
For a simple life
How he feels
That's proof for him
Pig's in zen
Talkin bout the pig
The pig
The pig
The pig
The pig
The pig
Goddamned pig
The pig - uh
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pigEmbed
