Idiots Rule Lyrics
I got a lie
A fat fucking lie
About a law
Idiots obey
They made it easy
Now cheaters have their way
You hi-di-ho's
You're living on your knees

Forget the rule!
Oh - idiots rule!

Now there's a time...
But I say none like now
There's a time
Where idiots are bound
If there's a pole
Planted in your back
Then you're a fixture
Not a man

Forget the rule!
Oh - idiots rule!
Forget the rule!
Oh - idiots rule!
Idiots!
Idiots rule!
You know that man
You hate?
You look more like him
Every day everyday
Hi-di-hoes!
2 good shoes
Won't save your soul
Idiots rule!
Idiots rule!Embed
