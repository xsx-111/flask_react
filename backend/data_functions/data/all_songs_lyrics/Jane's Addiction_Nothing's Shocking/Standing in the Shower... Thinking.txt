Standing in the Shower... Thinking Lyrics
Standing in the shower thinking
About what makes a man
An outlaw or a leader
I'm thinking about power...
The ways a man could use it
Or be destroyed by it
The water hits my neck
And I'm pissing on myself...

Standing
In the shower
Thinking...

Standing in the shower thinking
About a man I know don't like me
He don't like the place I'm headed
Same place he's headed
I know he'd beat me to it
If he could but he won't do it
But he would man
If he could...
And the water is piping hot..
The water is piping hot
It beats upon my neck
And I'm pissing on myself...
Standing
In the shower
Thinking...

Standing in the shower thinking
Is my woman afraid of me?
She's seen how far I've twisted
It's just cause I can trust her
And ever since we met
She understood so she let
Me twist her good...
I twist her good...
And the water is piping hot
The water is piping hot
It beats upon my neck
And I'm pissing on myself...

Standing
In the shower
