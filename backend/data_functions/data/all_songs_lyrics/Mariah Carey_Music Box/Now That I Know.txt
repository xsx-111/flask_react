Now That I Know Lyrics
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want (What you want)
I can be what you need (What you need)
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see (Finally)
This is not make-believe anymore

I never knew if I could believe in you
I thought I was just a diversion
And you were killing some time
My friends, they told me to leave you
They said you'd never ever ever be mine
But you gave me your love and you said I'm the one
You want for the rest of your life

Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want (What you want)
I can be what you need (What you need)
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see (Finally)
This is not make-believe anymore

I was afraid that it was all a masquerade
And that I was only a plaything
And you would leave me behind
But now I feel so secure
By your side, I can conquer the world
'Cause I gave you my love and I know you're the one
I want for the rest of my life
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want (What you want)
I can be what you need (What you need)
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make-believe anymore

Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need (What you need)
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make-believe anymore

I really feel it (So much love)
I really feel it (So much joy)
I really feel it (Sweet, sweet ecstasy)
I feel it
I really feel it (Oh baby)
I really feel it
'Cause you opened my eyes and I realized your love is real
It's for real
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want (What you want)
I can be what you need (What you need)
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make-believe anymore

Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need (What you need)
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see (Finally)
This is not make-believe anymoreEmbed
