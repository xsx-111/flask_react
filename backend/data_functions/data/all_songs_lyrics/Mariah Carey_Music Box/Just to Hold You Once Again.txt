Just to Hold You Once Again Lyrics
Do you know
How it feels
Lying here without you, baby?
You could never understand what's happening to me
So alone
Nothing's real
I just dream about you, baby
And forever wonder why you had to break free

Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

It's so hard
To believe
I don't have you right beside me
As I long to touch you, but you're out of my reach
And my heart doesn't feel
It's so very cold inside of me
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be
Oh, even though you're not my lover, baby
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

You were the only one (Only one)
That I allowed inside my heart
Now I'm just holding on
To something so far gone
Oh, where did I go wrong?

Even though you're not my lover, baby
And even though you're not my friend (Oh, no, no, no)
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
Just to hold you once again2Embed
