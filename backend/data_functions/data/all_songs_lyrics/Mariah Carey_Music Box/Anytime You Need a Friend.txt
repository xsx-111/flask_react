Anytime You Need a Friend Lyrics
If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember
To keep the faith
And love will be there
To light the way, yeah

Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright

When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember
You're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home, oh
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again (No, oh)
So don't you fear (No, no, no, no)
Even if you're miles away (Even if you're miles away)
I'm by your side
Don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright

If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly, oh
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever, baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go

Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
Never be alone again (No, no)
So don't you fear (Don't worry, don't fear, yeah)
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side (I'm with you wherever you are)
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here (Yeah, you know it's alright)
Never be alone again (Oh, woah)
So don't you fear (Don't never fear)
Even if you're miles away (Oh)
I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright (Yeah)
Anytime you need a friend (Anytime)
I will be here (Oh)
You'll never be alone again (You'll never be alone)
So don't you fear (You never will)
Even if you're miles away (Oh)
I'm by your side (I'm by your side)
Don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright (Yeah, yeah)
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here2Embed
