Run On Lyrics
Lord God Almighty, let me tell the news
My head got wet in midnight dew
Great God, I been down on my bended knees
Talking to a man from Galilee
Michael spoke and he sound so sweet
I thought I heard the shuffle of angels' feet
He put one hand upon my head
Great God Almighty, let me tell you what he said

To go tell that lonesome liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambling, rambling backslider
Tell them God Almighty gonna cut 'em down

You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging
Run on, children, for a long time
Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down

You might throw your rock, hide your hand
Work in the dark with your fellow men
Sure as God made the rich and poor
You're gonna reap just what you sow
You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging
Run on, children, for a long time
Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down
You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging
Run on, children, for a long time
Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down

Some people go to church just to signify
Trying to make a date with the neighbor's wife
Brothers, let me tell you just as sure as you're born
You better leave that woman alone

To go tell that lonesome liar
Go tell that midnight rider
Tell the gambling, rambling backslider
Tell them God Almighty gonna cut 'em down

You might run on for a long time
Run on, ducking and dodging
Run on, children, for a long time
Let me tell you God Almighty gonna cut you down3Embed
