Porcelain Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

In my dreams I'm dying all the time
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to lie
So this is goodbye?
This is goodbye...

Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright

Tell the truth, you've never wanted me (Hey, hey)
(Hey, woman, it’s alright) Tell me

In my dreams I'm jealous all the time
When I wake I'm going out of my mind
Going out of my mind

Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright
Hey, hey, hey, woman, it’s alright12Embed
