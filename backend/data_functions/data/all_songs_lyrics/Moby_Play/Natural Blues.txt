Natural Blues Lyrics
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Went down the hill
The other day
My soul got happy
And stayed all day
Went down the hill
The other day
My soul got happy
And stayed all day
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God

Went in the room
Didn't stay long
Looked on the bed
And brother was dead
Went in the room
Didn't stay long
Looked on the bed
And brother was dead

Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Oh lordy
Trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my troubles but God
Don't nobody know my troubles but God4Embed
