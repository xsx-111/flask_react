Metranil Vavin LyricsA child thats born in pain
Kicked from the fireside
Landing in obscurity
Ill cry again
Nine times Im bleeding In my purity
Metranil Dreams of becoming a neon
You dont even take him seriously
How am I going to get to heaven
When Im just balanced so precariously
Fame takes down his clohes
Looks for the smallest of inhabitants
Hell, I suppose
You know me
I wasnt built for elegance
Once I was pride
Lived in the sweetest dream of foolishness
Lines etvhed on my face
Seek a path that never
Begs its own redress
Listener:
He was a brave man
He was a brave man.Embed
