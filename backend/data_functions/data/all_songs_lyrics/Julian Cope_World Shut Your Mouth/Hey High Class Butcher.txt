Hey High Class Butcher LyricsOh, the living is easy
And the fighting is over
When the fighting is over
Should the living be easy?
Breakfast now on the saviour
With soldiers' tales of an infant
I see the flames in the distance
He bows his head as he tells me
When you carve your name in
My face, blue and gasping
Crave a higher attention
Oh, you shouldn't do that
Oh, the river is hostile
But I still try to cross there
And if I leave my cross there
Use my feet for a memory
When I turn my face to
The telltale horizon
I hear the screams that curdle soldiers' blood
Oh, you shouldn't do that
In the night, in my kitchen
I can hear my meat sighing
Saying, "Hey, high class butcher
Save our gifts from this culture
We were asked here for dinner
But which side of the table?
The side of beef, not the kitchen
Oh, you shouldn't do that"
Oh, the living is easy
Is the easy worth living?
Oh, the living is easy
Is the easy worth living?
Yes, it's also for giving
So forgive and forget it
It's no problem, you can't have itEmbed
