The Greatness and Perfection of Love Lyrics
The greatest imperfection is love, love, love
But I can’t keep the fire away
The greatest imperfection is love, love, love
But I can’t keep the fire away
Take your place
And take your time and that’s what matters
I can see
The contours in your face
Faith, and now
I think it’s time to sleep, sleep, sleep with me
Here’s something rather deep
You know, 
It’s only fair
They take away my light, I spend my time with you
What’s the matter with that rhyme
And who are you
To give my life so much meaning
I can’t stand so much meaning
Hold my hand, 'cause I’m not healing
I need to find a way ahead
