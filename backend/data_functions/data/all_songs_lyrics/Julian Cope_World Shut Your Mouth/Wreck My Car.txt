Wreck My Car LyricsDriving a car on my own
There isn't room for everyone
I like to drive alone
You can come, too, but don't tell everyone

Only you can wreck my heaven
Only you can wreck my car
Only you can wreck my heaven
Only you can wreck my car
Having a party at home
Secrets with you and you tell everyone
Death and Destruction come, too
Oh, there ain't nothing like a house party

Only you can wreck my heaven
Only you can wreck my home
Only you can wreck my heaven
Only you can wreck my home
It's not at all mysterious
I'm not a cardboard freak
You sit there so sacrosanct
While the rest of us just incinerateEmbed
