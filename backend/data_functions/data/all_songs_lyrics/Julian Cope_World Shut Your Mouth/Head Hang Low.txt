Head Hang Low LyricsAll is lost
In bright confusion
Once that loss
Was far away
Frightened man
In deep division
Frightened man
With head hang low
You may sit alone like me
But, please, dont be alone like me
My worlds very beautiful today
Patron saint
Of lost illusion
Come and paint
My world in grey
I am lost
With no companions
All are bowed
With head hang low
You may sit alone like me
But, please, dont be alone like me
My worlds very beautiful todayEmbed
