Quizmaster LyricsI hold on to beauty
If I lose my grip
I might fall
Wont you understand I didnt
Clean out my mind
Now witless is everyones goal
But one of my senses
Left in the night
And someone had painted
Hope on my shoulder
The panic I kept
On a shelf out of sight
Now, Im not siding with you
But theres not much I can do
Dont look to hard
You might find me
Curled up asleep on my floor
Oh, I must have been murdered
During the night
Someone painted around me at dawn
But when it comes times
To reach out and give
I may be a corpse
But I know what Im giving
So dont over-reach yourself
Unless youre prepared to fall
Down a mountainside of anger
Smear that stuff all over your face
But through the confusion
I see you
Practicing hard at your faith
Oh your uniforms muddy
But still I can see
The arrangement of stars underneath
But one of these two
Is not on my list
We cant expect to explore
Without explosion
All my ideals were
Destroyed in the flood
And what use where they anyway?
And when the mute get lucid, prayEmbed
