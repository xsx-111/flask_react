Sunshine Playroom LyricsThe sun in her hair
The sun in her eyes
There’s something that makes me
Want to go back
To go back
Calling me, calling, imploring me back
Pleading me, reasoning, have to look back
Haunting me, taunting me, hauling me back
Calling and calling me, have to attack
Oh mother, where to go
Now that I am leaving home
All the fears, anxieties
Are bottled up inside
And the sad, and the wondering
The tears I have to hide
The sun in her hair
The sun in her eyes
There’s something that makes me
Want to go back
To go back
Come along, children
The runaway train ran down the track
And she blew, she blewEmbed
