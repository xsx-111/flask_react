Lunatic and Fire-Pistol LyricsOh, my stars that fall like ashen memories amidst
The trees then burst like leper sunsets on the shore
In english town my sweetheart weeps, and how i
Would prefer to be counting sheep than fighting
In the war
Now lunatic and fire pistol deep into my brain
Once more into the breach, into the fray
Insane, i see the rough-house boys
Descend onto the green
The candle burns the hours that light the day
But now i am the undergrowth and still i would
Prefer to be leaving hell and travelling far away
In short, the village ignorants are plundering my town
ItÂ’s a savage heart that beats them on their way
So lunatic and fire your pistol deep into my brain
Once more into the breach, into the fray
Insane, i see the rough house-boys
Descend onto my green
The cande burns the hours that light the day
But safe in my uniform
In no other way
Cast out and destitute
Ridden once with violence
Now i decay
But long ago i had a friend, honey
And sound and fury was his game
With pure contempt for any picture , honey
Just dedication to the frame
No stomach for the fighting
No fear of cannon fire
So lunatic just fire your pistol thereEmbed
