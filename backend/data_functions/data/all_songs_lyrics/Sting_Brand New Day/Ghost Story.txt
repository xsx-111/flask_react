Ghost Story Lyrics
I watch the western sky, the sun is sinking
The geese are flying south, it sets me thinking
I did not miss you much, I did not suffer
What did not kill me just made me tougher
I feel the winter come, his icy sinews
Now in the firelight, the case continues
Another night in court, the same old trial
The same old questions asked, the same denial
The shadows close me round, like jury members
I look for answers in the fire's embers
Why was I missing then, that whole December?
I give my usual line: I don't remember
Another winter comes, his icy fingers creep
Into these bones of mine, these memories never sleep
And all these differences, a cloak I borrow
We kept our distances, why should it follow
That I must have loved you?
What is the force that binds the stars?
I wore this mask to hide my scars
What is the power that pulls the tide?
I never could find a place to hide
What moves the Earth around the sun?
What could I do but run and run and run?
Afraid to love, afraid to fail
A mast without a sail
The moon's a fingernail and slowly sinking
Another day begins and now I'm thinking
That this indifference was my invention
When everything I did sought your attention
You were my compass star, you were my measure
You were a pirate's map of buried treasure
If this was all correct, the last thing I'd expect
The prosecution rests, it's time that I confess:
I must have loved you
I must have loved you 1Embed
