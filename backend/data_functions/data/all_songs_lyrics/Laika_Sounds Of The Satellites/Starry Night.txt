Starry Night LyricsIt is night
And life moves
At a new pace
The air is still
The earth sleeps
We move with the grace
Of the moon sweeping
Through the clouds
It is night
And life moves
At a new pace
The air is still
The earth sleeps
We move with the grace
Of the moon sweeping
Through the clouds
One by one the stars
Break through
One by one the stars
Break through
One by one the stars
Break through
One by one the stars
Break through
One by one the stars
Break through
One by one the stars
Break through
One by one the starsEmbed
