Out of Sight and Snowblind LyricsI watch the lights on the ocean, I count the leaves on the trees
If it wasn't for your indecision there'd be nothing between you and me
I catch your eye, it's a showdown, anticipate your every move
Purposely find contradiction, escalate nothing to prove
I watch the lights on the ocean, I count the leaves on the trees
If it wasn't for your indecision there'd be nothing between you and me
Instants of calm fly by mocking all poking fun at a smile
She pulls a face in the mirror, lately it's just not our style
Losing control to stay under fighting and screaming down walls
Worry has made you a martyr washed up and left for the birds
I watch the lights on the ocean, I count the leaves on the trees
I watch the lights on the ocean, I count the leaves on the trees
I watch the lights on the ocean, I count the leaves on the trees
I watch the lights on the ocean, I count the leaves on the treesEmbed
