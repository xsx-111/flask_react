Blood and Bones (Moody Mix) LyricsWake up, girl, what's wrong with you
Blood and bones and black and blue
Blood and bones and black and blue
All these things I am for you, all these things I am for you
All these things I am for you, all these things I am for you
All these things I am for you, all these things I am for you
All these things I am for youEmbed
