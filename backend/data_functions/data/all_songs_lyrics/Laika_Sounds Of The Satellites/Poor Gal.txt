Poor Gal LyricsI'm a poor gal long way from home 'fore
I get to heaven got a way to roam
And when I get there gonna take off my shoes
Got nothin' now & nothin' to lose
All day long you heard me moan
You can tell my friends when I am gone
A dollar for some bacon a nickel for the lard
I'd like to buy some more but times are hard
You work me late, you work me soon
Sometimes you work me by the light of the moon
You work me late, you work me soon
Sometimes you work me by the light of the moon
Going to see my long haired babe
Got her a dress on the last pay day
Gonna treat her nice gonna treat her fine
Gonna take her home on the railroad line
Gonna treat her nice gonna treat her fine
Take her home on the railroad line
You work me late, you work me soon
Sometimes you work me by the light of the moon
You work me late, you work me soon
Sometimes you work me by the light of the moonEmbed
