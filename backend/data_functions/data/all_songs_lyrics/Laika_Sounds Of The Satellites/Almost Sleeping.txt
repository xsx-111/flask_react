Almost Sleeping LyricsI'm not talking anymore
All the skins of the words
Fell off in my hands
If I told you and showed you
You'd laugh
I'm not trying anymore
All my good intentions
Fell out of my hands
If I told you and showed you
You'd laugh
You're always right when I'm lonely
I can fake it so long only
Lose track of days
Whiling away
I don't have strength to get away
Lose track of days
Whiling away
I don't have strength
To get away
I thought it
Would be so easy
That I didn't need to worry
I'm safe inside your hands
Why'd I listen why'd I fall for that
You're always right when I'm lonely
I can take it so long only
You're always right when I'm lonely
I can take it so long only
I'm not talking anymore
All the skins of the words
Fell of in my hands
If I told you and showed you
You'd laugh
I'll stay all night when I'm lonely
I can fake it so long only
You're always right when I'm lonely
I can take it so long only
Lose track of days
Whiling away
I don't have strength
To get away
Lose track of days
Whiling away
I don't have strength
To get awayEmbed
