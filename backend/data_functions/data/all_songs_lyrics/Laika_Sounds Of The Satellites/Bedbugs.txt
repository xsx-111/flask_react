Bedbugs LyricsIt's gonna
Swallow me whole
The ground'll open up
And in I'll fall
Down down down
Mama set me up with a fine young thing
And he was gonna buy me everything
But he grabbed the hook
And took out for deep water
And pretty soon that fish
He pulled me in
It's gonna
Follow me home
Somewhere in the shadows there's a place for me
In the cold cold ground
Trouble's right behind me
There's hard times ahead
The devil's got his hammer
He's poundin' on my bed
Lost most my money
I'm on my last hand
I'm knockin' at hell's door with no weapon and no plan
Feelin' kinda timid like an egg without a shell
But if I've been just bluffing
I ain't gonna tell
It's gonna
Swallow me whole
The ground'll open up
And in I'll fall
Papa set me up
With a sharp-eyed boy
And I was gonna have him
For my toy
But he stole my heart
And took out for deep water
And pretty soon that shark
He pulled me in
Sky's full of lightening
The wind's spitting sand
Sun burning oh so hot it gave the earth a tan
The fish have all stopped jumping
The bedbugs are asleep
I'll lay myself beside you and pray my soul to keep
I wish I had a needle
As fine as I could sew
I'd stitch my baby to my side and down the road we'd go
My shovel struck sorrow
And the tears came running down
My shovel struck sorrow
And the tears came running down
My shovel struck sorrow
And the tears came running down
My shovel struck sorrow
And the tears came running down
Little fishes in the brook
Papa catch them with a hook
Brother clean it like a man
Mama fry it in the panEmbed
