Shut Off/Curl Up LyricsShut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
The best view from this window
Still looks like hell
And the fists they fall like rain
I know it just a little too well
Angel I've been beaten
Angel I'm a whore
I'm just a little bit older
Just a little less more and more
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
It's too long that I've stayed here
Too long that I've tried
Angel I'm so naked
I can't look you in the eye
Oh angel I'm exhausted
I think I'm a lie
I don't know how I got here
I just can't figure out why
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
In twenty-five years I'm silver
And in fifty gold
Angel I just can't imagine
What it's like to grow old
Angel there's no time left
Won't you give me strength
To meet you in a different life
To see you when this ends
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
Shut off and curl up
If it hurts push harder
The best view from this window
Still looks like hell
And the fists they fall like rain
I know it just a little too well
Angel I've been beaten
Angel I'm a whore
I'm just a little bit older
Just a little less more and moreEmbed
