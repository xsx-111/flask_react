Love Underlined Lyrics

Our love is underlined
'Cause she wants it all the time
And Jill Scott's a friend of mine
And Southern Hummingbird's a friend of mine

Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined

Our love is underlined
'Cause she wants it all the time
And Jill Scott's a friend of mine
And Southern Hummingbird's a friend of mine

And though I'm willing, babe
To go the whole way
We could never be in love
When you go, you're all I'm thinking of
With luck, I'll get you anyway
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined
Our love is underlined

That girl's no friend of mine

And it might be hard sometimes
Keep looking at me wide-eyed
While we're holding hands tonight
We're still in love underlined
And it might be hard sometimes
Keep looking at me wide-eyed
While we're holding hands tonight
We're still in love underlined
