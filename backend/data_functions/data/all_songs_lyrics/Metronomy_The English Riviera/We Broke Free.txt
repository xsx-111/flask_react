We Broke Free Lyrics
So get yourself fixed up
I'll take you out 'round town
I swear you'll never witness anything quite as fine

Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine

Where we're stood on this hill
I used to think of you
That one day we'd get together and here we'd climb

Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
Thank God the gold is mine
