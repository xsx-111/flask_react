Trouble Lyrics

I don't wanna go out
You don't wanna stay in
I guess we're gonna argue again
There's a tear in your eye
And there's no "I" in "team"
I guess we're gonna argue again, woah-oh-oh-oh

But what I do is always come back to you
My heart is oh, so true
But I might hurt you again
You know that it's true, I'm loving you
Oh no, not again, we're arguing

There's one thing causin' ya trouble
And girl, you're the one thing caught in between
They say your boyfriend lives in a bubble
But I'd let them in, yeah, I'd let them in

Darling, oh, darling
Darling, oh, darling
Darling, oh, darling
Darling, oh, darling
Oh, don't you know?
I love you so
I won't break you no more
Because our love's 
Ce n'est pas la mer à boire
, mais je ne suis partout voyons, ne t'en fais pas, oublions ça Et n'en parlons plus  ensemble; ensemble9Embed
