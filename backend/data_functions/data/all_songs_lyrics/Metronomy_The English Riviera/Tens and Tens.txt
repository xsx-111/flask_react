Tens and Tens Lyrics
Tens and tens and tens
We'll find you in the end
Everyone's not lost
And everyone's a friend, uh, hoo-oh
Uh, hoo-oh

Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round

Tens and tens and tens
Is what you'll have to spend
Everyone's not lost
And everyone's a friend, uh, hoo-oh

Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round
Pick up your stuff, I'll pick up mine
Never the last but the first time
Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round
I've got your back while you've got mine
Never the last but the first time

Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round
Pick up your stuff, I'll pick up mine
Never the last but the first time
Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round
I've got your back while you've got mine
Never the last but the first time
Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round
Pick up your stuff, I'll pick up mine
Never the last but the first time
Take the morning, take the sun
I'll keep coming 'round and 'round
I've got your back while you've got mine
Never the last but the first time
