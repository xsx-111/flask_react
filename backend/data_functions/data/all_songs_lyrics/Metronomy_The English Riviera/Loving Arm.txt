Loving Arm Lyrics
Heard baby's got the lovin' arm
I never get too close, I like to get results
Heard baby's got the lovin' arm
I never get too close, I'm flyin' down the coast to love
To love

Heard baby's got the lovin' arm
I never get too close, I like to get results
Heard her baby's got the lovin' arm
I never get too close, I'm gunnin' down the coast to love
To love

To love
To love


Heard baby's got the, heard baby's got the
Heard baby's got the, heard baby's got the
Heard baby's got the, heard baby's got the
Heard baby's got the, heard baby's got the
Heard baby's got the, heard baby's got the
Heard baby's got the, heard baby's got the
Lovin' armEmbed
