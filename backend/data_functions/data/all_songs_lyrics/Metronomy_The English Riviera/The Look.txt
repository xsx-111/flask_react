The Look Lyrics
You're up, but you'll get down
You're never running from this town
And I think you said
"You'll never get anything better than this
'Cause you're going 'round in circles
And everyone knows you're trouble"

'Cause you read it in a big book
And now you're giving me the look, look
But just remember how we shook, shook
And all the things we took, took
This town's the oldest friend of mine

We get up and we get down
We're always running 'round this town
And to think they said
We'd never make anything better than this
'Cause we're always in small circles
And everyone thinks we're trouble

We didn't read it in a big book
(We didn't read it in a big book, big book, big book)
And now we're giving you the look, look
(Giving you the look, ah, giving you the look, ah-ah)
But just remember how we shook, shook
(Shook, shook, shook, shook)
And all the things we took, took
(Took, took, took, took)
(This town, this town)
This town's the oldest friend of mine
This town, this town, this town
