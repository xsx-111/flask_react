Some Written Lyrics
I tried to catch you up but I'm too late
So as I finish up your lemonade

I'll send a message, some written, one sung
You left a number that's eight numbers long


I thought I did enough but that's my mistake
It's time to liven up your lemonade

I'll send a message, some written, one sung
You left a number that's eight numbers long


There's no gettin' over, so I'm done
I'll forget the number and I'm gone
There's no gettin' over, so I'm done
I'll forget the number and I'm gone
