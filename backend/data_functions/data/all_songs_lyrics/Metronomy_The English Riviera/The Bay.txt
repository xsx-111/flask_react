The Bay Lyrics
You may have the money but you've got to go
It's sensible, it's sensible
And those endless seasons that go on and on
Incredible

But I'd sooner get out, remember where we went last year?
You said everything about it moved on your career
If you want to go, I'll take you back one day
'Cause this isn't Paris, and this isn't London
And it's not Berlin, and it's not Hong Kong, not Tokyo
If you want to go, I'll take you back one day

It feels so good
In the bay
It feels so good
In the bay

You may have the body but do you have the soul?
Let's make this happen, let's make this happen
And those endless beaches that go on and on
It's magical
But I'd sooner get out, remember where we went last year?
You said everything about it moved on your career
And you said, "(If you) If you (Want to go) want to go (I'll take you back one day)"
'Cause this isn't Paris, and this isn't London
And it's not Berlin, and it's not Hong Kong, not Tokyo
If you want to go, I'll take you back one day

It feels so good
In the bay
It feels so good
In the bay
