Corinne Lyrics
Oh, Corinne
I've got a pain in my heart
I think it's because of you
'Cause they kicked me out of the forces
When I laid a hand on you

Oh, Corinne
I'd take this pain in my heart
For just one more night with you
If they'd let me back in the forces
And I could lay my hand on you

I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again

I've got-I've got
I've got my heart tied up, I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time
I've got my heart tied up, I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time
I've got my heart tied up, I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time
I've got my heart tied up, I've got my heart in a bind
She just wants to dance all the time

I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again
I've got my heart tied up now with a boom and a bang
I'm not gonna fire you again4Embed
