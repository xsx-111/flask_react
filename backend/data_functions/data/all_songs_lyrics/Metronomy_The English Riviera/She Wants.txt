She Wants Lyrics
She sleeps so soft, so soft I tread
Arranging papers around the bed
And if she's dreaming deep tonight
I lie with her by reading light
A glass of water by her side
And gone are hopes of getting tired

I call the shots 'til you wake up
Count every second on every clock
It’s getting late, and that I know
The hours come, the hours go

Them twitching legs, them twitching arms
And there you're lying, your make-up on
And girl, if you're dreaming deep tonight
I'll lie with you by reading light
A glass of water by your side
And gone are hopes of getting tired

I call the shots 'til you wake up
Count every second on every clock
It’s getting late, yeah that I know
The hours come, the hours come
The hours come, the hours come
The hours come, the hours come
The hours come, the hours come
The hours come, the hours come1Embed
