Ramon Casiano Lyrics
It all started with the border
And that's still where it is today
Someone killed Ramon Casiano
And the killer got away
Down by the Sister Cities river
Two boys with way more pride than sense
One would fall and one would prosper
Never forced to make amends

He became a border agent
And supplemented what he made
With creative deportation
And missing ammo by the case
Since Bullet ran the operation
There's hardly been a minute since
There ain't a massing at the border
From Chinese troops to terrorists

He had the makings of a leader
Of a certain kind of men
Who need to feel the world's against him
Out to get 'em if it can
Men whose trigger pull their fingers
Of men who'd rather fight than win
United in a revolution
Like in mind and like in skin

It all started with the border
And that's still where it is today
Down by the Sister Cities river
But for sure no one can say
The killing's been the bullet's business
Since back in 1931
Someone killed Ramon Casiano
And Ramon still ain't dead enough2Embed
