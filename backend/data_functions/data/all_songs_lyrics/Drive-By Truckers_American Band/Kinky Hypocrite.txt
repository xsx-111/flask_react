Kinky Hypocrite LyricsHot-blooded bible thumping cash on the barrel honey
Private jets and drunk CEOs
From Pentecostal denim to highfalutin linens
Empty pockets line the deepest egos
Its a tricky navigation from the wanting to the having
All the needs of a kinky hypocrite
The greatest separators of fools from their money
Party harder than they like to admit
Ain’t it always you know who’s boots
Scooting up a goose stepping rhythm to a simpler time
Quickest on the stick when the call of nature hits
Shuffle shoeing to a pissy Florsheim
Every slope is slippery with a little something lacy
Tween your business and your poly wool blend
The greatest separators of fools from their money
Party harder than they like to admit
Book tours, miracle cures
Affirmation and the end times immanence
Low hanging headline grabbing
Ringmasters with imaginary elephants
Condemnation all at once
Or making payments on a daily syndicated hissy fit
The greatest separators of fools from their money
Party harder than they like to admitEmbed
