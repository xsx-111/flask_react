Guns of Umpqua LyricsI see birds soaring through the clouds outside my window
Smell the fresh paint of a comfort shade on this new fall day
Feel the coffee surge through morning veins from half an hour ago
Hear the sound of shots and screams out in the hallway
Spent my last weekend camping out again down the road a ways
Just me and Joan and a couple of friends on this beautiful trail
Watched the sun slip down behind a mountain stream in these great Cascades
Saw a mighty hawk swoop down upon a stream to devour its prey
Now we’re moving chairs in some panic mode to barricade the doors
As my heart rate surges on adrenaline and nerves I feel I’ve been here before
I made it back from hell’s attack in some distant bloody war
Only to stare down hell back home
Outside my mind I wander freely past this rocky shore
Waves crash against the banks where Lewis and Clark explored
We’re all standing in the shadows of our noblest intentions of something more
Than being shot in a classroom in Oregon
It’s a morning like so many others with breakfast and birthdays
The sun burned the fog away, breeze blew the mist away
My friend Jack just had him a baby
I see birds soaring through the clouds
Outside my window today
Heaven’s calling my name from the hallway outside the door
Heaven’s calling my name from the hallway outside the doorEmbed
