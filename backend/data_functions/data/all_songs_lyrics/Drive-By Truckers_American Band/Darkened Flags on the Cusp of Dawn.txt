Darkened Flags on the Cusp of Dawn LyricsThe darkest nights we look upon
They smolder on the lawn
What we smite and bathe in light
And where we crawl out from
Draw the blood, accept the stain
Everyone looks upon
Darkened flags on the cusp of dawn
We should light out for the trees or the great beyond
Light out for the love of thee, we build our lives upon
Cast aside the hurtful things that bear the fruit of scorn
Darkened flags on the cusp of dawn
So youâ€™ve moved out from the city to horizons stretched out far
Beyond the pains and the reach of planes, chasing distant stars
The baggage that you take defines the things that you become
Darkened flags on the cusp of dawnEmbed
