XD-Data II LyricsI saw you XD-Data II
Scenes from a life
That I once knew
Sweet televised images of you
Smilin at me
That's how it used to be
When you show I just never know
So I hit record/start
To keep you where you are
These last days I've created ways
To make you appear with news I long to hear
Like you're comin back home again
In humanized form
(humanized form)
Home safe and warm
(home safe and warm)
In humanized form
(humanized form)
Home safe and warm
(home safe and warm)
In humanized form
(humanized form)
Home safe and warm
(home safe and warm)
In humanized form
(humanized form)
Home safe and warm
(home safe and warm)
(home)
(home)
(home safe and warm)Embed
