First Movement / Message Send LyricsSarah, can you hear me now?
My resonator's breaking down
I met your choir by the rocks
And we've agreed to bring you up whatever the cost
Sarah, released today
There were songs in the dreams and I heard them say
"Sarah, don't be afraid
Lest we fall once again"
It's happiness that matters anyway
It's happiness that matters anyway
It's happiness that matters anyway
