Wonder Why in L.A. Lyrics
I'd watch you prepping food for days
Then I'd pack and just go away
Shredding food on your small guitar
I laughed hard but now my mouth is dark

To live and die in L.A
I wonder why in L.A
To live and die in L.A
I wonder why in L.A

I want you to tell the truth today
Why you moved from Colorado to L.A
Plastered pools full of booze you laid
When it's gone I wonder where you'll wanna stay

To live and die in L.A
I wonder why in L.A
To live and die in L.A
I wonder why in L.AEmbed
