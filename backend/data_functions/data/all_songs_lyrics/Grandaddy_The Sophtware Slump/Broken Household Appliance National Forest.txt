Broken Household Appliance National Forest LyricsSit on the toaster like a rock
No need to worry about a shock
All of the microwaves are dead
Just like the salamander said
The refrigerators house the frogs
The conduit is the hollow log
Broken household appliance national forest
Air conditioners in the woods
Broken household appliance national forest
Mud and metal mixing good
Meadows resemble showroom floors
Owls fly out of oven doors
Stream banks are lined with vacuum bags
Flowers reside with filthy rags
A family of deer were happy that
The clearing looked like a laundry mat
Broken household appliance national forest
Air conditioners in the woods
Broken household appliance national forest
Mud and metal mixing goodEmbed
