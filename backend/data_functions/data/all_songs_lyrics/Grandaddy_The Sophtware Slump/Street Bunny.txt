Street Bunny LyricsIt's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
He doesn't hop hop hop around
He struts around
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
He doesn't sniff the ground
He spits on the ground
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
It's a street bunny
This bunny snaps at little kids
This bunny doesn't like lettuce
Hey there's a pond to piss
And a mallard duck with a tommy gunEmbed
