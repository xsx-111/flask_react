She-Deleter LyricsOh she-deleter
The wind in your teeth hurt
Her over and over
And over again
Now you stand in the dirt
Remembering a friend
She-deleter, she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
No more fucking she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
Go my fucking she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
She-deleter, she-deleter
No more fucking she-deleter
Oh she-deleter
The wind in your teeth hurt
Her over and over and over again
Mow you stand in the dirt
Remembering a friend
Oh she-deleter
The wind in your teeth hurt
Her over and over and over again
Mow you stand in the dirt
Remembering a friend
Oh she-deleter
The wind in your teeth hurt
Her over and over and over again
Mow you stand in the dirt
Remembering a friend
Oh she-deleter
The wind in your teeth hurt
Her over and over and over again
Mow you stand in the dirt
Remembering a friendEmbed
