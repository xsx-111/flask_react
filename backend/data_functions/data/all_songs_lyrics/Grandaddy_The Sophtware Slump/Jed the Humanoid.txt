Jed the Humanoid LyricsLast night something pretty bad happened
We lost a friend (we lost a friend)
All shocked and broken (all shocked and broken)
Shutdown, exploded (shutdown, exploded)
Jeddy 3 is what we first called him
Then it was Jed (then it was Jed)
Now Jeds systems dead (Jeds systems dead)
Therefore so's Jed (therefore so's Jed)
We assembled him in the kitchen
Made out of this end (made out of this and)
Made out of that end (made out of that and)
Whatever was at hand (whatever was at hand)
When we finished Jed we were so proud
We celebrated (we celebrated)
We congratulated (we congratulated)
At what we'd created (what we'd created)
Jed could run or walk, sing or talk and
Compile thoughts and (compile thoughts and)
Solve lots of problems (solve lots of problems)
We learned so much from him (learned so much from him)
A couple years went by something happened
We gave Jed less attention (gave less attention)
We had new inventions (had new inventions)
Left for conventions (left for conventions)
Jed had found booze and drank every drop
He fizzled and popped (He fizzled and popped)
He rattled and knocked (He rattled and knocked)
And finally he just stopped (And finally he just stopped)1Embed
