Miner at the Dial-a-View LyricsI found your house and I saw your car
But I've no idea where you are
From the dial-a-view
Tire scraps on the federal roads
Look like crash landed crows
From the dial-a-view
Hello, welcome to dial-a-view
To locate the area in which you wish to observe
You must program in the longitude and the latitude
For a closer, more detailed picture
Use either zoom or the micro-zoom controls
Good luck
I dream at night
Of going home someday
Somewhere so far away
So dream alright
I know it's going to take some time
I'm going home someday
Fifteen years is almost done
And I don't recognize anyone
From the dial-a-view
My home, my friends and you
I watch them fade but what can I do
From the dial-a-view
Hello, welcome to dial-a-view
To locate the area in which you wish to observe
You must program in the longitude and the latitude
For a closer, more detailed picture
Use either zoom or the micro-zoom controls
Good luck
I dream at night
Of going home someday
Somewhere so far away
So dream alright
I know it's going to take some time
I'm going home someday
I dream at night
Of going home someday
Somewhere so far away
So dream alright
I know it's going to take some time
I'm going home someday
I dream at night
Of going home someday
Somewhere so far away, yeah
So dream alright
I know it's going to take some time
I'm going home someday
