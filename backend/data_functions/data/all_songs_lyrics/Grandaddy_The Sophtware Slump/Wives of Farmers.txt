Wives of farmers know the power of a home cooked meal
Wives of farmers grow pretty flowers out in the yard
Wives of farmers know that life is sometimes hard
Wives of farmers decorate their homes with precision
Wives of farmers don't have time to watch television
Wives of farmers pick their kids up at the bus stop
Wives of farmers love their kids so they hug them and talk to them a lot
Wives of farmers like to go out Friday night for dinner
Wives of farmers always find a trusting baby sitter
Wives of farmers know their husbands don't always know what to say
Wives of farmers understand this and love them for who they are anywayEmbed
