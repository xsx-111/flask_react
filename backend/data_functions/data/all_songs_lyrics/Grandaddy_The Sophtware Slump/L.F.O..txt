L.F.O. LyricsLasting hopes for love will try again
Goodbye creatures, goodbye human friends
Orchestras on warships in the wind
If we don't reunite this time'
Will try again
Will try again
Will try again
Will try again
Lasting hopes for love will try again
Catalogue the awkward specimen
Stay and wave goodbyes as long as you can
If we don't reunite in time'
Will try again
Will try againEmbed
