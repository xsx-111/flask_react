Beautiful Ground (Original Cassette Tape Demo) Lyrics
You said I'd wake up dead drunk alone in the park
I called you a liar
But how right you were

AC TV land, 20 grand, bike to the bank
Shakes from the night before
Stare at the tiki floor

High school marriage ring keys are under the mats
Of all the houses here
But not the motels

I try to sing it funny like Beck, but it's bringing me down
Lower than ground
Beautiful ground


I try to sing it funny like Beck, but it's bringing me down
Lower than ground
Beautiful ground
Beautiful ground
You're plants and birds and rocks and thingsEmbed
