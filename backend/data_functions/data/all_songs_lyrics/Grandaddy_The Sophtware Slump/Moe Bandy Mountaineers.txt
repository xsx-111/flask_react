Moe Bandy Mountaineers LyricsThere was a case of old nasal spray I bought at a thrift store
I ain't left my place in twenty days and I can't get off the floor
Unlike moe bandy mountaineers
Bar stool mountain expiditioneers
I'm done with whiskey, wine, and beer
It's nasal spray from this day here
It seems I'm drunk on drip again
And as usual my head is spinning
Just so I can breathe some more
As usual I've gone too far
Unlike moe bandy mountaineers
Bar stool mountain climbing gear
I'm done with whiskey, wine, and beer
It's nasal spray from this day here
It's probably the fact that that box
Was out in the rain, the cold, and the hot
I guess that's probably why
It ends up getting me so high
Unlike moe bandy mountaineers
Mountain bar stool climbing hat
*drunk* It's nasal spray from this day here
Unlike moe bandy mountaineers
Chop down them corn cob fears
*high* It's nasal spray from this day here'
Day here'
I'm just gonna stay hereEmbed
