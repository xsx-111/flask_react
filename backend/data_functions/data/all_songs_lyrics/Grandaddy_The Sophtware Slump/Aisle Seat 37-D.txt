Aisle Seat 37-D LyricsMiles high, stalled above the sea
Aisle seat 37-D
The hard guys that are crying quietly
And the moms lost in shock will never see me
Sitting alone wearing headphones
Smiling slighty as we fall towards the sea
And i'm having a glass of red wine
Trying to find a picture of you
While everyone's going insane
I feel that i'm staying reasonably calm
Now the pilot's reciting a prayer
But i'm so not there
And i really don't care
Cause the picture of you i couldn't find
I finally found
So everything's fine
Yeah the picture of you i couldn't find
I finally found
So everything's fine
While faster we fall toward the sea
I'm okay cause you're with me
Here in 37-D
(i'm okay cause you're with me)
(i'm okay cause you're with me)
Here in 37-DEmbed
