Spike the Senses Lyrics
Every second of every minute of the day
I let my fancy play
And when the feeling strikes me
I deliquesce in the sky without waving goodbye

While contemplating a fractured pale cathedral wall
Death can't touch me at all
Let its rapacious fingers with venomous stingers try
I'd like to see them try

Try to find a way to spike the senses
Till everything goes white
Try to find a way to spike the senses
Till everything goes white
Try to find a way to spike the senses
Till everything goes white
Try to find a way to spike the senses

I had a vision of vinyl spiders in a cage
Now, I avoid the stage
'Cause though it was a trifle
I still can't stifle the fear that they might just reappear
Try to find a way to spike the senses
Till everything goes white
Try to find a way to spike the senses
Till everything goes white
Try to find a way to spike the senses
Till everything goes white
Try to find a way to spike the senses

Climbing, climbing, climbing
Never falling
If it was up to me, I'd freak the clouds
Let them fall and drip to the sea
I think the chemicals have done
Some evil thing to me1Embed
