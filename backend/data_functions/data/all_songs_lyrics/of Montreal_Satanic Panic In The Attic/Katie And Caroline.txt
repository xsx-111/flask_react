Katie And Caroline LyricsPrincesses Princesses
Princesses Princesses Princesses
Katie and Caroline are
Throwing a tea party from 8 to 9
Everyone is happy and feeling fine
Grammy and Pa will be there
Of course Nanna will be there too
Katie and Caroline are a mix
Of smiling flowers and sunshine
And are as clever as three foot miniature Einsteins
Uncles Nina and Gonzo love them
Of course Uncle Mouse does too
And one day you'll have real horsees to ride
And you'll never ever want to leave each other's side
Katie and Caroline never act
Real grouchy like a porcupine
They're the sweetest creatures yes a flawless design
You've made your mommies oh so happy
And your daddies oh so tooEmbed
