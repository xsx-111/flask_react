Baby, your magic is working
I lose control of myself whenever you are near me
I feel myself changing

From a guy too cynical for love
Into a blushing romantic
Oh, honey, I'd swim across the Atlantic
Just to be near to you, I'm hopping like a kangaroo

Baby, your magic is working
All of my friends think I'm mad
'Cause I talk of nothing but you, girl
How you've really changed me

From a guy thought too cynical for love
You've proven everyone wrong
Anywhere with you, girl, is where I belong
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason

Lately, I've been so happy
Just holding you and gazing into your eyes, like in a movie
You are a star, I mean a starlet
Listen, the night we met, I fell in love with you
Who'd have guessed, who'd have guessed?
I'm in love, I'm in love
How you've really changed me
From a guy thought too cynical for love
Suddenly, I feel as light as a butterfly
And wanting to give love another try
Everything is beautiful and you are the reason

Lately, I've been so happy
Just holding you and gazing into your eyes, like in a movie
You are a star, I mean a starlet
Listen, the night we met, I fell in love with you
Who'd have guessed, who'd have guessed?
I'm in love, I'm in love

Baby, your magic is working
My mirror's reflection is you
Looking cocky and smirking
Now your magic is working
Ooh, your magic is workingEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
