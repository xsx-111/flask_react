How Lester Lost His Wife Lyrics
First, there was the fable of the bull
Told by the picador
Then, an Orwellian raping of a virgin apple core

An apple core, an apple core, an apple
Core, an apple core, an apple

Next, our minds were supping up the horrors
That our vicious master's whip
Was serving us in rituals, nefariously hip

Wickedly hip, wickedly hip, wickedly
Hip, wickedly hip, wickedly

I had to don a disguise to see her
Sneaking through the snaking hallways to her chamber
I wasn't prepared to encounter the vision
Of she and it engaged in defiling of the sacred
In an instant, her face became so plaintive
And I watched as she transformed into the Black Amaranth
The Black Amaranth
The Black Amaranth
The Black Amaranth
The next morning, I spied
In a window framed in brass
The story of her condemnation
Portrayed in the stained glass

In the stained glass
In the stained glass, in the stained
Glass, in the stained glass, in the stained
GlassEmbed
