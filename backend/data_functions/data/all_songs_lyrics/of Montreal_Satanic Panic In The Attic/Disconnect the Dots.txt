Disconnect the Dots LyricsCome disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful
Ahh

Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
Come disconnect the dots with me, poppet
Come disconnect the dots
It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful, ah
It's so beautiful
Our lunacy
It's so beautiful, ah
