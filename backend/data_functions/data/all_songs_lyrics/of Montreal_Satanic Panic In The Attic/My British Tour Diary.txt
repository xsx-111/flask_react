My British Tour Diary Lyrics
On our trip to England, I noticed something obscene
People still actually give a shit about the Queen
Though London girls aren't snobs at all
And Brighton's lovely in the fall
Left alone to drive ourselves on the opposite side
Man, it was a miracle that nobody died
Hanging out with Steven, Drew
Theo, Paul and Sorrel, too

Eating at Welcome Breaks daily
We danced in Leeds with Brit Pop Haley

Performing with the Apples
And then crashing at the Wrights'
Bitching because Steven booked us on such early flights
Always in a foggy haze because we haven't slept for days
Every single one of our London cabbies played
The most truly repellent techno music ever made
But they'll drop you without hesitation if you try changing the station

Up to our necks in crisps and litter
In the van we dubbed the Gary Glitter
Oh yeah
I think I know...
I think I know what I need to say
Heart attack on the dance floor
Heart attack on the dance floor
Heart attack on the dance floor
Aquaman needs an antidepressant
Sorry, can I get one of those, please, please, please?Embed
