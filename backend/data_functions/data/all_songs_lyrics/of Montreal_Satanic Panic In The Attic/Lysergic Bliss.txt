Lysergic Bliss Lyrics
Wearing an olive drab
But feeling somehow inside opalescent
Wonder how I'm managing to smile
When I can't even pay my rent
Maybe it's because I've finally found
My little tulip, my Norge dear
Funny how in spite of all my woes
Life can appear rosy and clear
Rosy and clear

And I'm dizzy from her kiss
So vertiginous, lost in lysergic bliss
(Because it hurts me so bad)

Love the way you wear your curly hair
Sanguine and spiraling, tied in a bun
Love the way it falls about your face
Mercurially gilded by the sun
If we were a pair of jigsaw puzzle pieces
We would connect so perfectly
Creating a still photo of a scene
From the Phantom of Liberty
Of Liberty
And I'm dizzy from her kiss
So vertiginous, lost in lysergic bliss

(Okay, children, remember your breathing
One, two, three, four...)1Embed
