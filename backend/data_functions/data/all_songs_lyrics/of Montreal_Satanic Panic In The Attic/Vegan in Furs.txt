Vegan in Furs Lyrics
I used to think it glad, while at my country seat
Now I'm peaking in so many ways, the gloom is in retreat
Yeah, the dark epoch is over
I've found my Efeblum
Then passed Ernst's mausoleum, defended by a rook
Who shot a look so virulent, it pierced me like a hook
The palaver of solipsists, exploding in my skull

Yeah, and we both despise all of the academic swine
Who made the author of Discus Ulysses benign?

So what if Wednesday finds us
Wearing rabies parachutes?
Foaming like the melody of sea foam fairy flutes
The atmosphere is viscous, we're sticking to the brine

Yeah, and we both despise all of the academic swine
Who made the author of Discus Ulysses benign?

When the lanterns fill with finches, so begins the brawl
Their brains are like porcupines and mine's a paper ball
When the lanterns fill with finches, so begins the brawl
Their brains are like porcupines and mine's a paper ball
I know they don't understand
They don't get us at all
Their moss mangles polyanthus and mine's a paper ballEmbed
