Climb the Ladder Lyrics
When I'm caught in a net and I haven't a clue
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you

Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)

When there's ghosts in my coat and everything is askew
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you

Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)
Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)
Climb the ladder, oh, to you

All of these faces are crowding around me
Mouths open wide to devour
But they have no impact, no, I do not cower
Knowing I'm safe in your tower

When my pencil tip's broken and my brain is too
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you
Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)

When I feel like an oar in a sunken canoe
All I've got to do is climb the ladder to you

Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)
Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)
Climb the ladder, oh, to you

All of these faces are crowding around me
Like grey paint caked on a flower
But they have no impact, no value, no power
Knowing I'm safe in your tower

Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)
Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)
Climb the ladder (just climb the ladder)Embed
