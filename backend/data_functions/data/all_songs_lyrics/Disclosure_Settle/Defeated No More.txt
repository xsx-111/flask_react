Defeated No More Lyrics
Defeated no more
I just feel I let you go
Been cheated, I've been fooled
But in my heart I'm glowing gold

Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control

Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

Defeated no more
I stood and watched you take it all
I’m healing, I’m reborn
Now I'm shaking off the cold

Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I know you think you’re hurting but can you love?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think…
Can you love?

Defeated no more
I feel your shadow disappear
I've pleaded and I've fought
But now I know I'll make the rewards

Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I know you think you’re hurting but can you love?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think…
Can you love?9Embed
