Voices Lyrics
There are voices in my head
And my heart is trying hard to drown them out
I keep hearing what they say
They've enticed me into what they’re all about
Willpower slips away
And I’m weakening with every word they say
So I contemplate my fate
As I do, the whisper turns into a shout

You bring out the darkest side of me
Chased out from a place that I can’t reach
I would love to practice what I preach
But you bring out the darkest side of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me

Risking everything I had
I was keen to find the worst that I could do
Drove the sanity away
Brought destruction to the people that I knew
My head became a cage
I became a puppet on the stage
And even though we’re not okay
The feeling brings me pleasure all the same, all the same
You bring out the darkest side of me
Chased out from a place that I can’t reach
I would love to practice what I preach
But you bring out the darkest side of me

I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me
I tried to resist but you caught me
I tried to dismiss what you taught me4Embed
