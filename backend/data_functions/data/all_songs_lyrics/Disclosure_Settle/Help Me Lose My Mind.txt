Help Me Lose My Mind Lyrics
Talk to me, and watch me crumble
You will see me come undone
Faithfully I will look over
There I'll find what you've become
(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?

Jealousy will be washed over
Carefully we will come through
Could it be easy to start over?
Somehow I will bring you to
(What you've become)

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting, I've been waiting
Waiting, waiting

You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?
You help me lose my mind
And you bring me something I can't define
Help me lose my mind
Make me wonder what I felt before
Keep biding my time
How much longer have I been waiting for?26Embed
