Confess To Me Lyrics
I can help you run away for good
Overtake what you had understood
All it takes is a little understanding
After all, don’t question if I would

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you

I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you

I can take the low out of lonely
I can stop the sense of slowing down
Don't you lie but if you only tell me
I will help, just let me turn it around
(Turn it around)
(Turn it around)
Owning up to worry
No time left for me (no time left for me)
Owning up to worry
No time left for me (turn it around)
Owning up to worry (owning up to worry)
No time left for me (no time left for me)
Owning up to worry (owning up to worry)
No time left for me

Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you
Confess to me, make me feel it
Confide in me, don’t resent it
‘Cause I can stop you from nothing
I’ll fulfill your desires for you

I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you
I'll fulfill your desires for you3Embed
