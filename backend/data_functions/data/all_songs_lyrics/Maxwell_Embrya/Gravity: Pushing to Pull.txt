Gravity: Pushing to Pull Lyrics
All my days and all my nights and
Every hour is devoured
As the dawning strokes its morning
I'll be wanting, I'll be

Pushing to pull me closer to you dear
Deeper than gravity is how I must be near
I'll be hunting

As the moments drip like water
I'll be patient for my slaughter
As the dawning slays the evening
I'll be waiting, I'll be

Pushing to pull me closer to you dear
Deeper than gravity is how I must be near
I'll be hunting

And though you cause, my calling
And baby you know, i'm haunting
And though you smell, I'm crawling
And baby you taste, i'm stalking
You still ignore me watching every move babe
Every move babe, every move babe
And though you taste, I'm stalking
And though you smell, i'm crawling
And though you know, I'm haunting
And though you cause, my calling
You still ignore my atmosphere on you babe
On you babe, on you babe

And all my days, all my nights
Every hour is devoured
As the dawning strokes its morning
I'll be wanting, I'll be hunting

Pull me, I'll be watching
Pull me, I'll be wanting
Pull me, I'll be haunting
Pull me, I'll be nothing
Pull me, I'll be watching
Pull me, I'll be wanting
Pull me, I'll be haunting
Pull me, I'll be nothingEmbed
