Each Hour Each Second Each Minute Each Day: Of My Life Lyrics
How can I do wrong babe?
When right is where your heart is near with me
Featured in a song baby, you are my only source of melody
Baby, come on baby girl, come on
Come on
Keep it there 'till dawn baby
'Till comes the coming second, coming all on me, ooh

Do me 'till I'm done, do me 'till I'm done, do me 'till I'm done
'Till comes up the sun, moon goes where it's from
'Till the morning comes
Sideways, upside down, ceiling or the ground
'Till my lost is found
Eachhoureachsecondeachminuteeachday of my life baby
Each night of my life baby
All Right, all right, all right
Oh yeah, all right
Oh yeah, oh yeah

With every other breath baby, I drown
You always make the rain baby like sunshine
It's like I never ever doubted me
It's like I'm almost close to diggin' me
You made what I was missing baby
All mine
Keep doing it on and on
Do me 'till I'm done, do me 'till I'm done, do me 'till I'm done
'Till comes up the sun, moon goes where it's from
'Till the morning comes
Sideways, upside down, ceiling or the ground
'Till my lost is found

Each night of my life baby
Do me 'till I'm done, do me 'till I'm done, do me 'till I'm done
'Till comes up the sun, moon goes where it's from
