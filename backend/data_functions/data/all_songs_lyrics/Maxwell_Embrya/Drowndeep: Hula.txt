Drowndeep: Hula Lyrics
Confusing as this is
I hope my kiss can rectify
The lack of part time bliss
A weightlessness inside
Your life, your life, your life

Oohh waah, oohh waah
Let's drown deep in us
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Make no fight, no fuss
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Come drown deep in us
In us, in us, in us, in us
In us, in us

I'll wear your liquid kiss and watch as if inside
Dispel the negative as if a myth alive
Why should I let you...
Why should I let you go
Why should I let you go?
How could I let you...
How could I let you go
How could I let you go?
When we be up here all alone
Hula hula baby, babe
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Let's drown deep in us
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Make no fight, no fuss
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Come drown deep in us
In us, in us, in us, in us
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Let's drown deep in us
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Make no fight, no fuss
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Come drown deep in us
In us, in us, in us, in us


Oohh waah, oohh waah
Let's drown deep in us
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Make no fight, no fuss
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Come drown deep in us
In us, in us, in us, in us
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Let's drown deep in us
Was I let you go baby..
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Make no fight, no fuss
I can never live with baby
Oohh waah, oohh waah
Come drown deep in us
In us, in us, in us, in us
In us, in us
In us, in us2Embed
