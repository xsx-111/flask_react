Submerge: Til We Become the Sun Lyrics
Over to under
Enter your wonder, baby
Submerge into me, baby
And take me to higher

Submerge within the light
Illuminate my night
Let your atmosphere surround me
Submerge within the light all night
'Til we become the sun
'Til we become the sun

See if I'm breathing
'Cause I'm not sure tonight if I'm alive
Words are demeaning they can't describe
2x
Oh, my God
'Til we become the sun
Submerge within the light
Illuminate my night
Let your atmosphere surround me
Submerge within the light all night
'Til we
'Til we become the sun
3x
Submerge within the light all night
'Til we become the sun
'Til we become the sun2Embed
