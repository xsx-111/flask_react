Everwanting: To Want You To Want Lyrics
Lay all night here on top If you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?

Minus my negative
Change what I thought I would never
Spoke a kiss, verbal bliss
And I was made a much more better

'Cause where you touched, was such a no no
A blush filled plush, I loved it oh so
I love it oh so much, It's sweeter than candy
Could all this lust, be a symptom of you baby

Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want
Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want
Burn the cold, take the snow
Make July out of December
Light the night, in afterlife
And make this soul a much more better

Cause where you touched, how could you know?
A blush filled plush, I love it oh so much
Could all this lust, be a symptom of you baby

Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want
Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want


Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want
Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want
Lay all night here on top if you want to
I'm giving all I've got, every drop
Don't you want to?
Everwanting to want you to want
Everwanting to want you to want
Everwanting to want you to wantEmbed
