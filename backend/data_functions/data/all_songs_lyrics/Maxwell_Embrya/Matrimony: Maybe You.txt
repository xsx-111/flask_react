Matrimony: Maybe You Lyrics
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me

Maybe you may be the lady lady love
I'm prayin', dreamin', livin' and thinkin' of

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me

Teach me 'bout me
Tell me what you thought I thought you thought I thought
Use me drain me
Of all the things you want you know girl can't be bought

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me
Maybe you might be
Sweet matrimony
A one-derful-in-two a family

Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save me
Maybe you might be more than just a one night lady
Maybe you might be matrimony tryin' to save meEmbed
