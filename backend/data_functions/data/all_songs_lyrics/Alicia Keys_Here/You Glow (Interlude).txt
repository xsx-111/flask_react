You Glow (Interlude) LyricsAlicia: I heard this little girl in P.S. 257 yelled out one day to the teacher and said "That shit is whack!" And she stood up in the classroom and walked up from the back and stood in front of the classroom where her history was attacked and said, "You are not niggers. As a matter of fact you are not really even black. I'll prove it to you. I'll put every last one of y'all in a row, put some Vaseline and baby oil in your face and look in the mirror. Look my beloved, you glow."2Embed
