Illusion of Bliss Lyrics
You know, right now
I miss someone that I love
Or fell in love with
I don't wanna cry or nothing, but
I'ma just get straight to the story
I'm a twenty-nine year-old addict

What would you know? What would you do
If you had no control over what you pursue?
You talk yourself, tell yourself, "Baby, I'm better than this"
All that I'm fightin', I don't wanna resist

And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an iIlusion of bliss, hey

Live in prison of blood and flesh
An easy way out is this high, I confess
So what you lookin' at? What you wanna say?
You can't save me, baby
I don't want it no way
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss
And so it persists like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an iIlusion of bliss, ah

See, my life ain't no easy road
I don't know which way to go
Won't somebody see me when I can't see myself?
Won't somebody listen before I need help?
I'm sick of being judged, sick of being sick
Tell me, where's the love?
Tired of bein' tricked
Sick of bein' high, sick of being low
Sick of all the lies, puttin' on a show
And so it persists, and so it persists
Like a bottomless kiss
An illusion of bliss, an illusion of bliss

I don't wanna be a fallen angel
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm gone, gone
I don't wanna be a fallen angel
Don't say I'm lost, lost
I don't wanna be a fallen angel9Embed
