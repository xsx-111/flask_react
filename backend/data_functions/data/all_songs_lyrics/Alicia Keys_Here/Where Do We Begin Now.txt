Where Do We Begin Now Lyrics
What they gon do 'cause we the same sex?
And we spendin' all this time
This could be the love we ain't made yet
Even though it's on my mind
We ain't even had the conversation
But do you wanna testify?

Oh-oh
How many know this love song?
How many times it goes wrong?
Goes wrong

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
What we tell our friends now?

I had a dream about you last night
Then it kinda blow my mind
All I really know is that it feels right
And I gotta live my life
We ain't even had the conversation
Let me be the first to testify
Oh-oh
How many know this love song?
And how many times it goes wrong?
Goes wrong

Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Where do we begin now?
What we tell our friends now?

I gotta let you know, gotta let you know
I gotta let you know
I gotta let you know, gotta let you know
I gotta let you know1Embed
