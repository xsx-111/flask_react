Kill Your Mama Lyrics
Come on
Feel me
Yes

Shame on us, all your sons and your daughters
Thieve all your gold and we poison all your waters
Every piece of our soul is for sale, now they bought us
Think we know it all, then look where it got us

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind (Uh)

Tryna play God, we been fuckin' with genetics
All that you have given and we only disrespect it
The rate that we're goin', premature Armageddon
That's what gonna happen if we let it

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind, mm
Is there any savin' us?
We've become so dangerous
Is there any change in us?
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama?
When only mama's gonna love you to the grave

Killin' ourselves, fallin' down with the sickness
Money is the king, it's a dirty bloody business
There will be no trial, but the child will always witness
If we're in love with Hell, why the hell would Heaven visit?

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
We're cryin' to the wind

When mama gets the belt, you gon' wish we didn't do it
Had your chance for redemption, but you fuckin' blew it
Now the weather's changin' and the hurricane is movin'
Right in your direction, what direction are you choosin'?

Oh, mama, mama
Oh, mama, mama
Forgive us for your pain
Is there any savin' us?
We've become so dangerous
Is there any changin' us?
Even for the sake of love
How you gonna kill your mama?
When only mama's gonna love you to the grave?

How you gonna kill your mama? Oh
How you gonna kill your mama? Oh
