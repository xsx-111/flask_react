Pawn It All Lyrics
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah
Yeah, ah

I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again

Sometimes you gotta let it go
Just to make it possible
Sometimes you gotta do it, be willin' to lose it
Freedom has no price, you know
Thinkin', "How we gonna make it now?
How we gonna feed the babies now?"
We gon' make it through it
God gon' see to it
Just get up and do it now

I would pawn you my watch (Hey)
I would pawn you my chain (Hey)
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring (I would pawn you this golden diamond)
'Cause I need it so bad (So bad)
I would give you everything (Yeah)
Just so I could start my life over again (So I could start all over)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up

See, I learned the hard way
Now I'm doin' it in my way (My way)
'Cause life is too short to fall in New York
Can't get up and get away
So I gotta let it all go
Start back from zero
'Cause I give it up, I don't give a fuck
'Cause love is my hero

I would pawn you my watch (Hey)
I would pawn you my chain (My chain)
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring (Pawn you this golden ring)
'Cause I need it so bad (So bad)
I would give you everything (Everything)
Just so I could start my life over again (I can start all over)
I would pawn you my watch
I would pawn you my chain
I would pawn you this golden diamond ring
'Cause I need it so bad
I would give you everything
Just so I could start my life over again
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up (Hey)
Get on up

(So bad, hey-ayy)
(Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh, uh)
(Ayy, ayy)6Embed
