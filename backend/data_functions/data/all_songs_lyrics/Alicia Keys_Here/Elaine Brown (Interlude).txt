Elaine Brown (Interlude) LyricsOkay, can I do one more? It's really quick. So he said, "Blow black mother, black mother." He always announce the title and say, "black mother." This is rap, this is hip hop, this is all that, from the street. Poetry from the street
Black mother, I must confess that I still breathe
Though you are not yet free
What could justify my crying start
Forgive my coward's heart
But blame me not the sheepish me
While I be sleeping in a deep-deep sleep
And I be hazed and dazed and
Vipers fester in my hair
Black mother, I curse your drudging years
The rapes and heart-breaks, sweat and tears
But I swear on siege night dark and gloom
A rose I'll wear to honor you, and when I fall
The rose in hand
You'll be free and I a man
For slave of natural death who dies
Can't balance out to two dead flies
I'd rather be without the shame
A bullet lodged within my brain, black mother1Embed
