Take What You Need LyricsTake my hand sweet darlin' wipe that frown off your face
I don't love anyone but you no one can take your place but
Sometimes I worry darlin' the way you seem to hoard my love
Just take what you need, don't empty out the store
Just take what you need 'cause I ain't got much more
Took a stroll in the country, some peace of mind to find
Wire fences everywhere, no place to rest my mind
Seems like a shame to me the way some people hoard their land
Just take what you need, don't empty out the store
Just take what you need 'cause I ain't got much
Took a look in the paper While tryin' to eat a bite
You know I read the evening news and lost my appetite
Some have the nerve to ask for more respect from you and me
Just take what you need, don't empty out the store
Just take what you need 'cause I ain't got much
Take my hand sweet darlin' wipe that frown off your face
I don't love anyone but you no one can take your place but
Sometimes I worry darlin' the way you seem to hoard my love
Just take what you need, don't empty out the store
Just take what you need 'cause I ain't got muchEmbed
