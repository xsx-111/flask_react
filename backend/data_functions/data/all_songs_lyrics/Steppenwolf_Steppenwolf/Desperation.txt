Desperation LyricsWhen rain drops fall and you feel low
Ah, do you ever think it's useless
Do you feel like letting go
Do you ever sit and do you wonder
Will the world ever change
And just how long will it take
To have it all rearranged
Tell me why these things are still the same
Tell me why no one can seem to learn from mistakes
Take my hand if you don't know where you're goin'
I'll understand, I've lost the way myself
Oh, don't take that old road it leads to nowhere
We must return before the clock strikes twelve
It's so easy to do nothin'
When you're busy night and day
Take a step in one direction
And take a step the other way
So don't quit tryin' when you stumble
Don't give up should you fall
Keep on searchin' for the passway
That will lead you through the wall
Don't look back or you'll be left behind
Don't look back or you will never find peace of mind2Embed
