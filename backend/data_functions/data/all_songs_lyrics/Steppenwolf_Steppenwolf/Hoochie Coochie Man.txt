Hoochie Coochie Man Lyrics
The gypsy woman told my mama
On the day I was born
Oh, you got a boy child comin'
Oh Lord, he's gonna be a son of a gun
He's gonna make those pretty women
You know, he's gonna make 'em jump and shout
The whole wide world gonna wonder
What it's all about

Yeah, you know I'm here
And everybody knows I'm here
I'm your Hoochie Coochie man
Oh Lord, Everybody knows I'm here

I got a black cat bone
Lord I got a mojo too
I got little John, the conquered
Oh baby, I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna grab those pretty women
I'm gonna grab 'em by the hand
You know, the whole wide world gonna know
Oh Lord, I'm your Hoochie Coochie man
Yes, you know I'm here
Everybody knows I'm here
Yes, I'm your
Mmmmhhh-hmmmm
Ouuhh-huuuhhh
Aw, yeah, don'tcha


On the seventh hour
Oh Lord, on the seventh day
I tell you on the seventh month, child
Hey, the seven doctors say
Now he was born for luck
I said, baby, don't you see
I got seven hundred dollars, darlin'
Don't you mess with me

Because I'm here
Everybody, everybody knows I'm here
I'm your Hoochie Coochie man
Hey, I tell you, everybody knows I'm here1Embed
