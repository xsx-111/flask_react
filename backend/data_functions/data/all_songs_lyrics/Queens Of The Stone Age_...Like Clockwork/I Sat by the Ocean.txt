I Sat by the Ocean Lyrics
I sat by the ocean
And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard
Yet, I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in crying
It doesn't change anything
So, baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize
Maybe I don’t need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, "Boy, if you want love
You'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are
Are you sure it's really you?"
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips
Because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view
Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night
You, me and a lie
Silence is closer, we’re passing ships in the night
Into the light, left with nowhere to hide

Closer and closer, we’re crashing ships in the night23Embed
