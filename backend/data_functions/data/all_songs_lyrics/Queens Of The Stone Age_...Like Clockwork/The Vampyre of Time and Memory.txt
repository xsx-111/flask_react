The Vampyre of Time and Memory Lyrics
I want God to come
And take me home
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me?
Who am I supposed to be?
Not exactly sure anymore
Where's this going to?
Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

Ain't no confusion here
It is as I've feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable
Is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all
Is far behind
The vampire of time and memories
Has died, I've survived
I speak, I breathe
I'm incomplete
I'm alive, hooray
You're wrong again 'cause I feel no love
Does anyone ever get this right?


Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love
I feel no love17Embed
