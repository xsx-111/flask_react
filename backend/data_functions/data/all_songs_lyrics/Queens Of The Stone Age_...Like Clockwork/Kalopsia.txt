Kalopsia Lyrics
I never lie
To myself tonight
Rose-tinted eyes
Color my sorrow
A shade of wine

Bye-bye, black balloon
See you real soon
Wave bye-bye (Bye-bye)

Oh, why you so sad?
What have they done?
Forget those mindless baboons
They're off playing God
Copycats in cheap suits
Are playing it safe
While cannibals of bad news
Consume a parade

Is it wonderful?
Kalopsia, kalopsia
Kalopsia
Kalopsia, kalopsia
Far, far from shore
The land of nightmares
Gone forever more
And I love you more
Than I can control

I don't even try
Why would I?

Oh, why the long face?
You've got it all wrong
Forget the rat in the race
We'll choke chain them all
Fates favor the ones
Who help themselves
The rest feel the sting of the lash
As they row (As they row)
The boat (The boat)
To Hell, to Hell
