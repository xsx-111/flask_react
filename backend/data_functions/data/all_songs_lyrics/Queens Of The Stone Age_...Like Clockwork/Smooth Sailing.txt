Smooth Sailing Lyrics
Ah!
Oh, yeah

It's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
I got nothing to lose and only one way up
I'm burnin' bridges, I destroy the mirage
All visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out

I got bruises and hickeys, stitches and scars
Got my own theme music, plays whenever I yawn
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything
I'm in flagrante
In every way
Every day

It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
That needs getting done
Well, God only knows one long vacation
If reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it
(It's so easy to see) Yet so hard to find
Make a mountain of a molehill, if, if the molehill is mine

I hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
I blow my load over the status quo, here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance
I'm risking it all-ways, no second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailing
From here on out
I'm gon' do the damage
'Til the damage is done

Well, God only knows, so mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions of your loaded savior
(Every temple needs gold) Every hook needs to shine
Hell is at the temple of the closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind
Closed blinds
(Ah, shut up, shut up)
It's all smooth sailing
From here on out
Oh, shut up
Oh, ooh
Pow!11Embed
