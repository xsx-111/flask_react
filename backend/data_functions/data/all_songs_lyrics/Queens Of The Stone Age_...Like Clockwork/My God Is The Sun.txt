My God Is The Sun Lyrics
Far beyond the desert road
Where everything ends up
So good, the empty space
Mental erase, forgive, forgot

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Heal them with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the sun

Well, I don't know what time it was
I don't wear a watch
So good to be an ant who crawls
Atop a spinning rock
(Beyond)

Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Heal them with fire from above
Kneeling, my god is the sun
Yeah
Heal them, like fire from a gun
Kneeling, my god is the Sun
Healing, kneeling
Godless heathens
Godless heathens
Always want from the sky17Embed
