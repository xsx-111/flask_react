If I Had a Tail Lyrics
Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
I'm machine, obsolete
The land of the free lobotomy
I wanna suck, I wanna lick
I wanna cry and I wanna spit
Tears of pleasure, tears of pain
They trickle down your face the same
It's how you look, not how you feel
A city of glass with no heart

If I had a tail, I'd own the night
If I had a tail, I'd swat the flies
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Yeah, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

Gitchy, gitchy, ooh la-la
Do run-run, you won't get far
Animals in the midnight zone
When you own the world, you're always home
Get your hands dirty, roll up them sleeves
Brainwashed or true believers
Buy flash cars, diamond rings
Expensive holes to bury things
I'm machine, I'm obsolete
In the land of the free immortality
If I had a tail, I'd own the flies
If I had a tail, I'd swat the flies
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-ah-oh-ah, oh-oh

Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ah-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

(Uh-uh-uh-uh) See me dancing on the scars?
(Uh-uh-uh-uh) See me dance?
Ah-ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

If I had a tail, I will control the night
If I had a tail, I will control the night
(If I had a tail, I will control the night)
If I had a tail, I will control the night
(When we have a tail, we will control)27Embed
