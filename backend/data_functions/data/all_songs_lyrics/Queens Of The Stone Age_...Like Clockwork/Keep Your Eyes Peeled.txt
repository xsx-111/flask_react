Keep Your Eyes Peeled Lyrics
Don't look, just keep your eyes peeled
Thoughtless, traipsing a minefield
Shotgun, never behind the wheel (Anymore)
Danger, monsters in smoke and mirror
Slowly, can one so lost be found?

Well, I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Then wake me up

Fallen leaves realize they are no friend of autumn
The view from Hell is blue sky
So ominously blue
Daydream until all the blue is gone

Well, I know you'll never believe
I play as though I'm alright
If life is but a dream
Wake me

Underwater is another life
Disregarding every myth we write
Rag doll churning, eagerly alive
(Over and over and gasping in horror
So breathless you surface
And just as the next wave hits)
Big smile, really a show of teeth
Without a care in a world, no fear
Lonely, you don't know how I feel
Praise God, nothing is as it seems11Embed
