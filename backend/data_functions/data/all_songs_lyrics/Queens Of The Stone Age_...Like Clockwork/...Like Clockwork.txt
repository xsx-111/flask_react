...Like Clockwork Lyrics
Everyone, it seems
Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see, my dear
Is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here

The love line in your hand
Cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone
Crumble in the light
Most of what you see, my dear
Is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Holding on too long is just
A fear of what to show
Because not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
Not everything that goes around
Comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear
It's all downhill from here18Embed
