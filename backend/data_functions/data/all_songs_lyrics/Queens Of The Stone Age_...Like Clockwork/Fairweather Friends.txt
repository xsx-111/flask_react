Fairweather Friends Lyrics
Is there anyone out there?
Or am I walking alone?
When I turned around and found that you'd gone
Before the first rain could fall

It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true
Well, it ain't so long before the dawn
When the sun is gone, well, so are
Well, so are you

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)
Fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)

One day, when we're far away
From everything that hurts
Drink wine and screw is all we'll do
Every day (Yeah)

So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed?
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends (Fairweather friends)
You know the hour's late (You're under blue sky)
Don't let 'em in your head (Fairweather friends) (You're under)
I'm gonna pray for rain again and again
Fairweather friends
Fairweather friends

Fairweâ€“
I don't give a shit about them anyhow14Embed
