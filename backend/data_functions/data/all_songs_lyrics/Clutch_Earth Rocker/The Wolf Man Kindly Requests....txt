The Wolf Man Kindly Requests... LyricsAll right!
You wanna know my political persuasion?
Well, sugar, I howl at the moon
At the moon - can you dig it?
Would you like some more information?
There´s a buzzkiller in the room
In the room - can you dig it?
Party´s over you all gotta go
The wolfman is coming out
Party´s over you all gotta go
The sooner the better
The wolfman is coming out
Let me tell you about my strategy
I sense my fire?
Drop me again, drop me again -
I think you know what I´m talking about!
Yeah!
Your ma told you not to come but you´re here to find out
Girl you shoud´ve listened
Your pa bid you not to come but you´re here to find out
Well, now you know!
Well, now you know!
I swear it´s not you - I promise it´s me
When the sun goes down - I tend to lunacy?
I swear it´s not you - I promise it´s me
When the sun goes down - I tend to lunacy?
Yeah!
So many people tell me my mind is a ghetto
Obviously they´ve been gentrified
Gentrified - and I got no time for that!Embed
