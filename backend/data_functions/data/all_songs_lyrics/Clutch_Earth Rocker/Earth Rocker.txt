Earth Rocker LyricsWhat's this about limits?
Sorry, I don't know none
What's this about some DB limit?
Sorry, I can't hear none
You can take a little cruise down the river of booze
Act all poor and defeated
Shout to the mountain some boo-hoo blues
But I'll stand here and repeat it:
I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody hear me now?
I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody get the message?
If you're gonna do it
Do it live on stage, or don't do it at all
If you're gonna do it
You better take it to the stage, or don't do it at all
I will suffer no evil
My guitar will guide me through
I will suffer no evil
And this time, I want to hear it from you
I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody hear me now?
I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody get the message?
Break it down
To brass tacks
Break it down
To just the facts
I don't need your stinkin' laminate
I don't need your VIP
I don't need your validation
Cause I wear mine on my sleeve
Don't look to me for answers
Cause I don't got-a-one
I just came to have a good time
And I'm gonna have one
Yes, I've lost many battles
And even more days
But if I had to do it over
I'd do it just the same
Cause I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody hear me now?
I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody get the message?
I'm an earth rocker!
Understand?
I'm an earth rocker!
Everybody get the message?1Embed
