Mr.Freedom LyricsPhantoms of the second civil war
You gather them around
And every time you open up your mouth
A load of horseshit comes flying right back out
Flying right back out
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Serious business on your lapel
Let the people, know how you feel
And every bumper sticker on the back of your car
Makes you feel a little more real
A little more real
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you BUT NO!
I bet you would like nothing better
Than for the shit to hit the fan
And from the safety of your arm chair
Properly lay those plans that no one else but you can possibly understand
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Thanks for thinking of me
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much but no
That’s mighty kind of you
Mr. Freedom big time talker, oh but thank you very much…but noEmbed
