Unto The Breach LyricsThe burden of a time lord is there's never any time
Too much of eternity and nowhere to unwind
Hobgoblins and morrismen fighting in the streets
Hot continuum breakdown give them lightning!
Waiting on the corner for the Swiss guard to arrive...to arrive
And when they do we'll battle them and rattle them
Halberd versus mind versus mind
Once more unto the breach!
Like the Gutenberg Bible, we're the moveable type
Very transient, very influential
Like the large hadron collider, the more you see the less you understand
The atmosphere's getting volatile
Waiting on the corner for the Swiss guard to arrive...to arrive
And when they do we'll battle them and rattle them
Halberd versus mind versus mind
Once more unto the breach!
Dalek goon squad. Black shirt master
Hit 'em where it hurts
Full on psychic blaster. Plague doctors and subhumans
Can you feel the heat?
The atmosphere's getting hectic
The atmosphere's getting volatile
Waiting on the corner for the Swiss guard to arrive...to arrive
And when they do we'll battle them and rattle them
Halberd versus mind versus mind
Once more unto the breach!
Once more unto the breach!
Once more unto the breach!Embed
