Oh, Isabella LyricsRatted out in Hades
Forced to return
To rockville
With nothing but a rucksack
Hard lesson learned
Foul council of leeches
Want silence in Bedlam
Take refuge
And a dagger to the bite
Then suck out the venom
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar and fever
Have taken your men
Running on the tightrope
Woven by spider
While the canyon
Teeming with shoppers
Grows wider and wider
What demon's possessing
The clock and the compass
Surrender
Run headlong to the void
The reptile's among us
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar and fever
Have taken your men
Chained to the ox cart
With a chest full of arrows
The villages
Are burdened with cedar
By bag and by barrow
Scrub brush from the wasteland
Snake in a tree
Remember
When they throw the torches in
Breathe, breathe, breathe
Oh Isabella
Your ship's run aground
Kneel at the sword
Scream at the clouds
Oh Isabella
There's smoke on the wind
Jaguar and fever
Have taken your menEmbed
