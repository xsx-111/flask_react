Book, Saddle and Go LyricsI may not got a lot of money
But I got self-esteem
And in the golden age of travel
That’s really all you need
I know I’m ugly, honey
But look where I’m coming from
I got a pony down state
And that pony born to run
Book, saddle and go
Hey, that’s the name of the game
Book, saddle and go
Canned heat, that’s the name of the game
They call me the robber
Highwayman
Don’t wanna hurt nobody
Just doing what I can
The galley after hours
Man the captain just won’t listen
“If you don’t turn this boat around
I’m gonna kick the damn doors in”
Book, saddle and go
Hey, that’s the name of the game
Book, saddle and go
Canned heat, that’s the name of the game
Pinkerton man, murdering bastard
I’m gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with you
You can take that my violin
And play it all you please
For at this time tomorrow
Well it’ll be of no use to me
I know they’re gonna hang me
Tomorrow I’ll be dead
Though I never even harmed a hair
On anybody’s head
Book, saddle and go
Hey, that’s the name of the game
Book, saddle and go
Canned heat, that’s the name of the game
Pinkerton man, murdering bastard
I’m gonna get even, get even with you
Get even with youEmbed
