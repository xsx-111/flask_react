The Face LyricsThey arrive on a sunny day
Offering the residents a better way
Before you know it you're in line
And chanting refrain
They reel you in and then they drown you out
First they tell ya
You're gonna lose your soul
And then they tell ya
Find another home
And then you take a good look around
And they stole your rock and roll
And once it's gone you'll never get it back
One thousand Les Pauls
Burning in a field
What rabid religion
Poisons their minds?
One thousand Jazzmasters
Thrown into the sea
What measure of madness
Governs their time?
Alright
In the beginning
There was void
The hand woke up
Then there was noise
Fire and water
Heaven and stone
Radio kings
Hammer and throne
One thousand Les Pauls
Smoulder in a field
What measure of madness
Fastens their hearts?
One thousand Jazzmasters
Sunk down to the bottom of the sea
What rabid religion
Drives them apart?
In the beginning
There was void
The face woke up
Then there was noise
Fire and water
Heaven and stone
Radio kings
Hammer and throne
Uncounted Les Pauls
Are sainted to the sky
Where there was darkness
Now only light
Uncounted Jazzmasters
Rising up from the bottom of the sea
The wicked are nought
The righteous are free
Uncounted Les Pauls
Explode and take flight
Where there was darkness
Now only light
Uncounted Jazzmasters
Are rocking from the bottom of the sea
The wicked are nought
The righteous are freeEmbed
