Cyborg Bette LyricsCyborg Bette
You're as cold
You're as cold as ice
Cyborg Bette
You never treat me
You never treat me right
Superior programming
Superior hardware
Superior firepower
Superior hardware
I remember
When you told me
That you were built for me
And I remember
When you told me
You would never leave
Superior programming
Superior hardware
Superior firepower
Superior hardware
Why you gotta run so hot?
Why you gotta run so hot?
Why you got to run so hot?
You come home
Speaking
Speaking mean and rude
You come home
Reeking
Reeking mean of crude
And I know that
Things ain't
What they used to be
When I ask you
For water
You give me gasoline
Why you gotta run so hot?
Why you gotta run so hot?
Why you got to run so hot?
The very rarest
Of our enemies
Style and grace
Style and grace
Altogether
Our vesuvian
Style and grace
Style and grace
Cyborg Bette
You done me
Wrong for the last time
I got a new girl
The latest model
And she's mine oh mine
Superior programming
Superior hardware
Superior firepower
Superior hardware
Why you gotta run so hot?
Why you gotta run so hot?
Why you got to run so hot?
Style and grace
Style and graceEmbed
