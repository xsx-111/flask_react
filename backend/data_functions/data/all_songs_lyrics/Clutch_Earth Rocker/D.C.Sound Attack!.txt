D.C.Sound Attack! LyricsThe optics of it are not important
The public don't give a damn
I see you're in need of consultation now
Everybody needs a sinister hand
Naturally no sympathizer
I'm a war monger, baby
Gonna industrialize ya
Trouble I love
Peace I do despise
I'm a war monger, baby
I got blood in my eyes and I'm looking at you!
No, no, no, I've never worn no uniform
Except for the ballroom blitz
There's no need for conversation here
I prefer the dimmest intelligence
Naturally no sympathizer
I'm a war monger, baby
Gonna industrialize ya
Trouble I love
Peace I do despise
You're a war monger, baby
And you know you can't deny
Hell hounds on your trail
What a pity
But that's the price you pay
Shaking hands in Necro-city
D.C. Sound Attack!
Let the rhythm hit 'em!
D.C. Sound Attack!
Drop the bomb! Look out!
I'm not one for sporting laurels
I find honor rather trite
Never let a sense of morals
Prevent me from doing what is right
Naturally no sympathizer
I'm a war monger, baby
Gonna industrialize ya
Trouble I love
Peace I do despise
You're a war monger, baby
And you know you can't deny
Hell hounds on your trail
What a pity
But that's the price you pay
Shaking hands in Necro-cityEmbed
