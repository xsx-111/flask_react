Fax Shadow Lyrics
It hurts so good inside

I don't want to know more about him and how he was in your shadow
Don't tell me anymore about what you have
I know you're different now from what I had

It hurts so good inside

I'm sorry I couldn't name the color of your eyes
I'm sorry I couldn't name the color of your eyes
I'm sorry I couldn't name the color of your eyes

I don't want to know more about him and how he was in your shadow
Don't tell me anymore about what you have
I know you're different now from what I had1Embed
