Blessa Lyrics
Come home in the summer
Live a life that you miss (that you miss)
It's alright
I'll fill you in (fill you in)
Don't you wait
For me to call your name again

I see the wind blow into my shins
Each grain cuts into my nerves
It's hard to let you come on in
And let you know that I was hurt

Search for a life
Every second
Every day, every night
It's a blessing

I found a job
I do it fine
Do it fine
Not what I want
But still I try
I see the wind blow into my shins
Each grain cuts into my nerves
It's hard to let you come on in
And let you know that I was hurt
