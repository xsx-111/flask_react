Imprint After Lyrics
Why did you choose to stay?
Are you sure about your life for once?
Have you found how you're gonna live?
I can tell you haven't gotten far
What made you want to come back to me?
Was it cause I didn't want to leave you?
I want you to know I'll keep you out of harm
But you've got to know you left your mark on me
Why did you choose to stay?
Are you sure about your life for once?
Have you found how you're gonna live?
I can tell you haven't gotten far
What made you want to come back to me?
Was it cause I didn't want to leave you?
I want you to know I'll keep you out of harm
But you've got to know you left your mark on me3Embed
