Minors Lyrics
Oh, not even a year
Has gone by already
You've got him
I want to see
Where I am

When I live
In newer places
I'll make sure
I'm further from you
When problems come
Two by two
I know it's
Not the truth

Is this how it ends?
With someone to be with
Obsessed with ideas
That leave no one impressed
Often nights end in
The morning for me
Out on the floor
Where I seem more welcome
Is this how it ends?
With someone to be with
Obsessed with ideas
That leave no one impressed

Oh, not even a year
Has gone by already
You've got him
I want to see
Where I amEmbed
