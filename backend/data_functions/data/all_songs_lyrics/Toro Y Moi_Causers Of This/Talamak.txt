Talamak Lyrics
When can we get together again?
Nevermind
I've lost you
How can I tell if I love you anymore?
Nevermind
I know I do
Call you closer to my arms
You'll feel better when you're warm
You're gonna like it when you leave your house
You're gonna like it when you're in a town
That you love
Like one I live in
Like one I live in
Like one I live in

It's my body's plan

I feel another
Time out
Of my life
Slow down
I feel another
Time out
Of my life
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
It's my body's plan

Make another telephone call
And think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me
Make another telephone call
Think of you and me18Embed
