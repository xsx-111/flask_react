Thanks Vision Lyrics
Turn those fans away from me
They only dry my eyes out
Ever since I was born I couldn't see
Ever since I could see I couldn't find
Why you close your lips so tight
When I try to kiss you off goodbye
Oh, oh

I never wanted to be never understanding
Blurry comprehension
Leaving everyone
Wondering where he went
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Doesn't matter does it?
Ah, ahh, oohh...7Embed
