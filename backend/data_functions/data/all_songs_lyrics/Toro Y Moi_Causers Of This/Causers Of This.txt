Causers Of This Lyrics
I met you when you knew who I was
My speech was different
And I came across just fine
I met you when you knew who I was
My speech was different
But I came across just fine
Am I turning out to be the one who doesn't want to speak?

It's 'cause I've been alone
My days in life aren't real
It's 'cause I've been alone
This is how I feel
This is how I feel
This is how I feelEmbed
