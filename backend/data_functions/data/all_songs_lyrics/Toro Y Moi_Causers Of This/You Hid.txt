You Hid Lyrics
Give me somewhere to be
Take me to someone now
You might as well waste
Your time with me
If you got me here

Get away
From the ones that make you fray
Down to the last few strands of thought
Making you a target for a fight

Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

Give me somewhere to be
Take me to someone now
You might as well waste
Your time with me
If you're gonna be here
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait

I don't think I'd work out
As a best friend
I don't want to hold you down
I know there's someone better for you
I don't want to be around
When you've gotta go

Go away
Go away
