Low Shoulder Lyrics
If you rest for me tonight
I'll let you drive off in the morning
I don't want you in the shoulder
Where no one comes around

You go where I was
I'll go to the wall
Don't mind the streetlights that leak through the blinds
If it gets in your eyes
Just look into mine
Just look into mine
Just look into mine
We'll slip into dreams
And you'll be alright
You'll be alright
You'll be alright
I'll be alright
I'll be alright

I'm sorry for the other
That was us for the last five years
Now it's over and it's getting better
That's how we lived
Now we're living different
Now it's over and it's getting better
(Getting better)
If you rest for me tonight
I'll let you drive off in the morning
I don't want (No)
You in the shoulder
Where no one comes around (No)
When no one comes around
If you rest (No)
For me tonight
(You know I've got to be up
At six and start to be without you)
I'll let you drive off in the morning
I don't want (No)
You in the shoulder
Where no one comes around
(You know I've got to be out
By eight so I can get back to you)

(No)
You know I've got to be up
By six and start to be without to you
(No)
You know I've got to be up
By eight so I can get back to you
(No)
You know I've got to be up
By six and start to be without you11Embed
