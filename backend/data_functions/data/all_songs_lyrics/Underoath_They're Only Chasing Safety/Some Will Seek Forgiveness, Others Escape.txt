Some Will Seek Forgiveness, Others Escape Lyrics
And I heard a voice through the discord of a deluge of passersby
And I saw one gaze frozen in time watching me passing by
And I swear I'll know your face in the crowd
And I'll hear your voice so loud when you're whispering

Hey, unfaithful, I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey, ungraceful, I will teach you
To forgive one another

Here's my kiss to betray (kiss to betray)
Desperate to brush the lips of grace (brush the lips of grace)
Do you feel hollow when you
Think of how I've lied?
O sweet angel of mercy, with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me
O sweet angel of mercy, with your grace like the morning
Wrap your loving arms around me

Hey, unfaithful, I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey, ungraceful, I will teach you
To forgive one another
Hey, unfaithful, I will teach you
To be stronger, to be stronger
Hey, unloving, I will love you
I will love you, I will love you...
And Jesus, I'm ready to come home!
Jesus, I'm ready to come home!
Home, home, home
I'm ready to come!

Hey, unfaithful, hey, ungraceful
Hey, unloving, I will love you
Hey, unloving, I will love you...1Embed
