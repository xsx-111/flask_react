Reinventing Your Exit Lyrics
Twelfth and Hide on a Sunday
Feeling like we're gold
And we're nothing short of invincible
Invincible, invincible!

It starts again, can you feel it?
It takes your breath away
Stop saying that we're invincible, it's around and round
You're uninviting, unrewarding
And I'm misinforming you, misinforming you

We all wanna be, wanna be somebody
Right now, we're just looking for the exit

This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall, up against the wall
You got me up against your wall
This is the way I  would have done things
Up against the wall, up against the wall
You got me up against your wall

It's you and me on a Monday, the lies that we told
This is where we both go numb now
You broke my heart again this time
You're fading now, you crossed the line
You crossed the line
We all wanna be, wanna be somebody
Right now, we're just looking for the exit

This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall, up against the wall
You got me up against your wall
This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall, up against the wall
You got me up against your wall

Reaching out for a hand that's not here!
But you're not there, you're not there!

This is the way I would have done this
Up against the wall, up against your wall
This is the way we should have done
When we're up against a wall, up against a wall!

This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall, up against the wall
You got me up against your wall
This is the way I would have done things
Up against the wall, up against the wall
You got me up against your wall5Embed
