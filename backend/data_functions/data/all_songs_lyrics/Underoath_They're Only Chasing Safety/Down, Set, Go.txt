Down, Set, Go Lyrics
I had the whole world in my hands and I gave it away
I had the whole world in my hands and I gave it away, gave it away!

I'm a half-wit boy
Cracking a smile and wearing it all on my sleeve
So cool and so poised
It's true, I'm just around to see
Where this thing goes, I'll never know
But all I know is packing bags is a remedy, is a remedy

This time I'll be nervous
'Cause I can't see your hands in front of me, in front of me tonight
Let's forget all pretense of what they thought we should be
What liars we can be

I'm on my way to the top of the world
And I've got a feeling I'll give it away
I'm on my way to the top of the world
And I've got a feeling I'll give it away

She's a maverick, she's so smooth
If things go according to plan
I'll have her finished by five A.M
There's no changing plans, there's no second chance
I've already got both feet through the door
And I can taste the air, I can taste the air
This time I'll be nervous
'Cause I can't see your hands in front of me, in front of me tonight
Let's forget all pretense of what they thought we should be
What liars we can be


Make a sound, it's safe for you
To choke in here alone
Whatever I say goes! Whatever I say goes!
Whatever I say goes! Whatever I say goes!

You're not here with me! You're not here with me!
You're not here with me! You're not here with me!
You're not here with me! You're not here with me!
You're not here with me! You're not here with me!1Embed
