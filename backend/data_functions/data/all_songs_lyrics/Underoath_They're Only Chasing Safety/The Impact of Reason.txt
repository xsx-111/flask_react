The Impact of Reason Lyrics
Prop open the door
I can actually see my breath tonight
But that doesn't mean I'm breathing
Crack a smile just for the sake of it
This could take a while, a long while

Silence is golden - especially in this case

I'm not too sure that I want it to be this way
Open mouth, closed eyes, no words are escaping
It's all a blur, it's too dark to see, ain't it pretty
The way it all streaks together at night, together at night?

I think it's time to turn around
I really want to go home tonight
I think it's time to turn around
I really want to go home tonight

I feel like this is going nowhere
I feel like this is going nowhere
Try to think of something quick
And trust the direction of the driver
No lights, no lights, no signs, no signs
I'm at a loss for words
No lights, no lights! No signs, no signs!
I'm at a loss for words, at a loss for words

Now conversation sparks
What an easy way to break the ice
Now conversation sparks
What an easy way to break the iceEmbed
