Spaniolated LyricsI was 18 years old just a research volunteer;
I walked home from the TCBY each night with no fear
One particular starry 11 o'clock
I went down by the water;
An old man with a burlap bag
Said How you doin' my daughter
He put me the hole of his old rusty crawler
And fed me three pills a day to keep me from getting taller
Learned me the rosary and made me pray to Santiago:
I wish I wish I was back in Chicago
Up the river to Seville I was rowing and strumming
On my portable guitar my fair lady a humming
The pain, the pain, in Spain falls mainly on me
The pain, the pain, in Spain falls mainly on meEmbed
