Wolf Notes LyricsPick up your trumpet
Your plastic pretend trumpet:
Blow me your horn today
Pick up your tambourine
Your Fisher Price My First Tamborine:
Jingle and jangle today
Plug in your keyboard
Your symphonic sound samba Samsung:
Pick out a tune today
Turn off your radio
Shut away your stereo
Put away your discman
And play me a tune today:
I rub the peg-paste and the chalk in
Scrape and the wolf-notes start to grrr
I did a donkey's back with fixed frog
And I martellato the slur
Through an open wound you watch the guts go
Cut cross the cat line, thick and thin
All overspun and rosined-up a slow stick trills me, trills me:
She varnished all around her F-holes;
Blue tape take aim, but the arms are too low
Legato look and sawing detache:
But you want to bust your bow
Bow down and wipe off, snap the case closed
Madame Professor says Well done
But an electric stroboscopic frequency meter'd say otherwise
I scratch harmonicas in half-position;
I pinch my e-string rat-a-tat;
I double stop on any open string;
Screw my G on up to B-flatEmbed
