Paw Paw Tree LyricsAt last when the choice was neither nor
Bottom of the bay we're set ashore
Went into town beg what we lack:
200 stripes on horseback
Wearing my yellow coat
Rope tied around my throat:
Great green wax candle unlit;
Silence! And then the sentence spit
I'm sitting up in my paw paw tree
Wait they make mango mush outta me
Pick axe I can't stay
Silver mines all day
Cut down the weedwood
And think that I just could
I'm sitting up in my paw paw tree
Wait they make mango mush outta me
Tied down with brown twine
Up past the tree line
Up by I hope where
The King of Spain don't care
I'm sitting up in my paw paw tree
Wait they make mango mush outta meEmbed
