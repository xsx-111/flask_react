Mason City LyricsCame a card marked Mason City
From my forwarder
Shut the door, don't let my dad see;
Read aloud dear sir:
Understanding you account an upright gent-
Lemen Aetna Life agreed and lent
As agreed, my fee is 2.6 percent
Write again the Riceville widow
SASE
I would guess they'll be turned out though
I'll still make my plea:
If the Dunlay heirs cannot be seen to care
Then the Banker's Trust will surely think it fair
To not give extensions, as they musn't dare
Write Des Moines on several matters
And I near anoint
Ladle thick the pleasant flatters
And then comes the point;
Mr. Nelson wouldn't like to hear it said
As he's too proud, so I do it in his stead:
He shall need an extension--so it read
--Take the Oregon Short Line to Salt Lake;
Take the Pere Marquette, take the Michigan Central
To West Madison for Christ's sake
Forgemen, Molders, Blacksmiths, Boilermakers
None on the make
Up for shade on Crumb Hill
Get something to make my hands still
But now--Wait
How are you my nabs?
Little tender footed crabs
Meet my knuckle duster
You geeched that gazoon's gow
Tried to break into the bow:
Go wipe your nose
I'm just hanging out with some noler knockums
Just passing time waiting till my stack comes
Prussian who got jackered
My snapper till your knockered
Get on the snam
The chivman wants your chip;
Better dummy up then go dip:
You're outta turn
I learned that the lowest form of life is the buffer nabber
Even worse than the dicer stabberEmbed
