Lately LyricsThat the sky would lift
That I’d find my place
That I’d see your face in the door
And the sun would glint
On a time well spent
On a time that ain’t no more
Taste the broken hearts
In the vacant lots
See the fruit that rots on the trees
Try to turn my head
Leave it all for dead
But it’s in my mind always
Honey lately I’ve been way down
A load on my mind
Honey lately I’ve been way down
Load on my mind
Someone tell me where did it go
Darling I'm damned if I know
I seen that look in your eye
No-one ever gave it a chance
I could have said in advance
You saw it all at a glance
And goodbye
Drag a salted kiss
From this cup of bliss
Watch a new lie twist on the breeze
You can paint it red
Leave it all for dead
But it’s in my head always
Honey lately I've been way down
A load on my mind
Honey lately I've been way down
Load on my mind
Someone tell me where did it go
Darling I'm damned if I know
I seen that look in your eye
No one ever gave it a chance
I could have said in advance
You saw it all at a glance
And goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Honey lately I’ve been way down
Honey lately I’ve been way down
Honey lately I’ve been way down
Honey lately I’ve been way down
Lately
