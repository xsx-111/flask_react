Angel On My Bike LyricsShe knows just what I like
The angel on my bike
She found me down on a two ton anchor
Tangled up in wire
She always gets it right
The angel on my bike
I could be killed if the train goes faster
Well angel watch my life
I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's a prayer
It's forty-five miles on that highway
Angel double prayer
I have to sleep with my eyes on the white lines
Elvis need of repair
I only want to believe
That angel it's me that you need
And there's only, only one heart on that highway
Angel double prayer
I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's a prayer
I can't handle a care
I want, but I can't be there
While angel's a prayer
Now it's hard time on these wheels
These fairytales turn to rusted steel
And it's gettin' hard now to believe
She's seein' me
Angel, please, tell me
Can't you see
Angel it's only me
Angel it's only me
Well I can't take a care
Man, I want, but I can't be there
While angel's a prayer
I can't handle a care
Well, I want, but I can't be there
While angel's a prayerEmbed
