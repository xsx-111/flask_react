Laughing Out Loud Lyrics
Man you oughta finish what you started
You can't leave me here alive
I know it started as a fist fight
But you've got me covered up in hives

I don't need an invitation
The best peach is at the top of that tree
When all this indecision reigns
It's your aimlessness that helps me see straight

You got me walkin' up a tightrope
With vaseline from my head to my feet
You got me lookin' into blindfolds
I know you've got your hands all over me
So when all these imitations fail
Just don't look back cause I won't be there

Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just what it was all about
Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just why you'd push me around
I'm doing time inside a grapevine
Little things amuse little minds
Where nothing's free except a little bit of bad advice
On how to live on only water, bread, and rice

I don't need an invitation
The best peach is at the top of that tree
So when all this night time vision fails
I'll lose all these chains and slip out of this jail

Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just what it was all about
Laughing out loud
When I didn't ever know just why you'd push me around
