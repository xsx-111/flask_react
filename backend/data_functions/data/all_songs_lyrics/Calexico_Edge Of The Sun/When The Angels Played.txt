When The Angels Played Lyrics
You were looking for silver, looking for gold
You never did feel the wind turning cold
You always said you didn’t need that much anymore
You were carrying the weight of the world
Running around with all that pain
So you never did feel my hand in the rain
You were dreaming deep down in the night
Dreaming all of your days
You never did wake when the angels played

There was fire in the tunnel fire in the wash
And the ringing of the bells
You never did wake when the angels played
Maybe you’ll find your silver
Maybe you’ll find your gold
Maybe we’ll meet again on the road sometime
Storm in December storm in July
I was standing in the door
When you said goodbye
You never did wake when the angels played

There was fire in the tunnel
Fire in the wash
And the ringing of the bells
You never did wake when the angels played
Well maybe you’ll find your silver
Maybe you’ll find your gold
Maybe we’ll meet somewhere down the road
Well storm in December storm in July
I was standing in the door
When you said goodbye
You never did wake when the angels playedEmbed
