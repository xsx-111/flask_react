Bullets & Rocks Lyrics
The days are growing short
Patience wearing thin
Blackouts and broken trust
Leading to exodus
The future’s built on bullets and rocks
They’ll search, they’ll save
They’ll find it one day
There’s work to do
And mouths to feed
Why can’t you see
This plaintiff plea
The future’s starved
The families disappear
To the dark cover of night


No fear, no harm was meant
The smuggler joked
And down they went
The devil’s highway
Disguised as a cloud of dust and smoke
Narcos and feds
Are all intertwined
You can leave your valuables here
With me he smiled
A future’s promised to you
Wrapped in their words without truth
Echoes in a labyrinth of solitude
Security built a lie, a wall
Wrapped round and around fortitude
Bullets and rocks
A future’s promised to youEmbed
