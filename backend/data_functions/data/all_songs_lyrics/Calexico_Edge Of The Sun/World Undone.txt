World Undone Lyrics
Crying for three days
Now your eyes are red and tired
You can’t sleep for three days
Now you’re waiting for tenderness to come
You’re waiting for tenderness to come
Now you’re waiting for tenderness to come

With a red bird on the branch
And a cactus wren in the thorns
Red bird on the branch
Now your world’s coming undone
You’re waiting for tenderness to come

Can’t trust in this anymore
Still waiting on the fence
So many times before
What keeps you here anymore
When things fall apart
Now your world’s coming undone
Now your world’s coming undone

Now you’re waiting for tenderness to comeEmbed
