Falling From the Sky Lyrics
Well, I dreamt you were playing
An old guitar from a five and dime
There was a song trapped inside
With the sweetest tune
You said it was sad to sing

Where do you fall when you have nowhere to go?
Where do you go where you have no one to see?
What do you see when you have nothing to feel?
What do you feel when you're all alone?

It’s a song that circles round and around
Like a bird lost inside a cloud
Cut off from the stars and they’re guided in the light
Not sure which way is up or down anymore


Tired of waiting
Clouds will be breaking
Soon you'll escape and
Someday we'll find a place in the skyEmbed
