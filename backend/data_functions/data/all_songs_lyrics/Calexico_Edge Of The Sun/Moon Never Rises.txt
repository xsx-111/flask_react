Moon Never Rises Lyrics
I’m lying in my room
Back’s against the wall
The voices in my head
Playing with my heart

They say the drink won’t drown you
Smoke won’t burn your eyes
Idle hands are the devil’s playthings
Now the world starts to fall

Moon never rises
Stars don’t shine
Walking through the darkness
Until these days of sorrow pass on by

Outside birds are singing
Flowers start to bud
The vines have nearly covered
The place we used to rest

Forgotten and forsaken
The day my lover left
Sweeping up the ashes
Scattered by the wind

Sin amor la luna no brilla en míEmbed
