Follow the River Lyrics
Shadows are calling, and I’ve been down all day
The city’s asleep but my mind keeps running astray
I dream of you in the falling rain

Still have the wounds that the sun won’t ever heal
Surrounded by the emptiness of everything, everyone
I’m not giving up, I’m getting there
No I can’t give up yet, I’m getting there

Swallowed by ambition with a heart full of lies
Till I followed the river and found my way back to youEmbed
