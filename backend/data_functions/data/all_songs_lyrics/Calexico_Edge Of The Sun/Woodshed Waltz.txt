Woodshed Waltz Lyrics
You let go the wheel and turned off the lights
Fell out from the world and looking
For something to ignite
I saw you breathing in the questions
That were clouding up your soul
Trailing you back to the road
Changing your disguise but keeping the crown
Like a box full of letters you drag
From town to town

All the leaves that you scatter
So that no one can guess your next move
Now no one is searching for you
And your refrain
Making good promise again
Well it might take us some time
Better woodshed for a while
Pack it all up there’s no use in waiting all day
In hopes that you’ll come back to stay

All the leaves that you scatter
So that no one can guess your next move
Still no one is searching for you
And your refrain
Making good promise again
Well it might take us some time
Better woodshed for a while
You’ll drive back again
And I’ll still be your friend
Pack it all up for there’s no use in waiting all day
Hoping that something might change
Leave the box full of letters in the rainEmbed
