Beneath the City of Dreams Lyrics
Venom from the dealer pulls you underground
Fortune bleeds out lucky streaks can snap
All plans have their flaws sewn
Into the map to the city of dreams

You sleep in the car with your getaway schemes
Trusted saints patrolling the walls
Deep in the chambers outside the vaults
Searched for a sound echoes concrete
Might lead for a way out
Beneath the city of dreams

El camino escondido en la ciudad del sueño
Perdido en sus calles lo busco en mis recuerdos

He looked in her eyes one last time
Then crossed his heart
Memories of a tunnel lined with gold
But no one believes in the cards they hold
Coroner’s crying to an empty crowd
The devil’s laughing to himself out loud
Beneath the city of dreams
