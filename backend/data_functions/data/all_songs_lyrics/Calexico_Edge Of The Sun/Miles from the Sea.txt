Miles from the Sea Lyrics
Finding fossils on the hillside
While the sun strikes him down to his knees
Where his great grandfather’s sweat
Swallowed up left for dust
Just to escape push the pain to right
Sketches a wave in the soil
One drop on his dry, dry lips
Before he goes inflamed and insane

Dreams about swimming
Miles away from the sea
Dreams about swimming
And the moon brings him back
Dreams about swimming
Miles away from the sea
While the moon stems the tide in his heart

Cast iron and recall
The ore pouring deep in the vein
As the years of searing heat, ‘till all is just salt
That is left in the bed where he sleeps

Dreams about swimming
Miles away from the sea
Dreams about swimming
Though he’s miles from the sea
Dreams about falling
From the sky through the sea
Dreams about drowning
While the moon looks away
History unheard
Silent like the waves
A graveyard for the giants
That was his eye, dry is his heart

Dreams about swimming
Miles away from the sea
Dreams about swimming
Though he’s miles from the sea
Dreams about falling
From the sky through the sea
While the moon lays out a bed
Of bones to call homeEmbed
