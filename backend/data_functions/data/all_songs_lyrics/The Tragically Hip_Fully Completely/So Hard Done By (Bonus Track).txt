So Hard Done By (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Interesting and sophisticated
Refusing to be celebrated
It's a monumental big screen kiss
It's so deep it's meaningless

One day I'll just up and quit, yeah
And that'll be it
Just then, the stripper stopped in a coughing fit
She said, "Sorry, I can't go on with this"

Yeah, that's awful close but that's not why
I'm so hard done by

It was true cinema-a-clef
You should see it before there's nothing left
In an epic too small to be tragic
You'll have to wait a minute 'cause it's an Instamatic

Yeah, that's awful close but that's not why
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by

One day I'll just up and quit
And that'll be it
Just as the room became more dimly lit
And the MC carried on with it

Yeah, that's pretty close
Well, that could be why
I'm so hard done by

I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done by
I'm so hard done byEmbed
