Lionized LyricsCold wind blowing over your private parts
I know a lack you've got and it makes a strong case for art
Billboard breasts, they don't have a face
I know that fact you've got no girl could ever trace
Lionized, lionized
Smoking just a little too violently
I know that fact I've got and I know it single-mindedly
Stupid, stoned, cause and effect
I know a lack you've got and you don't even lack it yet
Lionized, lionized
Lionized, lionized
Tableau vivant
Roman a'clef
I can't draw but I can trace
I know a lack I've got, an abundance of extra space
Cold wind blowing over your private parts
I know a lack you've got is to make a strong case for art
Lionized, lionized
Lionized, lionized
Tableau vivant
Roman a'clef
