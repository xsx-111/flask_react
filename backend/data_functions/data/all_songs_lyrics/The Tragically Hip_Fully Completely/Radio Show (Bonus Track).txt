Radio Show (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Holding in smoke 'til your father passes
My perspectives are broadened 'cause my senses are dulled
Phoning in to the radio show
People stop to watch construction
If it has something to offer
People stop, watching destruction
When it has something to offer

The structure's good and the night is beautiful
The connection is clear now, T.V.'s down low
I'm phoning in to the radio show
People stop to watch the election
When it has something to offer
People stop, watch the triumph
When it has something to offer

When you stop caring 'bout what's in store
It's strange how people stop caring so much about you anymore

The flaming vehicle crashed through the guardrail
The flaming vehicle crashed through the guardrail
I can give you the details, that's all I know
Phoning in to the radio show
People stop, watch the instruction
When it has something to offer
People stop watching instructions
When they have something to offer
When you stop talking 'bout what's in store
It's strange how people stop talking so much about you anymore

As long as we
As long as we
As long as weEmbed
