Fully Completely LyricsBring me back in shackles
Hang me long out in the sun
Exonerate me
Forget about me
I recommend measures for ending it
Lover, she simply slammed the door
She said, "You're going to miss me
Wait and you'll see"
Fully and completely
I ponder the endlessness of the stars
Ignoring said same of my father
Either it'll move me
Or it'll move right through me
Fully and completely
Bring me back in shackles
And hang me long out in the sun
Exonerate me
Then forget about me
Wait and you'll see
Just wait and you'll see
Fully and completely
Fully and completely
Fully and completelyEmbed
