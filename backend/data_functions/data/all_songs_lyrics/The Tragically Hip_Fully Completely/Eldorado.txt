Eldorado LyricsHe's a man-sized Eldorado
Hooved a doo
And who could blame him
Who could blame him
Where we going?
What's the ticket?
Just the mention of Berlin makes me sexy
It makes me sexy
And tired of thinking 'bout drinking
For thinking of drinking
While thinking 'bout drinking
And thinking 'bout drinking
It's man-sized inside
Look in here
It's all hardwood
What's that smell?
Smells like coffee
It smells like coffee
If you regret it please say something
I've got no genius for evil
That makes me common
It makes me common
And tired of loving, recovering
Loving, recovering
Loving, recovering
Loving, recovering
It's man-sized inside
He's a man-sized Eldorado
Whoopty-do
If you can't take it
If you can't take it
Where's he going?
What's that ticking?
Just the mention of Berlin
Makes me sexy
It makes me sexy
And tired of thinking 'bout drinking
For thinking of drinking
While thinking 'bout drinking
And thinking 'bout drinking
Tired of loving, recovering
Loving, recovering
Loving, recovering
Loving, recovering
It's man-sized inside
It's man-sized inside
Inside
Inside
Inside
Inside
Inside
