The Wherewithal LyricsRichard talks too slow
He'd get interrupted long before
I always loved that guy
And he's not on TV any more
To get out before
He had the wherewithal
To get out before
He had the wherewithal
You've got to coax him slow
That's the only way that he'll confess
Tell him that the truth
Will help him live with less
To get out before
He had the wherewithal
To get out before
He had the wherewithal
And that's a breathy body of work
Set your sights inward for a leaner look
And that's a breathy body of work
Set your sights inward for a leaner look
Richard died real slow
He won't get interrupted any more
I always loved that guy
And he's not on TV any more
To get out before
He had the wherewithal
To get out before
He had the wherewithalEmbed
