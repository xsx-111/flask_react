Pigeon Camera Lyrics
It was handsome at the auction
Oh but when we got it home
It grew up into something we could
No longer contain
Where's our pigeon camera
By now he could be anywhere
And after all that training
And after all that training
With something we could no longer contain

It's boring (boring)
I'm embarrassed (embarrassed of it)
I don't endorse that (slammed in my face)
I didn't want this

This house it has it politics;
Over there that's my room
And that's my sister's
And that's my sister
With something we could no longer contain

It's boring (boring)
I'm embarrassed (embarrassed of it)
I don't endorse that (slammed in my face)
I didn't want this (boring)
It's horrific (boring)
I'm embarrassed (embarrassed of it)
I didn't want that (slammed in my face)
I didn't want this
It's like we burned our boots with no
Contingency planEmbed
