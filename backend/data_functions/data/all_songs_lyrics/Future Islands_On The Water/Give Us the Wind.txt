Give Us the Wind LyricsWe set out to find something to hold
When seeking truth the answer is the road
When seeking wisdom the journey is your home
Fight through the wind, fight through the rain
Fight through the cold
We left ourselves behind on dancing wire
The loved ones we left back home will be our choir
Let the doubters be
The stick, the thorn, the briar
Fight through the wind, fight through the rain
Dance in the fire
Don't bless me
No, don't bless me
We don't want your blessings
Don't bless me
We don't want your blessings
Give me the pen
Give me the sword
Let me cut away the darkness, and pin it to the wall
Let us sing a song of beauty as before
Give us the wind, give us the wind
Give us the storm
Give me the pen
Give me the sword
Let me cut away the darkness, and pin it to the wall
Let us sing a song of beauty as before
Give us the wind, give us the wind
Give us the storm
Pushing back the lake
We found something more
Like a song
In a word
Like the heartbreak of birds
And there, beneath the sand
Looking like the rain
We found some god
And the will to change
We set out to find something to hold
When seeking truth the answer is the road
When seeking wisdom the journey is your home
Fight through the wind, fight through the rain
Fight through the cold
Don't bless me
No, don't bless me
Don't bless me
No, we don't want your blessings
Don't bless me
No, don't bless me
Don't bless me
We don't want your blessings
We don't want your blessings
Give me the pen
Give me the sword
Let me cut away the darkness, and pin it to the wall
Let us sing a song of beauty as before
Give us the wind, give us the wind
Give us the storm1Embed
