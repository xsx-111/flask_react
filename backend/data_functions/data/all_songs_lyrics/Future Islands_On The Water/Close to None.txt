Close to None LyricsYou look like you wanted home
Far from god, and close to none
I've been waiting for the sun
To wash away those powdered eyes
And I've been wanting to hear a voice
But not a word from, Madeleine
I've been trying
To get back to you
For some time
Darling, I was simply blind
How the mountains play tricks on our eyes
You know the sea has saved
The life you made
The white of waves
The truth of waves
I've been waiting for the sun
To wash away those marble eyes
And i've been wanting to hear a voice
But not a word from...
You look like you wanted home
And now that I've found you
You're not alone
You know me
And I know you(I've been waiting for the sun
To wash away)
You know me
And I know you(I've been waiting for the sun
To wash away)
You know me
And I know you(I've been waiting for the sun
To wash away)
You know me
And I know you(I've been waiting for the sun
To wash away)
You know me
And I know youEmbed
