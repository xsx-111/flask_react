Grease LyricsWe've been here before
In a gravel lot, by the back door
We move the same
We say the same things
And the same song plays on the radio
Time for the show
And the road was long and slow
And I'm growing old
I was a boy not long ago
What happens to youth?
What happened to truth?
What happened to me?
This song won't change a thing
No, but the people want it all
The dancing bear, the bouncing ball
Oh, I hope they want it all...
Or the same song plays on the radio
Time for the show
And the road was long and slow
And I'm growing old
And the highways take a toll
Time for the show
And the road was long and slow
And I'm growing old
I was a boy not long agoEmbed
