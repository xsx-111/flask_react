Where I Found You LyricsI remember your smile
The smell of your skin
The way that you walked
And laughed
And I remember our room
And coming home to you
I remember our room
And you
Look back
Hold on to the last
Don't let today push out the past
You've gotta look back, look back
Hold on 'till the last
I remember the drive
With and without you
One road I took to catch you
The other road I took to leave you, where I found you
And I remember the day
We sat in some strange bar
And nothing much to say
Nothing at all
I loved you
And I still do
You know I loved you
And I still do
Look back
Hold on to the last
Don't let today push out the past
You gotta look back, look back
Hold on 'till the last
I loved you
And I still do
You know I loved you
And I still do
Look back, look back
Look back, look back
Look back, look back
Hold on 'till the last
And I loved you
Look back, look back
And I still do
Look back, look back
You know I loved you
Look back, look back
And I still do
Look back, look back
Look back, look back
Look back, look back
Look back, look back
Hold on 'till the lastEmbed
