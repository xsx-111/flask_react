Before the Bridge LyricsAnd I will walk you home
And I will leave you there
I'll take the books you stole
And leave the heart that bared - this soul
I hope you have what you need
(I hope the moon is listening)
I hope you have what you need
(I gave my soul, my body)
I hope you have what you need
(I hope the moon is listening)
I hope you have what you need
(I gave you soul and body)

And if things hadn't changed
I would have buried you deep in my arms
And if things had stayed the same
I would have carried you as far as the stars
Whatever has us now
I can't forget, somehow
For, to forget a love, is to regret
And, what is love, is regret
And, what isn't love is a test
And if things hadn't changed
I would have buried you deep in my arms
And if things had stayed the same
I would have carried you as far as the stars
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Hold your tongue...
Hold your tongue...
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Hold your tongue...
Hold your tongue...
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?
Hold your tongue...
Hold your tongue...
Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in love?

And if things hadn't changed
I would have buried you deep in my arms
And if things had stayed the same
I would have carried you as far as the stars
Far far away
Whatever has us now
I can't forget, somehow
For, to forget a love, is to regret2Embed
