The Great Fire LyricsI can't ask you now
But if I could, I'd say the same
And I can't be the wound you wear to sleep, always
And I can't watch you dream
Beside a fire
You made to leave
But if you let me be there, again
If you let me be there, again
If you let me be there, again
I'll be still, won't say a word
And, I will wait tonight
Along a pier, alone in light
And, I will wait in sight, for you to call
In purple night
But, I can't watch you dream
Beside a fire
You made to leave
But, if you let me be there, again
If you let me be there, again
If you let me be there, again
I'll be still, won't say a word
If you let me be there, again
I'll be still, won't say a wordEmbed
