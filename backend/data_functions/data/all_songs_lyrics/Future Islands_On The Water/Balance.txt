Balance Lyrics
And you can clean around the wound
But if you want it to heal
It just takes time
And you can go up to the Moon
But if you want something to change
You gotta change your life
And take your time
It just takes time
It just takes time
It just takes time
Hard work and your time
And the Sun will leave the room
And leave you to the night
And that's alright
Because before the morning comes
There's a certain calm
And then there's light
It just takes time
It just takes time
A little trust and your time
You can change your life
It just takes time
A little trust and your time
And I can sit and talk
Because I was just like you
So arrogant and brave
Impetuous and blue
But trust me as a friend
And I'll do all that I can do
And I'd do anything for you
Because I want to see you through
It just takes time
Hard work and your time
You can change your life
It just takes time
A little trust and your time...
A little trust and your time...
A little trust and your time...
It just takes time
It just takes time
Hard work and your time7Embed
