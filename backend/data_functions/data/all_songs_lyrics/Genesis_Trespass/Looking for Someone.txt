Looking for Someone LyricsLooking for someone, I guess I'm doing that
Trying to find a mem'ry in a dark room
Dirty man, you're looking like a Buddha
I know you well - yeah
Keep on a straight line, I don't believe I can
Trying to find a needle in a haystack
Chilly wind you're piercing like a dagger
It hurts me so - yeah
Nobody needs to discover me
I'm back again
You see the sunlight through the
Trees to keep you warm
In peaceful shades of green
Yet in the darkness of my mind
Damascus wasn't far behind
Lost in a subway, I guess I'm losing time
There's a man looking at a magazine
You're such a fool, your mumbo-jumbo
Never tells me anything - yeah
Nobody needs to discover me
I'm back again
You feel the ashes from the
Fire that kept you warm
Its comfort disappears
But still the only friend I know
Will never tell me where I'll go
Looking for someone
And now I've found myself a name
Come away, leave me
All that I have I will give
Leave me, leave me
All that I am I will giveEmbed
