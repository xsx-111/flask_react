Perfect Timing LyricsIs this just a passing fancy
Or another passing game?
Is this just a little something
That fallen angels play?
Oh, I've had a million fantasies
But that was make believe
Baby, open up this door before I freeze
Girl, stop complaining
You're afraid of the dark
We'll go the distance
I don't think it's so far
I think it's perfect
Perfect, perfect timing, baby
Perfect, but I wanna know for sure
(Perfect timing)
Well, I tried to send a message
Yes, I tried to telephone
But I guess that I ain't lucky
And my card say no one's home
If the cards are on the table
That's a calculated risk
That's if accidental angels do exist
Just for a moment
If you think the moment's right
Ooh, let's not lose that moment tonight
(Perfect, perfect)
If this is love it's perfect timing, baby
(Perfect, perfect timing)
But I wanna know for sure
(Perfect, perfect)
If this is love it's perfect timing, baby
(Perfect, perfect timing)
But I gotta know for sure
I'm thinkin' this is the right time
I'm hoping you feel the same
'Cause that light at the end of the tunnel
Is the front of an oncoming train
Perfect
Ti-ti-timing
(Perfect, perfect)
If this is love it's perfect timing, woah
(Perfect, perfect timing)
But I wanna know for sure, yeah
(Perfect, perfect, perfect timing)
If this is love it's perfect timing, yeah
(Perfect, perfect timing)
But you gotta, you gotta let me know
(Perfect, perfect, perfect timing)
Baby, time is right, baby
(Perfect, perfect, perfect timing)
Ooh, let me know, ah yeah
(Perfect, perfect timing)
Ain't no clock on no clubhouse wall
(Perfect, perfect timing)Embed
