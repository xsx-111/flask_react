Damn Good LyricsTime rools on
And that's as it should be
Here and gone
Seems to move so quickly
Man, we was happy in our restless hearts
It was heaven right here on Earth
Yeah, we were laughin' as we reached for the stars
And we had some for what it was worth
Those were good times
Damn good times
Those were good times
Damn good times
Hey, take a look at this picture
Can you beliee that was you?
And who's that standin' there in the corner?
Not me
Ahh, the crazy things we used to do
Sure, we was acting like a couple of kids
Good to remember, you know that it is
I still feel it like the sun on my skin
Maybe that's better
'Cause these are good times
Damn good times
Talkin' 'bout good times
Damn good times
So it's one for the money
But that don't make the show, no no
Count to three and I'll be ready, yeah
To follow that road, yes I will
I see it comin', yeah, and this one is ours
We got heaven right here on Earth
Ain't nothin' like it when you're reachin' for stars
And you grab one for what it is worth
You can tell 'em
We'll be having good times
Damn good times
I'm talkin' good times, yessir
Damn good times
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, good times
Mmm, mmm, mmm, good times
Mmm, mmmEmbed
