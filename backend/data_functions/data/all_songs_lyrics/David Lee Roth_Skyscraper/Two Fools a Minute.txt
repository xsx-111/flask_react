Two Fools a Minute LyricsHere's a little combination for you
Seems like everything I like
Will make me sick or poor or fat (Says who?)
Ooh, you beautiful doll
Save one for me and try not to laugh
(Who's got the time?)
Who'll hold the horses
Now you see it, now you don't, right
Now I've seen everything
Least everything I want
Tasty, very sweet
Honey, for the life of me
Tell me baby, please
Who's that unexpected company?
So it's up the road, turn right next Thursday
Think that's where I'm gone
I ain't drowning, just waving
Ain't even worth a song, no
Take one for yourself now, Billy
Don't be shy
Yeah
Look at them hard hats work
We was making something of it
And X did mark the spot
But Y's a crooked letter
I forgot
But not me Chief, I'm just Radar
I don't talk in front of the kids
I know the difference
See, the meek shall inherit shit
I'd wait for her parade
While she's out doing Yankee Doodle
Thought I had it made
But the gravy train was late as usual
And it's up the road, turn right next Thursday
Think that's where I'm gone
I ain't drowning just waving
Ain't even worth a song
See you in the funny papers
Guess that's where I'll be
They say two fools born a minute
Guess that makes me three, hey
Modulate, daddy, modulate
Oh oh, oh
Ooh, sizzling to the top
Up, up, up, up, up, up the road, turn right next Thursday
Think that's where I'm gone
I ain't drowning just waving
Ain't even worth a little song
See you in the funny papers
Guess that's where I'll be
If there's two fools born a minute
I am all three, wait a minute
Two fools born a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute, what time is it?
Let me check it out
Oh, oh
Three fools born a minute
I knew I had company in here
Where's the drummer?
Four fools born a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
I don't know how many people can get in the back here
Billy you've gotta drive
Five fools born a minute
No, no, we can't let Stevie drive
Six fools born a minute
That's right don't be staring at your stereo, fool
I tell ya all, yeah
Shit, I've gotta be home before the end of recordEmbed
