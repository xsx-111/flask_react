Stand Up LyricsShe looks like Monroe, it's a good impersonation
From start to finish, it's her better side
Head over heels and he feels a strange sensation
Excedrin headache #65
That's the trouble with love
(That's the trouble with love)
And that's the trouble with war
(That's the trouble with war)
You never get what you came for
Stand up, stand up
The more you do it, the less you fall down
Stand up, stand up
Put your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground
Stand up, stand up
For the time of your life, you turn it up loud
Stand up, stand up
What kind of fashion is this flash infatuation
Is all this admiration mutual?
Need no lessons in emotional starvation
That look in her eyes is too good to be true
So now you got a good reason
(Now you got a good reason)
Yeah, but you just gorra learn
(You really oughtta learn)
Is what makes the world turn
Stand up, stand up
The more you do it, the less you fall down
Stand up, stand up
Put your head in the clouds and your feet on the ground
Stand up, stand up
For the time of your life, you turn it up loud
Stand up, stand up
Stand up, stand up
The more you do it, the less you fall down
Stand up, stand up
Put your head in the clouds, feet on the ground
Stand up, stand up (stand up)
For the time of your life, you turn it up loud
Stand up (stand up), stand up (won't you stand up)
Stand up, ah, ah
Ah, stand up
