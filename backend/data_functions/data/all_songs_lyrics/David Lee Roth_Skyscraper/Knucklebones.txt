Knucklebones Lyrics
When the fire burns 'neath a zombie moon
You feel the winds of change
Oh, the drums will tell the tune
And you know it's true, baby
Can you feel the heat of the setting sun?
It's burning up the streets
This beat has got mixed blood
Hey, and I know it too

But now her mama's got the eyes
Like she's workin' on a heart attack
A fella never can tell
And I'm about to go bananas
With the "When ya comin' back?"

So we're hittin' the road
And we're pumpin' thunder
Mama, look out for down below
Get the show on the road
It's the feeling we're under
You can feel it right down to your knucklebones
One of these dark nights, as the saying goes
There's some dirty work
To be done down by the crossroads
And I know it's true, ooh my baby

Ain't no use waitin' for your invitation
King Kong never had it so clean
We'll do the Fat Cat Shake
We'll have our cake and eat it too
You could never, no, no, no, never, beat this squeeze

Because we're hittin' the road
And we're pumpin' thunder
Mama, look out for down below, yeah
Get the show on the road
It's really no wonder
You can feel it right down to your knucklebones

Ah yeah
Whoo, must be the heat
Oh oh
Stop dreamin' and start drivin', Stevie, yeah
Ah
Ah
Ah
Ah ha ha

So we're hittin' the road
And we're pumpin' thunder
Mama, look out for down below
Get the show on the road
It's really no wonder
You can feel it right down to your knucklebones

Get the show on the road
Get the show on the road (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get the show on the road
And you can feel it right down to you knucklebonesEmbed
