The Bottom Line LyricsTalk about meanwhile back at the ranch
The ugly duckings learn to dance
Ooh, spirits rising, mihgt be more
Gonna blow this whole town out the back door
Give 'em hell tonight
(Give 'em hell tonight)
Go west young man? Aww rite!!
Aww right, aww right
We'll burn the bridges if we please
(We'll burn the bridges if we please)
Or forever you can hold my peace
A little taste I can't stop
Tastes as sweet as soda pop
All dressed up and ready for the top
Yes, I got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it
And that's my bottom line
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it, have it one more time
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it
And that's my bottom line
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it, baby
You wanna feel 100 proof?
I got news for you
I seen some folks fall and a couple fly
And some of them just dies
Ain't nothing's once upon a time
Got a rosy future and a big behind
Might get lucky, never mind
I hear beginners do it all the time
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it
And that's my bottom line
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it, have it one more time
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it
And that's my bottom line
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it, baby
Yes, I got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it
And that's my bottom line
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it, have it one more time
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it
And that's my bottom line
Got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have it, baby
Yes, I got to have it
Got to have it
Got to have itEmbed
