Hot Dog and a Shake LyricsI see ya shake and shimmy 'cross the burger shop floor
I never seen a woman move so slow
I'm dyin', french-fryin'
By the seat of my pants
Take a bite of double fries
Swear to god it make ya late for the dance, yeah
Here's one for the road
One shot for the real go-getter
Silly rabbit, you know just what it takes
A hot dog and a shake
That's what you're hungry for
A hot dog and a shake
My stomach's makin' noise, I'm having dinner late
'Cause I gotta be kept in a cool dry place
Just like any bowl of cherries
When the cream is risin' to the top
You find your real bottom line
Is when your spine snap, crackle and pops, pal
Give me one to go
Hey buddy, take a number
She can't say no to what it takes
A hot dog and a shake
That's what you're hungry for
A hot dog and a shake
Solo!
I'm more that just a victim of a hungry heart
Kiss me quick, I'm double parked
A hot dog and a shake
That's what you're hungry for
A hot dog and a shake
Just like any bowl of cherries
When the cream is risin' to the top
You find your real bottom line
Is when your spine snap, crackle and pops, pal
Give me one to go
Hey buddy, take a number
She can't say no to what it takes
A hot dog and a shake
(What you hungry for)
A hot dog and a shake
(well, well, well)
A hot dog and a shake
That's what you're hungry for
A hot dog and a shake
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
OhEmbed
