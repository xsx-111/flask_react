Hina LyricsThose eyes burn holes
Into the starry night
And when her sleepy eyes are open wide
You can barely dance beneath her light
And I'd love to get to know the natives
But I'm only flesh and blood
She'll share your joys but not your sorrows
Mistress of the coming flood
Hina
Cool upon the silent sea
Hina
Isn't she the moon queen?
Hina
Whispering in my dreams
You must come back to me
And the tides rise, a distant sigh
Falls on deaf ears
Her vision makes you every inch a king
King for a million years
And she loves you when you're leavin'
And she'll leave you if you stay
She says, "Don't tell me that you love me
You'll hate me for hearning it once I drift away."
Hina
I can hear you softly cry
Hina
Your storms and lullablies
Hina
I'll whisper in your dreams
Till you come back to me
Come back
But she will never stay
Come back
And you must never wait
Never wait, never wait, never wait
Come back, back, back
Ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah
Na, na, na, na, na
Woah
Hina
Come back
But she will never stay
Come back
And you must never wait
Never wait, never wait, never wait
