I've a feeling, I won't be coming down from this
I was searching through the heavens and somehow I slipped

I feel, I'm seeing so clear

Trying to forget tomorrow and all that's happened
This is not the way, the way I meant to be

I feel, I'm seeing so clear
I thought I was never gonna die
I feel, I'm seeing so clear
We need more time
Slipping away, I think I'm gonna crack
Misplaced trust, loyalty stabbed in the gut

I feel, I'm seeing so clear
I thought I was never coming back
I've been down for awhile
And now I'm coming backEmbed
