Alternative 4 LyricsIt's killing you, you're killing me
I'm clinging on to my sanity
All I need is a short term remedy
Come and hide me from this terrible reality
Dreaded memories float back to me
But there's still a wilful mind behind these cold psychotic eyes
Now I tread the path so differently
I've opened my mind and darkened my entire life
I'll dance with angels to celebrate the holocaust
And far beyond my far gone pride
Is knowing that we'll soon be gone
Knowing that I'll soon be gone1Embed
