Fragile Dreams Lyrics
Countless times I trusted you
I let you back in
Knowing, yearning
I should have run, but I stayed

Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken for you

Today I introduced myself
To my own feelings
In silent agony, after all these years
They spoke to me after all these years

Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken for you2Embed
