Better Off Dead LyricsI'm sorry about the sun
How could I know that you would burn?
And I'm sorry about the moon
How could I know that you'd disapproved
I'll never make the same mistake
So next time I create the universe
I'll make sure we communicate at length
Oh yeah
But until then...it's better off dead
A smile on the lips and a hole in the head
Better off dead, it's better than this
Take it away cuz there's nothing to miss
I'm sorry about the world
How could I know you'd take it so bad?
And I'll never make the same mistake
So if you are looking for a fantasy
Why not trying the entire human race
Just to play it safe
Until then...
A smile on the lips and a hole in the head
Better off dead, it's better than this
Take it away cuz there's nothing to miss
Better off dead, better off dead
Why don't you try pushing daisies instead
Better off dead, better off dead
A smile on the lips and a hole in the head
And I'll never make the same mistake
The next time I create the universe
I'll make sure you participate
Oh yeah
And I'll never make the same mistake
The next time I create the universe
I'll make sure we communicate at length, just in caseEmbed
