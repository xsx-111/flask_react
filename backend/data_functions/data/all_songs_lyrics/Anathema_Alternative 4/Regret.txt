As I drift away, far away from you
I feel all alone in a crowded room
Thinking to myself, there's no escape from this
Fear, regret, loneliness

Visions of love and hate, a collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter, echoes of silent cries

I wish I didn't know now what, I never knew then
Flashback, memories punish me once again
Sometimes I remember all the pain that I have seen
Sometimes I wonder what might have been

Visions of love and hate, a collage behind my eyes
Remnants of dying laughter, echoes of silent cries

And sometimes I despair at who I've become
I have to come to terms with what I've done

The bittersweet taste of fate, we can't outrun the past
Destined to find an answer, a strength I never lost
I know there is a way, my future is not set
For the tide has turned but still I never learned to live without regretEmbed
