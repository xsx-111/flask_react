Empty Lyrics
Empty vessel, under the sun
Wipe the dust from my face
Another morning, black Sunday
Coming down again, I'm coming down again
Empty vessel, empty veins
Empty bottle, wish for rain
That pain again, wash the blood off my face
The pulse from my brain, that pain again
And I feel that pain again


I'm looking over my shoulder 'cause millions will whisper
I'm killing myself again
Maybe I'm dying faster but nothing ever lasts
I remember a night from my past when I was stabbed in the back
And it's all coming back and I feel that pain again


I abhor you, I condemn you 'cause this pain will never end
You got away without a scratch and now you're walking on a lucky path
I have to laugh but you'd better watch your back


There's pathetic opposition
They're the cause of my condition
I'll be coming back for them
I've a solution for this sad situation
Nothing left but to kill myself again because I'm so empty2Embed
