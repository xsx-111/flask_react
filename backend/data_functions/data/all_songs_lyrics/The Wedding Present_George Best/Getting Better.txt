Getting Better LyricsI used to get mad at my school
The teachers who taught me weren't cool
Holding me down, turning me around
Filling me up with the rules
Got to admit, it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit, it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
We used to be angry, young men
Hiding our heads in the sand
Gave me the word I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit, it's getting better
A little better all the time
I have to admit, it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
I used to be cruel to my brother
I beat him and kept him apart from the things that he loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can
I admit, it's getting better
A little better all the time
Yes, I admit, it's getting better
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
Getting so much better all the timeEmbed
