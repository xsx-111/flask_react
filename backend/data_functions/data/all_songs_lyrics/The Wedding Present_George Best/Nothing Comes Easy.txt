Nothing Comes Easy LyricsI knew that something must be up
I'm not as daft as I might look
But if you can't be good be careful
If you don't brush your coat that hair will
Give the game away
I knew you'd think of going there
Oh I can lend you both the fare
But if you've got a choice then use it
You don't know what you need until you lose it
I've done the same myself
I wish you knew for sure
I don't understand you anymore
Before you slam that door
There's so much to lose and you will lose it all
Oh you will lose it all
You know that I'll always stand by
But don't ask me if I'll lie
I don't see any guilt on your face
I wouldn't like to be in your place
You don't know when you're well off
I wish I knew for sure
I don't understand you anymore
Before you slam that door
There's so much to lose and we will lose it all
Oh we will lose it allEmbed
