All About Eve Lyrics"Tom"
I've read this page a thousand times
It's the only way that I could find to carry on
"Say. Isn't it a good life over here?
And can you catch another can of beer?
So sharp, so clear
You bet! And a good kaffir I've never met
But you know this heat will make them sweat!"
Tin wall, hot flesh
Oh man, I'm too full of hate to shake your hand
And don't you ever call me your friend
He'll take this land
Did you try to imagine the hate
That a young boy could feel?
Did you try to imagine the hate
That a young boy could feel?
Big game; four begging children by the train
The Afrikaner does the same
Then gets back on again
And who's she?
"They call he Black Revolution Eve"
On the master's land she sowed some seeds
Today she leaves
Did you try to imagine the hate
That a young boy could feel?
Did you try to imagine the hate
That a young boy could feel?
Did you try to imagine the hate
That a young boy could feel?
Did you try to imagine the hate
That a young boy could feel?Embed
