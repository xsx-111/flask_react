What Did Your Last Servant Die Of? LyricsIs that a letter you're hiding from me?
Well I think I'm being used again, let me open it and see
That's not what I wanted to hear
There's a time and place for everything and that time is coming near
Do you have to spend so much time on your hair?
Well couldn't you start it earlier? Of course you've got things to wear!
No, I didn't pick up your coat on the way
Well some of us have to work you know, have you been sitting there all day?
All that I've done for you
After all that I have done for youEmbed
