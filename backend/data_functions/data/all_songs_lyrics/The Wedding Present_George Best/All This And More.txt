All This And More LyricsI wonder what our kid has bought her
I think I'll try and unwrap a corner
He didn't spend that much in the end
He doesn't think that highly of his friends
I've wanted one of those for years
That was until I got it here
On second thoughts, I don't think I like it
But if it's for sale someone will buy it
I can't think of just what I wanted it for
I've already borrowed too much money
I told Michel and she thinks its funny
I won't have anything but the best
Can I put this down and owe the rest?
I can't think of just what I wanted it for
All this and moreEmbed
