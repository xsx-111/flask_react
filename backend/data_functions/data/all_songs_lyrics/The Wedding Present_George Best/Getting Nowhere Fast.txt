Getting Nowhere Fast LyricsYou're not looking forward and you are not looking back
You've lost your warranty, you'll never get your money back
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
I am finished when I don't do what they want me to
I know them more than you, that's what the general public think
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
It makes you feel good, you've answered all the questions right
You've won a holiday, that'll help you sleep tonight
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
We are not looking forward and we are not looking back
We've lost our warranty, we'll never get our money back
My baby's buying me another life, getting nowhere fast
My baby's buying me another lifeEmbed
