Give My Love To Kevin LyricsWhy should I want to know his name?
What difference does it make?
You know I tried dead hard to keep away, I just had to call again
Where did you go last night?
Oh, what's that new place like?
Okay, I won't ask anymore questions and then you cannot tell me lies
Well they always need good men
They're crying out for them
It's not the sort of job I'd do myself, but then I'm not him
Oh, he buys you pretty things
And what does your mother think?
I just can't bear to imagine you sharing a bed with him
Tell me why should I be upset?
Some kid I've never met
We better sort this out before I go and say something I'll regret
No, I'm sure it suits him
I'm not trying to be anything
Before I leave I want you to give my love to KevinEmbed
