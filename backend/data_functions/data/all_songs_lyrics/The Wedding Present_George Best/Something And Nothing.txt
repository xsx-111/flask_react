Something And Nothing LyricsYou're not such a nice girl after all
It's as much as you can do just to say hello
Have you got to stick your head inside that book
Oh, you've noticed that I'm here, now please spare the dirty look!
It's such a beautiful evening, oh would you like to go out?
Oh pardon me for breathing
I know you walk a different way each night
To avoid the men on the building site
But I waited half an hour for you to come
Oh well you've missed your dad and the tea's now overdone
Well it's only part of loving
Oh please don't accuse me of making something out of nothing
There's really nothing to be ashamed about
He's a good looking kid, I think I've worked that bit out
And he seems to have the same desires as you
But if he's that much fun, how come I'm not laughing too?
It's such a beautiful evening, oh would you like to go out?
Oh pardon me for breathing
I can't help the way that I am, it's only part of loving
Please don't you tell me that I'm making something out of nothing
Silly, but true, you know I can't help but feeling used
When the two of you get on so well together
A quiet drink? Well what am I supposed to think?
When the two of you dance so well togetherEmbed
