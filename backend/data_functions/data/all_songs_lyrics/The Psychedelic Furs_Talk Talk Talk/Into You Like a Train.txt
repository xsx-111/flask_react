Into You Like a Train LyricsNo kind of love
No kind of love
I don't wanna make no scene
Lovers come and go
Or make you Mrs. Anyone
Or make you Mr. Me
I'm into you like a train
Into you like a train
Into you like a train
Yeah, fall in love
Yeah, fall in love
I don't wanna tape you down
Or shack you up with me
Or put you where the flowers go
And get into your mind
I'm into you like a train
Into you like a train
Into you like a train
If you believe that anyone
Like me within a song
Is outside it all
Then you are all so wrong
If you believe that anyone
Like me within a song
Would try and change it all
Then you have been put on
Into you like a train
Into you like a train
Into you like a train
Yeah, fall in love
Now fall in love
I don't wanna wear no side
And complicate it all
Or celebrate your prettiness
And kick you in it all
I'm into you like a train
Into you like a train
Into you like a train
If you believe that anyone
Like me within a song
Is outside it all
Then you are all so wrong
If you believe that anyone
Like me within a song
Would try and change it all
Then you have been put on
So wrong
Into you like a trainEmbed
