All of This & Nothing LyricsA phonebook full of accidents
A girl to drive your car
A suit to wear on mondays
And a coat a magazine
A heavy rain a holiday
A painting of the wall
A knife a fork and memories
A light to see it all
You didn't leave me anything
That i can understand
Hey i never meant that stuff
I want to turn you round
Dominoes a pack of cards
A picture of the queen
A dress to wear on sundays
And a handle for the door
A letter that i sent for you
A note you left for me
A wave a pack of cigarettes
A pocket full of beads
You didn't leave me anything
That i can understand
Hey i never meant that stuff
I want to turn you on
You didn't leave me anything
That i can understand
Hey i never meant that stuff
I want to turn you round
You didn't leave me anything
That i can understand
Hey i never meant that stuff
I want to turn you on
The sound of people getting drunk
A ceiling and a sky
A bank that's full of promises
A telephone that lies
A visit from your doctor
He crawls in through the door
A mirror you can look in
So that you know where you are
You didn't leave me anything
That i can understand
Hey i never meant that stuff
I want to turn you round
You didn't leave me anything
That i can understand
Now i'm left with all of this
A room full of your trashEmbed
