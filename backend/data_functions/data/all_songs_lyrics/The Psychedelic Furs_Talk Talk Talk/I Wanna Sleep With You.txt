I Wanna Sleep With You LyricsShe comes in like an angel
And goes down like these flats
I don't know why she does all this
It's making her see that
I don't want you always
And I won't hold your hand
I won't give you flowers
I just wanna sleep with you
I just want to sleep with you
I just want to sleep with you
I got my own morals
You've got your own too
Lovers will just steal your clothes
But I'm not one of them
Forgive me, I just didn't want to
Run away with you
There's romance or so she says
I wanna sleep with you
I just want to sleep with you
I just want to sleep with you
I wanna sleep with you
I didn't want to fade in you
I make my own scenes
These go-go girls are happening
They're just like accidents
He's got sunglasses, electric shoes
This vicious dog and I shake
A uniform in black and blue
He wants to be a god
I just want to sleep with you
I just want to sleep with you, nowEmbed
