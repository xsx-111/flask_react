Mr. Jones LyricsMrs. Jones is seventeen and six and twenty four
Moderately pretty, she is all the girls you know
We are going far away, we're going for a ride
Mr. Jones has got a plan if you just come inside
So good so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads and radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't wanna dance
Mr. Jones you're beautiful, your eyes are made of glass
Looking through the window you can see the world go past
Here's another nine-o'clock and here's another day
Wonder how the weather is and what the people say
So good so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads and radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't wanna dance
Mr. Jones can turn you on and turn you off again
Mr. Jones is all of you who live inside a plan
Put your head upon the pillow, never put it down
That would only wake you up and turn your head around
So good so far, slow down ha ha
Movie stars and ads and radio define romance
Don't turn it on, I don't wanna dance
Oh
Alright nowEmbed
