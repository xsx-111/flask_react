Dumb Waiters Lyrics
Give me all your paper ma
Give me all your jazz
Give me something that I need
Something I can have
Mrs. London's coming 'round
She's coming with her son
Gimme all your paper ah
So I can get a gun

She has got it in for me
Yeah i mean it honestly

She's so mean

Give me all your paper ma
So I can get a train
They just wanna suck you in
To being one of them
Tell her that I'm not in here
Tell her I'm a freak
Tell her that I fall about
Every time I speak
She has got in for me
Yeah I mean it honestly

I just scream

Give me all your paper ma
So I can buy a train
I don't know how I got in here
It's making me insane
Have another cigarette
And have another cigarette
In a room where lovers go
Talking on the telephone

They have got it in for me
Yeah I mean it honestly

They all dream
