So Run Down LyricsBlue cars big beat
Dead on my feet
I get this heat
Run round lime street
Do this
Be there
I just don't care
All day day wear
Go home she's there
I don't think that i can stand
I'm so run down
She is oh so out of hand
She's coming down
Run down
Who cares
I'm so happy
I get some clerk
Talk talk talk talk
Get up get down
This is toy town
All day day wear
Go home she's there
I don't think that i can stand
I'm so run down
She is oh so out of hand
She's coming down now
Sometimes she says she loves me
I just don't believe it
All day she says
My set it plays
Love songs all day
It sells toothpaste
Razors band-aids
It sells love
And it sells hairspray
Ha ha all day
Monday monday
I don't think that i can stand
I'm so run down
She is oh so out of hand
She's coming down nowEmbed
