No Tears LyricsThere's demonstrations and demonstrations
Listen, to the weathermen
They're not saying anything
They're tripping flags for you
This crazy face for you
You don't have a point of view
You don't have to say you do
No tears, no colours, yeah
There's conversation and conversation
Talk about yourself again
Talk about the rain again
Another lie for you
Another point of view
How can you believe in them?
Don't believe in anything
No colours, no tears, yeah
There's demonstrations and demonstrations
Listen to the weathermen
They're not saying anything
There's conversation and conversation
Talk about yourself again
Talk about the rain again
No tears, no colours, no you now!Embed
