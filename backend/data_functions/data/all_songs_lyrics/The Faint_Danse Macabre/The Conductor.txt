The Conductor LyricsConfident with your back to the audience
Tremolo strings begin with your gesturing wrist
Start the orchestra slow with an elegant aire
Then a circular sweep, crescendoing swell
Leo Slatkin, Dohnanyi, Previne, Depaur
Your arms are calling out
They wave like a swarm of sound
You pull the sound from scores of notes
You step the stage and take control
You're conducting verese in a moment of silence
Your body directs a pulse of wind
Von Karajan, Hampton, Menuhin, Levine
Your arms are calling out
They wave like a swarm of sound
You pull the sound from scores of notes
You step the stage and take control
Those arms are calling out
They wave like a swarm of sound
You pull the sound from scores of notes
You step the stage and take control
