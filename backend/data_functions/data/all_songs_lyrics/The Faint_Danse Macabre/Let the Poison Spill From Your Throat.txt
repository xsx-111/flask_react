Let the Poison Spill From Your Throat LyricsSome people get bit from the inside
When they talk it's cold and sour
And no, there's nothing they can do now
They've had their way too many times
If you glare to get what you want
It'll become your look
If there's dirt you've got on someone
You'll let it loose without a thought
Just let the poison spill
Spurt from your throat
Hiss like steam
Because the pressure's unreal
I'm not saying that it's not
You're causing a scene
You're wearing out that note
You scream until it's gone
You scream until it's gone, gone, gone
No government check can reverse it
You'd need a royal eclipse of the tongue
Or is the pain that you endure, no
Something you need
Well, you know how to get it
There's no climbing up that list
You just move down it one by one
You hate this and this and love that it shows
You're insecure, but that's no excuse
Just tell them they lie
You tell them the truth
The things you won't take are coming in groups
The people abused the trust that you had
And now you don't want it back
Just let the poison spill
Spurt from your throat
Hiss like steam
Because the pressure's unreal
I'm not saying that it's not
You're causing a scene
You're wearing out that note
You scream until it's gone
You scream until it's gone, gone, goneEmbed
