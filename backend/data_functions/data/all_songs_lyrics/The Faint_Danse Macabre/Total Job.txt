Total Job LyricsSharp dressed servers where the upscale dine
A safe dial turned by a glove in the crimes of night
A nurse in an ambulance rides
He don't deserve it, the patient's right
Career
Serious
There are times when I miss the appeal
Long black cars driven close to the lawn
Straight-legged slacks and the shine of the chauffeur's garb
The lawyer with an eloquent tongue
He sways the verdict, the jury is numb
Career
Serious
There are times when I miss the appeal
Energy that pulls us toward it
To feel the total job
No economic success
To get the total jobEmbed
