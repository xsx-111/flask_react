Posed to Death LyricsI feel a warm resistance
Beneath the outer layer
What once moved living organs
Leaks through a thin veneer
Blue blooded royal body
Elegantly posed to death
Not speaking prince now are you?
Not breathing one more breath
Just now the curtain's folding
It falls and lies to rest
So selfish royal brother
You've loved your wife to death
Your ways could not continue
You'd rule with hateful hands
I called you toward the staircase
And I caused your violent endEmbed
