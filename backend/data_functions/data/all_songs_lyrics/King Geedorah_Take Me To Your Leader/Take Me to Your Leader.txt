Take Me to Your Leader Lyrics
Paper. All day, in ways that people never think of

International Paper-

Hey, I made a funny!

Very funny

I wasn’t gettin’ good marks in reading-

Stupid

Poor girl

What is wrong with you?!
You're sick

Ho- hold on- I was only following orders, I WAS ONLY FOLLOWING ORDERS!
You little punk!
It’s not a joke, kid
Oi!
Don’t let your overconfidence get you killed, those men are dangerous!

He may have a face like a waffle iron, but he got a heart of gold

My little friend here is the only one who understands me

Take me to your leader

You can go to hell

What?

Nothing

Violence. Violence and power will rule!
Yeah

Brain death will follow in four minutes

The children will need some means of defending themselves

Well, I’ll be damned! We could blow up a whole army with these babies!

That may be so. I do appreciate it, but I have no use for weapons
My fists pack one million volts!
Pardon me1Embed
