No Snakes Alive (Take Me to Your Leader Version) Lyrics
“Hahahahahaha!”

Geedorah has arrived, you guys could take five
By the time it’s over, no snakes alive
Take the dive, I’m telling you, you’re better off
Then up against the flow that make her take her sweater off
From the setoff, when it came to scripts, he could hardly brag
It’s the result of concentration and lollygag
I said, “Yeah right.”  He pulled a mic out a snotty rag
Was sealed up air-tight, and wrapped up in a body bag
Get an advance and catch chance writer’s block
After spending the first and last penny, my own worst enemy
Tell me if I’m OD and usual flow
And made deals with these cats who keep sending dough, so
The Three-Headed set it, never get busted
He’s a man of his word who’s not to be trusted
Beats encrypted, multi-faceted, encrusted
Sweaty palm, keep mic rusted
*Sort of mellow type of fellow
Who sometimes spaz on wife like Othello
Hell no.  He won’t use words like Illuminati
Or Gotti or shotty, he might use karate
Azar the Gaza caught cut, I’ll ask why
A mask with the ball-style caps saying, “That’s fly”
Exact dough ‘til it stack high
White hoe, black guy, the rap game black eye
Exhilaration, Jet Jag’s accelerations
Touch speeds minds can’t conceive
Achieve altered altitudes and angles, angels answer aura
Illumination awesome, interpretation awkward
Alarm, ankle house arrest
Who’s best?  Monsta Island Czars
Crush pawn dreams to be king
A frank reality, calculation could never be
Quest destined, distant competition dusted
Disgusted, race for second, crowded, clouded
Confusion, conclusion: simple, plain
Self-education, self-made millionaires
Serpents slithering, sidewinds searching
Stalking, heat-sensing, can’t have me
Jet Jag’s Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, superhero
Hit zero to sixty, hot pursuit, pedal to the floor
Handling lyrics, traction
Swerving left, right
Making head-fakes
Playing high stakes
Levitates
Quick!  Hit breaks, they fly past, hit wall, parts
Fly loose, killer mongoose

Fake niggas continue to practice the art of intimidation
Sterile minds conceiving thought for artificial insemination
Syntax the sequence, arranging lessons so deliberate
Making wise words clear, but population stay illiterate
Consider it, Gods refine power, fools get rid of it
Men build dreams on promises but lacking the will to deliver it
Yo, I dissolve connivers like saliva on tic-tacs
Gone astray, but get the job done like socks that’s mismatched
Flip tracks, murder snakes, drunk niggas killing six packs
Choking on venom, suffering tricknological kickbacks
Poverty-stricken minds with thoughts barely worth two cents
Build history through time, linear design on blueprints
A nuisance lies in disguise, Eighty-Five Percent never knew
Wise men arise and pull files like Internal Revenue
Forever true, opposing self-evidence with leverage
Upset the beast belly, concoct homogenized beverage
Clever shit, calculated sabotage, Trojan Horse
Giftwrapped ambush, lethal energy in motion that grows in force
Trojan swords strategically aligned throughout the underworld
God of Elevation kill Superman, rape Wondergirl
Fictitious character decapitated, fake beings susceptible
To everyday occurrence, a fatal outcome’s inevitable
Might as well join the force, boss
Chance?  Take a loss like a coin-toss
Roll with a double-headed nickel
While the partner Jet Jag with the sickle, you in a pickle
King Geedorah, your ass better leave him alone
‘Fore he cold-catch a seizure and leave you blown
If he ain’t the best, he’s the best in
The top three out of myself, I, and me
Put on your thinking caps
Or act like you had a slight inkling perhaps
Or get smacked back in the ring like Bob Backlund
Ink jet-black, you wack

“Hahahahahaha!”
“Hey, what’s the meaning of this?”
“Shut up!”
“Hahahahahahahaha, young man”7Embed
