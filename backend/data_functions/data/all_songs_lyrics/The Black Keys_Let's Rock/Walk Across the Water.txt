Walk Across the Water Lyrics
I can barely wait to get a hold on you
I wanna feel the one who has my love
Always come a runnin' when you want me to
I put no one else above
Only one Iâ€™m dreaming of

Your sugar coated love has got a hold on me
You know you do it to me every time
Got me seeing colors that I never could see
Now I got a one track mind

Rivers run into the ocean
Oceans run into the blue
Look around at all the commotion
Then I walk across the water for you

Clown around forever in the summer time
Down around the deep blue sea
Me and you together for the longest ride
From here to eternity
Feels just like a dream to me
Rivers run into the ocean
Oceans run into the blue
Look around at all the commotion
Then I walk across the water for you
Then I walk across the water for you3Embed
