Every Little Thing Lyrics
When you look into the mirror
Do your secrets start to show?
You been holding onto something that you wish you didn't know
Every little thing that you do
Is always gonna come back to you

So put your hand into the hair of someone that you love
Petty fate, or a hand, anything you’re dreaming of
Every little thing that you do
Is always gonna come back to you

Hold on
Count your blessings
Road's long and it ain't always smooth
Every little thing that you do
Is always gonna come back to you

Build a house, fill it up
Make your part, making love
Doin’ right, doin' wrong
Livin' life like a song
Every little thing that you do
Is always gonna come back to you
Hold on
Count your blessings
The road's long and it ain't always smooth
Every little thing that you do
Is always gonna come back to you
Oh, back to you


Hold on
Count your blessings
The road's long and it ain't always smooth
Every little thing that you do
Is always gonna come back to you

Oh, back to you
Back to you
Back to youEmbed
