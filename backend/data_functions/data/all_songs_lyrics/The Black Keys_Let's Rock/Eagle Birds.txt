Eagle Birds Lyrics
See twin eagle birds up in the tree
One for you and there's one for me
When we thought we might be losing our minds
We saw the signs

Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody oughta be loved sometime

Feel you simmer down in the pan
Feed me dinner right out of your hand
All night long, I had you on my mind
Flying high

Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody oughta be loved sometime
She love me right (Woo)


You can search forever, you might never find
A love so real that will heal like mine
Eagle bird, I heard you fly on by
Late last night
Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody oughta be loved
Don't nobody wanna be lonely
Everybody wanna be loved sometime

She love me right
Flying high with you and I1Embed
