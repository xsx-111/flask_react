Under the Gun Lyrics
Leaving now, all I have is all I own
I'm hoping it’s all I need
Ran me down and the love was like a rolling stone
Only way out was to leave

On the road but I'm on the run
It ain't no fun when you’re under the gun
We made a deal but the dealer won and I'm under the gun
Calling the sun down, I'm under the gun now

My darkest hour, locked inside my lonely room
Counting the cracks on the wall
Pretty flowers, I still smell the sweet perfume
Then I make a mess of it all

On the road but I'm on the run
It ain't no fun when you're under the gun
We made a deal but the dealer won and I'm under the gun
Calling the sun down, I'm under the gun now

I drive the interstate, rode just like thunder shook
I’d get out from under if I could
Calling the sun down, I’m under the gun now
On the road but I'm on the run
It ain’t no fun when you're under the gun
We made a deal but the dealer won and I'm under the gun
On the road but I'm on the run
It ain’t no fun when you're under the gun
We made a deal but the dealer won and I'm under the gun
Calling the sun down, I'm under the gun now
Calling the sun down, I'm under the gun nowEmbed
