Breaking Down Lyrics
I went out on the town and I stumbled
I got caught in the trap, I was humbled
Bag of bones, sat alone in the deep blue
Pull me up, you don't know what I've been through
It was so cruel

When your heart's been aching
When you can't escape it
Don't you feel like breaking down?

Took a trip on the skip in the ocean
Sunk my ship like a brick, I was sulking
Caught a ride on the tide of your lovin'
Spun me 'round, ran aground, next to nothing
Ain't it something?

When your heart's been aching
When you can't escape it
Don't you feel like breaking down?

When the earth is shaking
And your soul's been taken
Don't you feel like breaking down?
Breaking down
When your heart's been aching
When you can't escape it
Don't you feel like breaking down?
