Tell Me Lies Lyrics
Burn, baby burn
You live and learn every time along the way
Lies, tellin' lies
Hypnotize, disguising things you say

Tell me lies
Tell me all your pretty lies
Tell me lies
La-la-la-la-la-la-lies

Words, tiny words
Takin' turns ever burnin' memories
On, moving on
Moving on 'cause it's only make believe

Tell me lies
Tell me all your pretty lies
Tell me lies
La-la-la-la-la-la-lies

Every woman who's ever loved you is telling you lies
Everyone who's ever loved you would never deny
Tell me lies
Tell me all your pretty lies
Tell me lies
La-la-la-la-la-la-lies
Tell me lies
La-la-la-la-la-la-liesEmbed
