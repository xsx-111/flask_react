Lo/Hi Lyrics
Woo!

Out on a limb in the wind of a hurricane
Down at the bar like a star in the howlin' rain

Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
If you die, nobody will hug you
No one to answer your prayer

You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low, high, high, low

One at a time, get in line for the masquerade
Drink 'til you cry and you're lyin' in the mess you made

Nobody to love you
Nobody to care
Nobody to drug you
No one to hold back your hair
You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low, high, high, low


Ah
Woo! Woo!

You get low (Low) like a valley
Then high (High) like a bird in the sky
You get low (Low) 'cause you're angry
Low (Low), high (High), high, low
Low (Low), high (High), high, low
Low (Low), high (High), high, low4Embed
