Get Yourself Together Lyrics
I'll go, I'll go wherever you go
Don't care, I'm here, I want you to know
Don't run, we'll make time and take it real slow
I'll go, I'll go wherever you go
I'm with you, whatever you do

You gotta get yourself together, babe
Try to keep it cool
You wanna make it last forever maybe
Get behind the new
You gotta get yourself together, babe
Keep your motor clean
You wanna make it burn forever, baby
I'm your gasoline
Oh, no, no, no

I'll do, I'll do whatever you do
Love me and I'll be lovin' on you
Treat me sweetly like I want you to
And I'll do, I'll do whatever you do
You can choose, make up all the rules

You gotta get yourself together, babe
Try to keep it cool
You wanna make it last forever maybe
Get behind the new
You gotta get yourself together, babe
Keep your motor clean
You wanna make it burn forever, baby
I'm your gasoline
Oh, no, no, no
I'll go, I'll go wherever you go
Don't care, I'm here, I want you to know
Don't mind, we'll make time and take it real slow
I'll go, I'll go wherever you go
I'm with you, whatever you do

You gotta get yourself together, babe
Try to keep it cool
You wanna make it last forever maybe
Get behind the new
You gotta get yourself together, babe
Keep your motor clean
You wanna make it burn forever, baby
I'm your gasoline
Oh, no, no, no

Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no, no
Oh, no, no. no1Embed
