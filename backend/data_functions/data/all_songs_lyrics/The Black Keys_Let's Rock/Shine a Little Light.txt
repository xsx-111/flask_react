Shine a Little Light Lyrics
Do you feel like you're the only one living on a prayer?
Have you ever tried to love someone who wasn't even there?

No one really knows
Where it goes from here
But we all decompose
And slowly disappear

If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

Go to places that you used to go
But they don't feel the same
See the faces that you used to know
But they forget your name

No one really knows
Where it goes from here
But we all decompose
And slowly disappear
If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
I'm waiting, praying, patiently
Shine a little light on my soul1Embed
