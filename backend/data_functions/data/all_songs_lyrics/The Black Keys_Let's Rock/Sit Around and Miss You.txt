Sit Around and Miss You Lyrics
We used to play pretend
You and me thought it might never end
Now I wonder where you been
I sit around and miss you

The fireflies would glow
Turning all the darkness to a show
Oh, what made us let it go?
I sit around and miss you

I miss you awful bad now
I miss the friend I had now
I miss you

Now when it's getting dark
I walk beside our ghosts out in the park
Oh, we sure did leave our mark
I sit around and miss you

I miss you awful bad now
I miss the friend I had now
I miss you
I sit around and miss youEmbed
