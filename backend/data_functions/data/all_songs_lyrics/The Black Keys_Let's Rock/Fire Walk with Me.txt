Fire Walk with Me Lyrics
Fire walk with me
I'm tired as I can be
Bruised, my weary soul
Flames now take control

Fire light the way
Burn the night to day
Bathe in afterglow
Everywhere I go

Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream
Feeling that fire walk with me

Fire in the sky
Burning ball of light
The heavens are ablaze
Flames are like a maze

Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream
Feeling that fire walk with me
Roll on fire
Higher and higher
Living in a fever dream
Feeling that fire walk
Burning up every thought
Feeling that fire walk with meEmbed
