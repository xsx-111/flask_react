Crazy About You Lyrics
Trust is a weird thing
Make you crazy, make you jealous
Make you wish you hadn't said a thing
And I guess I have been mean
But I'm only second guessing you
'Cause you won't even let me through

And I want to be happy
And I only want you
If you think that I'm crazy
I'm just crazy about you
Crazy 'bout you

And love is a wonderful thing
Make you want to, make you need to
Make you wish you hadn't said a thing
Baby I, I have been mean
But I'm only second guessing you
'Cause you won't even let me through

And I want to be happy
And I only want you
If you think that I'm crazy
I'm just crazy about you
I'm just crazy about you
Crazy about you, ah
Crazy about youEmbed
