My Hometown Lyrics
On back down in my hometown
Everybody's feeling it bad
No new breaks, whatever it takes
Not to have to sway it on a classified ad

Hey there Ma and Pa here I am
Money's running out all the same
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again

Up real late in New York state
Talking to my baby at night
She keeps me warm and protects me from harm
Love just keeps on rolling when the money gets tight

Hey there Ma and Pa where I am
Money's running out all the same
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again

Oh Mrs. Memory just take me on down
Back to the shanties and the cars by the lake
Oh Mrs. Memory just take me on back
Back to my baby and make it okay
Yeah just make it okay
On back down in my hometown
Everybody's feeling the same
Good money spent on keeping the rent
Sent in to the man under a week late

Hey there Ma and Pa were I am
Money's running out all the same
I just close my eyes and bring it on home again
I just close my eyes and bring it on home againEmbed
