Paper Moon Lyrics
I go walking under a paper moon
And all the birds are singing
Singing you a pretty tune
All the constellations and all the stars above
They all start to whistling
They start singing along

The world is but a monster and I'm not scared at all
I'm floating through the heavens, the world is in my arms

Oh, rainy day don't follow me
'Cause I'm her baby doll, she's my cup of tea

I go walking under a paper moon
And my eyes are made of crystals
And plastic flowers bloom
All the leaves are changing and the skies are blue
All the seasons of distraction
Can't take the smile God's given you
The world is but a monster and I'm not scared at all
I'm floating through the heavens, the world is in my arms

Oh, rainy day don't follow me
'Cause I'm her baby doll, she's my cup of tea

Love takes care of love
Hate just burns you out
Love takes care of love
Hate just burns you out
Love takes care of love
Hate just burns you out
Love takes care of love
Hate just burns you out
Love takes care of love
Hate just burns you out
Love takes care of love
Hate just burns you outEmbed
