Mirror, Mirror Lyrics
Mirror, mirror
Up on the wall in the back of the room
As I walk down the hall in the house where I stayed
Tell me something
About what I saw in the face of a man
Who once felt it all but feels nothing today

Knock knock - who's there
I don't know, I can't say
Ask me tomorrow I'll tell you the same

But ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
Ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now

Trouble trouble
Down in my hood where it's well understood
They love when you're bad and they hate when you're good
Tell me something
About who we are at the end of our days
When our souls become one but our lives separate
Knock knock - who's there
I don't know I can't say
Ask me tomorrow I'll tell you the same

But ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
Ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
It's bound to make you smile

Well ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
Ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
Ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
Ooh, I'm telling you now
I'm telling you now
It's bound to make you smileEmbed
