Jacksonville Skyline Lyrics
Banks of the river run through my hometown
As a boy I ran the dirt roads and I scraped my knees
Well, they paved the roads eventually
With neon signs and car dealerships and diners

The soldiers fill the hotels on the weekends
I saw the pretty women as I walked through town

Well, I moved away soon as I turned sixteen
Figured I was old enough to go and work a job
Well, I floated down main street, pools of car lights
Overcame me wishing I was still back home

The soldiers fill the hotels on the weekends
I saw the pretty women as I walked through town

Well, Jacksonville's a city with a hopeless streetlight
Seems like you're lucky, if it ever change from red to green
I was born in an abundance of inherited sadness
And fifty cent picture frames bought at a five and dime
I ended up a soldier on the weekend
Looking for a vacancy I was unable to find
Somewhere the night sky hangs like a blanket
Shoot it with my cap gun just to make it seem like starsEmbed
