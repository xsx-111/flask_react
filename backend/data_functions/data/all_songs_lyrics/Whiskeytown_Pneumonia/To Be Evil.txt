To Be Evil Lyrics
To be evil is to be scared
Withholding all the things too sacred to be shared
Too many vultures and things to keep alive
Holding ransom on my peace of mind
That God is gonna give to me, in time

To be evil is to be blessed
With the sweet sin, self-duress that only love can quarantine
Too many vultures and songs I got to sing
To keep me locked into a prayer
That God is gonna take us there
While I'm waiting here online
Feeling evil
All the while

1-2-3-4 everything is beautiful
5-6-7-8 gotta love to learn to hate
A-B-C-D I'm a little old machine
L-O-V-E is gonna be the death of me
Ah-ah

I'm not evil
I'm just scared
I'm not evil
I'm just scared
I'm not evil
I'm just scaredEmbed
