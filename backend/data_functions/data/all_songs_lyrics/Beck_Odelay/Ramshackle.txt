Ramshackle Lyrics
You've been so long
Your blind eyes are gone
Your old bones are on their own
So take off your coat
Put a song in your throat
Let the dead beats pound all around

We will go
Nowhere we know
We don't have to talk at all
Hand me downs
Flypaper towns
Stuck together, one and all

The bargains you drive
Buckets and bags
And all your belongings
Your train's in the sand
Ramshackle Land
Let the rats watch the races

We will go
Nowhere we know
'Til we find our one and all
Hand me downs
Flypaper towns
Stuck together, one and all
Praises get spent
Your trick face is bent
Pigsties and prizes
'Cause there's no kind of wealth
You're suiting yourself
You leave yourself behind

We will go
Nowhere we know
'Til we find our one and all
Hand me downs
Flypaper towns
Stuck together, one and allEmbed
