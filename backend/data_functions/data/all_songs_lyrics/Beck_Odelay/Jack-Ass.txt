Jack-Ass Lyrics
I've been drifting along
In the same stale shoes
Loose ends tying a noose
In the back of my mind

If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together
It's a strange invitation

When I wake up
Someone will sweep up my lazy bones
And we will
Rise in the cool of the evening

I remember the way that you smiled
When the gravity shackles were wild
And something is vacant
When I think it's all beginning

I've been drifting along
In the same stale shoes
Loose ends tying a noose
In the back of my mind
If you thought that you were making your way
To where the puzzles and pagans lay
I'll put it together
It's a strange invitation4Embed
