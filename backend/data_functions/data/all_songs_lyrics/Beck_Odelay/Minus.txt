Minus Lyrics
The last survivor of a boiled crown
Another casualty with the casual frown
The janitor vandals, they bark in your face
Juveniles with the piles and paste

It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage glasses
With the crutches of frogs

Don't be confused when the fuse is up
And you're taking a leak into your brother's cup
When the cup is filled you can run and be killed
In the billion miles of the muscles that build

Radiation
Feeling the force
Karaoke
Vomiting morons

The scalps of zero hear the call
Rubbing in a blind man's goddamn hall
With the canker sores and the robot pills
Throwing imbeciles on the window sills
It's a sensation
A bankrupt corpse
In the garbage glasses
With the crutches of frogs
Frogs
