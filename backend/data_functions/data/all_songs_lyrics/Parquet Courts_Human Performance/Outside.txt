Outside Lyrics
I saw a name in the graveyard that I knew
Glowing, like the neon in a lounge light
Spelled just the same as the twinge that crawls through you
As it passes slowly through a fast night
Dear everything I've harmed, the fault lies on my tongue
And I take it holy as a last rite
I picked away all the gray hairs that I'd grown
That remained on the

Outside
And I'm wound tight
And bound by
The secrets you saved, the pieces you kept
They've risen and slept without you

I tried to break all the objects that I threw
When I kept the tidiness of town life
I tried to sing all the verses that I knew
Of it, screaming softly in a loud mic
How do I blame all my carelessness on you?
Tell me, taking is mostly what it sounds like (Sounds like)
Hard words to sing but I laughed 'cause they were true
And it's seen on the
Outside
I'm wound tight
And bound by
The pieces you saved, the secrets you kept
They've risen and slept without youEmbed
