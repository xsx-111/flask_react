I Was Just Here Lyrics
My keys don't work
This knob don't turn
My eyes feel like
Cigarette burnt
I'll cut my hair
But I don't care
I'll brush my teeth
That's good for me
Apologies
It's been two weeks
Should I unwind
And go to sleep?
Creature comforts
Straight from the source

I was just here
I was just here

My mind's worn out
Without a doubt
A cancelled plan
You understand
Just stopping by
Another time
I must have lost
My train of thought
You look so nice
Chinese fried rice
Wouldn't you know
That place just closed?
I was just here
I was just here
I was just here
I was just here
I was just here1Embed
