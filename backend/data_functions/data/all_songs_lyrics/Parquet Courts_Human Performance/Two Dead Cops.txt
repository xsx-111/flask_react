Two Dead Cops Lyrics
Framed plant portrait on the wall
Christmas commercials, how many times
Somebody shouted "Last call"
And I knew he means it, at least this night
Stained white sweater, fluorescent light
One quarter short, get me next time
Somebody shouted "Get outside"
And we fell in rank to watch him bolt by
"Where the fuck is he?" "Down the stairs"
"What did he look like?" "Dark and tall"
Somebody shouted "They had it coming!" and
Bang! Bang!

Protect you
Is what they say, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do
Yeah, protect you
Is what they say, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do
When shots are heard, when lives are lost
Nobody cries in the ghetto for two dead cops
Off duty portrait cracked from the cold
Guadalupe candle, no permit for fire
Bears holding hearts and some a rose
Said a police bastard, "We lost two lives"
G train delayed, what else is new?
B43 dead, called a car
Tompkins is blocked  and there's helicopters
Flood lights and guards
Somebody follows you home in the dark
Can't look back, all the gates are down
He could do anything, there's no one around
Plant a bag in my pants

Protect you
Is what they want, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do
Protect you
Is what they want, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do
Yeah, protect you
Is what they say, but
Point and shoot
Is what they do
Protect you
Is what they say, but
Point and shoot
Nobody cries in the ghetto for two dead copsEmbed
