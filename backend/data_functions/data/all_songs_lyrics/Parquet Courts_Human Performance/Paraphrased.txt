Paraphrased Lyrics
Paraphrased
Can't be quoted, it's hard to say
Paralyzed
Doesn't move, it just blinks its eyes
Paranoid
Just another trap to avoid
Parallel
Never crosses, goes straight as hell

It's child-like persuading
It's night-time lactating
It's pre-season training
Object!
A doorman's composure
A patient's disclosure
Imposter's exposure
Subject!

Understood
No confusion, you said it good
Undeclared
Doesn't know if it's 'live or dead
Undesired
Cannot see that its charm's expired
Unconcerned
When interest cannot be returned
It's christened, the entry
It's paid off this century
It's here, evidently
Object!
An actor portraying
A cleric obeying
Informer betraying
Subject!

Sometimes my
Thoughts are infrequent explosions
Sometimes I
Drop definitions from my words
Sometimes my
Speech recalls moments of violence
Sometimes I
Can't be repeated, I can't be paraphrased, no!Embed
