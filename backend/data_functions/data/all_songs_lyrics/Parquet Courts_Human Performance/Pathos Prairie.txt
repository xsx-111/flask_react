Pathos Prairie Lyrics
Faster than hope flies cold through my veins
Faster than cruelty could drain it out
I commit crimes and I call them mistakes
Nothing denies like a heart in doubt
This I know! People flow like streams where I bathe
Then drift along to a foreign place
The past like a servant that bends for our sake
Into the lines we tell it to trace

Like how we are wired
Like how we decide
Like how we are taught, like how we are not
Like how we hide ourselves in vain

Laughter in sunshine, laughter in pain
Keeps pace of heart in an honest life
But after the fondness for life is erased
What races on in my soul besides
Rabid mutts that fight and fuck and howl till they faint
They too run on when the moon is lit
Faster than love turns itself into rage
Faster than I attempt to forget
Like how we desire
Like how we embrace
Like how we give up, like how we make love
Like how we taste when we spit away


Like how we are wild
Like how we are pure
Like how we despise, like how we tell lies
Like how we're sure that we're gonna change
That we're gonna change
That we're gonna change1Embed
