One Man No City Lyrics
Where I'm from, when no one lived there
I look back now, nothing's changed
Where I'm from now, still no one lives there
Look back again and lock the door
Yeah I maintain, I still remain
One man solitary and no city
One man solitary and no city
One man solitary and no city

"Cogito ergo sum" people say
But think again 'cause I have no faith
I find building blocks filled with nothing
Seen an ink blot page and I said nothing
Outside? I'll check it out, there's just a mirror
Look back now, an empty page
Yet I maintain, I still remain
One man solitary and no city
One man solitary and no city
One man solitary and no city


No town and no city
No identity and no city
No thoughts, no feelings, and no city
No you, just me, I think, and no city
No words I speak and no city
No outside and no city
Nothing at all and no city
No way home and no city
No relief and no city
No sympathy and no city
No understanding and no city
There's no one else and no city
Yeah I maintain, I still remain
One man solitary and no city
