Keep It Even Lyrics
There's a drawer in my house that I try to keep closed
But it's open
There's a commitment that I made to be somewhere
But it's broken
An oblique mantra in my head
It lies there on the floor like a bed
That would collapse like a trap
If it was spoken

You gotta keep it even
Even when you're uptight
Even when you're happy

Even when you're reaching for some
Line I've had in mind, it's been repressed over time
So I'm breathing
Seduced by an excuse that could not be made
But I'm speaking


There's a phone with a number that I try not to call
But it's ringing
For someone I've tried to keep to myself
But I'm singing
It's logic that's twisted and paraphrased
And justified by a distance
That separates a bond
Bound of persistence
Yeah, huh, you
You gotta keep it even
Even when you're uptight
Even when you're happy

Even when you're reaching for
That drawer in my house that I try to keep closed
But it's openEmbed
