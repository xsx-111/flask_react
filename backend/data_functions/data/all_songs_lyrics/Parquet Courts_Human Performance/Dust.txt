Dust Lyrics
It comes through the window
It comes through the floor
It comes through the roof
And it comes through the door

Dust is everywhere
Sweep
Sweep
Dust is everywhere
Sweep

It sneaks in ignored
It stacks up around
It follows, now swallow
You're biting it now

Suffocate, suffocating
Breathe
Dust is everywhere
Sweep

It comes through the window
It comes through the floor
It comes through the roof
And it comes through the door
Dust is everywhere
Sweep
Sweep
Dust is everywhere
