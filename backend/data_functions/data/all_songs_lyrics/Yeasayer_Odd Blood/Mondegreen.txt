Mondegreen Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Tune in, tune in, tune in, tune in (on the floor)

I just can't justify your love
Tryin' on different hands to fit my glove
I'm just too scared to watch TV
'Cause in the glass, static's all I see
Melted face ... (?)
And in the mirror speaking tongues
As I hear a siren drivin' by
I can't wake up, I try and I try

Everybody sugar in my bed
Everybody clouds up in my head
Everybody disastrous
Everybody's all after us
Everybody everybody everybody everybody...
 (x2)
Everybody's talkin' 'bout me and my baby
Makin' love til the mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin' mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin'
1, 2, 3, 4; 3, 4
5, 6; 3, 4, 5, 6; 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4
5, 6; 3, 4, 5, 6; 3, 4, 5, 6; 3, 4
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

I just can't justify my thoughts
Draw symbols on the carpet parking lots
Perhaps the pollen in the air
But discos turns into a state fair
Poppin' pills to stay awake
But all them pills just make me shake
I shiver, shout and run about
But all the time I want to cry out

Everybody sugar in my bed
Everybody clouds up in my head
Everybody disastrous
Everybody's all after us
Everybody everybody everybody everybody...
 (x2)
Everybody's talkin' 'bout me and my baby
Makin' love til the mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin' mornin' light
Makin' love til the mornin'
 (x2)
Be my sunshine, when the dark clouds rumble
And together we can, try to avoid trouble
And we'll run to somewhere, where the grass grows greener
And the water's clearer, and our blood flows cleanerEmbed
