Grizelda LyricsI know, I know, I know
Every hour of the day
There's a whisper inside of her brain
Telling me who to kill
Telling me who will live
I'd do what she says so I'd do what you will
I'll do what you say, now do what you will
I'd do it again
Again, again, again
(I'll love love love you again)
I know, I know, I know
Every hour you're awake
They'll be upping the price on your head
And now you're in reach
So watch where you sleep
They'll search day and night, can't forget what you did
You'll put up a fight don't regret how you lived
A means to an end
End, end, end
(I'll love love love you again)
Step inside the box
Pretend we won't, don't scream again, no
Go to sleep
We'll surely find you now
Really thenEmbed
