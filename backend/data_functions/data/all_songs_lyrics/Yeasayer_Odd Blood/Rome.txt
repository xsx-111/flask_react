Rome LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah
When you see me, better make a phone call
'Cause I'm a bad brained gravel throated fiend with no time at all
But just know that, I'll drown in sorrow
When I deposit your body in the dovecote, darlin', tomorrow
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
I'd sorta like to cross the Rubicon and battle for it
I paint my face red, but I'm wearing purple
I'm a gladiator, high-heeled, opium-fueled, in a bubble
Take, take, take, take
I take the gold plate, and silver metal
Heat it up, melt it down to a soup and help you to swallow
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
I'd sorta like to cross the Rubicon and battle for it
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of
It's just a matter of time
There's no mistaking that
Rome is gonna be mine
It's just a matter ofEmbed
