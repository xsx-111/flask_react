I Remember Lyrics
I remember making love on a Sunday
Bright floating hearts in a fresh cut grass in May, woah
I remember making out on an airplane
Still afraid of flying, but with you I'd die today, woah
I remember the smell of your skin forever
Love us being stupid together, woah

You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time

I remember Monday making your eyes red
Still don't know what it is that I said, woah
I remember thinking this would never end
Even when you're gone, your eyes running through my head, woah

You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time
You're stuck in my mind
All the time1Embed
