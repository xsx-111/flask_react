Strange Reunions Lyrics
Don't ask me for any favors, and I won't ask how you do it
Leave me alone now
'Cause after all now
Dealing with you is a nuisance

Ever since I was young I've been wondering this
Why we walk on eggshells 'round the holy dimwitted
And if, if your tongue slips, you might have to take to task
At all of our hallowed institutions

Don't ask me for any favors, and I won't ask how you do it
Leave me alone now
'Cause after all now
Dealing with you is a nuisance

If you could laugh at yourself, what difference would it make?
You could ignore Dane cartoonists and you wouldn't turn into prey
But if distance persists, we'll preach to choirs, raising ire
Well, needless, I will raise a celebration

This feud is getting old
No one is gonna be told to go along
Most of our questions have easy answers
Our only chance is let them be wrong
Don't ask me for any favors, and I won't ask how you do it
Leave me alone now
'Cause after all now
Dealing with you is a nuisanceEmbed
