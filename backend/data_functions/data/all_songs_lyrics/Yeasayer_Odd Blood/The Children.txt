The Children Lyrics
We are children and we'll give you trouble
If we don't like what you're doing and we think that it is wrong
Now we're satisfied, but when we're not
We are taking lives and making drones

(?) The world that came from us
It makes the child
Dadada da da da dadada da dada da da
Dadada da da da dadada da dada da da

We are children, not the youth, not kids
It is not time to pretend my friend, this might just be the end
Shadow life that sits outside your door
We live inside your walls, we leak through floors

(?) The world that came from us
It makes the child
Dadada da da da dadada da dada da da
Dadada da da da dadada da dada da daEmbed
