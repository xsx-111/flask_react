Madder Red Lyrics(Ooh)
Even when my luck is down
I take joy in knowing that our love grows
But if my vices are a burden
Please don't let me off
Cast me from your home
(Ooh)
'Cause lately I've wronged you
And not been on your side, love
Maybe I've been gone
Please don't ask me why
I turn away just when you want me
And I know that home is where you want me
There's not much for me there
Never gave a thought to an honorable living
Always had sense enough to lie
It's getting hard to keep pretending
I'm worth your time
(Ooh)
Never gave a thought to an honorable living
Always had sense enough to lie
It's getting hard to keep pretending
I'm worth your time
'Cause lately I've wronged you
And not been on your side, love
Maybe I've been gone
Please don't ask me why
Please don't ask me why
Please don't ask me why
Please don't ask me why3Embed
