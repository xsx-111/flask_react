Ambling Alp Lyrics
Now kid, I know I haven't been a perfect man
And I've avoided doing things I know I can
But if I've learned one thing to tattoo on my arm
Or burn into my thumb
It would be that

You must stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done

Oh Max Schmeling was a formidable foe
But Ambling Alp was, too, at least that's what I'm told
But if you learn one thing, you've learned it well
In June you must give fascists hell
They'll run but they can't hide

You must stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
And when those thunder clouds are crying in the skies, in the skies
And when those fireflies keep shining in your eyes, in your eyes
Keep your mind on the time, with your ass on the line
Keep your fleet feet sliding to the side, to the side

Now, the world can be an unfair place at times
But your lows will have their complement of highs
And if anyone should cheat you
Take advantage of, or beat you
Raise your head and wear your wounds with pride

You must stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done
Stick up for yourself, son
Never mind what anybody else done7Embed
