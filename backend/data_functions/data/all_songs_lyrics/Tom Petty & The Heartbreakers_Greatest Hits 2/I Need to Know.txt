I Need to Know Lyrics
Well, the talk on the street says you might go solo
Good friend of mine saw you leavin' by your back door

I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Because I don't know how long I can hold on
If you're making me wait, if you're leadin' me on
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)

Who would've thought that you'd fall for his line
All of a sudden, it's me on the outside

I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Because I don't know how long I can hold on
If you're making me wait, if you're leadin' me on
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Baby, I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
If you think you're gonna leave, then you better say so
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Because I don't know how long I can hold on
If you're making me wait, if you're leadin' me on
I need to know (I need to know)
I need to know (I need to know)
Baby, I need to knowEmbed
