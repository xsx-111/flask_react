Listen to Her Heart Lyrics
You think you're gonna take her away
With your money and your cocaine
You keep thinking that her mind is gonna change
But I know everything is okay

She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving
But she don't need you

You want me to think that I'm being used
You want her to think it's over
You can't see it doesn't matter what you do
Buddy, you don't even know her

She's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving
But she don't need you

And you just can't creep up behind her
And you can't understand that she's my girl
She's my girl
Yeah, she's gonna listen to her heart
It's gonna tell her what to do
She might need a lot of loving
But she don't need you3Embed
