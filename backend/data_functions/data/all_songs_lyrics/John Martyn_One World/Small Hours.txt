Small Hours LyricsGonna get on up and fly away
Go on out for another way
And a new day's dawn
Gonna carry on
Keep on loving while your love is strong
Keep on loving 'til your love is gone away
Well you're very very lovely, gonna take you home
They say you'll be my ruin, but I just don't care
'Cause I love you so
I just love you so
Keep on loving 'til your love is gone
Keep on loving while your love is strong
All the wayEmbed
