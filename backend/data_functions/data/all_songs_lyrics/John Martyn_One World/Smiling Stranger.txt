Smiling Stranger LyricsStanding on the corner, got myself in hand
Waiting for the come on
From the come around man
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
Standing at the airport
With the smile of a saviour
Selling off a piece
Of my favourite flavour
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
I'm a smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
Take good care of yourself
And don't you worry so
Love is coming for us all
Soon as we think it will
Life is hard
Yes I know, but it's harder still
Loving a smiling stranger
Standing at the welfare
With the payoff in my hand
Waiting for the gimme
From the much obliged man
Smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every day
I'm a smiling stranger
Smiling stranger every dayEmbed
