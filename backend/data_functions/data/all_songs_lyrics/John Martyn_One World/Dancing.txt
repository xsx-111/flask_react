Dancing LyricsOh darling, it's gonna be late when we get back home
Can you wait till we get back home?
We don't go walking and reeling
And rocking 'round the whole round town
Walking and talking 'round the whole round town
Don't go rolling and rocking 'round the whole round town
Let another man take you home
Let another man take you home
Oh darling, I wanted to leave but I had to stay
Boys wouldn't let me run away
Been walking and reeling
And rocking 'round the whole round town
Been walking and talking 'round the whole round town
Been rolling and a-rocking 'round the whole round town
Let the morning bring me home
Let the morning bring me home
Well, this is alright, go out all night
Well, this is alright, you go out all night
I tell you there's been no romancing
There's been no fancypantsing
I've been dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing
Oh darling, I want you to try to understand
If you're leading the life of a music man
You've got to walk around and reel around
And rock around the whole round town
Walk around, talk around the whole round town
Go rolling and rocking out the whole round town
Till the morning takes you home
Till the morning takes you home
Oh darling, it's gonna be late when we get back home
Can you wait till we get back home?
We don't go walking and reeling
And rocking 'round the whole round town
Walking and talking 'round the whole round town
Don't go rolling and rocking 'round the whole round town
Don't let another man take you home
Don't let another man take you home
Well, this is alright, go out all night
Well, this is alright, go out all night
I tell you there's been no romancing
There's been no fancypantsing
There's been life-enhancing, take-a-chancing
Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing, dancingEmbed
