Strangeland Lyrics
Lover, I remember laying out our map
Throwing our possessions in the van
Your tapes piled on the back seat
And a camera in your hand
Dressed for our arrival in the strangeland

Strangeland blind
You got no reason, you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right, to put things right

We drove across the border as the winter rains ran dry
And only fateful birdsong filled the sky
You threw your head back screaming
As we raced across wet sand
And leapt into the waters of the strangeland

Strangeland blind
You got no reason, you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right, to put things right

You wound the rope around me
And you pulled the knots in tight
And shook me like a bad dream from your sight
And now the things I've done to forget you
Well, it's not what I had planned
The sweetest thoughts get twisted in the strangeland
Strangeland blind
You got no reason, you got no rhyme
You get no time to put things right, to put things
Strangeland dreams
You tore my baby away from me
We get no time to put things right, to put things right
You get no time to put things right, to put things right
To put things right, to put things rightEmbed
