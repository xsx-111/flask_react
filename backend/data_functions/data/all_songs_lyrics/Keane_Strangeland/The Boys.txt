The Boys Lyrics
The boys are grinning from the photograph
It's Friday night and they're trying so hard
The sun is dropping and they want to go
Driving into town to see some girls they know

The boys, blazing on a summer night
Girls they want to watch them ride
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I don't remember
Boys, friends at every bar in town
Running all the good days down
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I don't remember

We felt like fighters when we caught the plane
Until that day we'd never heard its name
We did some things we didn't understand
And now we feel like strangers in our own land

The boys, blazing on a summer night
Girls they want to watch them fight
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I can't remember
Boys, friends at every bar in town
Running all the good days down
Is that the way it was before?
Cause I can't remember
This photograph, I hold it when I sleep
Cause people soon stop asking
When I cannot explain what I have seen
And at the bars in town
All the boys in town
Are running all the good days down
Running all the good days down
Running all the good days down
All the good days down1Embed
