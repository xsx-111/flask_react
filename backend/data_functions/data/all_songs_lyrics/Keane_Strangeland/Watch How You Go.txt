Watch How You Go Lyrics
The more we rush about, the less we do
I never saw you drift away
The more we spin around, the less we move
I never saw your spirit break

I wish that I could be your journey's end
But you were only passing through, yeah
It's not for me to try to steer your way
I wish you well in all you do

Just say you'll watch how you go
Be gracious with your light
And may the years be kind now
Just say you'll mind how you roll
The things that we have shared
Will soon be left behind now

I hope you know that you're a graceful soul
You fill the room with hope and light

It's only right that you should go your way
Cause nothing ever lasts that long
Just say you'll watch how you go
Be gracious with your light
And may the years be kind now
Just say you'll mind how you roll
The things that we have shared
Will soon be left behind now

Behind now
Behind now
Behind now

Just say you'll watch how you go
Be gracious with your light
And may the years be kind now
Just say you'll mind how you roll
The things that we have shared
Will soon be left behind now
The things that we have shared
Will still remain behind nowEmbed
