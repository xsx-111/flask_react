Day Will Come Lyrics
The winter night has wrapped a rag around your eyes
And stolen your sight
Oh, you seem so far away
I hope you'll find your way back someday
I miss you, I miss you

Some days set your world on fire
And some days, they sink like stones

That's when your heart will cry out
Until your body is numb
And the night will try to tempt you
But the day will come

We dream hard, we shoot high
Sometimes our fingers graze the sky
But we can't hold on

Some days set your world on fire
And some days, they sink like stones
That's when your heart will cry out
Until your body is numb
And the night will try to tempt you
But the day will come
Brother, don't hang your head
Until your distance is run
Cause though it seems so far away
You know the day will come

Some days set your world on fire
And some days, they sink like stones

That's when your heart will cry out
Until your body is numb
And the night will try to tempt you
But the day will come
Brother, don't hang your head
Until your distance is run
Cause though it seems so far away
You know the day will comeEmbed
