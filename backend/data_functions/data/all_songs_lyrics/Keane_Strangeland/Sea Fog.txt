Sea Fog LyricsThe sun bleeds in, hear the magpie sing for sorrow
It makes things better
Maybe we'll get to spread our wings tomorrow
If luck will let us
Can anyone fly into these grey skies?
Is there somewhere I'm meant to be
Sea fog comes, like a river rolls a stone
It's rolling me
I missed my turn in the dark
I hear your voice
It makes things easy
I strayed too far from the road
Wish you could always make things easy
And I won't fight through the rising tide
If thatâ€™s the way it has to be
Sea fog comes, like a river rolls a stone
It's rolling me
Sea fog comes, like a river rolls a stone
It's rolling me
Sea fog rolling
Sea fog rolling
Sea fog rollingEmbed
