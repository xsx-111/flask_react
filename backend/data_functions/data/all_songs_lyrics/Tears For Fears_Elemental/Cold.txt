Cold Lyrics
The coldest shoulder cast in metal
Frozen to the bone
To rely on hook, line and sinker
What a sinker, sinking like a stone
You'd be better off alone
She saw me on the television, underneath the sun
Thought that I was warm like a mother, lover, brother
Brother, she was wrong
Me, I don't long to belong
Time stood still with his fingers in his ears
Didn't want to hear it from another bunch of hollow men

Cold, been excommunicated 'cause I'm cold
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold
Bring to me my big old sweater
Nothing more will make me better

I met her on a Monday and my heart did nothing new
Seems she thought of me as some mystic, fatalistic, mystical guru
Me, I haven't got a clue
But floating on a magic carpet high above the earth
In the flood
You can see the world like a Buddha, bread and Buddha
With my blood, I can hold you
Bigger than your hurt
In the flood, with my blood, I can hold you
Don't you know that love is work?
In the flood
King got caught with his fingers in the till
With my blood
Where's your calculator? Will you leave it in your will?
Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold
And Capricorn is rising, yes I'm cold
Listened to my old friend Nockles
Hoped that it would warm the cockles

You can't fight the fear you can't, this is the road you're on
You don't belong to me, you don't belong to any one
Your reputation lies not in your eyes, but those who dare
Will bite the hand that feeds when it don't meet your needs
When you got blood to bleed, you got a life to lead

In the flood, with my blood, I can hold you
In the flood, with my blood, I can hold you
King got caught with his fingers in the till

Cold, been excommunicated 'cause I'm cold
My temperature's been rated and I'm cold
Bring to me my big old sweater
Nothing more will make me better

Cold, no heat on the horizon guess I'm cold
There'll be no compromising, cold
Cool, cold
Stone cold, stone cold, stone cold, stone cold
Stone cold, stone cold, stone cold, stone cold
Cold, cool, cold
Stone cold, stone cold, stone cold, stone cold
Stone cold, stone cold, stone cold, stone cold1Embed
