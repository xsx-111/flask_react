Elemental Lyrics
This race is already run
Get off your horse, get on this train
Hey-a, hey-a, oh
Welcome to the real world
I said, welcome to the real world
Are we rushing like the wind
Naked out and naked in?
Welcome to the free world
I said, welcome to the me world
Are we rushing like the wind?


Put your loving arms around

Did you lose your faith in God, no?
Does your conscience always get you down?
Fall to pieces, rough and tumble
Does your conscience always get you down?

These days it's all in the mind
It's elemental
Don't say you're up when you're down
It's elemental
Put your loving arms around

This your New Year's resolution
Put your loving arms around
Nothing doing revolution
Put your loving arms around

Take another leap in the dark
With a humble heart
Do yourself some good
What did you become?
Patience, be sure
Baby, baby

These days it's all in the mind
It's elemental
Don't say you're up when you're down
It's elemental

These days it's all in the mind
It's elemental
Don't say you're up when you're down
It's elemental
These days it's all in the mind
It's elemental
Don't say you're up when you're down
It's elemental

These days it's all in the mind
It's elemental1Embed
