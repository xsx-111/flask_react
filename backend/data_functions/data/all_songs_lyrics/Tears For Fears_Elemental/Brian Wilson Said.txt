Brian Wilson Said Lyrics
My life, nothing was easy 'til now
Hope like the morning will paint the dawn
More than ordinary
Make it more than merry
Take me to the jamboree
Deep down, deep down, deep, deep down
And shine a light on me
Draw back the curtains and smile
Everything's wow


Girls are ten a penny
Janet, Joy and Jenny, Judy, Joan and Jackie G
Hear me now, I warn you
Girls from California break your heart and set you free
My life


Shame to rely, but I swear it's the best I can do
Like a flame, like an i with a dot I am not you
Call me guilty I swear I'm a man who can fly
Deep down, deep down, deep, deep down
I keep coming back, I'll get back to you
My life, nothing was easy 'til nowEmbed
