Goodnight Song Lyrics
Here on the stage, the time has come
With the strains of "Be my Angel", of rock in two four
Time may keep alive that old swan song
That we've been playing forever
'Til the time may be right to say "goodbye"
My voice is aching
I'm tongue tired
And the sounds we are making are so...

Goodnight song, played so wrong
Blame the crowd, they screamed so loud, so long

Get some honesty
Take the best of me and then the rest let go
In every situation with it's tireless rage
Step outside the cage
And let the real fool show
I should have stayed 'round to break the ice
I thought about it once or twice
But nothing ever changes
Unless there's some pain

And our goodnight song, played so wrong
Blame the crowd, they screamed so loud, so long
Goodnight song, played so wrong
Blame the crowd, they screamed so loud, so long2Embed
