Mind Ya Bidness Lyrics
Me and mine 'bout to shine
Me and mine 'bout to shine

Me and mine 'bout to shine, that's for motherfucking sure
Feeling VIP, fill a zip full of motherfucking smoke
We got brown, we got white and some motherfucking Guinness
And ain't nobody here tripping, so mind ya motherfucking bidness

I run game with the Jeanie, no cheat code
For the fill up, psycho killer like Devo
That shit we burn down in the house you bet not reach fo'
Have a nigga praying to the Lord, Timmy Tebow
I ain't tryna stunt, I post in the back
Can't eat with them niggas, most them niggas is actors
You ain't got no homies, all your homies is rappers
Mines rode for me then and they gon' ride for me after
We got a big ass bong with some big ass blunts
Why you coming around? What your bitch ass want?
Talking 'bout how you know me, no, your snitch ass don't
I done done a bunch a shit that your lil' ass won't

'Cause me and mine 'bout to shine, that's for motherfucking sure
Feeling VIP, fill a zip full of motherfucking smoke
We got brown, we got white and some motherfucking Guinness
And ain't nobody here tripping, so mind ya motherfucking bidness
Me and mine 'bout to shine, that's for motherfucking sure
Feeling VIP, fill a zip full of motherfucking smoke
We got brown, we got white and some motherfucking Guinness
And ain't nobody here tripping, so mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness

Couple spots on the list we 'bout to flip tonight
What we sipping hit a nigga like Kryptonite
Ain't no losing on this side, my outfit survived
If you get in where you fit in, might switch your life
Want my money at the door like C-O-D
Plus the crown hold it down like P-O-P
You in town trying to clown on G-O-D
They gon' shut the shit down, only O-G
I be Hollywood Hawking, I might flex lowkey
I ain't guest list trolling, I pull up, just me
Pumping up how you buffing, bro, you ain't on team
If you ain't fam now, then you ain't gon' be

'Cause me and mine 'bout to shine, that's for motherfucking sure
Feeling VIP, fill a zip full of motherfucking smoke
We got brown, we got white and some motherfucking Guinness
And ain't nobody here tripping, so mind ya motherfucking bidness
Me and mine 'bout to shine, that's for motherfucking sure
Feeling VIP, fill a zip full of motherfucking smoke
We got brown, we got white and some motherfucking Guinness
And ain't nobody here tripping, so mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, mind ya motherfucking bidness
Mind ya motherfucking bidness, bidness, bidness
Uh, bidness, bidness, uh, mind your bidness, bidness
Yo, mind your muhfuckin' bidness, bidness

If y'all niggas can't spell, it's T-O-P
Top notch motherfucker 'til I D-I-E
If y'all niggas can't spell, it's T-O-P
Top notch motherfucker 'til I D-I-E

I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't loseEmbed
