Sunday Mass Lyrics
The Tree of Life
Bullets cut through eleven livin' teens like a butter knife
Nikolas Cruz shot seventeen
An incel snowflake radicalized by hate, straight
Devin Kelley blasted off in the Baptist church
Twenty-six gone from earth, for what it's worth
Stephen Paddock in Vegas murked fifty-eight
Motivation unknown, but his shot was straight
Omar Mateen shot forty-nine at Pulse, gory
Islam and homophobia obfuscated the true story
Fourteen were taken out in San Bernadino
Syed Farook, the culprit, Christmas day, it was lit
Aaron Alexis, a sharp shooter
Used a sawed off, took out a dozen
Left a DC navy yard buzzin'
Dylann Roof, nine down in Charles-town
See white inferiority without a hood and gownEmbed
