Obamacare Lyrics
I'm tryna burn this bitch down, I ain't tryna break in
Fuck your opinion 'bout us, to me don't mean nathan
I brought the wave, brought the rain, brought the lake in
Eyes on the cake and yours is for the takin', wait man
Puffin' Michael Jordan, catch a lot of air
Shuttin' down your city, then we outta there
Everyone can get it like Obamacare
Keep it buddy, they don't want no problems here

Bucket over earlobes, headache under headdress
Grindin' like I'm soon dyin', 'til I'm laid up bed rest
It's Quelle Chris all day shit, I don't need no playlist
Handsome, black, and headstrong, you nervous 'til your nails gone
Step out daddy long legs, Cab Calloway stride
Make a rapper freeze up like I was Zack in Bayside
I be knuckle down, ape, and 'bout my business, back straight
I was never weirdo, they just had to acclimate
Please, they grip the draws like Coppertone dogs
But ain't got shit to say like back when Poppa Doc lost
More reach than Doctor Ock's arms
Crazy, try to play me, you better call Saul
Train of thought on track, R and R my R&R
Floatin' through the fog, off more drugs than a DeBarge
Don't think it wasn't when it was, he's no mirage
This what's happening, it's Rerun, Dwayne, and Raj
I'm tryna burn this bitch down, I ain't tryna break in
Fuck your opinion 'bout us, to me don't mean nathan
I brought the wave, brought the rain, brought the lake in
Eyes on the cake and yours is for the takin', wait man
Puffin' Michael Jordan, catch a lot of air
Shuttin' down your city, then we outta there
Everyone can get it like Obamacare
Keep it buddy, they don't want no problems here

I'm feelin' like a million stacks, how the fuck you do?
Seein' how you livin', bet you probably feel a buck or two
Ho shit insured, sucker-proof, no deductible
Good neighbors with state pharmaceuticals by the bucketloads
That's Big Green like Ferrigno, if you down like feather pillows
We got wax without the earlobes, if you matchin', hold the euros
No tobacco, just the pure smoke, powdered keif lookin' like churros
If you choke up, you get higher, word to Bridget and Dinero
In a far south beach house, ashy ass, knees out
Barrin' up, beats bounce, eatin' steak and eggs 'til my feet gout
Hippy type freak outs with woke whites who beast hype
Droppin' N-words for my nigga friends only black folks can recite
That's free life, thought he wasn't when he was it
Been it from the beginnin', just gettin' better every minute
Smokin' gun, catchin' the killer and creator
Gave 'em two for one, don't thank me later
I'm tryna burn this bitch down, I ain't tryna break in
Fuck your opinion 'bout us, to me don't mean nathan
I brought the wave, brought the rain, brought the lake in
Eyes on the cake and yours is for the takin', wait man
Puffin' Michael Jordan, catch a lot of air
Shuttin' down your city, then we outta there
Everyone can get it like Obamacare
Keep it buddy, they don't want no problems here

Dumpin' Dutchie guts out the window
Keep it buddy, strictly for the kinfolk
Lightin' up the outdoor in the indoor
This ain't for you, this is for the kinfolk
Dumpin' Dutchie guts out the window
Keep it buddy, strictly for the kinfolk
Lightin' up the outdoor in the indoor
This ain't for you, this is for the kinfolk2Embed
