You, Me & Nobody Else Lyrics
Who wanna be peanut butter with the mustard
When you could be honey pudding with the custard?
We living like furs from Sterling with the wing tipped gators
If a hater try to intercept, latter days
Let me count the ways
We stay money like patent leather Js
Told me you love me and right then my whole life changed
That old cliche thought I'd never love again
And in you came
Trust a nigga, take a good situation and burn it down
Yet every time we start walking way we start turning 'round
And every 180 just led to the greater now
I'm feeling like a youth again, Eastlands and Eddie Bauer
Coolwater, durag
We Lamont and Rollo, you pitch a plan, I'ma follow
No schlemiel, no schlimazel
No ordeal we can't body, hell
I put that on everything, my grandmammy and mammy, yeah
You, me and nobody else

Can't be with nobody else
It's you and nobody else
Can't sleep with nobody else
Succeed with nobody else
Get free with nobody else
Co-D with nobody else
Just you and nobody else
You, me, and nobody else
You, me, and nobody else
Can't be with nobody else
You, me, and nobody else
Succeed with nobody else
Get free with nobody else
Co-D with nobody else
Just you and nobody else
You, me, and nobody else
'Cause even on my mind, no question
No second guessing
We'll be the best at being just
We and nobody else
No needing nobody else
'Cause even on my mind, no question
No second guessing
Could be the best at being just
We and nobody else
No needing nobody else

I never would've imagined that we'd be an item
Become a better me for you, good lord knows I'm trying
Every night's a slice of light, every days exciting
No pressure put on to test us could break a diamond
Stop it's shining
You my blessing all the best things
At times when I run a mess, you keep my head clean
Plus the red 100 with the line under it
They say when love is looking you can't hide from it
And now that it found me life worth waking up
To take time for shaping up
And when I win, we win and spend it just how we rake it up
When life is too short to sit and wonder where it's taking us
We grabbin' reigns 'til wheels falling off the bus
High flying, no JAG
We Lamont and Rollo, I pitch a plan and you follow
No schlemiel, no schlimazel
No ordeal we can't body, hell
I put that on everything, my granddaddy and daddy yeah
You, me and nobody else
'Cause even on my mind, no question
No second guessing
We'll be the best at being just
We and nobody else
No needing nobody else
'Cause even on my mind, no question
No second guessing
Could be the best at being just
We and nobody else
No needing nobody else

Can't be with nobody else
It's you and nobody else
Can't sleep with nobody else
Succeed with nobody else
Get free with nobody else
Co-D with nobody else
Just you and nobody else
You, me, and nobody else
Can't be with nobody else
You, me, and nobody else
Just you and nobody else
Can't sleep with nobody else
Succeed with nobody else
Get free with nobody else
Co-D with nobody else
Just you and nobody else
No question, easy, oh mama
No question
Easy, oh mama
Could be the best at Nobody
Nobody else
Nobody else but you1Embed
