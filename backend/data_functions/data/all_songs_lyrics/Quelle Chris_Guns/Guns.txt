Guns Lyrics
Just because you packing out here, 'lax, fam, you ain’t 2Pac
Granny keep a loaded four-five right inside the glove box
Brandon shot his first keystone 'fore he could spell his last name
Junior learned to load from Uncle Charlie at the card game
Kelly lit her school up like it's 4th of July
Where she from, them twenty-twos more patriotic than pie
New year, shoot up the sky, shooters boot up and ride
Po-pos show up and fire, know there’s nowhere to hide

Before I be in ya city, coming to ya city
I be in your city, coming to a city near you
In your city, coming to ya city
I be in your city, coming to a city near you
In ya city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)
In your city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)

I pull up, get out, shoot you right in the mouth
I boot up, shoot up, come right in ya house
I pull up, get out, shoot you right in the mouth
I boot up, shoot up, come right in ya house
I pull up, get out, shoot you right in the mouth
I boot up, shoot up, come right in ya house
I pull up, get out, shoot you right in the mouth
I boot up, shoot up, come right in ya house
They hollering give me back my bullets, Lynyrd Skynyrd, new Van Zants
If you own it, then you'll pull it, maybe so, probably not
They spend billions like civilians won't catch trickle from the top
Just to protect or to progress what but little bit we got
Bruh-bruh, I'm your friendly neighbor, I stay on yo block
I protect and service, I big game, buckshot
Ain't no cracking that code, ain't no safety on locks
Might as well get you one, procrastinating will get you popped

That's why I be in ya city, coming to ya city
I be in your city, coming to a city near you
In your city, coming to ya city
I be in your city, coming to a city near you
In ya city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)
In your city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)
In your city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)
In your city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)
In your city, coming to ya city (Why, why?)
I be in your city, coming to a city near you (Why, why, why, why?)
Why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why? (In your city, coming to ya city)
Why, why, why, why? (I be in your city, coming to a city near you)
Why, why? (In your city, coming to ya city)
Why, why, why, why? (I be in your city, coming to a city near you)2Embed
