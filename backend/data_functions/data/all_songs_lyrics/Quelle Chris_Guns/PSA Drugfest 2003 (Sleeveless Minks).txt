PSA Drugfest 2003 (Sleeveless Minks) Lyrics
This town ain't the right size for you and I
Six million ways to fly, who's tryna die?
The moon got a dark side, I know a guy
Who mix up a spliff like witches with newt eye
Cocktails unlike the Tom Cruise kind
Inhale, choke up like a high noose tied
I'm too down, like the blue towel
Alice the white rabbit and a white owl, ow
Couple hits'll put your lights out, ciao
Some white boys bringing the pipes out, wow
Spark L's like dude, gettin' the Dell
For what they sell in the tubes, many sit in a cell
Cottonmouth, moving like Rochelle Farrell
Hit the harvest with clippers like Sam Cassell
Word to Dewey Cox, you won't get hooked, ahk
Laced or dip, that shit turn your eyes Fetty Wap
When that shit got lame, we spiced up the game
Brought out the blades and lined up cocaine
Prefer it off white, but albinos, okay
To balance out the jump, we rolled it up Js
Honey had the stylish chain with the scoop
Four troop packed in the stall like the coupe
Spontaneous interludes in the nude like Luke
Musta been the X that made them look cute
No peer pressure, this campaign's grassroots
Squad members hailin' from the top to the bottom
From coast to coast, toast Gamora and Sodom
We dyin' to die with more problems
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, sip 'em if you got 'em
Pop 'em if you got 'em, snort 'em if you got 'em
Shoot 'em if you got 'em, eat 'em if you got 'em
Drop 'em if you got 'em, take 'em if you got 'em
Chew 'em if you got 'em, fuck 'em if you got 'em
Roll 'em if you got 'em, smoke 'em if you got 'em
Sip 'em if you got 'em, pop 'em if you got 'em
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, smoke 'em if you got 'em
Smoke 'em if you got 'em

Farmin' the fungus like Mario the plumber
You can smell the cocktail off the sweat from the summer
Double the ration, last trip was a bummer
Had to hit the new connect, my Bae Bro had the number
You know the steez, some Gs hit pharmacies
Alchemy initially prescribed for they knees
Over the border or order from over seas
Or cop it off the corner, know a family down the street
I support local business
Plus the head, stay grass fed
'Til the eyes go blood red
Who dat grew this shiznit?
That shavelli had my wig split, O-M-Jesus
When we out of town, hit the legal with the visa
Know a bunch of stoners down to roll up 'til you seizure
From coast to coast, toast Gamora and Sodom
We dyin' to die with more problems
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, sip 'em if you got 'em
Pop 'em if you got 'em, snort 'em if you got 'em
Shoot 'em if you got 'em, eat 'em if you got 'em
Drop 'em if you got 'em, take 'em if you got 'em
Chew 'em if you got 'em, fuck 'em if you got 'em
Roll 'em if you got 'em, smoke 'em if you got 'em
Sip 'em if you got 'em, pop 'em if you got 'em
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, smoke 'em if you got 'em
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, smoke 'em if you got 'em
Smoke 'em if you got 'emEmbed
