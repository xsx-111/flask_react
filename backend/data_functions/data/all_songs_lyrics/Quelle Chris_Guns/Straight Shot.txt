Straight Shot Lyrics
All we need is just a straight shot from here
Everything is just a straight shot from here
Guaranteed it's just a straight shot from here
Follow me, it’s just a straight shot from here
Everything is just a straight shot from here
All we need is just a straight shot from here
Guaranteed it's just a straight shot from here
I believe it's just a straight shot from here

I’m okay
Feeling light today, towed by the wind, no fee, no triple A
Used to treating Frito Lay like gourmet, laughing, shit alright
Y'all ain't gotta make my day, I'm always making shit I like
You must think I'm Bobo the Foolish
Hollering 'bout relaxing while unloading all these full clips
Focused like I'm telling stout to holler while I'm preaching to the pulpit
I’m looking through and right above this bullshit, maybe it’s the Libra
Something bout that fifty-fifty in me, I'm a pessimist also a believer
Hopping off the precipice, stop to sniff the green up
Take a few to let loose and ’bout half as much to clean up
If bitches loved Sosa, Joanie, Chachi, leant up
What's behind the poster? Is it just as scenic?
Living like I'm supposed to, loving like I mean it
Ask him how he know, I don't know, I seen it
Trust me though, I seen it
Everything is just a straight shot from here
All we need is just a straight shot from here
Guaranteed it’s just a straight shot from here
I believe it's just a straight shot from here
All we need is

There go Q; talking me off a ledge again
A veteran of this Sisyphus stroll allegedly
I wanted off of this pitiful stone
Letting go was proving too hard for mission control trajectory
God, please forgive my yesterdays
If we was ever at odds, I guess that's my test of fate
Would you believe I thought in the weight you'd suggest I take?
That it couldn't be more your regard for my inner strength
I guess I am human, the news like a rerun
The silver lining clouds exit mouths when the weed puffs
I had to make allowance on account that I need trust
To find my way up out of all this doubt that they feed us
Maybe its the Aries, something 'bout the chances
The underdog's plans just appeal to romantics
Maybe it's the fairy tales of a boy king high in the camps
With just a sling in his hand that took a giant to pasture

Everything is just a straight shot from here
All we need is just a straight shot from here
Guaranteed it's just a straight shot from here
I believe it's just a straight shot from here
All we need is
Everything is just a straight shot from here
All we need is just a straight shot from here
Guaranteed it's just a straight shot from here
I believe it's just a straight shot from here
All we need is just a straight shot from here
Everything is just a straight shot from here
Guaranteed it's just a straight shot from here
Follow me, it's just a straight shot from here

Who are you? What are you?
And what do you want from me?
Is it my money? My joy?
My loyalty? My compliance?
Should I laugh? Should I cry?
Should I fear? Why should I care at all?
I don't even know you
Yet still, you are so close
What is it in those words you say?
Each page you write?
The twists of your dance?
What are you? And what have you done to me?
Who am I now? What am I?
What was I before you?Embed
