Spray and Pray Lyrics
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, yo, uh-huh

We load up, lift, and shoot (Uh-huh)
Nathan much else to do (Uh-huh)
Been packing since a youth (Uh-huh)
Me and my broito, Scoo (Uh-huh)

Studied gunslinging from '89 to new-thousand-two
Prayed if I paid my dues, I'd grow big to be just like you
Some played the nest, I flew, trigger happy-ass Q
Too immature to set safeties on, grow old, and dig roots
Most of my day ones turned in they AKs for 401Ks
And when I'm in love, too drunk off of firepower to placate
So I load up life and shoot, nathan much left to do
Sleek rifle look like new, me and my bonnie nukes
Knowing the day will come when some youngin step to me spooked
Sayin' when they pay they dues, they'll grow up to bust just like Q

All guns for hire, trying, some targets set on truth
Just pray and spray, you'll find it, endangered, on the loose
Most choose to move in silence, but no suppressor could mute
What lies within this chamber? No day is bulletproof
So we load up, lift, and shoot (Uh-huh)
Nathan much else to do (Uh-huh)
Been packing since a youth (Uh-huh)
Me and my broito, Scoo (Uh-huh)

Praying the climate changing, this game maintained by the youth
Watching 'em run and gun 'til they grow up to be like (*Gunshot*)

It's not just us killing each other
It's everybody killing one, just killing each other
You look at the news
People killing each other every day for small-
Family members killing each other, for money
We just killing each other for
I don't knowEmbed
