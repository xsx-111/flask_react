Dead Cities Lyrics
"I had killed a man... a man who looked like me"

Faces milling 'round like cars
Look across the tables, they're there in the piss-stained bars
Faces milling 'round like cars
Look across the tables, they're there in the piss-stained bars
Make me believe I'm not going to die, for that I'd gladly give you somethingEmbed
