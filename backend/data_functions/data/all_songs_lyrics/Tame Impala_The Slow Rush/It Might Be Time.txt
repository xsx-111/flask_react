It Might Be Time Lyrics
Something doesn't feel right
That's enough for one night
Hope y'all get home alright
There I go, blame it on the weather

But hey, there's nothin' wrong
I'm only tired of all these voices
Always sayin' nothing lasts forever

It might be time to face it
It ain't as fun as it used to be, no
You're goin' under
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
You ain't as cool as you used to be, no
You won't recover
You ain't as young as you used to be

It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it

I've been lost before
So tell me it's not over
'Cause I finally got somethin' goin'
And suddenly
All my friends are growin' up
And movin' on
I must be missin' somethin'
'Cause I just wanna keep this dream alive for now
Don't they know nothin' lasts forever?

It might be time to face it
Nobody knows what you've come here for, no
You're goin' under
They roll their eyes when you're at the door

It might be time
It might be time to face it (Yeah)
You may as well embrace it

We promise to come visit (Yeah)
It might be time

It might be time to face it (Yeah)
You ain't as fun as you used to be
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to be

It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it20Embed
