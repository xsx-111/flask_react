Do It! LyricsOh. I wish you well
And I hope someday your life turns out just like you planned
Oh. Well I hope you can
Find it in you to forget all the things I've said
Yeah. And I know you will
Cause you're my friend and that's the nicest thing I've said: all day
I hope to god. I hope to god that someday you will understand
I don't think that you understand
The things we say are not always the things we feel
You need to think before you make mistakes
Something may end up to link the reasons
Why we do the things we had to to
To the day where we were:
Prove me wrong and do what you do
I don't think that you understand
The things we say are not always the things we feel
You need to think before you make mistakes
Something may end up to link the reasons
Why we do the things we had to to
To the day where we were:
Prove me wrong and do what you do
Oh. Well I hope you can
Find it in you to forget all the things I've said
Yeah. And I know you can
Find it in you to forget all the things I've saidEmbed
