Cold War Lyrics
This war is cold and silent
Our love has turned to violence
You've got three years to die for something
You've got three years to live for something

This war is warm and vibrant
Our love has turned to silence
You've got two months to tell him something
You've got two months to tell him something
(x2)
And if you love let him know
Or if you leave him tell him so
Or you will break his heart in two

This war is cold and silent
Our love has turned to violence
You've got two months to tell him something
You've got two months to tell him something
