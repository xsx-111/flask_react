Little Girl Lyrics
My brother has a lady
Oh, and one day she will have a baby
My brother has a baby
Oh, and one day, and one day she'll save me
Ohhh need to talk to you girl
Ohhhhhhhh No NOOO!!!

You know this lady she's my baby
She's my baby, baby
When can I see you?
Can I love you?
Can I hold you, hold you?

My brother has a baby
Ohh oh No
Ohhhhhhh NOOOO!!!

You see this baby she's a lady
She's a lady, lady
When can I see you?
Can I love you?
Can I love you, love you?
You know this lady she's my baby
She's my baby, baby
When can I see you?
Can I know you?
Can I hold you, hold you?
