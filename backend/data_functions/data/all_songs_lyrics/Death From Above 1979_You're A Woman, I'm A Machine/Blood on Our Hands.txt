Blood on Our Hands Lyrics
I am leaving while you turn away
In the basement is where I'm going to stay
There is blood in all the things I say
Will you hate me if I stay this way?
From the bedroom, where we're running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done
You're a woman, we all know it's true
By the things that I've done to you
There is blood on all the shoes you've worn
From the people you were stepping on
There is blood in all the things you say
I won't hate you if you go away

There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where we will
Bring it back to the start again
Bring it back to the love we had
There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where we will
Bring it back to the love we had
Bring it back to

I am leaving if you turn away
In the basement is where I'm going to stay
From the bedroom, where I'm running from
There's a sequel to the things I've done
There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where we will
Bring it back to the start again
Bring it back to the love we had
There is blood on our hands again
From the bedroom is where we will
Bring it back to the start again
Bring it back toEmbed
