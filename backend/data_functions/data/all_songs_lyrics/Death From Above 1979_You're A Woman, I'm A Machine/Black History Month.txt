Black History Month Lyrics
Do you remember a time when this city was
A great place for architects and dilettantes?
A nice place for midwives and crossing guards?
And on and on

Hold on, hold on, children
Your mother and father are leaving, leaving

Do you remember a time when this pool was
A great place for water-wings and cannonballs?
A nice place for astrologists and blow-up dolls?
On and on, on and on

Hold on, hold on, children
Your mother and father are leaving, leaving
Hold on, hold on, children
Your best friend's parents are leaving, leaving


Hold on, hold on, children
Your mother and father are leaving, leaving
Hold on, hold on, children
Your best friend's parents are leaving, leaving
Hold on, hold on, children
Your best friend's parents are leaving, leavingEmbed
