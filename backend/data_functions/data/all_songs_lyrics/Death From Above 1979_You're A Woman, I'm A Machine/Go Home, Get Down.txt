Go Home, Get Down Lyrics
So that you're not alone
I wanna take you home with me
Well let's stay up all night
Or you can while I fall asleep

Don't ask I don't know
This is all, this is on
Don't tell me you don't know
I'll come back when I go
C'mon let's go home
You're my friend I want you to know
Don't tell me you don't know
I'll come back if I go
(x2)
So if you tell me that you'll have me
Never leave me til I die
Why try?
But if we're living and we're happy
And I come back when I go
You will know

Don't ask I don't know
I'll come back when I goEmbed
