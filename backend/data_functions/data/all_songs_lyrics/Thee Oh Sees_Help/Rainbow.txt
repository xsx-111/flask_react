Anyone can join my love
It's just drippin' off when I walk down the street
And if you drink up this love
You won't feel half empty

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba

Anyone can join my love
You soak it up as you slip down the stairs

Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
Any job will make you broke
Every house is not a home

Ba-ba-ba-ba
