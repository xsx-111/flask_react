Meat Step Lively Lyrics
Scratched up and busy, he's overrated
And he thinks about himself, no one can save him
Lost in a fog and outside in
When he wishes, he wishes to rebegin

But that is far from the truth
At the start he couldn't find the heart
To up and bear the fruit

Scratched up and busy, he's overrated
And he thinks about himself, no one can save him
Lost in a fog and outside in
When he wishes, he wishes to rebegin

But that is far from the truth
At the start he couldn't find the heart
To up and bear the fruitEmbed
