It's so easy to call
Like an unfurling flag
It's so easy to call
Out in the courtyard

Oh trainer, lay your lash down on me
Oh trainer, lay your lash down on me

It's so easy to fall
Like an unfurling flag
It's so easy to fall
Out in the courtyard

Oh trainer, lay your lash down on me
Oh trainer, lay your lash down on me
Oh trainer, lay your lash down on me
Oh trainer, lay your lash down on meEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
