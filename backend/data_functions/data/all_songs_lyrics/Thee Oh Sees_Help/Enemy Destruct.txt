Enemy Destruct Lyrics
When hate is in the room
Everybody dig in, dig in
Everybody clam up, clam up
Everybody cave in, cave in

When love is in a hole
Everybody fall in, fall in
Everybody break up, break up
Everybody cave in

Every little thing they say, it makes you want to go away

When hate is in the room
Everybody dig in, dig in
Everybody break up, break up
Everybody cave in, cave in

When love is in a hole
Everybody fall in, fall in
Everybody break up, break up
Everybody fall in
Every little thing you say, it makes me want to go away

When hate is in the room
Everybody dig in, dig in
Everybody clam up, clam up
Everybody cave in, cave in

When love is in a hole
Everybody fall in, fall in
Everybody break up, break up
Everybody cave in

Every little thing you say, it makes me want to go awayEmbed
