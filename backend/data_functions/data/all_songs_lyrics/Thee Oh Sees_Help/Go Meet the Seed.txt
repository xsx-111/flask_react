Go Meet the Seed Lyrics
I wanna live, I wanna hang way up in a tree
I'll describe all the things that I see
World stretching out around me
Mountain, meet the land, go meet the seed

Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
Wooo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo

I wanna live, I wanna hang way up in a tree
I'll describe all the things that I see
World stretching out around me
Mountain, meet the land, go meet the seed

Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
Wooo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo

I wanna live, I wanna hang way up in a tree
I'll describe all the things that I see
World stretching out around me
Mountain, meet the land, go meet the seed
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba
Ba, ba-ba-ba, ba, ba, ba-ba
Wooo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
Wooo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
Oooo-oo, oo-oo, oo-oo
Oooo-oo, oo-oo, oo-ooEmbed
