Soda St. #1 Lyrics
I can't wait much more
It feels like twisted guts
And, oh
I can't get no help at all

I walk in cities
It feels like it's made for us
And, oh
I can't get no help at all

I shake frozen hands
Of square and bitter men
And, oh
I can't get no help at all

I can't wait till fall
To see you there and call
Your name
I can't get no help at allEmbed
