Peanut Butter Oven Lyrics
One thing to be
Would be the dust on TV
One thing to be
Stones wet with sympathy
One thing to be
A taste, a smell, a feeling for free
A cry sometimes
Cuts a line across the sky
And sleeps in close
Sticking to my ears at night

One thing to be
Would be the dust on TV
One thing to be
Stones wet with sympathy
One thing to be
A taste, a smell, a feeling for free
A cry sometimes
Cuts a line across the sky
And sleeps in close
Sticking to my ears at nightEmbed
