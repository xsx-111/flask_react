Green Gloves LyricsFalling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them
Take another sip of them
It floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink
In a glass of water
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves
Cinderella through the room
I glide and swan
Cause I'm the best slow dancer
In the universe
Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves
Now I hardly know them
And I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine
Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves4Embed
