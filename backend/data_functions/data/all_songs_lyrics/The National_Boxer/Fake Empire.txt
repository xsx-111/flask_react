Fake Empire Lyrics
Stay out super late tonight
Picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade and take it with us

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city
With our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice, bluebirds on our shoulders

We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire


Turn the light out, say goodnight
No thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire
