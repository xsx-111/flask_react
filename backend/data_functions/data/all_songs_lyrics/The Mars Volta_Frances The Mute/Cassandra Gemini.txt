Cassandra Gemini LyricsTarantism (0:00-0:39)

I think I've become one of the others, oh, oh, oh
Think I've become one of the others, oh, oh, oh
I think I've become... one of the others, oh, oh, yeah yeah
Plant a Nail in the Navel Stream (0:39-4:46)

There was a frail syrup dripping off his lap danced lapel
Punctuated by her decrepit prowl she
Washed down the hatching gizzard
Soft as a mane of needles
His orifice icicles hemorrhaged by combing her torso to a pile
Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse
She was a mink hand job in sarcophagus heels

Bring me to my knees, read the sharpened lines
All my arms bled me blind
Faucet leaks in shadows, spilling from
Morgue lancet caressed your fontanelle
I've sworn to kill every last one
Every last one
Panic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms
Onto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches

All your dreams splintered off
Leech by leech on this catafalque
Anyone will tell you, yes, anyone
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm
Your mother flirted with disease
When she skinned that costume by its navel strings
Panic in the shakes of the wounded, panic in the worms
Onto the floor, and out of your mouth and out of your eyelids

No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time, oh, yeah!
Faminepulse (4:46-22:02)

Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep of nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste
Oh, oh, oh

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become
If you should see the dice
Charmed with its snaked choked eyes
You'll wear the widows weeds
Because they're just your size

Behind the snail secretion
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs
A limbless procreation
Let the infant crawl deformed
A bag replace the breath
Of these suffocating sheets
And now when the craving calls
I'll scratch my itchy sheath

And soon
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more

She fell for the whispers
Sister flooded deaf tears
That night tore a river
In her barren womb mirror
And his multiple sons
With their mandible tongues
Set crucified fires to petrified homes
L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Let it burn
I want, I want, I want, I want to let it burn

And the owls they were watching
And the owls didn't care
Then the owls came a' knocking
Placenta in their stares
They will feed on all the carnage
Leftover from the flood
And in the corner of their eyes
Fled sister L'Via
Sister L'Via

Now the pieces went floating
Reflecting all at dusk
Conceived from the stabbing
Was Vismund Cygnus

25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight

25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks cumming on the marble shrine
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks cumming, cumming tonight
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks cumming on the marble shrine
25 wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
25 snakes are drowning
Drowning
Drown
Drowning
Drowning
25 more
25 more
25 more
25 more
Woahaoh
Woah, woah

You can't bend your crooked arms
Or fold your punctured proof
The air is growing cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
And there's nothing you can do
Soon there'll be no gauze
Inside the confessional
Only rows of crows
Defrocking every breath, breath, breath, breath

One day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
I said one day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
You've always had a family
In the burial of your home
In the burial of your home
Burial of your home
Burial of your home, ffffph

Night forevermore
Night forevermore
Night forevermore
Night forevermore
Night forevermore
And I peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin
Multiple Spouse Wounds (22:02-31:37)


Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep on nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become

No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)
In the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, your life was just a lie)
No there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)
In the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, you ain't got-)
Sarcophagi (31:37-32:31)

The ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens
A depth perception languished in the night
All my life, I've been sewing the wounds
But the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud
Ooooh...3Embed
