Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus LyricsSarcophagi

The ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens
A depth perception languished in the night
All my life I've been sowing the wounds
But the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud
Ooooh...
Umbilical Syllables

(Niño prepárate) Que vas sufrir
(Niño prepárate) Salte veneno
(Niño prepárate) Salte de aquí
(Niño prepárate) Labios temblando
(Niño prepárate) Salte veneno
(Niño prepárate) Salte de aquí
(Niño prepárate) Brincan los cuerpos
(Niño prepárate) Vas a sufrir

My, my, my nails peel back
When the taxidermist ruined
Goose stepped the freckling impatience
And all the brittle tombs
Five hundred little Q's
I'm splitting hairs to match the faces
Come on now
All night I'll hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre sonando
De rabia naci

Now this trail don't lie
An abortion that survived
A lineage of bastard mastacation
And all the severed proof
And talons scratch my suite
These are the feathers that replace them

Come on now
All night I'll hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre sonando
De rabia nací

Who do you trust?
Will they feed us the womb?
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb? Yeah
I found the remnants of a crescent fang
It cleaned my wing down to the bone
Umbilical syllables left to decode
There was no cradle I can taste it

Come on now
All night I'll hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre sonando
De rabia naci

Who do you trust?
Will they feed us the womb?
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb? Yeah
Facilis Descenus Averni

Bring me this plague, she took a drink
Those nicotine stains on his every word
My scavenger quilt will only hide the truth
Bring me, bring me this plague

I count the days to find what was left behind
Only these names I clutch will lead me to my home
Somehow this river marks a wrinkle hand in mine
And everyday that parts the water into two
Mothers and feathers start to drown the living proof
I can't remember these lakes of blood
Wrapped in a blanket there sweats a cut
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah


Who do you trust?
Will they feed us the womb?
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb?
Who do you trust?
Will they feed us the womb?
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb?
Will they feed us the womb?
Con Safo
