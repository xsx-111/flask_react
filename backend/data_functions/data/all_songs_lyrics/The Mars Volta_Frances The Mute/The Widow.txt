The Widow Lyrics
He's got fasting black lungs
Made of clove splintered shards
They're the kind that will talk
Through a wheezing of coughs
And I hear him every night, in every pore
And every time he just makes me warm

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Must I hide? 'Cause I'll never, never sleep alone

Look at how they flock to him
From an isle of open sores
He knows that the taste is such
Such to die for
And I hear him every night on every street
The scales that do slither deliver me from

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone
Oh lord, said I'm, said I'm, said I'm
Said I'm, bloodshot for sure
Pale runs the ghost, said I'm, said I'm
Swollen on the shore, swollen on the shore
In every night, in every pore
The scales that do slither deliver me from

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone
Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Let me die, 'cause I'll never, never sleep alone
