Transit Lyrics
I have listened repeatedly
I have listened very well
No one interrupts the harmful
When they're speaking

To wonder why of Europe
Say your goodbyes to Europe
Swallow the lie of Europe
Our shared history dies with Europe

Follow me
Won't you follow me?

A future's hinting at itself
Do you fear what I fear?
All those names of ancestry
Too gentle for the stones they bear

Somewhere someone  wants to see you
Someone's traveling towards us all
To wonder why of Europe
To live, love, and cry in Europe
Say your goodbyes to Europe
Our history dies with Europe

Follow me
Won't you follow me?

The lights are dimming
The lounge is dark
The best cigarette is saved for last
We drink alone
We drink alone2Embed
