The Sands Have Turned Purple LyricsYoung human beings
Young human beings
And I hope you understand we've worn out customary costumes
And famous last names to blame
Clumsy stilts cause faultless spills
They're building bold billboards
I'm pinching for braille
I see you here
I see you hear me
Así-así
We risk feeling the feeling of risk
We don't believe in failure
Young human beings
Put the flame hat on before it's too late
Put the flame hat on
Drop out
Out run
Pass it onEmbed
