Oh Messy Life Lyrics
Fire is motion
Work is repetition
This is my document
We are all, all we've done
We are all, all we've done
We are all, all we've done
We are all, all defenses
Fire is motion, is motion growth?

And you are colder
Than you could ever be
And you are bolder
Than buzzing bugs
And you are colder
Than you could ever be
And you are bolder
Than buzzing bugs

My mama, my my mama said
My cousin bucky's so boldly bald
My cousin bucky never took his hat off
He always kept his hair back
My cousin bucky kept his hair back
He kept that cap on
Even when swimming
Yeah, I know there's a lesson
In there somewhere
Something nothing
Special about boys
Who smell like salami
And boys who've never apologized

And you are colder
Than you could ever be
And you are bolder
Than buzzing bugs3Embed
