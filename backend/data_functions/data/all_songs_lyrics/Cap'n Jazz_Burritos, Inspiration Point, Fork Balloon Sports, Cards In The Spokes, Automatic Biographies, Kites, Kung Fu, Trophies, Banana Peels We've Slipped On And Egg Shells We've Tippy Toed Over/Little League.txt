Little League Lyrics
Hey

Hey coffee eyes
You got me coughing up my cookie heart
Making promises to myself
Promises like seeds
Of everything I could be

Hey
Hey Ringwald haze
We're using bruises too loosely
In a haste to lose me
And I've given all I could give
We live in quick flips, slips, tips, and taps
To snap us outta these statue traps
But I've taken all I could take

Hey
Hey Ringwald haze
We're using bruises like Bruce Lee
In a haste to bruise me
And I've given all I could give
I've taken all I could take
I've pushed all that I could push
I've pulled all that I could pull
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Thin kids get a skinny neck hex
(Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat)
Heads hang heavy
Kitty kitty cat, kitty kitty cat
I feel heavy
It's in my window
Heads hang heavy
I'm feelin' heavy
Mind's feeling heavy
Museum mouth
Mouth
Heads hang
Heads hang down
Won't you
Use me
Use me
Use me
Hey
I want you to
Won't you
Use me
Use me
Use me
