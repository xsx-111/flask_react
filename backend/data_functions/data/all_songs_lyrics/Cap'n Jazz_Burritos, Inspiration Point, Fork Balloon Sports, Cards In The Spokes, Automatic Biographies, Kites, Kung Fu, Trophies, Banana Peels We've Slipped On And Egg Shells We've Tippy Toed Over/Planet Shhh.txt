Planet Shhh LyricsWe're being too honest
I push you to pull me
Belittle my little attempts at growth
Go on, Go on
Head right down that headlight's stare
Take my wind and blow it back at me
We've done this before
Halo my little hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs stab my heart
Hey God
I dare you to say it to my face
Hey God
I'll pull you outta the sky and make you 14 again
You'll never say another word about blame
We bit lips
We saucer eyes
I can't shake the shapeless memories every time I read
(And it's never been read)
I'm sassy
Halo my little hoola hoop hug
Squeeze to warm and ribs stab my heart
Now the taste of my teeth reminds me
Have I called you today?
Yesterday I called you neverEmbed
