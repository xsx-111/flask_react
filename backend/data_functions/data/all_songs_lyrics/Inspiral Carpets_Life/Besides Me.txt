Besides Me LyricsI'm too tired to listen to anything you say
When I see you tomorrow, I will have the sense to say
Too much
You always say too much (X3)
I AM MOVING ON, I AM PASSING BY
I AM MOVING ON, YOU ARE RIGHT BESIDES
I don't want to watch you, all the stupid things you say
All the time adds up to nothing, everything you do or say
Too much
It always costs too much (X3)
I AM MOVING ON, I AM PASSING BY
I AM MOVING ON, YOU ARE RIGHT BESIDES
I won't ask you questions, time will pass you by
Let alone in this world, you are the strangest one
Too much
You always say too much (X3)
I AM MOVING ON, I AM PASSING BY
I AM MOVING ON, YOU ARE RIGHT BESIDES MEEmbed
