Inside My Head LyricsShe'll speak of colours, I don't even know
She'll speak to me, then she won't show
The picture of you, inside my head
THE PICTURE OF YOU, INSIDE MY HEAD
HAS JUST, BEEN BURNED
She speaks a language, I've never heard
Keeps me guessing, every word
The picture of you, inside my head
THE PICTURE OF YOU, INSIDE MY HEAD
HAS JUST, BEEN BURNED
We're gonna be together very soon
And I will not be dancing by the light of the moon
Don't tell me you don't care for me
'Cause that'd be the way it was meant... to... be...
She talks of things, I've never seen
Takes me places, that I've never been
The picture of you, inside my head
THE PICTURE OF YOU, INSIDE MY HEAD
HAS JUST...!Embed
