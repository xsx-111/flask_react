Directing Traffik Lyrics
I read it in a book in school, I read it with "Janet and John"
No matter how you know the man, you can't trust what he's on
Some time later when he's on his own
What once was muscle is now bone

I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffik

You can't judge a man by his skin, or a book by the cover it's in
But I can't help feel it's true, the devil's got a hand on you
In a world of laughter where the madmen thrive
You're sewing up your death shroud from the inside

I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffik

I read it in a book in school, I read it with "Janet and John"
No matter how you know the man, you can't trust what he's on
In a world of laughter where the madmen thrive
You're sewing up your death shroud from the inside
I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffik

I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffik

(I see a skull on a stick
I see a skeleton with skin)
I'm getting by just the best I can
While you're directing traffik

Man!Embed
