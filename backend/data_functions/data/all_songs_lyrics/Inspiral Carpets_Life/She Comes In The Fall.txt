She Comes In The Fall Lyrics
Wake up, wake up, this must be some kind of fear
In the short time that I have got to know you
I have found here a wrong way to go about it
It's just this fear, the fear I have to go about you

You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl
You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl
You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl
You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl

(Here she comes) she comes in the fall
(And you should learn) to walk before you crawl
(Here she comes) arms dance together in the fall
You don't walk, you crawl

Back she returns there, he's always sat in the same chair
All you feel is the harder edge and the heat
I have found here a wrong way to go about it
It's just this fear, the fear I have to go about you

(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl) She comes in fall
(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl)
She comes in fall
(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl)
She comes in fall
(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl)
(Here she comes) she comes in the fall
(And you should learn) to walk before you crawl
(Here she comes) arms dance together in the fall
You don't walk you crawl

(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl) She comes in fall
(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl)
She comes in fall
(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl)
She comes in fall
(You should learn to walk, should learn to walk before you crawl)

(Here she comes) she comes in the fall
(And you should learn) to walk before you crawl
(Here she comes) arms dance together in the fall

You don't walk you crawl
You don't walk you crawl
You don't walk you crawl
You don't walk, you crawl

(Here she comes) she comes in the fall
(And you should learn) to walk before you crawl
(Here she comes) arms dance together in the fall
You don't walk, you crawl
You don't walk, you crawl, you don't walk, you crawl
You don't walk, you crawl, you don't walk, you crawl
Here she comes
