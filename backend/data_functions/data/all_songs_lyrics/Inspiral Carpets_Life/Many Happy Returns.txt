Many Happy Returns LyricsYou try to move on in me, I sense and now I can see
It's all what you can do for me
So far and so long away now, found another home, I'm happy
It's all what I can do for you
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS, ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T DESERVE
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS, IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS NOW
I tried to get away but, all of the time you follow
It's just a moth to a flame
It's getting way hard to live here, It's getting too hard to see you
This is what you have done to me
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS, ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T DESERVE
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS, IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS NOW
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS (MANY HAPPY RETURNS)
ALTHOUGH YOU DON'T DESERVE (MANY HAPPY RETURNS)
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS (MANY HAPPY RETURNS)
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS NOW
IT'S MANY HAPPY RETURNS (MANY HAPPY RETURNS) (X4)Embed
