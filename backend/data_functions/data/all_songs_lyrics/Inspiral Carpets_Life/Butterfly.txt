Butterfly
All I know I see it, what for?
All I know you see it, what for?
Lies to, love to, feel it all
What I've dropped to
And I never see what I want
Never see what I need
Now it's for
To die for, To die for
To die for, to die for
(Butterfly)
A simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
(Butterfly)
In your life you'll feel it all
(Fly us home)
(Butterfly)
Simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
(Butterfly)
Anything free from
(Fly us home)
(Butterfly)
Simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
Softer than softer
All I
Well I fall, and I fall
Every light I need
Upon me place it all
Everything is simple to, simple for me
What I need
Some things matter
Some things they feel
Set it for, to kill for
I set it for to kill for
Kill for you
(Butterfly)
Simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
In your life you free it all
(Butterfly)
Simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
Anything you're free from
(Butterfly)
Simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
Softer than softer than anything
(Butterfly)
My butterfly
(Fly us home)
Anything
(Butterfly)
My butterfly
(Fly us home)
Softer than anything
(Butterfly)
My butterfly
(Fly us home)
Softer than
(Butterfly)
And anything
All I
Every life is taken. What for?
And every life is taken. What for?
You lie to, you love to, feel it all
I've dropped to
Now I never see what I want
Never see what I need to kill for
(Butterfly)
A simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
In your life now you feel it all
(Butterfly)
A simple change for me to
(Fly us home)
Everything
(Butterfly)
Now you're free from
(Butterfly)
(Fly us home)
Simple change for me to
Softer than softer than anything
You love to lie to
You love to
You lie to
You love to
You lie to
You love to...
You love to...
You love to...
You love to...
Lie to meEmbed
