Monkey On My Back LyricsSo very hot up in your room, a man can feel the danger
And you tell me, "it'll be soon", so I control my anger
Thought you said there's no danger here, that's when I can see your fear
THE MONKEY (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
ON MY BACK (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
IS BLEEDING (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
THE MONKEY ON MY BACK IS BLEEDING
THE MONKEY ON MY BACK IS BLEEDING
I'll try to tell you how I feel, it's got me counting the hours
It's not so unreal if you've got the special powers
Won't ever see the morning light, don't tell me it ain't right
THE MONKEY (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
ON MY BACK (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
IS BLEEDING (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
THE MONKEY ON MY BACK IS BLEEDING
THE MONKEY ON MY BACK IS BLEEDING
MONKEY (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
ON MY BACK (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
IS BLEEDING (THERE'S A MONKEY ON MY BACK)
THE MONKEY ON MY BACK IS BLEEDING
THE MONKEY ON MY BACK IS BLEEDINGEmbed
