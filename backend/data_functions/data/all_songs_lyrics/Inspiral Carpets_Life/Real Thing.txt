Real Thing LyricsOne day soon you'll find me gone, have no idea of where I am
Search and search with no success, nightmares return each day
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME WAITING (YOU KEEP ME WAITING)
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME ASKING FOR MORE
Then you'll find me laughing at what you said behind their backs
Find the truth about it funny, find it so hard to take
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME WAITING (YOU KEEP ME WAITING)
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME ASKING FOR MORE
We play those games too often, we play out strangers in the bed
You search for something different, put the gun right to my head
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME WAITING (YOU KEEP ME WAITING)
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME ASKING FOR MORE
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME WAITING (YOU KEEP ME WAITING)
YOU ARE THE REAL THING (YOU ARE THE REAL THING)
YOU KEEP ME ASKING FOR MORE
(REAL THING) YOU ARE THE REAL THING (X4)Embed
