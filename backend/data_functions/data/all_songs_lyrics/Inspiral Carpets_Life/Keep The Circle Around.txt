Keep The Circle Around LyricsPain is one thing tying you to that girl
She has got your head in a whirl
Now if you ever promise me, then I'm sure that you'll be free
Pain is one thing tying you to that girl
She has got your head in a whirl
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
Now there's only one thing you can do
'cause only you really know what you're going through
Now if you're ever on your own, think what it's like, all alone
Now there's only one thing you can do
'cause only you really know what you're going through
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWN
YOU CAN SEE INSIDE OF ME THAT SOMETHING'S GOING DOWNEmbed
