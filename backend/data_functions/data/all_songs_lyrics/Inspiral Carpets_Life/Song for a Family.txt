Song for a Family LyricsSee the man in the corner of the tap room
The froth from the beer is on his lip
And it's rose-coloured where the skin is glowing
And the domino is at his fingertip
And he prays each night that his family's alright
And he's got work
See the lollipop lady by the roadside
Some days, the kids are so hard to control
But they bring her lots of presents on her birthday
And their little faces make her feel so old
And she prays each night that her family's alright
And she's got work
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM, WE ALL PRAY FOR SIMPLE THINGS
STRANGERS SHARE YOUR DREAMS, WHO KNOWS WHAT THEIR PRAYERS WILL BRING?
LOVE AND HEALTH IS ALL, TIL YOU FALTER IN YOUR STEPS AND FALL
WE ALL LIVE ON DREAMS
See the lad on the Saturday terraces
With his collar pulled up around his chin
His side is two goals down and playing lousy
But he still believes his team is gonna win
And he prays each night that his family's alright
And he's got work
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM, WE ALL PRAY FOR SIMPLE THINGS
STRANGERS SHARE YOUR DREAMS, WHO KNOWS WHAT THEIR PRAYERS WILL BRING?
LOVE AND HEALTH IS ALL, TIL YOU FALTER IN YOUR STEPS AND FALL
WE ALL LIVE ON DREAMS
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM, WE ALL PRAY FOR SIMPLE THINGS
STRANGERS SHARE YOUR DREAMS, WHO KNOWS WHAT THEIR PRAYERS WILL BRING?
LOVE AND HEALTH IS ALL, TIL YOU FALTER IN YOUR STEPS AND FALL
WE ALL LIVE ON DREAMSEmbed
