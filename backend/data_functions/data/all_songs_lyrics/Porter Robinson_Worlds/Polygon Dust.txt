Polygon Dust Lyrics
Taking back wasted time that we have spent
Walking 'round wasted, tracing back the steps
Oh I can taste it, the secret I have kept
Walking 'round wasted, and I'll take what I can get

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

Taking back wasted time that we have spent
Walking 'round wasted, tracing back the steps
Oh I can taste it, the secret I have kept
Walking 'round wasted

It's how I feel
Too late to turn
It's how I deal with you
Too late to turn
It's how I feel

Taking back wasted
Oh I can taste it
It's how I feel
Walking 'round wasted
The secret I have kept
Walking 'round wasted
Take what I can get
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa6Embed
