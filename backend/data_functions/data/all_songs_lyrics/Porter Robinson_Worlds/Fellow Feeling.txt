Fellow Feeling Lyrics

I cried, for I didn't think it could be true
That you and I might have always known one another
And that we could not only evoke, but conjure a place of our own
That everywhere that has ever existed
Was all in service of our dream
Now please, hear what I hear


Let me explain
This ugliness, this cruelty, this repulsiveness
It will all die out
And now, I cry for all that is beautiful
