Years of War Lyrics

Take one last look at what you're leaving behind
'Cause there's no coming back once we go
We are the children of an innocent crime
And it's time to take down the throne
Although our hands may shake
We'll set the city ablaze for their treachery (Oh-oh)
We'll spill their blood and set our fathers free

O-o-o-oh, two hundred years of wa-a-a-ar
Fight 'til we are no mo-o-o-ore
A curse on the streets of gold, oh, oh
Just kno-o-o-w, that mine is a hand to ho-o-o-old
Take back what their kingdom sto-o-o-ole
A curse on the streets of gold


O-o-o-oh, two hundred years of wa-a-a-ar
Fight 'til we are no mo-o-o-ore
A curse on the streets of gold, oh, oh
Just kno-o-o-ow, that mine is a hand to ho-o-o-old
Take back what their kingdom sto-o-o-ole
A curse on the streets of gold
