Hear the Bells Lyrics
Living in a cruel world
Trudging with my feet in the snow
On a day out, into the night now
Doctor, I've been walking by the side of the road
For a long time, and I'm going out of my mind

It's so far from me now
But oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
But oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
But oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
But oh, I can hear the sound

Can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?
You won't hear it on the radio
Madness is the hero carnival
Can't you hear the bells?

Sitting on a rooftop
Crazy days are coming again
I've been running
But I'll be hidden in the masquerade
It's so far from me now
But oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
But oh, I can hear the sound

Can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?
You won't hear it on the radio
Madness is the hero carnival
Can't you hear the bells?

It's so far from me now
Oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
Oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
Oh, I can hear the sound
It's so far from me now
Oh, I can hear the sound

Can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?
You won't hear it on the radio
Madness is the hero carnival
You won't hear it on the radio
Can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?
You won't hear it on the radio
Madness is the hero carnival
Can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?6Embed
