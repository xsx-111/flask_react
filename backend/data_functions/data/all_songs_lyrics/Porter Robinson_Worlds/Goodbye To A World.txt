Goodbye To A World Lyrics
Thank you, I'll say goodbye soon
Though it's the end of the world, don't blame yourself, now
And if it's true, I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own
Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
Though it's the end of the world, don't blame yourself
And if it's true, I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own


Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
Though it's the end of the world, don't blame yourself, now
And if it's true, I will surround you and give life to a world


Thank you, I'll say goodbye now
Though it's the end of the world, don't blame yourself
And if it's true, I will surround you and give life to a world
That's our own

—goodbye soon
Though it's the end of—world, don't blame yourself, now
And if it's true, I will surround—19Embed
