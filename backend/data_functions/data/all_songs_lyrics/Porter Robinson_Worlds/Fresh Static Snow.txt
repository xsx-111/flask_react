Fresh Static Snow Lyrics
You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name
I'll cry for you the same
You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name
I'll cry for you the same


You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name
I'll cry for you the same
You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name
I'll cry for you the same

Melt this curse away
Cry for you the same
Don't move so lightly, static snow
That is your memory
And though I know we'll never meet
You're an ever part of me

You'd fit perfectly to me and we'd end our loneliness
Melt this curse away
Though I'll never know your name
I'll cry for you the same11Embed
