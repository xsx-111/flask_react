Merry Go Round LyricsHush was the first word you were taught
And they watched you wear
The clothes they claimed that they bought
They brought you down
To watch the merry-go around
In fall, you knew how much it cost
A trouble doll
Around your neck when you lost
You wouldn't make a sound
But I could hear your little heart pound
And I watched your feet slip off the ground
Merry go round in dreams
Writes 'em down, it seems
When she sleeps, she's free
Merry go round in dreams
You wake to another day and find
The wind's blowing out of key with your sky
Only you can see
And the rain dancing in the night
Everybody stands around in delight
Merry go round in dreams
Writes 'em down, it seems
When she sleeps, she's free
Merry go round in dreams
And everybody thinks she's sick
She's got two worlds she can pick
And she's sad
Hush is the only word you know
And I stopped listening long ago
They ignored me with a smile
You as a child
But the trouble doll hears your heart pound
And your feet they say goodbye to the ground
Merry go round in dreams
Writes 'em down, it seems
When she sleeps, she's free
Merry go round in dreams
Merry go round in dreams
Merry go round in me
Merry go round
Round and round in me
Merry go round
Round and round in meEmbed
