Attitude LyricsWell when you open that bottle of wine
You open a can of worms every time
Now you don't stop, that ain't true
Never said a word, I never had to
It was my attitude
That you thought was rude
It was my attitude
Old habits are hard to break
And I don't know how much I can take
What I think is on the tip
Of my tongue should I let it slip
It was my attitude
That you thought was rude, not me
It was my attitude
That you thought was rude
Remember sitting back in school
I held my tongue until it turned blue
They said I had an attitude
You just failed my test
'Cause I know you be the best
So wipe me off as you conclude
A POV is what I can't use
I got an attitude
I got an attitude
Said I had an attitude
Said I had an attitude
Said I had an attitude
An attitude
Said I had an attitudeEmbed
