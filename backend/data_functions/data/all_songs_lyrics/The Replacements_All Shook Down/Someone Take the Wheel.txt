Someone Take the Wheel LyricsRip out the table, we need room to move
In a life unstable you're so easily amused
Anywhere you hang yourself is home
Throw in a tape, fix the tone
Someone take the wheel
And I don't know where we're going
Anybody say what you feel
Back home I guess it's still snowing
The windows are dirty, let's hope it rains
Add another newspaper, something to do with my change
I see we're fighting again in some fucking land
Throw in another tape, man
Someone take the wheel
And I don't know where we're going
Anybody say what you feel
Everybody's sad, but nobody's showing
Show me one night
Kiss until I'm tired
Show me one night
Show
The music is pounding out in that rain
And we're standing in the shadow
Forever on the brink
Turn it up so I don't have to think
Someone take the wheel
And I don't care where we're going
Anybody say what you feel
Everybody's sad, but nobody's showing
Someone take the wheel
Someone take the wheelEmbed
