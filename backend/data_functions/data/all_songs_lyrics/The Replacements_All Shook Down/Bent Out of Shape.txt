Bent Out of Shape LyricsThere's popcorn for dinner
Last night it was cheesecake
A little sleepy-time tea
Spiked with another heartache
I smell you hair
The clothes I wear
I miss your face
Can't you see I'm bent all out of shape
You got me bent all out of shape
I couldn't lie if I tried
Yeah you kept me straight
It don't feel so good
But it made me feel great
Bent out of shape
You wanna be a dancer
And I'm on my last leg
Call but you don't answer
I call again tomorrow
I call again today
I smell your hair
The clothes I wear
I miss you face
Can't you see I'm bent all out of shape
You got me, got me bent all out of shape
I couldn't lie if I tried
Oh you kept me straight
It don't feel good
But it's gonna feel great
Bent out of shape
I don't need no lover
I don't need no more friends
They tell me to forget her
They tell me to forget her
But I never felt better
I smell your hair
The clothes I wear
I miss your face
Can't you see I'm bent all out of shape
You got me bent all out of shape
Well my friends all say it shows, it shows
Now I don't care who knows
And that feels good
It made me feel great
Bent out of shape
Got me bent out of shape
Lock me up
Lock me upEmbed
