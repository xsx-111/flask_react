Happy Town LyricsThe plan was to sweep the world off its feet
So you sweep the garage for the neighbors to see
The plan was to set the world on its ear
And I bet you don't know why you're here
Who knew
That avenue was bound for happy town
Happy town
Happy now
Happy town
Actors, authors, artists and thieves
Have afternoon parties where nobody heaves
Former strippers and junkies and men of the cloth
And we all fell in line and got lost
Who knew
That avenue was bound for happy town
Happy town
Hey, happy now
Happy town
Happy town
Happy town
Happy town
The plan was to set the world on its ear
And I'm willing to bet you don't last a year
The plan was to set the world on fire
But it rains every day on the liar
In happy town
Happy town
Happy townEmbed
