Lonely Star Lyrics
Yes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you’ll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Every Thursday

It seems like pain and regret are your best friends (Ooh, oh yeah)
Cause everything you do leads to them, why?
Run, run
Yeah, but baby, I could be your best friend, ooh, ooh
And baby, I could fuck you right (Ooh whoa)

Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, oh yeah
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you could have it all
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star
Woah
Blaming all your sins on your best friends, ohh, oh yeah
And nothing's never ever your fault
And nothing's your fault baby, no
Well baby, you don't need your best friends (Woah)
Yeah, cause I got everything you want (Woo, ehh yeah)

Baby, you could have it all (Ooh baby)
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star, baby you could be a star
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh)
Baby, you could have it all (Ooh yeah)
Baby, you can have the cars, the clothes, the jewels, the sex, the house
Baby, you could be a star (Oh yeah)
If, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill
Promise me when they all love you that you’ll remember me
When you fuck them, you'll see my face
My body is yours
Give them any other day but Thursday
You belong to me
Every Thursday
I'll wait for you
I'll be beautiful for you
Every Thursday
I exist
Only on Thursday
Ohh, ohh
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday
Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday
But on Thursday, Thursday (Ooh)
I love the guitars61Embed
