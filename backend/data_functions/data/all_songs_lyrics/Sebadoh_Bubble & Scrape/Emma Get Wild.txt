Emma Get Wild LyricsOne, two, three, four!
I am being myself, I am all confined
I am paid to tonight with a hunting knife
A fire, a wiry frightened disease
Agitated and edgy, yay
Here is to my health and living right
Brain tuned out to the radio dial
The storm may be all we want to avoid
Your empire that exists, will be destroyedEmbed
