Sacred Attention Lyrics
My head so low
The way I think could scrape the ground
I will give them all control
I will crumble all around

There's no need to say a word
As logic burns right through my head
I could almost laugh out loud
The way this silence leaves me dead

Feel afraid to speak
And I feel afraid to smile
As I crave sacred attention
You could hit me all the while

You might be the weaker one
And I may stand and stare
But I'll always know my place
To keep this order safe, not saneEmbed
