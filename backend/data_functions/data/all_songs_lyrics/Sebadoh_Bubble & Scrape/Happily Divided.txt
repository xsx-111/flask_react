Happily Divided Lyrics
Of these times, it's where we make the most
Boredom fabricated, words are flowing
Down each others' throats
And I'm so excited, happily divided

Smashing all my windows, rocks falling in the yard
Pretending that you're bigger than you really are
Pretending you're bigger than you really are
Happily divided

Yeah, you're big only when your numbers grow
All dressed up with nowhere to go
So excited, happily divided1Embed
