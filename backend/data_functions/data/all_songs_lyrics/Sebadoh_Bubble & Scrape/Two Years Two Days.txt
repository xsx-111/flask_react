Two Years Two Days Lyrics
Now that you have your doubts
Will you always be looking for a way out?
And if I convinced you to stay

Two years or two days from now
I’d live in fear of losing you
Holding on and trapping you inside

Now I understand
I can’t always have what I’m wanting
And now I’m wanting you

But if you don’t want me
I’ll have to set you free
I’ll have to learn to live without you

Guilt is a stupid thing
Don’t let it make you stay
Leave me if you’re wanting someone else

I’ll be okay
Two years or two days from now
Even though I love you more nowEmbed
