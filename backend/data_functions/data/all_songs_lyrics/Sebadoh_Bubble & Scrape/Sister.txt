Sister Lyrics
Damned, if I do and damned, if I don't
I told you I loved you, I wish that I hadn't
You don't seem the same
I guess I know you too well
I knew I was falling, but I didn't know how low I'd fell

Sister, oh sister, who told you these lies?
I haven't got time to teach you what it could be like
To pull you from this, child

You don't smell the stink
But your mind has found the bed
You think I'm all yours
And I wish that I were dead
The words were not your own
It was something your mother said
Umbilical bloodline, mind control
By the whiny chat

Sister, oh sister, I thought it'd be nice
That thing I felt when we first met just will not suffice
The glimmer in your eyes
I love you, sister
A bloodline to condescend
I thought so, sister
But I cannot pretend
It's hard to believe this blood
This isn't healthy love
It's hard to believe this love
This isn't healthy blood

Sister, oh sister, you thought you're so wise
But we're still fishing and coming from the blindest eye
A logic you defyEmbed
