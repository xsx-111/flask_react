Fantastic Disaster LyricsThis or that or what you will is all the same to me
There's danger almost everywhere as far as I can see
Careen them maybe if you can, charm my troubled soul
The farther I go, the worse I get
Electric current, my arms outstretched
I may be hostile, sick with rhyme
Spirit all able, time is on my side
Destroys the funny plants, my dear, go pull one at the root
You will find if I am not at fault, unlucky rabbitâ€™s foot
Deal me insincerity, clairvoyance is not an act
If there is any concern, my nerves to soothe
But my face would never fuse in to be with you
I am entertaining on the street, 12 degrees
To sweet college girls and friends with fleas
Dreaming our direction crazy, some real-life stories go
Await sweet, crazed adventure, I want someone to know
It is scary how I view my life to book, yet written and unsigned
A violent piece of addict grows, I live on borrowed time
Childlike, I have been always a terror, I need to be held
Ammunition cynical, damn all memory
Shot glass hits the wall, time of victoryEmbed
