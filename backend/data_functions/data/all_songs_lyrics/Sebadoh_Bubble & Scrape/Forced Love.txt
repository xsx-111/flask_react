Forced Love Lyrics
She don't need the guilt, she don't need the pressure
But she craves a guilty pleasure
She has no conscience, call her a seeker
Let her know if she can please you, she’s eager to please you

Pit bull, heart breaker, forced love dictator
Is she as shallow as she seems?
Sweet, yet heartless, mindful, yet thoughtless
Left a kiss to find a conflict of interest

Gave myself away by what I didn’t say
I tried to talk but my pride got in the way
And I would never dare to break her heart
Too scared and selfish to watch my security fall

Pit bull, heart breaker, forced love dictator
The boy that crippled all her dreams
Sweet, yet heartless, mindful, yet thoughtless
Left a kiss to find a conflict of interest

And I would never dare
To break her heart
Too scared and selfish
To watch my security fall
Take me back, I'm not proud
To share the glory if I'm allowed to
‘Cause nothing can be lost
This magic never existed
I hope I never miss it
Leave it alone, let it die
It can't be worth the pain we've hidden
Nothing will be lost

A love that couldn’t be trusted
Is it worth the time that we’ll abuse?
Is it worth the time that we’ll abuse?
Is it worth the time that we’ll abuse?Embed
