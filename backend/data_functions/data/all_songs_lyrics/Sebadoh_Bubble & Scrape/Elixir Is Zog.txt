Elixir Is Zog LyricsWhat is all this commotion?
You can break the alarm
Restrain, please, do not bite me on the arm
Capricorn Rising
Diligent, she waits
Bright eyes wink
Future wife in a miniskirt
Buying me a drink, I abandon every plain
Not your Mr. Right
Committed like a burglar, arrive in style
Nailed a warning sign
Oh, when we get into square land, you will get your little fish 
A reel that sucker in
In this condition, the elixir is zog
Concentrated salvation, a region squad
The way in my skeptic, blinded by grog
A clever decision, never am solvedEmbed
