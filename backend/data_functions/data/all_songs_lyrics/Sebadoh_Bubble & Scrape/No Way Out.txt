No Way Out LyricsLooking at a new routine is the way to be
This no way out and the wheels are lazy
Give a living when you are that again
Hoard in sunshine, medicine
Fell apart as humans will, they walked away from everything
Carry a lantern, because I may live away
Where I can relax when I leave this place
Defined by age, I am a monkey in rage
Store it in rhythm because they cover more space 
The Garden of Eden is a garbage dump
Wild with daisies, I am a hardcore punk
Gridlock, jury, dismarry, dustbowl, dustcat deserving, gridlock, workingEmbed
