Bouquet for a Siren Lyrics
I am hiding nine wives, close my eyes
Valiant, like a god I fly
Merry-go-round, window-speak
Working only for luxury
Married to failure, dulled by grief
I am fighting on and off full-cheek 
Since when again, I care, I swear I do not intend to be mean
Siren glides from surf to cliff
Endearing language, provocative
I am here to say what is done is done
Serving shark’s fin soup for everyone

Beautiful women in the world to see
I am a born romantic, EAG
Got to right to find an American dream
And so what?
Stranded here high and dry
Got a cause on the region, on the beach I lie 
Fortunate to wait and see
On these stepping stones of dust we have roped at defeat
Feeling as weak as a circus freak
I got to relocate, I want to sail the seas
We should have never kissed, never played
Pardon me, I had a place to stay
Enlighten my wives, close my eyes
Fell to you, like a god I fly
Merry-go-round, window-speak
Working only for luxury
Married to failure, dulled by grief
I am fighting on and off full-cheek 
Since when, again, I care, I swear I do not intend to be mean
Siren glides from surf to cliff
Endearing language, provocative
I am here to say what is done is done
Serving shark’s fin soup for everyone

I am scared (I am scared of dying)
Do not let me die
Where is my lover? (Where is my lover?)
And again, again, again, again, againEmbed
