Think (Let Tomorrow Bee) LyricsCould I hold on, or should I hold on to you?
Ask, I will tell the truth; there is nothing I should hide
And if I move to slow, if you are bored I need to know
I am weak to hide inside, to force what I do not feel
If all we have is a question, there is no hope to find a future
But something in me cries for you
It feels too real this time
I think I love you, though I do not know what love means
Girl of my dreams, or a friend that one day leaves
Could I trust this when I have lied to myself before?
Will I do it all again to taste what I have imagined we could be?
Look what I have become; this pressure that we feel
In a world of possibilities, this may not prove real
But could we give enough, backed against a wall?
Too close to breathe, but too far to fall
All I ever wanted was to feel you closer to me
And it is sad to feel this resistance
What once before had felt so free
Let tomorrow be
I cannot be so impatient
Pushing every answer, when there is not any question
Let me feel good now
And though this may have to end, I hope I am always with you
Honestly your friend
I think I love youEmbed
