Flood Lyrics
A cap comes off the 40 ounce
The bowling captain's out to pounce
Uncap the joy, out of control
The night cat goes within my soul

Yeah, all right
Going to ride with the flood tonight
Yeah, all right
I'm going to ride with the flood tonight

The girls, the bars
We're smoking joints in the car
A hundred miles an hour through the meadows
I'm stump-jumping drunk from the get go

Yeah, all right
We're going to ride with the flood tonight
Yeah, all right
We're going to uncap with flood tonight, let's go

The night cat makes me want to sing
Because I don't feel a thing
Except all the joy in the world
Come on, get in the car, let's go
Yeah, all right
Going to ride with the flood tonight
Yeah, all right
I'm stump-jumping drunk from the get go

Stump-jumping drunk and let's go
Stump-jumping drunk and let's goEmbed
