Homemade Lyrics
Sitting around with my homemade bone
I'm naked and loose when no one's home
And I may let my fingers roam
Juicing free on my holy bone
Here I am, on my knees
Praying to the beast that stole the sex from me

I see something we should do
If you need one, then you need two
I won't hold back, so why should you?
I wonâ€™t hold back, so why should you?
Here I am, on my knees
With nothing to blame but my curiosity
It got the best of me

There's still pictures in my mind
I've been addicted all this time
It taught me everything I know
Tell me, girl, did it leave me cold?
Here I am, on my knees
With nothing to blame but my curiosity
The selfish child in meEmbed
