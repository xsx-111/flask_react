Cliche Lyrics
Did you think I was dead inside?
There was no room to grow
And if I loved you still, I didn't let it show
I never left you, though I've always loved you
And you were free to leave me
If you didn't believe in me
Dumped, don't mind me
I didn't know what I had till it was gone
In love, so scared, couldnâ€™t stay

Cliche

I had a good time
Remember the good times
Before it had to happen
Cracked our world wide open
Dumped, don't worry about me
It wasn't up to you to set me free
There never is good time, so they say
Cliche, clicheEmbed
