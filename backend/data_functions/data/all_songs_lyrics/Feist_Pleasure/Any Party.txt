Any Party Lyrics
I was guided by voices to the backyard where I hear
That someone is talking about someone we used to know
I think that I know what’s gotta be done
I’ll take a minute alone and decide what to do

You know I’d leave any party for you
'Cause no party’s so sweet as a party of two
Sugar, I got no question of the right thing to do
Oh, you know I’d leave any party for you

You planned meeting me on your way home
And I tried reaching you on your new flip phone
You didn’t have the ringer on, so I couldn’t warn you
That a stranger is here looking for a reunion

You know I’d leave any party for you
'Cause no party’s so sweet as our party of two
I’m getting tired of these clowns and balloons
Oh, you know I’d leave any party for you

I won’t lead you astray
You know, I’ve got your back any day
Oh no, I got your back every day, every day
Every day, every day
And you know I would leave, I would leave
I would leave, I would leave
You know I’d leave any party for you
No party’s so sweet as our party of two
