The Wind Lyrics
The wind that will bring me
Out to you
Is a wind that gets singing
Whipping at the tune
The same wind comes rushing
That later lays low
And it pulls at my edges
Then continues to blow

Keep on the horizon
Keep on my horizon
Keep on the horizon

It brings hail from old water
And a storm on its knees
And flags from a revolution
That brought us some peace
And the trees for their hundred years
Lean north like calligraphy
And I’m shaped by my storming
Like they’re shaped by their storming

Keep on my horizon
Keep on my horizon
You found you, I mean you
Keep on my horizon
You found you
Keep on the horizon
As strong as that wind
That blew us round the island
Is a wind that has lasted
Longer than the past has
It’s a wind that will keep on
Lasting beyond ever after
It’s a wind that will keep on lasting
Longer than the past hasEmbed
