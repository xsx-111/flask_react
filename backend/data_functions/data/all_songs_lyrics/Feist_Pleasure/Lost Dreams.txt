Lost Dreams Lyrics
I used to know
By the day and by the night
Full of questions
Answers and questions

Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams

I used to make it, so it would all come togetherness
Even by day, I had a dream, I am a dreamer
And I saw all about his goodness became so
Bad-ass blacking out and itâ€™s called the name of love

Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams


Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Lost dreams, lost dreams, lost dreams
Thought I was discovering
Wanted to know everything
Winter fall and summering
Thought I was discovering
Wanted to know everything
Winter fall and summering
(Lost dreams)
Every night you go to sleep, a chance to have another dreamEmbed
