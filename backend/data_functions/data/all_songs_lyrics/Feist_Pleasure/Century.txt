Century Lyrics
I fought my feelings and got in the way
Could've been easier like a decade of days
Projection, young marriage, lighting the stage
I wanted feelings, that got in my own way
Then wrote that letter that had nothing to say
Staccato vision like a kingdom of days

All lonely, or not lonely, century away
But still a vision as if help's on its way

Someone who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to the one
At the end of the century

The air is clearer a decade away
Singing to a mountain that was empty all along

All lonely, young marriage lighting the way
She wanted feelings that got in her own way

Someone who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to the one
At the end of the century
Someone who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to the one
At the end of the century
Someone who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to someone
Who will lead you to the one
At the end of the century

Century. How long is that?
3,155,973,600 seconds
876,000,000 hours
Or 36,500 days
Almost as long as one of those endless dark nights of the soul
Those nights that never end
(Century)
When you believe you'll never see the sunrise again
When a single second feels like a century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century
A century2Embed
