Get Not High, Get Not Low Lyrics
I closed my eyes, opened up my eyes
That made me close my eyes, so then I opened my eyes
Like living in a dream

As long as I stay closed like that
Secretive to stay intact
Well that is not fun
That’s why I couldn’t trust anyone at all

And I got high
And I got low
So I got high

I was bright as the sun
Then Saskatchewan
Then I laid low like the tide
Then Bay of Fundy high
I was living in extremes
And everything that that means

And I got high
And I got low
So I got high
And I got low
Get not high
Get not low
I can’t tell, or be told where to go
Get not high
Get not low
I can’t tell, or be told where to go
Get not high
Get not low
I can’t tell, or be told where to go1Embed
