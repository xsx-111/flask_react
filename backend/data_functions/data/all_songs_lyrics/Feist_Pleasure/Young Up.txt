Young Up Lyrics
When they cart me away
Will I say that I died already
Years ago?

I got so stuck in my ways
That’s no way to behave
Got so tired before I noticed I was done

I felt like I covered my tracks
Like no one had my back
Just so you know
All of this battling goes so slow

Young up
Ya’ young punk
The end is coming
And fear not
Ya’ young pup
That everything that falls is falling

Was I just making it up
Pushing my luck
I got tired before I noticed
If I’d corrupted the core by asking for more
Just so you know
All of this battling goes so slow

So I looked into your eyes and said
Then I looked into my own eyes and said to myself

Young up
Ya’ young buck
The end’s not coming
Fear not
Ya’ young punk
That everything that falls is falling
Even if you don’t have your own back
And everything that needs to fall has fallenEmbed
