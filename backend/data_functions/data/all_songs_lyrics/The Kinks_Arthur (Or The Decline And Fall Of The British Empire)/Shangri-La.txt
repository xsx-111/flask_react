Shangri-La Lyrics
Now that you've found your paradise
This is your kingdom to command
You can go outside and polish your car
Or sit by the fire in your Shangri-La

Here's your reward for working so hard
Gone are the lavat'ries in the back yard
Gone are the days when you dreamed of that car
You just want to sit in your Shangri-La

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top, and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place, and you know where you are
In your Shangri-La

Sit back in your old rocking-chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
The little man who gets the train
Got a mortgage hangin' over his head
But he's too scared to complain
Cause he's conditioned that way

Time goes by, and he pays off his debt
Got a T.V. set and a radio
For seven shillings a week
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!

And all the houses in the street have got a name
Cause all the houses in the street, they look the same
Same chimney puff, same little car, same window panes
The neighbors call to tell you things that you should know
They say their lines, they drink their tea, and then they go
They tell your business in another Shangri-La
The gas bills and the water rates, the payments on the car
Too scared to think about how insecure you are
Life ain't so happy in your little Shangri-La!
Oh, Shangri-La, Shangri-La
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

Put on your slippers and sit by the fire
You've reached your top, and you just can't get any higher
You're in your place, and you know where you are
In your Shangri-La

Sit back in your old rocking-chair
You need not worry, you need not care
You can't go anywhere!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a!
Shangri-La-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!Embed
