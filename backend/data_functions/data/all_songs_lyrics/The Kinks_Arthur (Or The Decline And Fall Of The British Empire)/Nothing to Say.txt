Nothing to Say LyricsRemember walking with you by my side
You were my papa. I was your pride
And now I got children and I'm going grey
No time for talking. I got nothin' to say
Those Sunday dinners that we had at home
Now I got a house and I've got friends of my own
We can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday
It's best that we're going our separate ways, ok
How is your rheumatism? (Nothing to say.)
How are your chilblains? (Nothing to say.)
How's Aunty Mabel? (Nothing to say.)
So far, papa, I got nothin' to say, ok
Those happy days we spent together
We thought our world would never change
How the days go by
And things will never be the same
You keep pretending that everything's fine
So you make small talk to help pass the time
But all the words that you spit from your face
Add up to nothin' -- you got nothin' to say
How are those noisy neighbors next door?
I'll have to go soon 'cuz I'm getting bored
I gotta be home early to see a good play
So far, papa, I got nothin' to say
How is your life insurance? (Nothing to say.)
How is your trade union? (Nothing to say.)
How's your independence? (Nothing to say.)
So far, papa, I got nothin' to sayEmbed
