Lake Charles Lyrics
He had a reason to get back to Lake Charles
He used to talk about it, he'd just go on and on
He always said Louisiana was where he felt at home
He was born in Nacogdoches
That's in East Texas, not far from the border
But he liked to tell everybody that he was from Lake Charles

Did an angel whisper in your ear?
And hold you close, and take away your fear?
In those long, last moments

We used to drive through Lafayette to Baton Rogue
In a yellow El Camino, listening to Howlin' Wolf
He liked to stop in Lake Charles because that's the place he loved
Did you run about as far as you could go?
Down the Louisiana highway, across Lake Pontchartrain?
Now your soul is in Lake Charles, no matter what they say

Did an angel whisper in your ear?
And hold you close, and take away your fear?
In those long, last moments
He had a reason to get back to Lake Charles
He used to talk about it, he'd just go on and on
He always said Louisiana was where he felt at home

Did an angel whisper in your ear?
And hold you close, and take away your fear?
In those long, last moments
Did an angel whisper in your ear?
And hold you close, and take away your fear?
In those long, last momentsEmbed
