Jackson Lyrics
All the way to Jackson
I don't think I'll miss you much
All the way to Jackson
I don't think I'll miss you much

Once I get to Lafayette
I'm not gonna mind one bit
Once I get to Lafayette
I'm not gonna mind one little bit

Once I get to Baton Rouge
I won't cry a tear for you
Once I get to Baton Rouge
I won't cry a tear for you

All the way to Jackson
I don't think I'll miss you much
All the way to Jackson
I don't think I'll miss you much

Once I get to Vicksburg
I don't think I'll feel the urge
Once I get to Vicksburg
I won't even feel an urge
All the way to Jackson
I don't think I'll miss you much
All the way to Jackson
I don't think I'll miss you muchEmbed
