2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten Lyrics
You can't depend on anything, really
There's no promises, there's no point
There's no good, there's no bad
In this dirty little joint

No dope smoking, no beer sold after 12 o'clock
Rosedale, Mississippi, Magic City Juke Joint
Mr. Johnson sings over in a corner by the bar
Sold his soul to the devil so he can play guitar

Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten

Man runnin' through the grass outside
Says he wants to take up serpents
Says he will drink the deadly thing
And it will not hurt him

House rules, no exceptions
No bad language, no gambling, no fighting
Sorry, no credit, don't ask
Bathroom wall reads: Is God the answer? Yes
Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten
June bug versus hurricane
June bug versus hurricane
Hey, hey

I had a lover
I thought he was mine
Thought I'd always be
His valentine

Leaning against the railing of a Lake Charles bridge
Overlooking the river, leaning over the edge
He asked me: Would you jump into the water with me
I told him: No way, baby, that's your own death you see

Too cool to be forgotten
Hey, hey, too cool to be forgotten
June bug versus hurricane
June bug versus hurricane

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, heyEmbed
