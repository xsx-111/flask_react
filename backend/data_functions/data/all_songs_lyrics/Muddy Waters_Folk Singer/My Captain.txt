My Captain Lyrics
Oh captain, captain, hmm, ooo, my captain so mean
Ah, isn't feed me nothing, oh yeah, but soya bean
Oh the cook's alright, oh yeah, but the captain so mean
Hey, the cook's alright, oh yeah, but the captain so mean, I mean so mean
Ah, don't let me drive nothing, but just a old beat up wagon team
Yey, I worked all night, oh yeah boys, and I worked all day, ah, urn, so sad, so sad
Yey, I worked all night, oh yeah boys, and I worked all day
Ah, I couldn't find my mule, oh yeah, fella'd show nowhere
Yey, my wheel mule is crippled, hum, you know, my lead mule is blind
Now I ain't gonna buy my baby no more stockings, oh yeah boys, seem behind, mmm
Seem behind
Hum, people seem behindEmbed
