Cold Weather Blues LyricsCall my baby
You know the little girl fail to come
If I call my baby
You know the little girl would fail to come
Hot spring water
Oh, yeah boy, wouldn't help her none
I mean, wouldn't help her none
It wouldn't help her none
Whoa, times don't get no better
Peoples, I'm gonna have to go
Times don't get no better
Peoples, I'm gonna have to go
Well, you know I'm going back down south
People, where the weather suits my clothes
Where the weather suits my clothes
Oh, so cold up north that the birds can't hardly fly
So cold up north that the birds can't hardly fly
I'm going back south
And let this winter pass on by
And let this winter pass on by
And let this winter pass on by
Let this winter pass on by, yeahEmbed
