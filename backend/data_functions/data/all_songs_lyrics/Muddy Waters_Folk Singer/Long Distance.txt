Long Distance LyricsYou say you love me darlin'
Please, call me on the phone sometime
You say you love me darlin'
Please, call me on the phone sometime
When I hear your voice
Ease my worried mind
One of these days
I'm gonna show you how nice a man can be
One of these days
I'm gonna show you just how nice a man can be
I'm gonna buy you a brand, new Cadillac
If you only speak some good words about me
Hear my phone ringin'
Sound like a long distance call
Hear my phone keep ringin'
Sound like a long distance call
When I picked up my receiver
The party said another mule kickin' in your stall1Embed
