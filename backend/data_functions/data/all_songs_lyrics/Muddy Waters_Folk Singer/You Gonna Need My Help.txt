You Gonna Need My Help Lyrics
Oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
Oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
You know I won't have to worry
I have everything, little girl, coming my way

Well, you wake up in the morning with your face all
All full of frowns
I asked you, "What's wrong with you?"
You say, "I'm slowly putting you down"

But oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
I won't have to worry
I have everything, little girl, coming my way


Oh, you leave home in the morning
You won't come back tonight
You won't cook me no food
And you still say you treat me right
But oh, you gonna need
You gonna need my help, I say
I won't have to worry
I have everything, little girl, coming my wayEmbed
