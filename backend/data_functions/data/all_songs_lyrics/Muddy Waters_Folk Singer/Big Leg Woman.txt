Big Leg Woman LyricsBig leg womens, keep your dresses down
You got stuff to make a Bulldog hug a hound
Big leg women, keep your dresses down
(Ah-ah) You got somethin', make a bulldog wanna hug a hound
If you roll your belly like you roll your dough
People they's crying
They want some more, (oh!)
Roll your belly like you roll your dough
Hey people they's crying
People they's crying for more
Big leg women sure got something good
People they’s crying about it in the neighborhood
Big leg women sure got something good
Now if you don’t believe me ask anybody in my neighborhood1Embed
