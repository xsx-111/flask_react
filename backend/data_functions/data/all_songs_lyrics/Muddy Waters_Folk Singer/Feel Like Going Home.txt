Feel Like Going Home Lyrics
Well, now it getting late on into the evening
And I feel like, like blowing my home
When I woke up this morning all I had, I had was gone
Now it getting, late on into the evening, man now
I feel like, like blowing my home
Well now, woke up this morning, all I had was gone
Well, brooks run into the ocean, the ocean run in, into the sea
But don't find my baby, somebody going to  sure bury me
Brooks run into the ocean, man, that ole ocean ran into the sea
Well now, if I don't find my baby
Somebody sure going to bury me
Well, minutes seemed like hours, an hour don't it seem like days?
Seems like my baby would stop her old evil way
Minutes seemed like hours, an hour seemed like days
Well now, seems like my baby child, whoo-hoo well, child
Would stop her low down waysEmbed
