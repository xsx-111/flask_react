The Lines of My Earth Lyrics
The lines of my earth
So brittle, unfertile, and ready to die
I need a drink
But the well has gone dry
And we in the habit of
Saying the same things all over again
For the money we shall make

This is the last song that I'll write
'Til you tell me otherwise
And it's because
I just don't feel it
This is the last song
'Til you tell me otherwise
And it's because
I just don't feel it anymore

It should be our time
This fertile youth's black soil is ready for rain
The harvest is nigh
But the well has gone dry
And they in the habit of
Saying the same things all over again
About the money we shall make
This is the last song that I'll write
'Til you tell me otherwise
And it's because
I just don't feel it
This is the last song
'Til you tell me otherwise
And it's because
I just don't feel it anymore


This is the last song that I'll write
'Til you tell me otherwise
And it's because
I just don't feel it
This is the last song
'Til you tell me otherwise
And it's because
I just don't feel it anymore1Embed
