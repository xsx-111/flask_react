Easy to Ignore Lyrics
You and the moon are a beautiful sight to me
The stars in your eyes make it really hard to see you
A night in the sun is all I really want
You and me with the best of both for once

Oh, and night breaks
My heart could not ache any more
Am I that easy to ignore?

You let your song blow right through me
Your mighty intellect
Makes you mighty hard to see
Will there come a time for me to be
More to you, more to me?

Oh, and night breaks
My heart could not ache any more
Am I that easy to ignore?

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
My heart could not ache any more
Am I that easy to ignore?

You and the moon are a beautiful sight to meEmbed
