Love Lyrics
"You must be the seed
Descend into the earth
Searching for the union
Of death, and then rebirth"

But I need love
It is patience, it is kindness
I need love
It is rain after the dryness
I need love
Sister Wisdom, help me see
It's the one thing that I need
The only thing that I need

"The Harvester is near
His blade is on your skin
To plant a new beginning"
Well, then let the cut begin

But I need love
It is patience, it is kindness
I need love
It is rain after the dryness
I need love
Sister Wisdom, help me see
It's the one thing that I need
The only thing that I need
"The Harvester is near
His blade is on your skin
To plant a new beginning"
Well, then let the cut begin
Let the cut beginEmbed
