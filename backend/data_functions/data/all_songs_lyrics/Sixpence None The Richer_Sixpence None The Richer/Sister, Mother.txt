Sister, Mother Lyrics
My life is plagued
By mistakes, broken love
Slaps in the face
But I'm trying to care
To dare to embrace
Your face

Hug him like a brother
Kiss her like a sister
Let her be my mother for now

I want to find
Where the maid in the street
Is pouring her wine
I heard she takes you in
And gives you the words
You need said

If you'll be her brother
She'll kiss you like a sister
She'll even be your mother
For now

Hug him like a brother
Kiss her like a sister
Let it be my mother
Let it be my father

I will be her brother
Kiss her like a sister
Come and be my mother
Forever
