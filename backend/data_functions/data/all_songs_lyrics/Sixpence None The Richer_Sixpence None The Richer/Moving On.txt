Moving On LyricsMoving On
It has gotten to my head
Permeates the path I tread
But I tread, I'm moving on
In a new and happy song
I can sing about the night
How my tunnel without light
Led me to the other side
Where the sky is blue
It's all I can do
To not let them ruin me
I will not let them ruin me
I will not let them ruin me again
There is fire inside the tree
Flames of knowing kissing me
I have waited long to see a sign from you
It's all I can do
To not let them ruin me
I will not let them ruin me
I will not let them ruin me againEmbed
