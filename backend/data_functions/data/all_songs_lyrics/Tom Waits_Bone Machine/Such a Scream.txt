Such a Scream LyricsWell, pale face said to the eyeball kid
She just goes clank and boom and steam
A halo, wings, horns and a tail
Shoveling coal inside my dreams
There are no laws, she's made of cream
She's such a scream
Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement
A Donnie gal from mortal clay
The plow is red, the well is full
Inside the dollhouse of her skull
A cheetah coat fills up with steam
She's such a scream
All crooked lines, her fireplace
A milktrain so clean, machine gun haste
You'll ride the only wall of shame
And drag that chain across the state
Her lips are red, she is the queen
She's such a screamEmbed
