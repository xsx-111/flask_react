All Stripped Down LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah
Well, the time will come when the wind will shout
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
And all the sinners know what I'm talking about
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
When all the creatures of the world are gonna line up at the gate
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
And you better be on time and you better not be late
(All stripped, all stripped)
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
Well, you know in your heart what you gotta bring
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
No big mink coat, no diamond ring
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
Well, take off your paint and take off your rouge
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
Let your backbone flip and let your spirit shine through
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
(I want you all stripped, all stripped, all stripped down)
All the men we got, well, they're goin' down the drain
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
And when I see your sadness on a river of shame
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
You gotta raise up both the quick and the dead
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
With no shoes on your feet, no hat on your head
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
(I want you all stripped, all stripped, all stripped)
(All stripped, all stripped, all stripped down)
Ain't nothin' in my heart but fire for you
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
With my rainy hammer and a heart that's true
(All stripped down, all stripped down)
(All stripped, all stripped, all stripped down)
All stripped down
I want you all stripped down
All stripped down yeah
All stripped, all strippedEmbed
