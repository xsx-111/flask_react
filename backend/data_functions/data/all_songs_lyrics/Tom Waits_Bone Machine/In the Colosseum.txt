In the Colosseum LyricsThe women all control their men with razors and with wrists
And the princess squeezes grape juice from a torrid, bloody kiss
What will you be wearing there? The lion or the raven head?
The flesh will all be tearing, but the tale will be my own
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
This one's for the balcony and this one's for the floor
As the senators decapitate the presidential whore
The bald-headed senators are splashing in the blood
The dogs are having someone who is screaming in the mud
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
Now it's raining and it's pouring on the pillaging and goring
The constable is swinging from the chains
For the dead, there is no story, no memory, no blame
Their families shout blue murder, but tomorrow it's the same
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum
Call 'em as we see 'em
In the colosseum tonight
A slowly-acting poison will be given to the favorite one
The dark horse will bring glory to the jailer and his men
It's always much more sporting when there's families in the pit
And the madness of the crowd is an epileptic fit
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum
We call 'em as we see 'em
In the colosseum tonight
No justice here, no liberty, no reason, no blame
There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood
And greetings from the nation as we shake the hands of time
They're taking their ovation, the vultures stay behind
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum
In the colosseum
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum tonight
In the colosseum tonightEmbed
