Who Are You LyricsThey're lining up to mad dog your tilt-a-whirl
Three shots for a dollar, win a real live doll
All the lies that you tell, I believe them so well
Take them back, take them back to your red house
For that fearful leap into the dark
Oh well, I did my time in the jail of your arms
Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn
Tell me, what did you do? What did you do the last time?
Why don't you do that?
Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way
Time's not your friend
Do you cry? Do you pray? Do you wish them away?
Are you still leaving nothing but bones in the way?
Did you bury the carnival with the lions and all?
Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
And just who are you? Who are you this time?
You look rather tired, are you pretending to love?
Well, I hear that it pays well
How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go?
Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes?
Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes
You better get down on the floor
Don't you know this is war?
Tell me who are you this time?
Tell me who are you this time?Embed
