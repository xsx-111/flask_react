Black Wings LyricsWell, take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Just like they say in the Bible
Never leave a trace or forget a face
Of any man at the table
Any man at the table
When the moon is a cold chiseled dagger
And it's sharp enough to draw blood from a stone
He rides through your dreams on a coach and horses
And the fence posts in the moonlight look like bones
Well, they've stopped trying to hold him
With mortar, stone and chain
He broke out of every prison
Where the boots mount the staircase
The door's flung back open
He's not there, for he has risen
He's not there, for he has risen
Some say he once killed a man with a guitar string
He's been seen at the table with kings
Well, he once saved a baby from drowning
There are those that say beneath his coat, there are wings
Some say they fear him
Some say they fear him, others admire him
Because he steals his promise
But one look in his eye, everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
He can turn himself into a stranger
Well, they broke a lot of canes on his hide
He was born away in a cornfield
A fever beats in his head just like a drum inside
Some say they fear him, others admire him
Because he steals his promise
But one look in his eye, everyone denies
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
Ever having met him
Ever having met himEmbed
