Jesus Gonna Be Here LyricsWell, Jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon
He's gonna cover us up with leaves
With a blanket from the moon
With a promise and a vow
And a lullaby for my brow
Well, Jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon
Well, I'm not gonna do nothin' but wait here
I don't have to shout, yeah
I got me no reason
And I got no doubt, yeah
I'm gonna get myself unfurled
From this mortal coiled-up world
Jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon, yeah
I got to keep my eyes, keep 'em wide open, yeah
So I can see my Lord, yeah
I'm gonna watch the horizon
For my brand new Ford, yeah
Well, I can hear him rolling on down the lane
I said "Hollywood be thy name"
'Cause Jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon, yeah
Well, I got to keep myself, keep myself faithful
And you know I've been so good, yeah
Except for drinking
But He knew that I would, yeah
Well, I'm gonna leave this place better
Than the way I found that it was
And Jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon, yeah
I know my Jesus gonna be here
He gonna be here soon, yeah
I know my Jesus gonna be here
Gonna be here soon, yeah1Embed
