That Feel LyricsWell, there's one thing you can't lose
It's that feel
Your pants, your shirt, your shoes
But not that feel
Throw it out in the rain
You whip it like a dog
You can chop it down like an old dead tree
You always see it
When you're coming into town
Once you hang it on the wall
You can never take it down
But there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
You can pawn your watch and chain
But not that feel
Always comes and finds you
It will always hear you cry
I cross my wooden leg
And I swear on my glass eye
It will never leave you high and dry
Never leave you loose
It's harder to get rid of than tattoos
But there's one thing you can't lose
Is that feel
One thing you can't lose
It's that feel
You can throw it off a bridge
You can lose it in a fire
You can leave it at the altar
It will make you out a liar
Fall down in the street
You can leave it in the lurch
Well, you say that it's gospel
But I know that it's only church
But there's one thing you can't lose
And it's that feel, it's that feel
One thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
One thing you can't lose
And it's that feel
One thing you can't lose
And it's that feel3Embed
