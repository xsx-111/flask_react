Earth Died Screaming Lyrics
Rudy's on the midway and Jacob's in the hole
The monkey's on the ladder, the devil shovels coal
With crows as big as airplanes, the lion has three heads
And someone will eat the skin that he sheds

Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Dreaming of you

Well, hell doesn't want you and heaven is full
Bring me some water, put it in this skull
I walk between the raindrops, I wait in bug house square
And the army ants, they leave nothin' but the bones

And the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Dreaming of you
There was thunder, there was lightning
Then the stars went out and the moon fell from the sky
It rained mackerel, it rained trout
And the great day of wrath has come
And here's mud in your big red eye
The poker's in the fire and the locusts take the sky

Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
Well, the earth died screaming
While I lay dreaming
I lay dreaming of you (dreaming of you)
I'm dreaming of you (dreaming of you)
I'm dreaming of you (dreaming of you)
I'm dreaming of you (dreaming of you)1Embed
