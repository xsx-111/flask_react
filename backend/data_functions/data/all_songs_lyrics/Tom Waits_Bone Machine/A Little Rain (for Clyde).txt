A Little Rain (for Clyde) LyricsWell, the ice man's mule is parked outside the bar
Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar
And the German dwarf dances with the butcher's son
And tonight, a little rain never hurt no one
Well, they're dancing on the roof and the ceiling's coming down
And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves
And a little trouble makes it worth the going
And a little rain never hurt no one
Oh, the world is round and I'll go around
You must risk something that matters
Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here
If it's worth the going, it's worth the ride
She was fifteen years old and she'd never seen the ocean
She climbed into a van with a vagabond
And the last thing she said was "I love you, Mom"
And a little rain never hurt no one
And a little rain never hurt no oneEmbed
