Whistle Down the Wind LyricsI grew up here, all of my life
I dreamed someday I'd go
Where the blue-eyed girls and the red guitars
And the naked rivers flow
Now I'm not all I thought I'd be
I've always stayed around
I've been as far as Mercy and Grand
Frozen to the ground
I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave
So kiss me once and then
I'll go to hell, I might as well
Be whistlin' down the wind
Bus is at the corner
The clock on the wall
A broken-down windmill
Ain't no wind at all
I yelled and I cursed
If I stay here, I'll rust
And I'm stuck like a shipwreck
Out here in the dust
Well, the sky is red and the world is on fire
And the corn is taller than me
And a dog is tied to a wagon of rain
And the road is wet as the sea
But sometimes the music from a dance
Will carry across the plains
And the places that I'm dreaming of
Do they dream only of me?
There are places where they never sleep
And the circus never ends
So I will take the Marley Bone Coach
And be whistlin' down the wind
So I will take the Marley Bone Coach
And be whistlin' down the wind2Embed
