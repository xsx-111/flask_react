Auf Wiedersehen Lyrics
Au revoir, auf wiedersehen
You won't see another morning
You won't see another evening
Good night
Buenos noches o senor
Senorita see ya later
Buenos noches
Bye bye

There are many here among us
Who feel that life is a joke
And for you we sing this final song
For you there is no hope

Sayonara suicide
Hari kari, kamikaze
You won't see another evening
Goodbye
Buenas noches senor
Senorita see you later
Buenas noches
Bye bye
There are many here among us
Who feel their lives is a joke
And for you we sing this final song
For you there is no hope

Bye bye, so long, farewell
Bye bye,  so long, sayanora
Bye bye, au revoir, auf wiedersehen
Bye bye, so long, farewell
Bye bye, so long, suicide
Bye bye, so long, hari kari, kamikaze, suicide
Suicide
Suicide
SuicideEmbed
