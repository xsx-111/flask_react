Surrender (outtake) LyricsMother told me, yeah, she told me
That I'd meet girls like you
She also told me, "Stay away
You'll not know what you'll catch"
Just the other day I heard
Of a soldier's falling off
Some Indonesian junk
That's going round
Mommy's alright, daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey!
Father
Father says, "Your mother's right
She's really up on things
Before we married, Mommy served
In the WACS in the Philippines"
Now I had heard that WACs were dykes, old maids either that or whores
But mommy's neither one of those
I've known her all these years
Mommy's alright, daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey!
Whatever happened to all this season's
Murderer of the year?
Every time I got to thinking
Here'd they disappear?
But when I woke up, Mom and Dad
Are rolling on the couch
Rolling numbers, rock and rollin'
Got my Kiss records out
Mommy's alright, daddy's alright
They just seem a little weird
Surrender, surrender
But don't give yourself away
Hey, hey!
Away
Away
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Surrender
Surrender
But don't give yourself away
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
Surrender but don't give yourself away
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
Surrender Surrender
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
But don't give yourself away
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
Surrender
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
Surrender Surrender
Mommy's alright, Daddy's alright
Ned's alright
Tommy's alright
Johnny's alright
Gary's alright
Ricky's alright
We're alright
We're all alright
Alright tonight
Oh Konnichiwa
Lick your tits all night longEmbed
