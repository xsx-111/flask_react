On the Radio Lyrics
(It's on the radio)
I love the music (on the radio)
It's what they're playing
(When the radio's on)
And you and me get crazy
(It's on the radio)
I love the music (on the radio)
It's what they're playing
(When the radio's on)
And you and me get crazy

Hey, mister on the radio
Please play my favorite song
The one where she didn't go away
Hey, mister on the radio
You're really my best friend
Please play my favorite song for me

(It's on the radio)
I love the music (on the radio)
It's what they're playing
(When the radio's on )
And you and me get crazy
(When the radio's on)
Yeah you and me get crazy
Hey, mister on the radio
You're with me every day
And late at night I turn you on
Hey, mister on the radio
You're really my best friend
Please play my favorite song for me

All of the rock and roll DJ's
Got their fingers on the world
'Cause they play the songs
That make you and me feel so good

(Turn up your radio)
And hear the music
(On the radio)
This song is playin'
(When the radio's on)
And you and me get crazy
(Turn up your radio)
And hear the music
(On the radio)
This song is playin'
(When the radio's on)
And you and me get crazy
(When the radio's on)
And you and me get crazy
(When the radio's on)
Yeah you and me get crazy
(When the radio's on)
Yeah, yeah you and me get crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy

One minute the back side of midnight
It's me Captain Gonzo ready to roll hot wax
Anything you want to hear
All night its a balmy 73 degrees in Boss City, 71 in the Valley, 
But remember if you snooze you lose
I'm gonna hang with you, I'll crank it on
So let me know what you want to hear
Phone lines are open now
You say it you know I'm gonna play it
And be ready to win when I tell you to call in and whatever you do
Remember the phrase that pays puts your brain on vacation
And let your toes take over
Keep your pedal to the metal
I'll be back in sixty seconds
In the meantime go with it
Go for it, go nuts, go completely wild1Embed
