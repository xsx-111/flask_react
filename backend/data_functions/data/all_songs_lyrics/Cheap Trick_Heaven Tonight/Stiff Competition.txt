Stiff Competition Lyrics
Stiff competition
If I go up, you take me higher
Stiff competition
And when I'm down, you take me higher

Stiff competition all over the world
I screw you, you screw me, they screw us
Here we go again
All right, we have so much fun
When we're together
When we're together
When we're together
Now

I looked hard in your eyes
I was in love at first sight
It took me minutes, you're still waiting
Waiting for your turn
Your turn it won't be long

Stiff competition
I work hard every day of my life
Stiff competition
Get it up, you take me higher
Stiff competition
All over the world
The more I get, the more I like it
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
All right, we have so much fun
When we're together
When we're together
When we're together
Now

I looked hard in your eyes
I was in love at first sight
It took me minutes, you're still waiting
Waiting for your turn
Your turn it won't be long

Stiff competition
Stiff competition
Stiff competition
Stiff competitionEmbed
