California Man Lyrics
Goin' to a party, meet me on after school
Well, we're goin' to a place where the jive is really cool
And if the band stops playin' there's a jukebox down the hall
And with your blue dress on, your folks are all gone
You're sure to give the guys a ball

Get that real guitar, boy, shakin'
I'm a California man
Dance right on 'till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man
Well, I rocked my Mama so bad
This woman she's makin' me mad
Well, I don't care if her legs start achin'
I'm a California man

Well, my legs start to shiver when I hear you call my name
Well, my knees keep a-knockin' and my bow tie's bustin' out
Well, my feet start to fly and my jeans slung way down low
You know I'm back on my heels and it's makin' me feel
Like the king of rock 'n' roll

Get that real guitar, boy, shakin'
I'm a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man
Well, I rocked my Mama so bad
This woman she's making me mad
I don't care if your legs start achin'
I'm a California man
I'm a California man

Goin' to a party, meet me on after school
Well we're goin' to a place where the jive is really cool
And if the band stops playin' there's a jukebox down the hall
And with your blue dress on, your folks are all gone
You're sure to give the guys a ball

Get that real guitar, boy, shakin'
I'm a California man
Dance right on till the floors are breakin'
I'm a California man
I really rocked my Mama so bad
This woman's she's making me mad
Well, I don't care if your legs start achin'
I'm a California man

I'm a California man
I'm a California manEmbed
