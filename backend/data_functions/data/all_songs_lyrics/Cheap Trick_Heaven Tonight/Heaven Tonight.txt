Heaven Tonight Lyrics

Down the line, don't go over
There's a limit you went over
So much time, time runs out
Time ran out, make it down

Would you like to go to Heaven tonight?
Would you like to go to Heaven tonight?
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Would you like to go to Heaven tonight?
Would you like to go to Heaven tonight? Aah

Down the line, couldn't get much
Couldn't get much higher if you tried
And tried and tried, you're as guilty
It's a crime, ooh, it's a crime

Would you like to go to heaven tonight?
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?
Aah, aah, aah, aah

Would you like to go to heaven tonight?
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?
Would you like to go to heaven tonight?

You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come down
You can never come down, you can never come

Down, inside, you're getting nervous
You've never been this high before, oh
