Black Box Messiah LyricsYatto jiyuu! Hajimeru jikan da!
Shoumi de natsuin. Konkai ha katsu zo
Stayed with me - so violently
Played all your games on me
Broke all the chains just in time
A leap of faith made me fall back in line
Yatoo yihu! Hadjimeru jikan-da!
Shomi de natsuin konkai ha katsu zo
Made peace with what I held for true
Have faith in what I now must do
Sweet devotion, a sacred smile
Traded my secrets so you'll never leave my side
Yatoo yihu! Hadjimeru jikan-da!
Shomi de natsuin konkai ha katsu zo
Yatoo yihu! Hadjimeru jikan-da!
Shomi de natsuin konkai ha katsu zoEmbed
