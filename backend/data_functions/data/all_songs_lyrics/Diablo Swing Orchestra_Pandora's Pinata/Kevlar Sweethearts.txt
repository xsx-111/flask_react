Kevlar Sweethearts LyricsBreaking the me
Breaking in two
And it's all because of you
Blind to what's there
Too blind to care
And it's all because of you
Save whatever has been
Broken and left with the will to surrender to failure
Time to feel, time to believe
Dare to see what may come of our future
Lift your head, broaden your gaze
Speak your mind and your thoughts they will follow you
Taking my time
Biding my time
And it's all because of you
Waiting to see
What's waiting for me
And it's all because of you
Brave, but I am weary
Failed to remember the fear that I had of your failures
Time to feel, time to believe
Dare to see what may come of our future
Lift your head, broaden your gaze
Speak your mind and your thoughts they will follow youEmbed
