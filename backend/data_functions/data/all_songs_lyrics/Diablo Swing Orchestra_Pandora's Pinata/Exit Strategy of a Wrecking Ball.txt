Exit Strategy of a Wrecking Ball LyricsI brought the stars to burn you
I thought their beauty would turn you around
This state of chaos suits you
But now I've got a nation to crush you
On my command...
On my command
I've come to erase you
I'm here to replace you
This time words won't save you
This time no one fears you
And I can't wait
And I can't wait
To get you out of my mind
I searched a world to cure you
So now I wear the scars of your bitter disease
I'm rage and ruin before you
And without a thought in my mind
I'll make you come clean...
I'll make you come clean
I've come to erase you
I'm here to replace you
This time words won't save you
This time no one fears you
And I can't wait
And I can't wait
To get you out of my mind...
You'll never see her again1Embed
