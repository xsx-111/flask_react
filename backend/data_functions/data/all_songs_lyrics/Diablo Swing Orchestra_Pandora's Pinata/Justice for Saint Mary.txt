Justice for Saint Mary LyricsSeizures may guide me, insanity found me
I smile as your vanity sings us to sleep
Burning from both sides, secrets we can't hide
That halo you're wearing, it's not yours to keep
Stolen, and maybe broken
Since all that you left
Is a life that can never be whole again
Fallen, I heard the warning
'Cause all that I had was a life
That can never be whole again
Will you wait in my honour?
Save what's left of it in vain
When it's there for all to see
Will I wait in your honour?
Save what's left of it in vain
When it's there for all to see
Hear the sound of violence
It's a beat that makes us dance
You sway and I follow your lead
Drained, like a landmine armed and primed
Your words, they sound like mine
We all shall repent what we've done
In time
Confession in real time
Lies could have been mine
Naked are words that
Are dressed up in truth
Light up with voices
Screaming your choices
All that was lost just
To keep you from harm
Spoken, like you told them
For all that I left was a battle
That I'll never fight again
Show them we're above them
For all that I have is a heart
Unsure if even time can mend
Will you wait in my honour?
Save what's left of it in vain
When it's there for all to see
Will I wait in your honour?
Save what's left of it in vain
And it's there for all to seeEmbed
