Honey Trap Aftermath LyricsWas it me, was it you
Was it everything that
Never came true?
(Hush my child)
Now won't you need them?
(I'll make them mine)
In spite of how you treat them
Grace and fear
But the vision never ever came clear
(Watch me try)
It's time that you see them
(They'll break with time)
What if you need them?
What if you need them?
Way down
Won't you lead us on our
Way down from here
Way down
Won't you lead us on our
Way down from here
I will seek and reveal
What if nothing that we knew was for real?
(I did my time)
Love them and leave them?
(But it became my life)
And now you try to heal them?
Steal my time
And the honor was all but mine
(Changed since then)
How come I don't believe it?
(Have faith again)
Never had a reason
Come on down and lead
Way down
Won't you lead us on our
Way down from here
(We are on our way down)
Way down, (on our way down)
Won't you lead us on our
Way down from here (We are on our way down)
Now I am on my
Way down, (on our way down)
Won't you lead us on our
Way down from here (We are on our way down)
On our way down
On our way down
We are on our way down2Embed
