Aurora LyricsI gave you life in times when all our colours bled
Cherished hopes and dreams of the life that we never led
And now it's too late
Time to release you, safe and sound
Time to conceal all of your scars
Forgive and forget
We'll live to regret it all
And now we know this was not meant to last
You gave me time i thought was already mine
Spoke of what was wrong
I should have seen all of your signs
And now it's too late
Time to release you, safe and sound
Time to conceal all of your scars
Forgive and forget
We'll live to regret it all
And now we know this was not meant to lastEmbed
