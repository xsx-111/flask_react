Mass Rapture LyricsIn love and in glory
We worship her story
Made a believer, I'm made out of rays from her skin
Blinded by faith, I thought her real from within
Immersed in a sense to defend
My thoughts went black just as by heaven sent
Clean your feathers and rise
Phoenix burns with them ether eyes tonight
Heed her words
Soothing and beautiful
Freed from the herd
Seen and touched by the merciful
Holy lies, deep inside
Her body a temple, we cannot hide
Blood runs dry, we're paralyzed
Saved 'cause we're immortal now
In love and in glory
We worship her story
Seek and reveal, release and then cleanse what you fear
She reminds me of truth, reminds me of trust and what's real
She is silence reborn
I'm dragged into light with a mind that's torn
Blessed once again in her arms
Divine, and with a snake's charm
She is peaceEmbed
