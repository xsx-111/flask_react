Voodoo Mon Amour LyricsInsert your needles elsewhere
I'm broken as it is
Cannot stand or take the fall
Consider it as a bliss
Bewildered by your ego
Such savage since you smiled
When I can see your pins in me
Iron gifts come pouring down
Voodoo (mon amour)
Voodoo (mon amour)
Voodoo
Voodoo (cherie mon amour)
It's voodoo mon amour
Soaked in your breath now
We reek as mammals do
Reality emerges
And presents itself upon you
Like a petty piggy laughter
So empty and estranged
(Of each other, from one and another)
And iron gifts just keep pouring down
It's voodoo, mon amour
It's voodoo, mon amour
It's voodoo
It's voodoo, mon cherie, mon amour
It's voodoo, mon amour
It's voodoo, mon amour
It's voodoo
It's voodoo (cherie mon amour)
It's voodoo, mon amour
It's voodoo, mon amour
It's voodoo
It's voodoo, mon cherie, mon amour1Embed
