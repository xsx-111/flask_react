Crystal Pistol LyricsWell, I've been staring at the mirror ball for ages and I'll never quit
I'm gonna shatter it to bits and swallow every little piece of it
Maybe it'll light me up and send me speedin' down electric way
Or would it burn my body from the inside for a day?

Ya can't die twice but ya may as well try
To be that grin underneath the black eye
I'd make that promise but I always change my mind
And it's so grey
To be locked to yourself
With a frown for a face
And a life that just
Wants to be turned into hate

I'm gonna buy myself a little big-sized kind of gun
So I can launch myself through space and straight into the sun

Ya can't die twice but ya may as well try
To be that grin underneath the black eye
I'd make that promise but I always change my -
And it's so gold
With your teeth in your hands
While you're left there to lie
And your money walked out
And you can't get high
You gotta get yourself a little-big sized kind of gun
So you can shoot yourself through space and straight into the sun

Ya can't die twice but ya may as well try
To be that grin underneath the black eye
I'd make that promise but I always change my mindEmbed
