Little Silver Cross LyricsWatching the news man
For somewhere to go
Waiting for something
That's coming too slow
Too slow
Too slow, too slow, too slow, too slow
Too slow, too slow, too slow, too slow
A good bunch of will-nots
Who fucked up in class
And sold all their good stuff for gallons of gas
Watching the news man
For somewhere to go
Dying for something
That's coming too slow
Too slow
Too slow, too slow, too slow, too slow
Too slow, too slow, too slow, too slow

A little silver cross
Held tight in the light, shinin' blue
In a pretty midnight Ford blowing heat, holding two
With a beating heart in the backseat, now breakin' loose
Beaming down the road
They threw the town out the window
And sat in the rain
They had blankets and pillows
And they had hearts for brains
They said that you can feel good
But ya gotta be good for yourself
Yeah, you gotta feel good
But you gotta be good to yourself
Be good
Be good, be good, be good, be good
Be good, be good, be good, be good

A little silver cross
Held tight in the light, shinin' blue
In a pretty midnight Ford blowing heat, holding two
With a beating heart in the backseat, now breakin' loose
Beaming down the roadEmbed
