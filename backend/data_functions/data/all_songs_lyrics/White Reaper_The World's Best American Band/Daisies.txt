Daisies LyricsA ghost came over in my sleep to tell me
That I should find you
I should find you
Oh, but I won't pick flowers from another man's garden
Even if I tried to
If I tried to
The executioner is wearing lipstick
The secretary is deluxe as all
The president is blind and in a wheelchair
But the show is going on

Oh, it's daisies when you sing that song
I really don't know what to say
I gotta look away
I gotta look away
I feel wrong, I'm gettin' dragged along
I really don't know what to say
You ought to go away
You ought to go away
The store next door is smokin', it's on fire
Children take their turns to point and scream
And there's a picture of myself hung on a billboard:
Have you seen this man?
Oh, it's daisies when you sing that song
I really don't know what to say
I gotta look away
I gotta look away
I feel wrong, I'm gettin' dragged along
I really don't know what to say
You ought to go away
You ought to go1Embed
