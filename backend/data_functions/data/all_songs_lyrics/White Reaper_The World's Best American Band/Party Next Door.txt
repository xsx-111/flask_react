Party Next Door Lyrics
We were sitting on the porch late summer night one with the good old crew
When the party next door went off and took to the streets
He had a gun in his pocket, then he took it out and cocked it and fired a few
Then the whole big crowd went screamin' and runnin' away

Took 'em on a hell ride
Bullets in the night sky
Took 'em on a hell ride
Kicked 'em to the curbside
Took 'em on a hell ride
Bullets in the night sky
Took 'em on a hell ride
Kicked 'em to the curbside

There was a girl fight over some grad-school student, he was so confused
There was a bagman runnin' around just lookin' for a sale
I'm not a pill-head, baby, I just think that stuff's poetic at times
But I always liked gettin' a little bit out of my head

Took 'em on a hell ride
Bullets in the night sky
Took 'em on a hell ride
Kicked 'em to the curbside
Took 'em on a hell ride
Bullets in the night sky
Took 'em on a hell ride
Kicked 'em to the curbside1Embed
