Another Day LyricsAnother day, no dope
Another day, no fucking nose drugs
Another day, no luck
Another day and I'm cursed, I'm fucked
What's a tommy to do?
I'm broke, ain't got shit to do
When a tommy can't pay
Nothing quite seems okay
Another day, no coke
Another day, and I'm out of smokes
Another day no fuckin' girl
Another day in this bullshit world
Another day, no coke
Another day, and I'm out of smokes
Another day no fuckin' girl
Another day in this bullshit worldEmbed
