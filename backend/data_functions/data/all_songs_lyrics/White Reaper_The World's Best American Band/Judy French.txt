Judy French Lyrics
You know you crack my back little lady
When you tease me like you do
It could be simple, you and me simple
If you say you like it too
And your ripped jeans put me on the floor
Yeah, you make me want to pout
It could be simple, you and me simple
If you want to try it out

Stop, read my message and tell me what you think
Oh, girl, let me lean close, listen to your heartbeat

You can tell me secrets, little lady
I can keep a secret too
No one else would know, no one else would know
No one else but me and you
If I'm on your nerves, just tell me
I don't want to make it hard
I can leave you be, I can leave you be
We don't even have to start

Stop, read my message and tell me what you think
Oh, girl, let me lean close
I can take you home, little lady
I can take you with me too
It could be simple, you and me simple
Just tell me what to do

Stop, read my message and tell me what you think
Oh, girl, let me lean close, listen to your heartbeat
Now stop, read my message and tell me what you think
Let me lean close, listen to your heartbeat
Just stop
Just tell me what you think
Let me lean closeEmbed
