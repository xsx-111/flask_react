The Stack Lyrics
When you get what you want
It's hard to catch pity
When you're guilty as charged
It's hard to look pretty
When you scream in your room, does anyone hear it?
Do you cover your mouth and keep it a secret?

If you make the girls dance
The boy will dance with them
If you play the right cards
The stack will get bigger
When you gamble your winnings away
And you work up the nerve just to play
If you make the girls dance
The boys will dance with them

Well, I hope you still take your trips to the river
And the sound of my voice is giving you shivers
When you're running away, does anyone see you?
Do you cut your hair short and try to conceal it?

If you make the girls dance
The boys will dance with them
If you play the right cards
The stack will get bigger
When you gamble your winnings away
And work up the nerve just to play
If you make the girls dance
The boys will dance with them
If you make the girls dance
The boys will dance with them
If you play the right cards
The stack will get bigger
When you gamble your winnings away
And work up the nerve just to play
If you make the girls dance
The boys will dance with themEmbed
