Tell Me LyricsHe likes to roll
In a brand new stretch-type limo
And soak up the gold
From all the tickets and the tees that he's sold
And we like to watch
And fight over everything that he drops
And the lines? They stay chopped
Oh yeah, 'cause the show can never stop

Oh, he gonna tell me
Oh, he gonna tell me
Oh, he gonna tell me
About the mean kids crashing the bar
And the good kids torching their cars
Yeah, he loves control
Of all the little hearts and the little souls
Blood lovers on patrol
Down all the hills and the streets and the parks and the peaks and the rows
Who knocked this angel on his ass?
He can't swim but he washes up in his cash
Some bills to rinse, some bills to dry
Still he's gonna try

Oh, he gonna tell me
Oh, he gonna tell me
Oh, he gonna tell me
About the mean kids crashing the bar
And the good kids torching their cars
And the mean kids crashing the bar
And the good kids torching their carsEmbed
