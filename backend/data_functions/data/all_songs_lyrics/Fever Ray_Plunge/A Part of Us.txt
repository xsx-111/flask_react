A Part of Us Lyrics
I dig, I plant a walnut tree
I pour a lot of water in

Staring eyes
No disrespectful gaze
Centre of attention
Happy drunk, happy in a safe space

So proud to be a part of us
A chosen family
To love, to trust

Your eyes on me
We know, we know
Stay till tomorrow
Will I even grow old?
A taste of lion's paw, locked jaw
Still here in the morning
How we're making love?

I dig, I plant a walnut tree
I pour a lot of water in
Not that far
There's a change in the atmosphere
What we are
Brings the wrong kind of attention out here

So aware
We stumble through, the morning mist
Cold, wet air
One hand in yours and one hand in a tight fist

I dig, I plant a walnut tree
I pour a lot of water in1Embed
