An Itch Lyrics
Then everything's starting to come after me
And everything's starting to touch me
I go out and slam whoever I meet
They always reach out to touch me

Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you

An itch that started to follow me
The sensation of cutting a sister
A hunt, a game, a ditching spree
Have you ever felt a sister?

Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you

Then everything's starting to come after me
And everything's starting to touch me
I go out and slam whoever I meet
They always reach out to touch me

Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
An itch that started to follow me
The sensation of cutting a sister
A hunt, a game, a ditching spree
Have you ever felt a sister?

Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you
Imagine: touched by somebody who loves you1Embed
