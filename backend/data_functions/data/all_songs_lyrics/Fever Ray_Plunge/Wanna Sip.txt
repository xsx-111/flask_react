Wanna Sip Lyrics
I wanna love you but you’re not making it easy
I wanna love you but you’re not making it easy

I wanna love you but it’s not easy
I wanna love you but it’s not easy

Sometimes my head bends
I kinda got hooked on your scent

A funny trick, a handshake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my handshake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip

Wanna do it, if we do it, it's my way
'Cause how you do it when you do it, it's not okay

Sometimes my head bends
I kinda got hooked on your scent
A funny trick, a handshake
I wanna peek, I wanna sip
I show a funny trick, my handshake
Giving me a peek, giving me a sip

Something vague, a little opening
I wanna come inside

A bad habit, a toxic habit
I know I've got to let you go
It goes for all of us
You're not curious
I don't think you should hang with us

Oh, a bad habit, a toxic habit
I know I've got to let you go
It goes for all of us
You're not curious
I don't think you should hang with us3Embed
