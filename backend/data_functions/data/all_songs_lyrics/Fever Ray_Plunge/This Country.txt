This Country Lyrics
Tell me something sexy and I'll log off my whatever
Gag me and wake my fighting spirit
Take your time and stay off the channels
We're not attractive to this countryâ€™s standards

That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me

Open the gear box and she's on it
Staying alive with a firm hit
No definition in our own leads
Perverts define my fuck history

That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me
That's not how to love me

Free abortions and clean water
Destroy nuclear
Destroy boring
Lovers got love in a love fist
Every time we fuck we win

This house makes it hard to fuck
This house makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck
This country makes it hard to fuck1Embed
