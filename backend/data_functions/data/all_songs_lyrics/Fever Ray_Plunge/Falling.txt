Falling Lyrics
I learned this a while ago
Now it just takes a second
Didn't see it coming at all
It was over in seconds

Sometimes a low is a low
Still when pushing what's possible
A queer healing
Mom just had a feeling

You made me dirty again
She makes me feel dirty again
That old feeling of shame
She makes me feel dirty again

Dirty again
Why she wants me dirty again?
Dirty again
She's making me feel dirty again

Making me feel I want too much
Making me feel it's enough
Come over and see it
Come over and see yourself
Dirty
Why she wants me dirty?
Dirty again
She's making me dirty again4Embed
