To the Moon and Back Lyrics
Hey, remember me?
I've been busy working like crazy
I know you like tangerine
And your kiss is sweet and creamy

Oh, can you imagine
Our friend's fixed for us to bump in
Oh, I'm done looking
Now things can start happening

Hey, remember me?
I've got so much, just come and get me
I played something catchy
You leaned forward and kissed me

First I take you then you take me
Breathe some life into a fantasy
Your lips, warm and fuzzy
I want to run my fingers up your pussy4Embed
