Red Trails Lyrics
Blood was our favourite paint
You were my favourite pain
Waiting for your love to happen
Is like waiting for a drug that never kicks in

Left traces, red trails
Oceans, spray and stains
Your endless radius
Dismantle us
Touching and there's no one there
Playing love and kissing air

Setting the snow on fire
Watching over vivid dreams
This too will pass
Under the moon we last
Arranging my friend in a ring
I invited them to sing

Blood was our favourite paint
You were my favourite pain
Scratches when skin's too thin
Throwing me someone new to take in4Embed
