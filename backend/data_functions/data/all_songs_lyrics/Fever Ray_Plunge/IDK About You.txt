IDK About You Lyrics
Let's meet up when the time is right
The time is right
The time is right

But I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Let's find out what you are about
What's hidden in there
What you got for me there

But I don't know about you
I don't know about you

I know the way to fantasy
The world of dreams
The place to be

But I don't know about you
I don't know about you
Let's find out if our spirits meet
Let's push and tweak
Let our spirits meet

'Cause I don't know about you
No I don't know about you

You can trust me, baby
There's a scratch right there
You can trust me, baby
You can trust me, baby

But I don't know about you
I don't know about you

Anybody who's coming with me
Gotta love my tracks
And swing an axe

No, I don't know about you
I don't know about you
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know
Don't know, don't know, don't know, don't know

But I don't know about you
I don't know about you
But I don't know about you
I don't know about you1Embed
