Untouchable, Part 2 LyricsWhy I should feel this way?
Why I should feel this way?
Why I should feel the same?
Is something I cannot say
Is something I cannot say
Is something I can't explain
I feel you outside at the edge of my life
I see you walk by at the edge of my sight
Why I should follow my heart?
Why I should follow my heart?
Why I should fall apart?
Why I should follow my dreams?
Why I should follow my dreams?
Why I should be at peace?
I feel you outside at the edge of my life
I see you walk by at the edge of my sight
I had to let you go to the setting sun
I had to let you go and find a way back home
I had to let you go to the setting sun
I had to let you go and find a way back home
When I dream all I see is you
When I dream all I see is you
I've never seen a light that's so bright
I've never seen a light that's so bright
I've never seen a light that's so bright
Blinded by the light that's inside
Blinded by the light that's inside
Blinded by the light that's inside youEmbed
