Lightning Song LyricsLightning splits the sky
Shining blinding white
And here I lie almost asleep
Reckoning in a place of peace
And I feel I found my place in time and space
In hope and faith and love I give
My mind is clear, I have no fear
I shed no tears for you my dear
This world is wonderful, so beautiful
If only you can open up your mind and see
Your world is everything you ever dreamed of
If only you can open up your mind and see
The beauty that is here1Embed
