The Lost Child LyricsAdrift on a silent sea
The cold night surrounds me
Black ice forms beneath
The waves of a childhood dream
A far light hypnotized
A voice calls from paradise
Paradise
To here
My light is fading now
My heart is breaking now
My light is fading now
My heart is breaking now
A child sings to me
The mists rise blinding me
I can't find a way out of here
And the sound of angel dreams
The stars fall into the sea
The ice breaks
I'm pulled beneath
Pulled beneath the waves
My life is fading now
My heart is breaking now
My life is failing now
My mind is drowning now
But your hand reaches down
To reach down and pull me out and
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me
Save me1Embed
