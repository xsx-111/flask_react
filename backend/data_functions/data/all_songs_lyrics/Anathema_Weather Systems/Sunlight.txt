Sunlight LyricsSunlight failed, but only for a while
In the moonlight pale someone made me smile
The shining almost took me but I made it through that night
And in the morning life it graced me and I ran for miles
Sunlight in a billion dreams that are lost and won
Moonlight, in spite of all you've seen, there's only one way out
(Say you will)
In a billion dreams that are lost and won
(Love me until I leave the world)
(Say you will)
In spite of all you've seen, there's only one way out
(Love me until I leave the world)
(Say you will)
In a billion dreams that are lost and won
(Love me until I leave the world)
(Say you will)
In spite of all you've seen, there's only one way out
(Love me until I leave the world)1Embed
