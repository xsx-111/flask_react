The Beginning and the End LyricsInside this cold heart is a dream that's locked in a box that I keep
Buried a hundred miles deep, deep in my soul in a place that's surrounded by aeons of silence
And somewhere inside is the key to everything I want to feel
But the dark summer dawns of my memory are lost in a place that can never be
Can someone please show me the way?
Can someone please help me, 'cause I cannot see and the silence is raging
The silence is raging
Silence, silence
Fade into silence
Silence, silence
Fade into silence
Memory, memory
Inside is the key to a memory
Memory, memory
Inside is the key to a memoryEmbed
