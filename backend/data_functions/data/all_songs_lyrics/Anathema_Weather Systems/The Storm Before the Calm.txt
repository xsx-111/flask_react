The Storm Before the Calm LyricsNever, never ever worry
I will always, always
Be there for you
Found you, found you
I will never, ever leave you, never
I will always be here with you
Getting better, better, better, better, better, better
It's getting colder
I'm getting colder, colder
It's getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel anything at all
It's getting colder
It's getting colder, colder
Come on, come on
On me, on me
Touching, laughing, haha
Love me, love me for me
Holding, watching, loving
Getting better, better, better, better, better, better
It's getting colder
I'm getting colder, colder
It's getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel anything at all
It's getting colder
It's getting colder, colder
I'm getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel anything at all

It ebbs and flows and comes and goes
And rips you up and lets you go
It eats inside and splits your mind
As you search around for others kind
You gather strength from the depths
Fight the fight from day 'til night
This beautiful feeling soars over the skies
Moving through my body out my mind
It rises up and floods my brain
This is fucking insane, this is fucking insane
Am I still here as one with the fear?
Am I still alive as one with the fear?
Am I still here as one with the fear?
Am I still alive as one with the fear?
Am I still here as one with the fear?
Am I still alive as one with the fear?
Am I still here as one with the fear?
Am I still alive?
I'm still fucking here
Am I still here?Embed
