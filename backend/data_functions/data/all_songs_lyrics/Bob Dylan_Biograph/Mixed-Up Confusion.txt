Mixed-Up Confusion Lyrics
I got mixed up confusion
Man, it’s a-killing me
Well, there’s too many people
And they’re all too hard to please

Well, my hat’s in my hand
Babe, I’m walking down the line
An’ I’m looking for a woman
Whose head’s mixed up like mine

Well, my head’s full of questions
My temperature’s rising fast
Well, I’m looking for some answers
But I don’t know who to ask

But I’m walking and wondering
And my poor feet don’t ever stop
Seeing my reflection
I’m hung over, hung down, hung up!Embed
