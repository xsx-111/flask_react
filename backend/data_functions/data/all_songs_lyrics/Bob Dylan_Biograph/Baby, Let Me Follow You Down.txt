Baby, Let Me Follow You Down Lyrics
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt
He lives in Cambridge
Ric's a blues guitar player
I met him one day in the
Green pastures of Harvard University

Baby, let me follow you down
Baby, let me follow you down
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Can I come home with you?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me come home with you

Baby, let me follow you down
Baby, let me follow you down
Well, I'll do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down

Yes, I'd do anything in this God-almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
I'll buy you a diamond ring
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
I'll buy you rope and twine
Honey, just for you to climb
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just once drive me out of my mind
Buy you a hoop and skirt
I'll buy you a velvet shirt
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just don't make me hurt4Embed
