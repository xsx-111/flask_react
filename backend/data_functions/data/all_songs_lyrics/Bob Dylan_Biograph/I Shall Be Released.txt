I Shall Be Released Lyrics
They say every man must need protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above the wall

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

Down here next to me in this lonely crowd
There's a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him cry so loud
Calling out that he's been framed
Yeah

I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released7Embed
