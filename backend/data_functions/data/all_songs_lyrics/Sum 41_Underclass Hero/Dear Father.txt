Dear Father Lyrics
Address this letter to Dear Father
I know you as complete unknown
I guess it's better you don't bother
All our truths should be left alone

Be left alone, be left alone

I learned the things you never showed me
Took the chances you'd have blown
And to this day, the one and only
You remain a complete unknown

Complete unknown, complete unknown

You're out there somewhere, I don't know if you
Care at all, it seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never
Come, so you remain a complete unknown

Unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown
Unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown
So many years have been ignored
You've been gone without a trace
I'm getting used to knowing you're
Just a name without a face

Without a face, without a face

You're out there somewhere, I don't know if you
Care at all, it seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never
Come, so you remain a complete unknown
You're out there somewhere, I don't know if you
Care at all, it seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never
Come, so you remain a complete unknown

Unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown
Unknown, unknown, unknown, unknown

Address this letter to Dear Father
I know you as complete unknown
I guess it's better you don't bother
All our truths should be left alone
You're out there somewhere, I don't know if you
Care at all, it seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never
Come, so you remain a complete unknown
You're out there somewhere, I don't know if you
Care at all, it seems that you don't
It's as if the day will never
Come, so you remain a complete unknown

You're out there somewhere, I don't know if you care...4Embed
