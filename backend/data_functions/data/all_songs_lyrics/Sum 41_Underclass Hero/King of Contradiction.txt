King of Contradiction Lyrics
I've dethroned the king of contradiction or were you just a
Jester all along, a simple pawn? Don't you know you
Can't count your tears like your money running down the
Drain, the drain!

You don't need to pray for me, 'cause I'm not the one to blame
I can't wait to see you going down in flames
Could it be? No, not what we became
You lost the human race

I hope you burn like a cigarette in ashes as your head comes
Down and crashes, your throat pours blood from slashes
And I hope you never forget like a tattoo of regret this
Time, this time

You don't need to pray for me, 'cause I'm not the one to blame
I can't wait to see you going down in flames
Could it be? No, not what we became
You lost the human race

Now you're replaced now, was nice to know you now
Your time is up so...

Just drop dead!
