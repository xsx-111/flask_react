So Long Goodbye Lyrics
Time passes by, direction unknown
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it, your cup's overflown
But you measure no one that I've ever known

And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars, and believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright, and so long, goodbye

We always knew that it'd come to this
It's times like these I forget what I miss
Matters of heart are hard to address
Especially when yours is full of emptiness

And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars, and believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright, and so long, goodbye

Time passes by, direction unknown
You've left us now, but we're not alone
Before you know it, your cup's overflown
But you measure no one that I've ever known

And it's quite alright
And goodbye for now
Just look up to the stars, and believe who you are
'Cause it's quite alright, and so long, goodbyeEmbed
