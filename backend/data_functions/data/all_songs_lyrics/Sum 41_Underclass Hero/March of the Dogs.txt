March of the Dogs Lyrics
Ladies and gentlemen of the Underclass...
The president of the United States of America is dead!

I don't believe in the politics
Of chosen fools and hypocrites
Who walk a line that's tread so fine
Is it death or glory you have in mind?

And here we go, again it's mass delusion
No one knows, who leads this revolution now
As tension grows, the way to a conclusion
It's too late, there's no time
It's too late, there's no time
All for none, none for one, two, three, four

March of the dogs to a beat of disillusion
Sworn under God, breeding panic and confusion
The white flag is down, send in the clowns
The carnival of sins is now about to begin

It may be I'm a pessimist
But I'd say we need an exorcist
The root of all evil's standing tall
Under God and above us all
And here we go, again in desperation
All we know is confusion and frustration now
As tension grows, no vision of salvation
It's too late, there's no time
It's too late, there's no time
All for none, none for one, two, three, four

March of the dogs to a beat of disillusion
Sworn under God,  breeding panic and confusion
The white flag is down, send in the clowns
The carnival of sins is now about to begin

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
A-one, two, three, four


And now the president's dead, because they blew off his head
No more neck to be red, guess to heaven, he fled
Was it something he said, or because of who's in his bed
By whom will we be led? From whose hand will we be fed?
All the lies by the lying liars who said
"We'll be fine, it's okay, hey, look mom, no head!"
Blah blah blah blah... It's the carnival of sins!
Blah blah blah blah... And a one, two, three go!
Blah blah blah blah... It's alright, I said go!
Blah blah blah blah... One, two, three, I say go!
(It's okay, alright...)2Embed
