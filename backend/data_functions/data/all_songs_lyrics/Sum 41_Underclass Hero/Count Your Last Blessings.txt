Count Your Last Blessings Lyrics

Last call for regrets and defeat
To finish the bottle full of empty dreams
Punch-drunk headed straight out of line
Another excuse with no alibi
Hitching on the road of decline
With no-name streets and no vital signs
I pissed away the best of me and
No one can help me! (Help me! Help me!)

I'm misery's best friend, deadbeat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit, don't forget that you better

Count your last blessings, I fell off the wagon
I'm chasing six feet, and now I'm running out of time

My hands are tied and nailed to the cross
I'm looking for all the composure I lost
I'm petulant with a bad attitude
A poster child vision of wasted youth
I dodged the book and found the key
I can't say the same for dignity
I pissed away the best of me and
No one can help me! (Help me! Help me!)
I'm misery's best friend, deadbeat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit, don't forget that you better

Count your last blessings, I fell off the wagon
I'm chasing six feet, and now I'm running out of time

Now I'm my own enemy, I don't hear you now
Perfect tragedy, God bless us denial
Now I'm my own enemy, I don't hear you now
Perfect tragedy, God bless us denial

I'm misery's best friend, deadbeat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit, don't forget that you better

Count your last blessings, I fell off the wagon
I'm chasing six feet, and now I'm running out of time
I'm misery's best friend, deadbeat on a dead end
A bag full of regrets and I'm coming clean
The self-elect resident reject
A bad habit, don't forget that you better

Count your last blessings, I fell off the wagon
I'm chasing six feet, and now I'm running out of time
