The Jester Lyrics
A jester of sorts you stand holding your courts
Over minions on Capitol Hill
In a bath full of blood, I'm alone standing still
Under God you can fire at will, one, two, three, four!

When the devil's angels come to take your life and lead you
To the flames beneath, your headstone reads now
Here lies the dead who was hung by his head beneath us
They're laying in their graves, damnation free-for-all!

A prodigal son can't undo what he's done
A figurehead of capitol crime
With a light shining down, as you fall to your knees
To repent would be nothing but lies, one, two, three, four!

When the devil's angels come to take your life and lead you
To the flames beneath, your headstone reads now
Here lies the dead who was hung by his head beneath us
They're laying in their graves, damnation free-for-all!

La la la la la la la (Hey! Hey!), la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la (Hey! Hey!), la la la la la la la

Deadbeat, six feet dead
Underground
An eye for an eye only leaves us all blind
Going once, twice, there goes your life

When the devil's angels come to take your life and lead you
To the flames beneath, your headstone reads now
Here lies the dead who was hung by his head beneath us
They're laying in their graves, damnation free-for-all!
