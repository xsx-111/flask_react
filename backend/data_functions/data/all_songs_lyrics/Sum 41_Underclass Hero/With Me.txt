With Me Lyrics
I don't want this moment to ever end
Where everything's nothing without you
I'd wait here forever just to, to see you smile
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

Through it all, I've made my mistakes
I stumble and fall, but I mean these words

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

Thoughts ran unspoken, forever in vow
And pieces of memories fall to the ground
I know what I didn't have, so I won't let this go
'Cause it's true, I am nothing without you

All the streets where I walked alone
With nowhere to go have come to an end
I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go

In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
When you don't know what you're looking to find
In front of your eyes, it falls from the skies
When you just never know what you will find
What you will find, what you will find
What you will find, what you will find


I don't want this moment to ever end
Where everything's nothing without you

I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go
I want you to know, with everything I won't let this go
These words are my heart and soul (so I hold on)
I'll hold on to this moment, you know
As I bleed my heart out to show, and I won't let go
