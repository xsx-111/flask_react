Speak of the Devil Lyrics
Trying to find a way, getting better every day
And I got you, now I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in

I've seen many a face from young and to old
I've stolen their faith and I have broken their souls
Was here before Christ had forgave you your sins
And paid your price, and sealed your fate within

Days have come to an end, today's the day that we meet again
The self-inflicted inebriation guilt never lies alone

I've been waiting for the chance to reunite this sick romance
Poison never hurt so good
So nice of you to speak of me, your closest friend and enemy
And only saviour of masochists

Well, it's the dead-end, slave, from the altar to the grave
It's the last days of our life and faith, amen
Time, it's been so long and now there's nothing to say
I'm trying so hard to find the words to say
I'm tired of being, now I'm something I'm not
I can't believe and I never thought

Days would come to an end well, maybe someday we'll meet again
If ever that day never comes it would be too soon, my love

I've been waiting for the chance to nullify this sick romance
Pull the chord to detonate
So sick of you don't speak of me, no represent of misery
And only saviour of masochists

Well, it's the dead-end, slave, from the altar to the grave
It's the last days of our life
Well, it's the dead-end, slave, from the altar to the grave
It's the last days of our life and faith, amen

Trying to find a way, getting better every day
And I got you now, I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in
Trying to find a way, getting better every day
And I got you now, I'm not alone
All I need in this life is one
One thing to believe in...2Embed
