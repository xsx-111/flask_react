Pull the Curtain Lyrics
(Where'd I go wrong?) Pull the curtain, begin
Paranoia's wearing thin now, it's wearing thin now
(Where'd I go wrong?) Close my eyes, realize
I've become the victimized now, desensitized now

The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

(Where'd I go wrong?) Something's wrong because I
Find the glamour in the dark side, in the dark side
(Where'd I go wrong?) Cheap regrets, can't forget
Falling victim to the debts still unpaid in my mind

The one and only day has come
I pay for all the bad things I've done

It's going to take me, you don't know tragedy
I've been to hell and back again to tell and
Close my eyes and lay me down to sleep
I fear the worst, my beating heart ticks to explode
And my time is up so
Why can't I just sleep?!


Living dead awake, the horror show begins
So pull the curtains over me...

Bring on the panic
The uncontrolled and manic
It's a free-for-all kill them all, every last one of them
(Well, hey hey hey yeah) I don't care at all
Bring on the panic
The uncontrolled and manic
It's a free-for-all kill them all, every last one of you
(Well, hey hey hey yeah) I don't care at all

Suffocate the dreams in my mind
(I can't stop believing)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined
(Stop this heart from bleeding)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
(My intentions fold up)
No one told me empathy's a lie
(Lost in paranoia)
Suffocate the dreams in my mind
My last words, I'm choking, are all my dreams broken
(I can't stop believing)
Drown the thoughts that have me confined
The silence is deafening, my ears won't stop ringing
(Stop this heart from bleeding)
Gutter dreams as black as the night
My last words, I'm choking, are all my dreams broken
(My intentions fold up)
No one told me empathy's a lie...
The silence is deafening, my ears won't stop ringing...
(Lost in paranoia...)
Now we're gone, do you still
Feel the same way now? Can't you
See, I need help to stop
Me from myself, but can't you help me now?2Embed
