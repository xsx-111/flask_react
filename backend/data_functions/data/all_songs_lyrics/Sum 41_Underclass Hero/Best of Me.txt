Best of Me Lyrics

It's so hard to say that I'm sorry
I'll make everything alright
All these things that I've done
Now what have I become, and where'd I go wrong?

I don't mean to hurt just to put you first
I won't tell you lies (I'm sorry)
I will stand accused with my hand on my heart
I'm just trying to say

I'm sorry, it's all that I can say, you mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done if I could start again
I'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me

I know that I can't take back
All of the mistakes but I will try
Although it's not easy
I know you believe me cause I would not lie
Don't believe their lies told through jealous eyes
They don't understand (I'm sorry)
I won't break your heart, I won't bring you down
But I will have to say

I'm sorry, it's all that I can say, you mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done if I could start again
I'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me


I'm sorry, it's all that I can say, you mean so much
And I'd fix all that I've done if I could start again
I'd throw it all away to the shadows of regrets
And you would have the best of me...6Embed
