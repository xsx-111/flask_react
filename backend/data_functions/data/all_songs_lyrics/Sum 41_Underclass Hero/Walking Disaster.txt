Walking Disaster Lyrics
I haven't been home for a while, I'm sure everything's the same
Mom and dad both in denial, an only child to take the blame
Sorry mom, but I don't miss you, father's no name you deserve
I'm just a kid with no ambitions, wouldn't come home for the world
You'll never know what I've become, the king of all that's said and
Done, the forgotten son
This city's buried in defeat, I walk along these no name streets
Wave goodbye to all as I fall...

At the dead end I begin to burn the bridge of innocence
Satisfaction guaranteed a pill away catastrophe
On a mission, nowhere bound, inhibitions underground
A shallow grave I have dug all by myself

And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

A walking disaster, the son of all bastards
You regret you made me, it's too late to save me
(You regret you made me, it's too late to save me)

And he said, "Far as I can tell, it's just voices in my head
Am I talking to myself 'cause I don't know what I just said?"
And she said, "Far is where I fell, maybe I'm better off dead
Am I at the end of nowhere, is this as good as it gets?"

And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

A walking disaster, the son of all bastards
You regret you made me, it's too late to save me

To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
(It's too late to save me)
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
(It's too late to save me)
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
(It's too late to save me)
To save me, to save me, to save me, to save me
To save me, to save me, to save me...
And now I've been gone for so long
I can't remember who was wrong
All innocence is long gone
I pledge allegiance to a world of disbelief where I belong

A walking disaster, the son of all bastards
You regret you made me, it's too late to save me

I will be home in a while, you don't have to say a word
I can't wait to see you smile, wouldn't miss it for the world
I will be home in a while, you don't have to say a word
I can't wait to see you smile, wouldn't miss it for the world9Embed
