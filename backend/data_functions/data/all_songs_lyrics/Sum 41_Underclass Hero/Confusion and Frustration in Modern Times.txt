Confusion and Frustration in Modern Times Lyrics

Up in smoke pop goes the culture, the tension blew it up
While choking from my bleeding ulcer, we eventually threw it up

So what went wrong? Where's the voice of reason?
It's long gone, we lost it long ago
Apathy plus-sized filled the void of motivation
I can hardly breathe at all

Confusion's all I see, frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell, sedation? What the hell?

I broke the mirror to the past to find what I was looking for
The bleeding heart of broken glass is all I found and nothing

More regrets short of no correction
Paid my debts to anxiety
The iron lung collapsed from the pressure and the swelling
I can hardly breathe at all
Confusion's all I see, frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell, sedation? What the hell?
Confusion's all I see, frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell, sedation? What the hell?

Dead-end roads and warning signs
Destination nowhere in sight, so!


Divided we stand, together we fall
There isn't a god that can save us all
So don't pray on your knees, just beg on your hands
There is no belief in this promised land
Divided we stand, together we fall
There's no god that can save us all
So don't pray on your knees, just beg on your hands
There is no belief in this promised land, there is no belief...

Confusion's all I see, frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell, sedation? What the hell?
Confusion's all I see, frustration surrounds me
Solution's bid farewell, sedation? What the hell?1Embed
