Dearborn And Buried LyricsOne day I awoke
And I saw
The world
That comes from us
Dearborn
I will remain
A world
And death comes from my ashes
We were called upon
And awaited a sign
There was a fire divine
Remember us
And you will remain
We all fell
And overcame
Bereaved
This is our soil
Remember it
And it will remain
Dearborn
When ashes reign
Remember us
Dearborn
When ashes reign
Remember us
Dearborn
When ashes reign
Remember us
When ashes reign
Remember us
We were the flame
Now when will I be wounded enough?Embed
