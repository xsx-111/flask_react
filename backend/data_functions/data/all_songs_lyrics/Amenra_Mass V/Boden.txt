Boden LyricsCarry within
A fear
That blossoms on skin
Forever alone
Sorrow says
Bury my bones
Carry within
Regret
For everything
Tear old pain away
I renounce this day and
I renounce every wound
Made in my flesh
Made by my flesh
Are you awake? what did you see?
I'm a sudden hissing
Right behind your ear
A white noise
But it's quiet now
I am reason
I am fear
Inflict
I call out
And you fear me
I call out
And all the brothers in the world they hear me
But the pain remains the sameEmbed
