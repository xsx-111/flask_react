Satudarah LyricsEvery time I look up to you
I don’t know myself
Every time I say so
You don’t talk back
Every bow my head take
I done too late
Oh remember my boy
You don't owe me
Now all my friends
Call me big black
Every form of ours
I can't remember
Free fall if you want
Just don't lose it
I remember the time
My Indian dad said
Think you're a big man
Why don't you talk back
So I stood up
Pushed my chair back
Think you're a big man
Why don't you talk backEmbed
