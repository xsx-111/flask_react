Believe Lyrics
I believe, can’t deny it
Seen heaven, don’t get down
When I was a kid I was afraid to die
But I growed up now

Radio’s on and they’re playing my song
Back in 1992
Things were simpler baby, you hear everyone say
But don’t make it true

If I’m caught in the hour of dark
Won’t laugh, won’t make a sound
I won’t scream, and I won’t get excited
I know God’s underground

Well, seems to me baby you don’t want to stay
That’s okay if that’s true
Yeah, life goes on, and this is just a song
But still I do it for you
And I do it for you

I can feel it in the air tonight
Summer’s almost done
They said you lived out on the wrong side
You said that’s half the fun
Let’s not talk too heavy
I’ll see you next go around
Echoes back all things at last
Return where they belong
I believe, and I’ve been spared
And I’m not down
Fall to tears, and I’m not teasing
I’m not down
Yeah I’m not down
Do it for you
I’m not down
Do it for you
Do it for you
I’m not down
Do it for you, yeah, feel it too
Can’t stop the kid from singing
Do it for you
Yeah I’m not down
Be strong
Thick-skinned
Her heart started racing
Her hips start moving
When things go black
I got you
She’d say, she’d say
She’d say, she’d say
Keep steady, do it
Don’t stop, do it3Embed
