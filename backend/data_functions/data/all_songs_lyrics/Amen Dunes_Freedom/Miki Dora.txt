Miki Dora LyricsGetting on fine
Catch the next wave
Get the move right
Darken the wave
Coasting all day
Coasting all day
The way you're going
We know what you'll say
The waves are gone
The waves are gone
The waves are gone, you said
Man, they all gone
Pride destroyed me man
'Til it took a hold of me
And I feel it when I cry
I can feel it in my dreams
Miki Dora
Taking your time
Waves are gone
Waves are gone
1963
We were up on North Beach
And you're copping all my tricks, man
But you don't do it like me
Sitting on the pier
Sipping on my beer
I come upon a vision
When Mary comes to me
Silver golden waves
And chills that keep me clear
You all recall my name
But don't mean a thing to me
Miki so fine
Catch the next wave
Miki Dora
Darken the wave
The waves they are gone
The waves they are gone
The waves are gone
The waves are gone
Pride destroyed me man
And I didn't know the deal
I said, "I'm sad I'm gonna cry"
Scaring the devil in me
I shouldn't have gone
We shouldn't have gone
But I did not discover the difference
It didn't come to me
Give with nothing to take
Slid along the waves
He could not suffer existence
It wasn't meant to be
Getting on fine
Rolling on me
There's still enough time
To roll around with me
Roll around with me
Roll around with me
Roll around with me
Roll around with me
Roll around with me
Roll around with me3Embed
