Calling Paul the Suffering LyricsCalling Paul the suffering, calling you
Eric I been rolling, met with tears, love and tears, all on you
Born puzzled and dumb
Dear I'm the Messiah
Hear me now dad
Clear tones
High about the plains
Wishing he was alive again
Knowing the only kind of good
Was thinking that he could
High about the plains
Wishing I was alive again
Knowing the only kind of good
Was thinking that I could
Here we look back
Ain't it good?
Here we look back
Say you could?
He's the king of kindness
King of kindness
King of kindness
King of kindness
King of kindness
King ah ah ah ah
You'll get called
I been rolling two years now
I'll make you proud boo
Do what I like in the morning
Tell me now this and that, do you
But I'm going up man
You go down, I'll see you around, man
Do what I like, yeah, dear boy
I'm a boy too, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
