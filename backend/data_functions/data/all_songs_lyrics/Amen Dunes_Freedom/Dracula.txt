Dracula LyricsHere and then you're gone
Yeah Houston love song
Used to run around
With the vampires uptown
But I've seen them fade
And I got to get away
In the years to come you know that
Houston loved me wrong
Picture Saint Denis
Put his arms around me
My baby, don't lie
My baby, so true
Arm in arm
With Houston thug
Keep it low to the ground, now
As you get to know the town
Cutie's mind is on fire
She had a spiritual good time
She's never been a good student
But she's cute
My baby don't lie
Don't you know I'm in the mood
Gonna do it to you
Yeah, you make it through December
And I really look up to you
Keep it cool and calm
Keep it going till it's done
Drove on for Point Judith
Drove his car through the city
Well, what can you do
Every thought you had was untrue
Been dreaming too long
Fell under the snow cloud
Powerful two-chord blues
Coming through from me to you
Maybe this is all
Let's keep it short and sweet
Keeping my brights on
We got miles to go1Embed
