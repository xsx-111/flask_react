Blue Rose LyricsI got money 'cause I work all day
Don't get down, I’m a mile away
When evening comes, I go call up the band
We play religious music, don't think you'd understand man
Well, hear me Paul, I will stick around
I'm the baddest, stoniest thing in town
Give me eighteen, man, but they speak another tongue
They left me there, but the dead men have no fun
Truth it’s not my fault, yeah love came over me
Dear, dear, if you love war, then you got war with me
They looked him straight and told him I'm in town
Now, now, feeling good, somehow
Eight days down, we stick around
Philip, what’s up, I need you bad now
Think “my God, I can hardly dream”
If you don't like that, well you told me not to brag, but I said
Yeah hear me Paul, and I’ll fight aboveground
They left me there, fill me up when I’m down
Dear, kill off my father, yeah love came over me
Dear, dear, if you want war, then you got war with me
Well, way I was brought up, we were told things never to tell
Bitter, beaten down, stop, they don't know, kick em down
Fame
For a while I had no way out, yeah man
Not now, not now, catch it now
They said that I should move on from here
Combed out my hair, started out, and my dreams took half a drag
Can't tell my poor mind to leave me, yeah I can't catch a break
You weren't much a man to me, but you're the only one I've ever hadEmbed
