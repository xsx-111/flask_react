Yeah, freedom
Freedom
You'll know the way
You’ve fading from me
And I will hold you
Elation
Wasted, ancient, patient, hesitation
Na na na

Yeah, freedom
Freedom
It’s cold here, but you came in
He can close his eyes but you know he can’t fake it
And I will hold him until he’s done
So be it, avian, patient, hesitation
Lover come in,  lover come in
Lover come in,  lover come in
You’ve got a beautiful guitar
And there's an ocean where you are
Wherever you run, there you are
Lover come here,  lover come here
Na na na
Na na na
