Time LyricsShame, wish that I could stay
I could hold your head one last time
Same, summer sun
Suffering suffering, still the same
Time, so much time
Some other time, so much pain
Spain, in Southern light
Close to crying, solo grey
Man, oh man, when Jesus died
No one cried, all the same
Lay awake in summer light
No one served, serves to say
Turn away, do not lie
Open doors, to burn my light
You’ll do something good
Southern Spain, give it that southern pain, southern pain
Yeah that Southern pain, hold my soul, so early
Lovely lady dresses in grey
So much pain, induction pain, yeah
So much pain, so much pain, yeah
Roman silver sky
Takes their time, to push it away
I’ll ride the river hoping to tell you
Some day, so they say
So loud, say it I'm proud
Say it loud, say it out loud, pain
Say it out loud, say it I’m proud
Say it out loud, pain
It’s over, German foot soldier
Torch the night, with soldier's pain
Something, something in my heart
Took its hold, throughout my life
Something in me
Silver cloud
So empty now
Sitting on a cloud
PainEmbed
