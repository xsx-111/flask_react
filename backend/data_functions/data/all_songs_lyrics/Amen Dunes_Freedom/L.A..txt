L.A. LyricsThrow the saint in the fire, baby, long day
Power is something you believe in, something you gain
At 19, I was king, so supreme, down to Judea
Memory don't mean much to me, but still don't go away
High up in the Hollywood Hills, I'm barely awake
Got my arms around some clown, who's barely awake
Doesn't we look stupid now, tears trickle down our face
At 10 I light my first cigarette, and drive down to L.A
At 10 I light my first cigarette, and drive down to L.A
Some say fake it, I don't know man
Stomp it, take it, cool it down baby
I've been trying to make it, for years and years and years
Watch them years go by on fire
(This is your time
Their time is done, it's over
I'm sick and tired)
Poor girl
(Screw ups, this is your time)
Yeah baby, I'd remember saying
(Now go out there and take it)
All this time, you barely I'm alive
Yeah that's all, it's all or nothing at all
Ah my baby been a year since I've been through
Got the fever so bad, I know you do too
Nobody needs to know, if you show up and I'm in town
Come around early, put your feet up, we'll joke around
She looked so pretty, cigarette in her mouth
She'd grown mature, man she filled out
Come on baby, you know I'm trying to cut it out
But you're so bad, I'll never put you down
About five hours out of my mind I wake up
About a mile of fire to stop, I beg her
Fa la la la la, God fades them out
Blue eye, you lied, I miss you, that's all
Stop Joanne, stop Joanne
Stop Joanne, stop Joanne
Stop Joanne, stop Joanne
Quick talk is like no talk, he can just space off, look in his eyes
Crocodile, detour, new tears they start in my eyes
Six star-loaded rose-froze Black Star, you got off fine
It's ten o'clock you ought to stop the detour, you know baby it's time
Big talking, spaced off, you got your big man, he's fine
Because she told me, cross on back, the river's fine
Drop five dollar, you get the skinny girl, I get the real fire
That's all
Not meEmbed
