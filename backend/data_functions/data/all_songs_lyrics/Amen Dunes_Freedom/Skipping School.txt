Skipping School LyricsWoke up Sunday feeling good
Though I'd try maybe stay high forever, yeah
Drift along the Mekong, if I could
Daddy was the coolest kid in school
He was always in the alley sniffing glue, yeah
Did it till his little lips turned blue
See you in the park at dark
Talking bad about the dad that you never knew, yeah
Talking about the things you said you'd do
Yes I'm sorry
There's no use in being closed-hearted, yeah
Guess you did the best that you could
Got held up on my way to North Pigalle
Must have got off in the wrong arrondissement
He said, one more stop and you would have found God
Out here on the road somewhere tonight, I don't know
But I'm doing fine, and the weather is good
Go back and show you if I could
I really got to go, yeah man
I already know
See them go, aw man
They already know
I don't think of it at all
'Cause dear, they are gone
It's come head on before
They already know
Yeah, I've been good, yeah
Aw, see them go
Get out and go
Fire off another round
Still I been gone
But I'm already gone
Did you go into the door, way out purple kind of person with Perfect eyes
I said, well the way I'm going I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-
I-I-I-I been good man
Say I don't really know
Do they always fight until the love turns out to pick em up and
Burn them through before they go
Now the sky's all red, elevated
And that's enough, to know it's time
Way I been going
I'm already goneEmbed
