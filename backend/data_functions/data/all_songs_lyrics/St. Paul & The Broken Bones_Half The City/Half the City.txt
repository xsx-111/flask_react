Half the City LyricsOh, this poor and lonely heart
It is made of pure steel
And you can't let it cry
Like the poor end of a stream
I populated half the city, child
But I still can't find no love
Somebody has to heal me
From up above
Ain't no way that I could stay
Every day, oh every day
There it goes, her arms that hold me closely
So closely
Though I can't let it die
This hope I feel
Oh the cities make me cry
But I still can't leave her
The streets are paved with pain
Of further past the law
Just got to get through, darling
But I've had enough
There ain't no way that I could stay here
I'm breathing, oh I'm breathing
There she goes, her arms that hold me closely, so closely
I know that it's time
For this city of mine
To just crumble down
Let me hold her
Let me hold her
Got to feel her deep down
Got to feel it deep down baby1Embed
