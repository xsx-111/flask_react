Call Me LyricsThis ain’t the heartache that I thought I knew
This ain’t the party that I thought we’d do
You got your limit, baby I got mine
611-3369 You got to call me, baby
We ain’t the lovers that’ll tear it down
We ain’t the fortune all over town
You got your limit, baby I have mine
611-3369 You got to call me baby
I need you to pick up that telephone
And dial this lover’s heartache
I need you to call me
I need to hear your sweet voice
Let me let me let me let me hear you again
I need you I need you
I need I need you baby
I need I need I need I need I need I need you baby
I need I need I need I need I need I need you baby
I got to get you pick it up that telephone
Please please oh baby
You got your limit, baby I got mine
611-3369 please oh please baby
Pick up that phone
I need you to pick it up baby
I need you to pick it up now baby10Embed
