Broken Bones and Pocket Change Lyrics
Young Love has made me old
Tired restless and blue
When it comes and she goes
Says goodbye to my poor soul
Broken bones and pocket change
This heart is all she left me with

Reckless love has made me cold
Worn down just like shoes
Ain't nobody, Ain't nobody gonna love me
I'll just stand here, all alone

Broken bones and pocket change
This heart is all she left me with

I got it bad baby
I got it so bad
And I'm down
Oh I'm down on my knees

Music died and it let me go
Said goodbye to my poor soul
The melody, why have you forsaken me
Broken bones and pocket change
This heart is all she left me with
Broken bones and pocket change
This heart is all she left me with
This heart is all she left me with
This heart is all she left me with

Oh but I, Oh but I, Oh but Ive been broken
Can't take, Can't take it down
Im going down, I'm going down todayEmbed
