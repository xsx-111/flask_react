Dixie Rothko LyricsI told her
No no no, you are too young
Her heart said yeah yeah yeah
Baby, I'm so strong
Sometimes l feel that the love you got
I know it ain't right
His heart went yeah
I don't have it wrong
His mind went ooooh
I like it, baby, just like that
Sometimes I feel that, that love you got
We know it ain't right
But when you love each other the way we do
We'll get passed all of it, get passed all of it baby (??)
Their hearts said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We got it oh so bad
Their minds went oooh ooooh oooh
Baby, we got a sweet sweet plan
I know we gonna make it, child
I know we gonna make it, baby
I know
I said I know we gonna make it, baby
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know we gonna make it, baby
I know, oh oh I know, I know, I knowEmbed
