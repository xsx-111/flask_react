That Glow LyricsI've lost my senses for that child that went away
I've carried all my sorrow
To my resting place
Oh how that glow in her eyes
It lights up
When she's gone to someone else's arms
How I wish it was me
I'm lost in oh this heartbreak
Lord, set me free
There ain't no man, there ain't no man
That should carry this burden inside of me
Oh how that glow in her eye
It lights up
When she's gone in someone else's arms
How I wish it was me
When she's lost I can bare it no more
Oh, how I wish oh how it wish it was me
How I wish oh, it was meEmbed
