Let It Be So Lyrics*Based on the album version. Live versions have a change in lyrics
I will love you to the end of time
But our love ain't right
Please old lady, let me lay with you
I know he ain't here tonight
What we built, ain't for this world
We'll keep going til it dies
Let us live inside this so, sweet mystery
Let it be so
We can't stop what the lord has made
Though the devil may try
I ain't holy, but I'm whole with you
Let's just dirty up the time (??)
What we built, ain't for this world
We'll keep going til it dies
Let us live inside this so sweet mystery
Let it be so
What we built, ain't for this world, oh no
We'll keep going til it dies
Let us live inside this so sweet mystery
Oooooo oooooo yea yea yeaEmbed
