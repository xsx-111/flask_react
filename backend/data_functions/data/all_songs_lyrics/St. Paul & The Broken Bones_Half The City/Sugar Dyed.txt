Sugar Dyed LyricsAin’t nobody, ain’t nobody gonna steal my brand new groove
Oh there look at her body I’m about to lose my cool
I would not have let you go
Everybody told you so
You can’t, you can’t, you can’t let me go
In your crazy heart
Damn girl you got me tired
I got to lose my sleep
Love me, love me, love me
Love me ”till the lights come on
I would not have let you go
Everybody told me so
You can’t, you can’t, you can’t let me go
In your crazy heart
Ain't no need for conversation
Cause love is what we do

Cause they can’t stop what we got
I know that you love the lord but he ain't here right now
I Need you baby, oh I need you
You’re crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, heart
You’re crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, heart
Got to love, got to love, got to love, got to love me
Got to love, got to love, got to love, got to love meEmbed
