Grass is Greener LyricsHow do we always do this
Turn ourselves around?
Remember when those sweet memories
Used to soothe us, used to make us smile
We put on our Sunday best
We live our quiet mess
But we'll never be married
I know that I've been cold
Baby, I, I ain't got no soul
I have had those sweet sugar thoughts
They're taken away from me
They can't nab no more
I just have to be so unhappy
We put on our Sunday best
We live our quiet mess
But we'll never be married
Give me time
Give me time, Give me time

You've got to give me time
Please don't leave me baby
I can't have you leaving me
I know where it is you've gone
That old grass ain't greener
That old grass ain't greener
I know baby, because I've been there
I know it ain't, I know it ain't
It ain't greener
I know it ain't, I know, I know, I know
Time, time, time
Oh, sweet time
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me
Time, time, time
Oh, sweet time
Please don't leave me, Please don't leave me
I can't have you leaving me
Please don't leave me
Please don't leave meEmbed
