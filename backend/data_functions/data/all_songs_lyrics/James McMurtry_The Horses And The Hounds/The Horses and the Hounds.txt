The Horses and the Hounds Lyrics
When the white oak leaves are rustling 'round the courtyard
Tell the cook to leave the kitchen window down
Just don't lock it from inside, I might still need a place to hide
When I turn to face the horses and the hounds

Sister says to come on back for Christmas
Mama's wondering why I never come around
Lord I've been running for so long, I just can't find a way back home
So I'll turn to face the horses and the hounds

You might hear some gears a'grinding (Gears a'grinding)
'Fore I can get this rig turned back around (Turned around)
And head back down the highway winding
Back towards the horses and the hounds

I thought I'd found a love to last me
'Til she opted for that candy coated clown
I didn't even make a show, I just walked on and let 'em go
Still I'm running from the horses and the hounds

You might hear some gears a'grinding (Gears a'grinding)
'Fore I can get this rig turned back around (Turned around)
And head back down the highway winding (Highway winding)
Back towards the horses and the hounds
Straight towards the horses and the hounds

On the Trail's Inn Motel sign rides a warrior
With his horse run out and his lance a'pointed down
That's as far as he's gonna get, he surely knows what's coming next
He's just waiting on the horses, the horses and the hounds

You might hear some gears a'grinding (Gears a'grinding)
'Fore I can get this rig turned back around
And head back down the highway winding (Highway winding)
Back towards the horses and the hounds
You might hear some gears a'grinding (Gears a'grinding)
'Fore I can get this rig turned back around (Turned around)
And head back down the highway winding (Highway winding)
Back towards the horses and the hounds

Straight towards the horses and the hounds
And I'll bet they hear it halfway back to town
When I turn to face the horses
The horses and the houndsEmbed
