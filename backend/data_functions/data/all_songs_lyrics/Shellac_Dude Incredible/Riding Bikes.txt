Riding Bikes LyricsMe and Ted were small and riding bikes along the wall
Stealing things and breaking things
I have my back, he had his, each one had the others'
Doing things that made us whole and something close to brothers
Time has changed, the strangest things come matters of contention
Some of the things we've had to do I'm not about to mention
I won't second-guess something, done the panic of the moment
I'll admit the scale requires something like atonement
And then I answer to require answers of this town
Put your folks together, Ted, shit is coming down when I'm riding bikes!
I'm riding bikes!
I'm riding bikes!
Riding bikes!
Riding bikes!
I'm riding bikes!Embed
