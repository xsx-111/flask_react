Dude Incredible LyricsOh, my brothers and oh, my other comrades
Let's leave this place directly
And go where the females congregate
Perhaps they'll let us fuck them
And on the way, we'll have adventure
Some of us are tired
Where we are is copasetic
Fuck that, let's go
We can always eat along the way
Suddenly, we find ourselves surrounded by a group of strangers
And we resolve to fight them although we are outnumbered
Oh, my brothers
Oh, my other comrades
Terrific how we fight them
Terrific how we fight them
Hand over hand over hand over hand over
Swing, that's how we travel
The higher we go, the higher we go
Hand over hand over hand over hand over
Hand over hand over hand over hand over hand
Some of them survive and some of them have fallen
Their carcasses will be devoured by animals and insects
But quickly, we are upon them sunning themselves on the beach
Some of them are not too fit but some of them, spectacular
Oh, my brothers
Oh, my other comrades
I find myself in competition
I will fight you ruthlessly, OK!
Hand over hand over hand over hand over
Hand over hand over hand over hand overEmbed
