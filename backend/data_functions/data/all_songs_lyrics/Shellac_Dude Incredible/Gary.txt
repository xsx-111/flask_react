Gary Lyrics
Kaiser of steel
Steam ship and wheel
Master of land and ocean
Owner of souls
Railroad and coals
Let us address your devotion

Harken, oh king
Listen, old thing
Softly we singing low

Oh, what a pal was Gary
Oh, what a pal was he
Time rambles on
Hush, we are gone
Gary almighty dream

Driven of steel
Glowing red unreal
Down the cold river furnace
Sheering the broom
Uncaring of doom
You'll trial and skirmish
12 hours a day
For what foul play?
That's why we sing in low

Oh, what a pal was Gary
Oh, what a pal was he
Time rambles on
Pray soon we're all gone
Gary almighty dream

Like a tended cigar
Smokestacks and bars
Those workers and 
Sparks, slag and ten
And our smoke battered friends
Home of the Jackson five

Gary, I hope that you're proud
Of the smoke the stink and the cloud

Oh, what a pal was Gary
Oh, what a pal was he
Time rambles on
Pray soon we're all gone
Gary almighty dreamEmbed
