Porrohman LyricsNight hangs on the city
Like a blanket on a cage
A sacrifice prepared
Laughter lies on faces
Where the sun has never shone
The fear of life is strong
We are waiting in the forest
Deep and dark behind the wall
What is hidden in our hearts
Absolves us of all worry
When our fate is in the hands
Of a demon or a god
Porroh Man come from the inside of time
Takes his dust from a moving line
On our knees with our eyes on the ground
Those once lost have now been found
Give us iron! Give us rope!
Give us iron! Give us rope!
Save us from all worldly pain
Save us from the glowing rain
Save us all from love and hope
Give us iron, give us rope
Give us iron! Give us rope!
Give us iron! Give us rope!Embed
