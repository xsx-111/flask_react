Harvest Home LyricsWho saw the fences falling
Who broke the ploughman's bread
Who heard the winter calling
Who wore the tailor's thread
How many sheaves were counted
How did the carriage shine
How many thoughts were doubted
How did the landlord dine
Just as you sow you shall reap
Just as you sow you shall reap
Who led the mayday feasting
Who saw the harvest home
Who left the future wasting
Who watched the families go
See where the bowls are empty
See where the arms reach
See where the butter melted
See where the altars creak
Just as you sow you shall reap
Just as you sow you shall reap
In a harvest home
Where were the days of promise
Where were the gifts divine
Where were the heroes honest
Where was the summer wine
Watch how the waves must shatter
Watch how the shore divides
Watch how the nets will tatter
Watch Canute and his bride
Just as you sow you shall reap
Just as you sow you shall reap
In a harvest home
In a harvest homeEmbed
