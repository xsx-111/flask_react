1000 Stars LyricsNow we play our final hand
Move in closer, understand
This time like never before only the black queen scores
A card so high and so wild we should burn it
The luck of a thousand stars can't get me out of this
The luck of a thousand stars; losing it's charm
There are people I have loved
Hypnotized by lies in defensive disguise
Some say protect and survive; I say it's over
The luck of a thousand stars  can't get me out of this
The luck of a thousand stars; losing it's charm
Hold me through the darkest night
I feel secure in your arms while all the city's on fire
It's not between you and me but we are losing
The luck of a thousand stars can't get me out of this
The luck of a thousand stars can't get me out of this
The luck of a thousand stars; losing it's charmEmbed
