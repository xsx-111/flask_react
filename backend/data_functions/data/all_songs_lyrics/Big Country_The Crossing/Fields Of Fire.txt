Fields Of Fire LyricsBetween a father and a son
Between the city and the one
Before the teacher and the test
Before the journey and the rest
The shining eye will never cry
The beating heart will never die
The house on fire holds no shame
I will be coming home again
Four hundred miles
Without a word until you smile
Four hundred miles
On fields of fire
Between the woman and the boy
Between a child and his toy
Between a woman and a boy
Between a child and a toy
Before the following of the west
Before the journey and the rest
Four hundred miles
Without a word until you smile
Four hundred miles
Without a word until you smile
Four hundred miles
On fields of fireEmbed
