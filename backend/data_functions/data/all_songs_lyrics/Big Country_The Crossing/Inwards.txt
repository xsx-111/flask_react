Inwards LyricsI wouldn't want to go home on a night like this
When I find out that some of the past has been missed
And the light in the window has burned it's fuse
I pull everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's loose
I wouldn't want to stay out with news like this
All the engines too loud, all the pavements hiss
How the scouts in the stairwell will meet again
I pull everything inwards but everything's changed
Everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's loose
I wouldn't want to stay out with news like this
All the engines too loud, all the pavements hiss
How the scouts in the stairwell will meet again
I pull everything inwards but everything's changed
I wouldn't want to go home on a night like this
When I find out that some of the past has been missed
And the light in the window has burned it's fuse
I pull everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's loose
Everything inwards but everything's looseEmbed
