All Fall Together LyricsI forget how it started
But everyone knew of the cause
Hard out of the sun with a vengeance
And all was then lost
They crawled into homes
And yet all of the old ways were gone
It left nothing to run to
But no one can help how they're drawn
Chorus
We will all fall together
A black sky in the rain
And you can laugh and I will sing
We've changed forever
Survivors set out on a trail
In the search for salvation
Looking for remnants of sense
In the end of a nation
Chorus
All fall together
A black sky in the rain
And you can laugh and I will sing
We've changed forever
All came together
And steadied themselves on the shore
Knowing the terror
Would find them much worse than before
Chorus
Nothing to live for
And nothing more left of your pride
Can you face all the black
In your heart that will not be denied?
Chorus (three times)Embed
