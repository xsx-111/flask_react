The Storm Lyrics
I came from the hills with a tear in my eye
The winter closed in and the crows filled the sky
The houses were burning in flames gold and red
The people were running with eyes full of dread

Ah, my James
They didn't have to do this

We chased them for miles, I had tears in my eyes
Through forest and moor, as the clouds filled the sky
The storm broke upon us with fury and flame
Both hunters and hunted washed down in the rain

Ah, my James
They didn't have to do this

I know I can never return
To the time of hope when I was born
Let the strength of peace run through my hand
When we walk away from the storm's roar
Then I will be afraid no more
And now I'm sure of where I stand
Let the strength of peace run through this land
And nobody smiled as we took back our own
While rain beat upon us, the thunder would moan
And nobody smiled when we knew what was lost
We knew well enough only time proves the cost

Ah, my James
They didn't have to do this
Ah, my James
They didn't have to do this
I know I can never return
To the time of hope when I was born
Let the strength of peace run through my hand
When we walk away from the storm's roar
Then I will be afraid no more
And now I'm sure of where I stand
Let the strength of peace run through this landEmbed
