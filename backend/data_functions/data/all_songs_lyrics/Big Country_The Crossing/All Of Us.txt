All Of Us LyricsBad weather gathers all along the coast
When the stormclouds gather and my blood runs cold
If we can't go further When we get to the shore
Then we have to turn around and fight some more
We'll go together; I have room in my soul
That's enough of watching people trading hearts for gold
I can see you on the beach on your knees
Spilling more salt in an already dead sea
We'll feel the wind and the rain on our face
You can do it yourself, but I heard of a place
It's got to be now and it better be together
When spirits make a meeting, you can feel it forever
Bad weather gathers all along the coast
When the stormclouds gather and my blood runs cold
I can see you on the beach on your knees
Spilling more salt in an already dead sea
Run away with me again
Time for us to grow
Run away with me again
All of us aloneEmbed
