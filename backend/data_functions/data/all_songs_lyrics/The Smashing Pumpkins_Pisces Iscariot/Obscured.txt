Obscured Lyrics
Lost your head, now you sleep on the floor
What you said, I don't want anymore
Through the haze, make your eyes up to ache
Out in space, days away

Through these eyes
I rely on all I've seen
Obscured
Through these eyes
It looks like I'm home tonight

Left for dead as you sweep out the cold
Things we said we don't need anymore
Tale inside her like a fallen kite
Hey, hey, yeah

Through these eyes
I deny on all I see
Obscured
Through these eyes
It looks like I'm home tonight
What you said made a mess of me
What you said, I don't want
