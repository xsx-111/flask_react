Whir Lyrics
I've wasted all my years
Been chasin' all my fears
For another brighter than you
I gave in long ago to make it to the show
But it's not easy when you're alone

All your prayers
In my ears
Don't you care?

Whir yourself around
Just to fall back down
Whir yourself around

My honey, little girl
Come on, lets go for a whirl
It's still early, the sun is sleeping

She says she wants to marry me
She says she wants a baby
It's not easy when you're scared
Whir yourself around
Just to fall back down
Whir yourself around

All your prayers
In my ears
Don't you care?
