La Dolly Vita Lyrics
I lay my head on her bosom
To cry myself to sleep
I see no greater wisdom
Than she has given me

La dolly vita
Sweet as true love
La dolly vita
Cool as ice cream
Cool as ice cream

You hear a lot of visions
You can't even stop
Can't see what you're missing
Spinning like a top

Fade away, I want to see her
Fade away, I want to see her
I only want to meet her

La dolly vita
True as blue sky
La dolly vita
Cool as ice cream
Cool as ice cream
Take it all the way down
Forsake what you have now
Take it all the way downEmbed
