Blew Away Lyrics
Blew, blew, blew away
But I don't wanna fade
Blew, blew, blew

And if you love her
You know it will come true
And if you need her
You know that she'll be there
Stay awake, I lie here
With her and I fall
When I wake inside you
I know you know I'm yours

Blew, blew, blew away
But i don't wanna fade
Blew, blew, blew

And if you're sad, too
Until the angel sings and touches you
Don't confuse my only life
I said blew, and please don't ever leave
I will grieve, and 'member thee
Hope to meet you there


And I wanna let her know
That I won't let her go
I wanna let her know
That I love her so

I'm blew, blew, blew, blew away
But I don't wanna--
Blew, I love you
Blew, blewEmbed
