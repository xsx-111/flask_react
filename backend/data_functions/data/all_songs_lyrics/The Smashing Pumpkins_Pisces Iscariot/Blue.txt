Blue LyricsHey blue, all your love is strange
Come out with all those crazy names
So true when you lie
For you, blue
Right or wrong
I belong
Right or wrong
Hey blue, where'd you run to now?
Miss you since they found you out
I've been waiting such a long time
For your smile, for you
I lay with you this velvet morning
Stay with me for a while
Where we run to is up to you
Just stay with me for a while2Embed
