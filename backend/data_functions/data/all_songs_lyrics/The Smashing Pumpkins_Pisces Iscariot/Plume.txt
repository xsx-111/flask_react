Plume Lyrics
Oh yeah, another day
Oh yeah, gotta play
What it is, it never was
I don't care to give enough

My boredom has outshined the sun
It's so down low
I just want to have some
Little fun


Oh yeah, another day
Oh yeah, what a waste
What it is, it never was
I don't care or give a fuck

My boredom has outshined the sun
It's so down low
I just want to have some
Little fun
Bring me down
Bring me down1Embed
