Landslide Lyrics
I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, i turned around
And I saw my reflection in a snow covered hill
'til the landslide brought it down

Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?

Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I've
Built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too


Well, I've been afraid of changing cause I've
Built my life around you
Time makes you bolder
Even children get older
And I'm getting older, too
I'm getting older, too
I took my love and took it down
I climbed a mountain, i turned around
And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hill
The landslide brought it down
The landslide brought it down3Embed
