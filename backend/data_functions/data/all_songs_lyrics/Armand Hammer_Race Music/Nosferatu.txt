Nosferatu Lyrics(Woods)
Drink first, drink deeply
From sleeping to writhing beneath me
Weakening/it ain't easy
While she gone barely breathing
The money comes back greasy
Good pussy don’t come cheaply
Open her veins drink again
Bottomless
The dick is drained the bitch is trained
I get hunger pains riding around looking at things
Sliding in shadows
Put the glass slipper on a young ho/moon eyes
Sucked the pussy dry left her more dead than alive
Don’t act surprised/nothing lasts forever
From turned out on the dick to name on the whip to
Burned out on the strip/we’ll be in it together
Bloodied her lip buried the treasure
Triple x marks the spot
Forget-me-not’s and black roses
Palefaced/handon her throat/stolen moments/
Choking/out of pocket get broken/black moon/
I gotchu opin
Riding and smoking spit game wide as the ocean
Hypnotize minds mindless devotion
Watch you put on lotion while I light the drugs
Flesh by the pound but not a single drop of blood
Chorus:
Slept all day heavy curtains drawn
Her head on my chest heart in the palm
I could make a fist but the night is long

(Elucid)
The dick dont come cheap
Your soul to keep, touch, tease
Crown of her head
Sole of her feet
No other but me
Feed it deep
Pussy seize throb and cream
Invest in my dream
Hallucination machine
Pyramid schemes
For whosoever believe
Ask and ye shall receive
Slip on outta them jeans
Ass gleaming
Lebanese cedar sheen
Shes a keeper, portishead out the speaker
Earthly pleasure strung out begging for extra
Free to drain
Ain't nothing here in my name
Start to pester?
Second thoughts
On to the next one
She bluffing dropping bread crumbs back to the rest, son
Lost one
Forked tongue in both holes
Heart froze
Toxic lows
Somehow keep coming back for more, sadistic
Casualties and statistic
Eating cold eels thinking distant thoughts
Absurd
Jack johnson minus purse and furs
She’s hooked
He’s got much nerve
Hardly invested standing on the verge of leech and lover
Stubborn
Keep her white knuckled in our throes of pleasure
Whatever
Can't purge the kid
Your curse is hisEmbed
