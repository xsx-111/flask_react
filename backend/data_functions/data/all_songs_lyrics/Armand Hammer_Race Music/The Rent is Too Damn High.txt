The Rent is Too Damn High Lyrics(Woods)
Section 8
But hall plush with piff and sour grape
Wet cough through thin wall
Keep me up late
The man in 3C is dying of cancer
Told me straight-up
I admire his candor
Sent him to his fate like Taliban commander
They sell death off my steps
Necromancers
Woodwinds play for the local Jo Jo Dancer’s
Woods in the wind
Plastic cups Seagrams & Fanta
Till police shut down the Party
Black Panthers
Retreat into the jungle
I watch through peepholes on the humble
Like I got points on the bundle
True self secret like Rumple/stiltskin keep it
Every man for himself when the long arm reaches
Cassette tape Nkrumah speeches
Face-creased
Streetcorner preacher screeches into loudspeaker
Chorus:
I can hear my neighbors fucking
Calling on jesus/Christ
Radiator cold as ice but outside
The heat stay on like pilot light
They grew strong outta spite
(Elucid)
Modest brownstone sad ghost in the hallway
I’m doing the right thing all the wrong ways
More haze crushed as the song fade
Breaking dawn
Im plotting on long range
Change came
Broke niggas
Affording pain
Lean protein stashed in parka pocket
Fishers market
Down a couple on the humble kept his boots polished
Full time college
Loan mileage
Still vibrant
5 bill black barrel jerk chicken down on prospect
Hogs breath
Red and blue
6 pointed stars and suwoos
Crude jewels
Can’t tell who’s who
Platoon move
I’m thru and thru
Acrid fumes
Blunts pipes and burnt spoons
Aunties uncles cousins thrice removed
For whom the bell dings
12 string guitar gently weeps
Supreme kings
Wayward out outta reach
Jesus on the main line
Call him up and tell him what you need
Seed crackle brown tree steams
Fiends vanish scene when that caprice sweep
Indeed indeed
Chorus:
I can hear my neighbors fucking
Calling on jesus christ
Radiator cold as ice but outside
The heat stay on like pilot light
They grew strong outta spite
Shunned the beast and kept the old ways like Mennonites2Embed
