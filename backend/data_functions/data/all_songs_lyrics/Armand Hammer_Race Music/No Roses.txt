No Roses Lyrics(Elucid)
Shouting from beneath the surface
I stated committed but i wasn't perfect
Was it worth it?
Mostly indifferent but served her purpose
No roses
Hairpin curves the roads frozen
Oh dip
Watch him disappear
Beneath her nose
Unload then roaming Castle Hill at 4 am
Spent and Foggy threw up in ur lobby like i won't be back again
Cleaning up my act hat left by the mantle
Next to 90s r&b cds and Tea candles
Fuck it
Keeping Lies Straight no yaki
Wonder if she really put it past me
Heart committed wasn't hardly perfect
Second guessing this ain't really working
Moments played out
Sudden urges
Weak
Speak of the devil
Wetter than last remembered
Repeat offender
Whats it take to make me reconsider
Swear she ain't Playing second fiddle for another winter
Her baby boy getting big
First met him in his mothers womb
That ain't mine
She let me splash Inside
First time raw
No balloon
I come thru tell her no perfume
Consuming my bassoon
Blue cheese moon
Blowing sour boom
We got history  just a chemistry thang
Peeled outta Memory lane
Man i know i Been changed
(Woods)
Like it was yesterday, sitting in the waiting room finally out of things to say
No fear in your face replaced by something I couldn’t place then
Nor articulate roday
Scales weighed gave way to beds made, closed eyes
Holding your hand felt like a lie
Clenched till you ground bone & knuckle
Came home bombed, tried to live in the rubble
Though it would be enough that I loved you
Maybe I didn’t love you enough
While you slept reached for the crutch
No woods in your hood made do with a vanilla dutch
Stalked through Hell’s Kitchen, torch cuffed, eyes peeled but
Strangely, didn’t give a fuck
42nd, swept in the crush, human tides under blinking lights
Thinking about the device, the life unchosen
The unknown price paid in that moment
Empty words, earnestly spoken, copper tokens on debts imposing
Cops hopped out the unmarked whipe, said they seen me smoking
Aggressive patdown but the L is down a strom drain floating
Radio’s crackling, fresh action
One clapped me on the back “don’t be out here when we circle”
The blood was black-purple
Tiptoed inside, cupped your stomach from behind
Were you really asleep or was I just that blind?Embed
