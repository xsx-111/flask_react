Frog and Toad are Friends Lyrics(Woods)
Unpublished but ghostin’ for Fredrick Douglass
Trust, I could write your whole album
Eazy-Duz-It
Raiders snapback with the Jheri Curl
Gats inlaid with Mother-of-Pearl
They pulled me into this world
Into the light C-section Poltergeist
Hold Northern Lights like polar nights
Respect the classics
Dutches mastered
Your titles got an asterisk
Stats is juiced/push into hotel rooms
Orenthal James
If the boys come, steadily maintain I was framed
Chapter and Verse, heal the sick and the lame
Dawn to Dusk, man have fe cut cane
Leg chained
Babylon a use dem brain
Suggest you do the same
Left on that note
English Channel backstroke
The whole family had high hopes
I was hoping to get high/the kick was wide
So begins the time of sorrows
Night of the Long Knives/we gon ride through your sleepy hollow
The lynch mob gathers; fire in the eyes, courage borrowed
(Elucid)
Woolrich vintage
No socks in his oxfords
Gold bond copper
Tryna hold the funk hostage
Blotter acid in his headband
Wavy New York City wetlands
Mindful where u step
No respect
Come correct fam
A hexed land held in blessed hands
Hell inna handbasket
Im packed
Good bread meat cheese
Old grapes and cloth napkins
Nothing lavish
Rocking duck cloth trousers trimmed with flecktarn camo
Check me out yall
Downtown southpaw swinger
Plugged her 5 fingers
Sweet nothings whispers on me member
Return to sender
Free and independent baby
I won't hinder
Only jewels i lent her
Are u stupid
Or just Assume the symptoms?
Bitches brew u let em stew With vengeance
Play the fool
4th and inches
Smashmouth
Cliqout and Hash clouds
You already know
How this Hardware got passed down
Passed out
Woke to fresh juice eggs and hash browns
Dont ask clown
I Laugh now might not get another
Turn my baby to a single mother
(Woods)
I dont mess with Swishers
My pops was the type to be like
“One of these days, right in the kisser”
Never quite got my father figured
Not sure it’s worth the hassle
Like getting high at my mom’s house, but i’ll do it if I have to
Either we running by commitee or you absorbing these tackles
Nice with rooks and knights/too lazy to castle
That’s how Troy got gaffled
Keys to the kingdom
Perpetrator play the victim
She stripped straight down to raw ambition
This year, it’s no honorable mentions
Unify the belts, end all dissension
108-mic Pulitzer prizefights left the crowd wincing
As is customary, he paved the fucking road with good intentions
(Elucid)
Goatmouth rappers pinching onion powder for you peasants
Cruel recession
Morsels rationed there’s barely seconds
Closed sessions they rant and rave without connections
Lost all the recipes, necessities quote code of veterans
Arresting
No concession
Even triple low remedials of all complexions
Fuck the dumb, need return on investments
Fresh chicken szechuan on corners of Cedar and Sedgewick
Every scroll penned like last will and testament
Rode hard on a horse named pestilence
In the business of soul collections
Stretched weighed measured
Tallest tales, unspoken legends
Shhhhh
Don’t get popped in ya lip
Breathe deeply ahki
Third down its probably a blitz
Bruce Smith round the end
Full frontal impact square in the numbers
Forced fumble picking turf from ya facemask
Looking dejected and pitifulEmbed
