Cloisters Lyrics
Tripping balls on the bank of the Hudson
Earth rumbling
Reevaluating my function
Tongue tungsten
Melting down they assumptions
I got a hunch
They acting out of need of some substance
After grilled pepper shrimp
I hiked my hand up her sundress
Vivid gradient sunsets
12 steps
Start at zero
Fear no
Sacrificial lamb in a gyro
Here go
Fresh out the roach coach
My beard long
Try not to impose on folk
And clones alike
Beholden hype
Imma show u right
Sound of mind
One way boarded flight
Twinkling lights
Over my city
Unlike any
Bust my hump for these nigga pennies
It been deep
Like sinkholes for repent freaks
Under mi sensi
Feeling extra sensory
Grip slippery
Citrus piffery
400 year old trees whisper how they sent for me
Kush school of mystery
If u cool ill waive the entry fee
Knowledge reigns supreme
Over nearly everyone
Peace scientist
Zions lion
I’m on 12fifth (125th)
(Woods)
Nonstop to DC free wifi
Far removed from the days of New Century
Chinatown Bus lines
Weight in the duffel weighing on my mind
Things change
Bag full of laundry now been a long time
Red Line train get off just rained
Smells like mulch and pine
Let myself in moms sleep
Cut the light pull the covers under her chin
Kiss her cheek
She still with the Camry 96 take it for a late night
Slide past spots where we used to get right
Spill cigar cuts in dark cuts tip 40s under porchlights
But it’s houses where those woods was
Strange faces
Kinda bugged my peoples gone out the hood
Up county in bracelets over drugs
Or got a job, a wife, up and moved cuz
Respect due
Certain point you gotta stop eating baby food
Night breeze the trees whisper truths I breath green
Knock the cherry off on my shoe
Parked at the park for old times sake sittin on the trunk
Wishing you was there to watch for JakeEmbed
