Renaissance Garments Lyrics(Elucid)
2 for $20 denims at the Busy Bee
Massapequa
This was 93
Ill take the mustard and the hunter green
Surplus fatigues and klan conehead hoodies little “C” patches on the chest and sleeve
Cleaned and pressed
Steamed starched with creases check
Never forever fresh
Fall and spring School shopping Money stretch
U dont work u dont eat
Kids Odd jobs raking leaves
Some friends would graduate to theft
Herringbone gold drape they neck
I would beg for J’s(jordans) and reebok pumps
Turn the page
Eastbay catalog
Highlight fly shit every month
Air mowab
Jansport backpack hella colorful tags
Most my gear second hand passed in pathmark shopping bags
Off brand
Tommy hilnigga
Guess crewnecks bondooloo leather logos
Long face rebeca lobo
Coulda had a polo shirt
Bo knows
Splashing cool water on borrowed claiborne
Oxblood chukka tryna be that fly mufucka
Chorus:
Ain't what u want baby
Its what u need baby
Ain't what you want baby
Its what you neeeeeed
Ain't what you want baby
Its what you need baby
Just come see me
Satisfaction guaranteed darling

(Woods)
Window shopping
Merry-Go-Round to Chess King
Knowing damn well you can’t buy a thing
A peasant wandering in the Valley of Kings
Thorough niggas fly through on Avirex wings
Post-up, pick and roll like basketball teams
Charlotte Hornets warmups
Carhart jeans/ Butterscotch Timbs
Admire the attire aspire with your friends
Wait for bus silent
Thinking how the fuck to get ends
Eddie Bauer Ralph Lauren
Dye packets on the Starter jackets
Hardaways and the black Shaq’s
Kid!
Imagining holding talisman shine halogen
Lime skin New Balance, the girls gather in
Gassed like paraffin
Caught the vapors in zig zag papers trying to be men
Dreading weekends in Marshall’s dressing room
Thin skinned in Russell Athletic
Acid washed Levis, Mom don't get it
And if you said it out loud, sound pretty patheticEmbed
