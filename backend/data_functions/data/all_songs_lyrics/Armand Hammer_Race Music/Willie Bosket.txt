Willie Bosket Lyrics
Sometime I feel like I'm somebody else
Emotion running having conversations with myself
They say he present but nobody home
Look at this lil' muthafucka acting like he grown
Shackled to a future via padded room
Me and my attitude
Me and my attitude

Underprivileged, overmedicated
Short attention court decisions left 'em vegetative
(Look how they do me, huh?) in case I might not make it
These feelings complicated, actions without explanation
Why they build me up to break me down (break me down)
Really I just wanna make my family proud
What I gotta do to make 'em understand
I need your prayers but maybe I should give this shrink a chance
Transferred outta school, new alternatives (don't be a pussy, nigga)
Teacher scared to death, nobody learning shit (you supposed to, nigga)
What security? Still sneaking blades and burners in
Disturbed, but we just need a proper turn to vent
What I do to deserve this type of hurt I'm in
Point the gun at myself, I bet they hear me then
No not again, promise me you'll make it right
Where I done been you check ya soul to Pay the price
Sometime I feel like I'm somebody else
Emotions running having conversations with myself
They say he present but nobody home
Look at this lil' muthafucka acting like he grown
Shackled to a future via padded room
Me and my attitude
Me and my attitude
Shackled to a future via padded room
Me and my attitude
Me and my attitude

Early, crack of dawn, seven-thirty
Dirty, crack stem palmed, herky-jerky
If it’s the bomb, feets is working
Jitterbug, Lindy Hop, the Roger Rabbit
Cut a rug, the room is padded
Mumble to hisself can't tell him nothing
And the shit he say? You hope he bluffing
Seen him round the way, niggas you never seen before (oh word?)
Seen him smoking, what it is you ain't sure (oh word?)
Ashamed to say it but every night you lock your door
(oh word?)
Witching hour, son appears just like a ghost
You call the cops, they come in pulling fucking toast
Take him to the hospital, docs just let him go
Going gone off that water, water, we call it boat
Still going strong off some wet he smoked a week ago
Every day is fourth-and-long, What a Niggy Know?
Every day is drama, Mr. Zone 6
Credit the embalmer, zone blitz
Got him zoned out on the couch, you’re living in a crypt
Sometime I feel like I'm somebody else
Emotions running having conversations with myself
They say he present but nobody home
Look at this lil' muthafucka acting like he grown
Shackled to a future via padded room
Me and my attitude
Me and my attitude
Shackled to a future via padded room
Me and my attitude
Me and my attitude1Embed
