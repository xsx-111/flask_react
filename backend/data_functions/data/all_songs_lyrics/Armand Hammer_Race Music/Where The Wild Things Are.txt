Where The Wild Things Are Lyrics
First fight came home with a bloody nose
Second fight same day pops like
Don't step back in this yard if you don't take control
Or deal with me you need make it  known
I ain't raise a punk you better hold your own
I walked back slow and snuffed Rahmel from behind
Closed my eyes still swinging hard fire welled up inside
Power bitter to the taste
Swollen my face felt fried
Winded tell me got this
Learned to walk with my pride
Must Earn your right to survive
Rite of passage
What was foreign grew familiar with time
Too young to process particulars
My views unrefined
Innocent mind
Before neighbors was truly ready to die
Dyno BMX spoke chrome cycle kept spinning
Acts of violence I'm a victim and a wide eyed witness
Block Yellow tape ballistics
South Jamaica 88 fever murder rate statistic
Growing Older higher stakes been normalized by repetition
Fall in line late for the wake
Henny pour it to me straight
Moms reminded me I'm different
From these Miseducated henchman
Murdering my brother not gangsta but mostly desperate acts of submission
Throw YOUR hands up in the air
Strays Whistled from a distance
Scratched serial standard issued
All night prayer, tears, pass moms a tissue
Dumb out, stupid nice
Waiting For Superman
Classroom full of Kryptonite
Juvenile Hell
The Trife Life
Ossie Davis been dead
Now they hand you gun and knife said
Do The Thing Right
Banana in the tailpipe
Eyes squeezed tight squeezing off
On a-alikes with the ArmaLite
Born yesterday but hey
They was up all night
Looking for niggas only found theyselves
Pulling on triggers
Spot Enemy outside his home
Let fly like Predator drone hell to pay
Like predatory loan
Rule Of the Bone did the Regents off the dome
Studied the streets
Prepaid the phone hand a lil’ nigga the heat
You don’t really want to know how it go
Like ground beef
A mother’s grief
Overdubbed on top some hot beats
Shots cheap/foot chase in Rock Creek
I’m wired
Can’t sleep behind a fade someone caught last week
King of the Wild Things
Made it home for supper
You should see the other kid
He’s a dead motherfucker
