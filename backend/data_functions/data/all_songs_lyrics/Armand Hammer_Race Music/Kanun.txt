Kanun Lyrics(Woods)
At the end of the day/only wanted what was mines
Now the whole town gots to pay/the piper’s pied
And nope/I dont have a fuck to give, sell or tithe
In over your head hoping he throws a line
But son just waved like roll damn tide
The Mind Plays Tricks
We’re Violent by Design
Base alchemy Metro-North turned nicks to dimes
Leapt from the balcony with John Booth lines
Serve mine cold
Alongside a bottle of fortified wine
Number One Chief Rocka so its no shocker
When you see him in San Sebastian with Serge Ibaka
Alive with Pleasure
Under pressure chopped and screwed
Weighed measured
As a child refused to mind my betters
But a belt at night will have you standing at breakfast
Bitterly thinking, when I get big we gon’ see who the toughest
William Woods to the white courtesy phone
White bleached bones on the throne
Crown on the dome/rakishly tilted right
You ain't about that life/presidency
Late nights drawing up lists of enemies
Double space typed death is the penalty
Human sacrifice/fled the scene Ted Kennedy
My kingdom for a horse
But your loss I savoured like warm Hennessy
(Chorus)
Follow me if I advance
Kill me if I retreat
Avenge me if I die, there won’t never be no peace

(Elucid)
I don’t have another cheek to turn
Raging boil over steady heat
Be the hand redeemed
Fool me twice shame on me
You’ll burn before you earn your keep
Mark your stripes
The kettle screams
Troubled waters belly deep
Up shits creek blown way way out of reach
Just when you thought its peace
Creeping while u sleeping
What they sow shall reap
Harvest season of the vic
Highest treason
Feeding lowly base desires
Dry bones, famished valleys
Wilderness leave no survivors
The devil is a liar
Trench clad sawed shotty Hired gun beside em
What jah provideth
No man to minus
Underline
End time skies of fire
Space rocks spit across horizon
Slang covenant backsliders
Tent revival
Pick the sty from my eye before i spoon out yours
Hysteric cries of a child scream from behind locked doors
Who’s checking score
Keeping short accounts
Transfer barrel in his mouth
Overdraw then bounce
Cashing out
Calvarys march
Thorned crowns
Mouth wide
Silence be the sweetest sound
Prayer cloth
Wipe my brows
Good and faithful servant
On testament New King James version
The bitch deserved it
Spare the rod
Getback was certain
Heretic verses with seven deflowered virgins
Lay down your burdens
This is righteous murder
A public service
May u burn eternal
My hell is hereEmbed
