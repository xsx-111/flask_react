Black Ark Lyrics(Elucid)
WHEN SPACING OUT DONT HIT ME WITH THAT BASIC MATH
CATCHING HIM BREAKING FAST WHERE THE ANGELS LAUGH
BOARDING ANCIENT CRAFTS
BURN YOUR GOLDEN CALVES
NOTHING SACRED
LAST CHANCE
ESCAPING NATURES WRATH
GRAVITYS GRASP
MEGABLAST
SPLASH
FOREVER CAST
CLASH
PAST PRESENT
MASS TRANCE
SUGGEST A METHOD
SLEIGHT OF HAND
MAGIC A TAD RECKLESS
LESSONS
MATHEMATICS
TRANSGRESSIONS
FLOOD THE PLANET
FEELING MANIC
PLAYED WAY OUTTA TUNE
MANY SUNS MANY MOONS
WHIRLWIND PYRAMIDS
SOULS SPARK FILAMENT
ONCE DARK SYMBOLS
BORE  FAMILIAR RESEMBLANCE
LIGHTBODY BRILLIANT
RHYTHM AND VIBE
STRETCHED WEIGHED MEASURED
DISCIPLINE TO ALIGN
LORD OF THE RHYME
STRANGE CHORDS FOREWARN MY ARRIVAL
ALL EYES ON CAIRO
KNOTTY HAIR GROWN IN BLACK SPIRALS
SMOKE BELLOWS FROM WIDE NOSTRILS
TURBULENCE
TRUE APOSTLES
SPACESHIP  EARTH
MOSTLY COLD AND HOSTILE
AWAKE THE IMPOSSIBLE
EXERT PRESSURE
LORDS NEVER WORRY
Chorus:
DESTINED
ALTERED MYTH
ALL  IM LEFT WITH
ECLECTIC
HEADTRIP IMPRINT
RELEASE THAT TENSION
I  SPEAK ON POTENTIAL
(Woods)
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred
Lunging/the cables jerk
Elevator plunging/black faces in black cages
Fire in the Earth
Four kilometers of cold dirt
Exodus/breathe dust/dance with death
Her cheeks blush
Finest gown at the ball/sirens call/legends of the fall/crushed
Velvet inside the coffin
Heavy metal particulate coughing blood often
Sent home to your orphans dead walking
TB/Houses In Virginia/scorching
Gulp air in shaft/the gas burns sky blue
Theirs not to reason why
Die whether you don’t or do
Cross-legged in catacombs/Jules Verne sent to break stone
Fumes diesel
The world turns, bones picked clean
Intelligent boll weevils
Smiegel yearns/by all neccessary means
Precious, older than evil
Earth quakes/Fire rages atop mercury lakes
Alone together in the darkest place
But Lord’s never worryEmbed
