Hand Over Fist Lyrics(Elucid)
MOP THE DECK
RING AROUND THE COLLAR
A PROPER SWEAT
ILL FITTING
POLYESTER POLOS
FADED SAVE FROM YA MEMORY
WITH YEARS AVOIDING PHOTOS
ROCKING MOHAWKS IN ‘04
THAT BOY GONE
MASTER KEY A BLOW AND SO ON
LET A NIGGY KNOW
BLUES AND REDS
BUILT LIKE MO VAUGHN
POKE A LANE BRYANT THICKUM BUT I AINT MAKE IT THROUGH THE WHOLE SONG
CROWN FRIED
DEADEYES
AND CLAMMY FLESH
AS SHE SLEPT
LIFTED TWENTY FROM HER PURSE BEFORE I LEFT
CALLED ME IN LIKE AN HOUR
THAT WAS FOR MY BABYS LUNCH
YOU AINT ABOUT SHIT
WHEN I SEE YOU IMMA…
CLICK
LISTEN MY TRAINS A COMING
SILVER PEAK SHUTTLE OUTTA PEEKSKILL
PURPLE DAWN RISING
REEK OF SOUR MASH REFILLS
EPILLS
GRIND DOWN MY MOLARS I CANT KEEP STILL
GRIMY NIGGA RAGTIME
BRUSH MY TEETH WITH HEINEKEN
SLOW DOWN TO CUT A HALF LINE
RED WINE AND SHIT BROWN BOOMERS
NO.7 ESIASON BLITZ
WILD EYED FRESH OUT THE LIONS DEN
HIGHER SCIENCE
BLEND WITH SUICIDAL TENDENCIES
AN ILLUSION BETTER LIVING THRU CHEMISTRY
Chorus:
Well known offender
Lords never worry but pussy respect pressure
(Woods)
Early bird gets the worm
Fuck that weed shit son
I ain't tryin to burn
What’s the word?
Let me hold something
Aight, then fuck it
Let me roll something
I need that doe cousin!
Tight than a mug
Fuck showing love im on that
Jerry maguire
Bitch said she sick and tired
Bitch you singing to the choir when
All a nigga really need is his shirt ironed
Bout to see my P.O
Apply myself to these applications but
If i dont get a j.o. dont say nathan
When you see me going in the basement
Knocking Sports, Drugs & Entertainment
Food in the dark
I ain't trying to read for Mr. Magoo part
Bullshit glengarry leads
Cadillac Eldorado
Second place is steak knives
In the streets its talented kids but
They corner only teach em how to take dives
Ima take mine like a date rape on Valentine’s
Dressed to the nines
Flower in lapel
Just goes to show, you never can tell
(Creature)
Kufi on in a crack house losing his religion
Truthfully  gone blackout out of commission
Smelling like a sewer system you would diss him
Came home after four days the eulogy written
Ghost in the snap shot a shadow of himself
Lost hope on the bad block a battle for help
Four children and wife  depend on him
Ignore feelings despite the stench on em
Eyes the same  color  as damu’s flag
Son cried ashamed  not you dad
Judge mental  life’s never budge or bent you
Could use a hug  gentle in dark light resents you
Day break time to get right with your maker
Stay safe what you invite can take ya
Where the sun stood still on the darkest corner
Numb  can’t feel like a heartless mournerEmbed
