White Lies Lyrics
Some said he did it all for a fat gold rope
Or was it at the mall over a fashionable coat?
Speculations abound
Was he really broke?
Word around town he getting pounds of that okey doke
And you know how that go
I just heard that though, I don’t really know
Interrogation room; Utz chips; cherry coke
Mentholated smoke
That’s that New Negro
W.E.B. Du Bois in the peacoat
H.B.C.U. keynote speaker
Rewrote history only to find the future bleaker
Black Orpheus
My girl eloped with the reaper
Throw the next bitch down the well
If she floats, that's a keeper
In the lab white smoke bubble out the beaker
Hunchback jump when I yell "Eureka!"
Love don’t cost a thing
But I’m looking for something cheaper

No more space to hide
Tell me who gon' change my mind
I felt all wrong inside
How to make it right?
Someone told a lie
No more space to hide
Tell me who gon' change my mind
No more space to hide
To the corner sat a wide eyed younging in the rear pew
Rev. kept his timepiece flooded
Many mansions' what I’m heir to
Kingdom kid with an apocalyptic worldview
Fire from the sky into oceans, swirling like whirlpools
Mom talking about "Don’t have me look for you behind the gates
Can we all just die now? I shouldn't have to wait."
Maybe when I'm older I’ll have half her faith
Give or take
Tell them rich niggas pass the plate
Trap house of the lord where some would traffic weight
Hid under covers of the cloth
Statutory rape
Touch that old rugged cross
Sung his highest praise
True we all fall short, most disguise their pain
So you can talk that talk, make it seem less staged
Snatched down off that horse, how you see no shame?
What he call divine law made me look both ways
Twisted messages relayed
I didn't come back the same
