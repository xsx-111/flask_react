Duppy Lyrics
Woke to blood on the gate
Witchcraft whispered by maids
The fear under the mask, my father’s face ashen
Hands grasping held us back
We were kids laughing
A few months later the hearse had him
Graveside
Women clutch white napkins
Black magic
Rumors it wasn’t no accident
State funeral/uniforms and acronyms
Eat with the dead pour strong spirits
We Africans
Yeah, me and my sister
We never really laughed again
It’s obeah we come for
And paid good money
Last weapon of the poor
For this children went hungry
Blood on the door
Buried charms
Paw of monkey
Macbeth palms
Dry-eyed in the Beloved Country
Burglar alarm/reach for the heat
Find nothing
Die quietly in your sleep
They still say your wife did something
Upon your house a pox
A fortnight, body in a box
Don’t believe me, just watch
I see fire in a dead man's eyes 4X

Once upon a lynching
Rank fumes of incense
Root workers herb mixing
Graveyard dirt pinching
Intention imprint
Fragrant oils holy waters
Sacrifice for those who fell before us
Retreat to the forest where the moon don’t shine
And the sun barely sweeps the floor
4 corners
Crude shrines
Brick dust outlines
Marooned
Psychic ties
Humbly we commune
Perfumed resin
Laws of attraction
Bats blood
Black arts
Conjure man incantations
Fireside divination
Don’t forget to feed the loas
When the spirit leads
Tell my horse ill ride sidesaddle
Star charts and dream books
Papa la bas  live from the botanica
All white attire with a mugwort amulet
Third eye pierce
Geode chevron amethyst
Nature my cathedral
Backwater crossroads talisman
Gypsy woman with a fever vision
Destiny altered in this land of the living
Elders still whisper
Listen in the stillness
I see fire in a a dead man's eyes 4XEmbed
