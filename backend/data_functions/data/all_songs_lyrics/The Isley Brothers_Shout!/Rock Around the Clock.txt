Rock Around the Clock LyricsOne, two, three o'clock, four o'clock rock
Five, six, seven o'clock, eight o'clock rock
Nine, ten, eleven o'clock, twelve o'clock rock
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Put your glad rags on and join me, hon'
We'll have some fun when the clock strikes one
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock it around the clock tonight
When, when the clock strikes two, three and four
If the band slows down, we'll yell for more
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
Rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock it around the clock tonight
Yeah, and when the clock chimes five, six and seven
We'll be rockin' up in seventh heaven
Gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock it around the clock tonight, yeah
Oh, yeah
Well, we're gonna rock around the clock
Oh, we're gonna rock around the clock
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock around the clock, clock, clock
We're gonna rock around the clock
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rock around the clock tonight
And when the clock strikes twelve, we'll cool off then
Start a rockin' around  again
We're gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock 'til broad daylight
We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight
We're gonna rock, rock, rock around the clock, clock, clock
We're gonna rock around the clock
We're gonna rock, we're gonna rockEmbed
