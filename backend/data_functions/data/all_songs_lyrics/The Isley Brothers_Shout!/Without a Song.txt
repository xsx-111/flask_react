Without a Song LyricsWithout a song, the day would never end
Without a song, the road would never have been
When things go wrong, a man ain't got a friend
Without a song
That field of corn, would never see a plow
That field of corn, would be deserted now
A man is born but he's no good, no how
Without a song, without a songEmbed
