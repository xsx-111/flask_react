St. Louis Blues LyricsSt. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Oh, she pulls her man around by her apron strings
Well, if that wasn't for powder or for her store-bought hair
You know that gal I love wouldn't have gone nowhere, nowhere
I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause that gal I love, she's gonna left this town
Well, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
Oh, I hate to see that evenin' sun go down
'Cause that gal I love, she's gonna left this town
St. Louis woman
St. Louis woman with all her diamond rings
Oh, you know she pulls her man around by her apron strings
Well, if that wasn't for powder or for her store-bought hair
You know that gal I love wouldn't have gone nowhere, nowhere
Got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be
Oh, that gal's gotta heart like a rock cast in the sea
Well, oh hell, she wouldn't have gone so far from meEmbed
