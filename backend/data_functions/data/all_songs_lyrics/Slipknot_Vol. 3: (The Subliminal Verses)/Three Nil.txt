Three Nil Lyrics
One, two, three, nil

Chaos, it's just the beginning
Every promise I made I'm rescinding
Center mass in the middle of the monster
I'm getting tired of drowning the constant
Cry for help, it's debatable
The only reason that you love me is I'm hated by all
Come on, come see dysfunction
I guess we're gonna leave it open for discussion
Who am I? Where am I going?
Maybe I'm looking in the wrong direction
Maybe I'm looking for any direction

This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my expectation
This is not my desperation
Yeah! Holed up, scarred and tamed for the hell of it
Look at me, I am the glorified malcontent
Save me? Save this
All I gotta do is give up and all is forgiven
I'm sick of being the butt of a cosmic joke
And I don't get the punchline
A million people lined up for miles
To see the great big mouth shut up and apologize

This is not my war
This is not my fight
This is something more
This is not my life
This is not my revolution
This is not my convolution
This is not my only reason to question why
Today I said goodbye, goodbye

Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today, I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye
Yeah

I'm the pariah, break me
I am the liar, save me
I can take anything, make me
Accuse me of everything, kill me
Cut off the system, enslave me
Deny my existence, waste me
I won't be afraid, try me
I won't be unmade, deny me
So come on, break it off
Come on, buy the lie
Come on, say it, say it
Come on, say goodbye

Goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye, goodbye
Oh, I didn't need to leave to stay right here
Today I said goodbye
One, two, three, nil
