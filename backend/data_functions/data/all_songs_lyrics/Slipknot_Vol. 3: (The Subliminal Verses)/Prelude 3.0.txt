Prelude 3.0 Lyrics
I don't know why I never told you
I don't know why I never tried
When we shed these bitter skins again
All the reasons come to life

But now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over

I don't know why you never asked me
And I don't know why you never cared
When we hide these little sins again
All the reasons have to die

But now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
And now it's over
No, no, no4Embed
