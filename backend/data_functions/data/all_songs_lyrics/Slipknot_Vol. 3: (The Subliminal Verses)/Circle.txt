Circle Lyrics
Give me the dust of my father
Stand on the face of the ancients
Bare the secret flesh of time itself
Follow me… I've come so far, I'm behind again
Follow me… I wish so hard, I'm there again
Follow me…
Follow me…

All that I wanted were things I had before
All that I needed, I never needed more
All of my questions are answers to my sins
All of my endings are waiting to begin

I know the way, but I falter
I can't be afraid of my patience
There's a sacred place Razel keeps safe
Follow me… I've seen so much, I'm blind again
Follow me… I feel so bad, I'm alive again
Follow me…

All that I wanted were things I had before (oh, oh)
All that I needed, I never needed more (oh, oh)
All of my questions are answers to my sins (oh, oh)
All of my endings are waiting to begin12Embed
