The Nameless Lyrics
Yeah!

Pathetic (benign)
Accept it (undermine)
Your opinion (my justification)
Happy (safe)
Servant (caged)
Malice (utter weakness)
No toleration – invade (committed)
Enraged (admit it)
Don't condescend (don't even disagree)
Desire (decay)
Disappoint (delay)
You suffered then (now suffer unto me)

Obsession – take another look
Remember – every chance you took
Decide – either live with me
Or give up – any thought you had of being free

(Don't go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you…
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate…
Anyone (no) anything (yes) anyway (fall)
Anybody (mine) anybody (tell me)
I want (you) I need (you) I'll have (you)
I won't (let anybody have you)
Obey (me) believe (me) just trust (me) worship (me) live for (me)
Be grateful (now) be honest (now) be precious (now) be mine (just love me)

Possession – feed my only vice
Confession – I won't tell you twice
Decide – either die for me
Or give up – any thought you had of being free

(Don’t go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you…
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you…
(Don’t go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you…
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate…

Yeah!
Yeah!

Stay inside the hole – let me take control
Dominate
You are nothing more – you are something less
Innocent
Something has to give – something has to break
Omnipresent
Fingers on your skin – let my savage in
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
(Don’t go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you… (I wanted you)
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hurting you… (was hurting you)
(Don’t go) I never wanted anybody more than I wanted you… (I wanted you)
(I know) the only thing I ever really loved was hate…

You're mine (I know who you are)
You're mine (I know who you are)
You're mine (I know who you are)
You're mine (I know who you are)8Embed
