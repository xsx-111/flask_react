Talking Drum Lyrics
I hear a voice, I hear a sound
But nothing plays on my mind
I take the car, I travel 'round
But nothing stays on my mind

What do you do when things go wrong?
I'm winning in the heart of the bushland
What do you do when things go wrong?
I'm winning in the heart of the bushland

But now I'm scared, now I'm lost in love
All these things were never done
Your burning bridge, my talking drum
Now we're too late for heaven

My my talking drum, my my talking drum
My my talking drum, my my talking drum

What do you do when things go wrong?
I'm winning in the heart of the bushland
What do you do when things go wrong?
I'm winning in the heart of the bushland
But now I'm scared, now I'm lost in love
All these things were never done
Your burning bridge, my talking drum
Now we're too late for heaven

My talking talking, talking drum
Talking
My talking talking, talking drum
Talking
My my talking talking, talking drum
Talking
My talking talking, talking drum
