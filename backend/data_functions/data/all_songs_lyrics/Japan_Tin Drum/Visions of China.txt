Visions of China Lyrics
I'm walking young and strong
But just a little too thin
I may be happy
But I haven't a clue to this life
In my mind

Stay with me, we could learn to fight
Like every good boy should
Cling to me, we are blacked out
In visions of China tonight

I'm burning heroes again
I never thought of before
I remember the fashion
But don't have a clue to your life
In my mind

Stay with me, we could learn to fight
Like every good boy should
Cling to me, we are blacked out
In visions of China tonight
We walk backwards, say nothing
My visions of China
We're young and strong in this party
We're building our visions of China
We walk backwards, say nothing
My visions of China
We're young and strong in this party
We're living our visions of China
We walk backwards, say nothing
My visions of China
We're young and strong in this party
We're building our visions of ChinaEmbed
