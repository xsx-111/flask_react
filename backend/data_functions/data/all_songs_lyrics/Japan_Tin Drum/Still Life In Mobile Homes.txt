Still Life In Mobile Homes Lyrics
Sometimes the comfort of a room
Sometimes I'm quite alone
I pack to leave a foreign town
It seems I'll never know

But I'll rent new accommodation
We'll make plans from mobile homes

The slow boat's moving with the tide
Drifting far from shore
It's the nature of this country life
I've never known before

Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses
From mobile homes

Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
The sound of wildlife fills the air
So warm and dry
The bushland burns in this southern heart
Like an open fire

Still we'll make plans for buildings and houses
From mobile homes
In mobile homes

Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes

A voice screams from heaven
As we start to sail
It's the calling of the fatherland
I used to know so well
But I'll find new accommodation
We'll make plans from mobile homes

Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes
Plant life, my life
Still life in mobile homes1Embed
