The Art of Parties Lyrics
Once I was young, once I was smart
Now I'm living on the edge of my nerves
The things we said weren't quite so tough
When we were young

Well, I'm burning
I'm burning buildings I'm building, this time

Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
Under heavy weather
Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning
Burning

I'm living, I'm living my life
I'm living this time

Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning
Burning
The wind blew through my hair (Once I was young)
I'd shelter from the sun (Once I was smart)
We lived on the strength of our nerves
When we were young

Well, I'm building
I'm burning buildings I'm burning

Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
Under heavy weather
Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning, I'm, I'm burning
Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning
Burning
Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning, just burning
Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning
Burning
Oh, oh, oh
For the art of parties
Oh, oh, oh
I'm burning
