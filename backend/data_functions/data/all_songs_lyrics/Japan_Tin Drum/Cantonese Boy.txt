Cantonese Boy Lyrics
We're pushing through these farming towns
We've worked hard ploughing over ground
Red army calls you, the call of the crowd
Red army needs you, it calls you now

Cantonese boy, bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy, civilian soldier
Cantonese boy, bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy, red army calls you home

We're singing, marching through the fields
We're changing the lives we've led for years
Red army calls you, the call of the crowd
Red army needs you, it calls you now

Cantonese boy, bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy, civilian soldier
Cantonese boy, bang your tin drum
Cantonese boy, red army calls you home

Red army calls you
Red army needs you
Red army calls you
Red army needs you
Gentlemen you heard us call
Raised your glass and called for more
Only young men broke the wallEmbed
