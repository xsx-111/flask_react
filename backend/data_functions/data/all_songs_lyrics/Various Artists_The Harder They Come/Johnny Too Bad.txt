Johnny Too Bad Lyrics
Walking down the road with your pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad
Woah woah woii!
Walking down the road with your ratchet in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad
Woah woah woii!
You're just robbing and you're stabbing, and you're looting and you're shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad
You're just robbing and you're stabbing, and you're looting and you're shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad

One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah woah woii!
One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah woah woii!
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue
There will be no Rock
No Rock
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue
There will be no Rock
Nowhere

Walking down the road with your pistol in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad
Woah woah woii!
Walking down the road with your ratchet in your waist
Johnny, you're too bad
Woah woah woii!
You're just robbing and you're stabbing, and you're looting and you're shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad
You're just robbing and you're stabbing, and you're looting and you're shooting
Boy, you're too bad
Too bad

One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah woah woii!
One of these days when you hear a voice say, "Come"
Where you gonna run to?
Woah woah woii!
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue
There will be no Rock
No Rock
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue
There will be no Rock
Nowhere
You're gonna run to the Rock for rescue
There will be no Rock...Embed
