At ocean eleven
And now rudeboys have a goil
'Cause them out of jail
Rudeboys cannot fail
'Cause them must get bail
Dem a loot, dem a shoot, dem a wail
A Shanty Town
Dem a loot, dem a shoot, dem a wail
A Shanty Town
Dem rudeboys get a probation
A Shanty Town
And rudeboy bomb up the town
A Shanty Town

At ocean eleven
And the rudeboys a go wail
'Cause them out of jail
Rudeboys cannot fail
'Cause them must get bail
Dem a loot, dem a shoot, dem a wail
A Shanty Town
Dem a loot, dem a shoot, dem a wail
A Shanty Town
Dem rudeboys get a probation
A Shanty Town
And rudeboy bomb up the town
A Shanty Town
Police get taller
A Shanty Town
Soldier get longer
A Shanty Town
Rudeboy a weep and a wail
A Shanty TownEmbed
