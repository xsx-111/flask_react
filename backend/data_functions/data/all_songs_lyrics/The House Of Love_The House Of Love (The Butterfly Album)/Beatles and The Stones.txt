Beatles and The Stones Lyrics
Look at him shouting out
Loud as thunder out at sea
He wants a bomb
So do we
A bomb from the sky
Is the perfect crime
Shoulder on shoulder and heat

The Beatles and the Stones
Sucked the marrow out of bones
Put the "V" in Vietnam
The Beatles and the Stones
Made it good to be alone
To be alone

Look at me, proud of being
Proud of being seventeen
Locked in, they park and they smile
Soft from the school
Cut by the rules
Oh I'm dazed and I'm dazed and I'm dazed

The Beatles and the Stones
Sucked the marrow out of bones
Put the "V" in Vietnam
The Beatles and the Stones
Made it good to be alone
To be alone
The Beatles and the Stones
Sucked the marrow out of bones
Put the "V" in Vietnam
The Beatles and the Stones
Made it good to be alone
To be alone1Embed
