Se Dest LyricsBruised and I'm aching
Screwed to the floor
I'm high on the shock
I've closed off the door
Cut the heart of pain
Loaded with dice and shame
Where do you stop?
Why do you stop?
You'll just do the same again
Give me a crime
I'll show the love
A song to the lonely
A song from above
Wailing from wall to wall
Lucid as a doll
Kick down the legs
Bite on the tongue
You'll just do the same again
Bruised and I'm aching
I'm screwed to the floor
High on the shock
I've closed off the door
I've never been so sure
Of anyone's love beforeEmbed
