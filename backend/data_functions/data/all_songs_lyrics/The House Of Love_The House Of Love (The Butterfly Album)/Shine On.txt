Shine On Lyrics
In a garden in the House of Love
Sitting lonely on a plastic chair
The sun is cruel when he hides away
I need a sister
I'll just stay
A little girl, a little guy
In a church or in a school
Little Jesus are you watching me?
I'm so young
Just eighteen

She, she-she-she shine on
She-she-she shine on
She-she-she shine on

In a garden in the House of Love
There's nothing real just a coat of arms
I'm not the pleasure that I used to be
So young
Just eighteen

She, she-she-she shine on
She-she-she shine on
She-she-she shine on
I don't know why I dream this way
The sky is purple
Things are right every day
I don't know, it's just this world's so far away
But I won't fight and I won't hate
Well not today


In a garden in the House of Love
Sitting lonely on a plastic chair
The sun is cruel when he hides away
I need a sister
I'll just stay

She, she-she-she shine on
She-she-she shine on
She-she-she shine onEmbed
