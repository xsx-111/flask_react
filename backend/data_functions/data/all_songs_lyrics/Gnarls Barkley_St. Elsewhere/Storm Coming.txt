Storm Coming Lyrics
I could paint a picture with a pen
But a song will only scratch the skin
And there are still places I haven't been
Because I know what's in there is already in the air
Oh yeah, there's a storm on the way
There's a storm on the way, alright
There's a storm on the way, uh huh
And it's comin' no matter what I say
(And I come, I come, I come, I come)

Hey, hey, hey
There's truth in the thunder, love in the lightning
The feeling is frightening, yet isn't it exciting?
I'm something like stormy weather; if I weren't, we would never
Huddle together; do I have to tell you
That I'm also the sunlight that shines shortly after?
I just rain 'cause I have to, on to a new chapter
I wish you lots of laughter 'til the next time you see me
Just remember you need me, I'm the storm coming

(And I come, I come, I come, I come)
Oh, come on
(And I come, I come, I come, I come)
Come on
Run towards the hills to avoid the high flood
I can do a dance that'll make the sky cry blood
Skills provoke and seals will be broken open
All that's left to do is try my love
Woo!

When I sing, it's a cyclone
I'm writing a raging sea
Searching for a sign of the times
Is it safe to say it's me?
Listen to our lives
The wind will whisper the way it is
I am going to happen
What a lovely day it is

Don't ask why
Just live and die4Embed
