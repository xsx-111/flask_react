Who Cares? Lyrics
Basically, I'm complicated
I have a hard time taking the easy way
I wouldn't call it schizophrenia
But I'll be at least two people today
If that's okay

And I could go on and on and on
But who cares?

It's deep how you can be so shallow
And I'm afraid 'cause I have no fear
And I didn't believe in magic
Until I watched you disappear
I wish you were here

And I could go on and on and on
But who cares?

You see, everybody is somebody
But nobody wants to be themselves
Ooh, and if I ever wanted to understand me
I'd have to talk to someone else
'Cause every little bit helps
And I could go on and on and on
But who cares?

It feels like a surreal life
But it's still nice
Wish I could live twice
And I still might
If these wounds heal right
I see a little light
Even though it's still night
It feels like a surreal life
But it's still nice
Wish I could live twice
And I still might
If these wounds heal right
I see a little light
Even though it's still night

And I could go on and on and on
But who cares?
And I could go on and on and on
But who cares?2Embed
