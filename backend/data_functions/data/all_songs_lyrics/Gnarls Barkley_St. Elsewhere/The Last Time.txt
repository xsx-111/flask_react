The Last Time Lyrics
All work and no play
That's the way it is, ain't it?
There's a rhythm deep inside of you
And you must get reacquainted

When was the last time you danced?
When was the last time you danced?
Well, come rock with me, baby
Dance with me, darling
Step with me, sweetheart
The world is watching

Under an endless sky
Wish I could fly away forever (And ever)
And the poetry is so pure
When we are on the floor together (It's been a long time)

When was the last time you danced?
When was the last time you danced?
Well, come rock with me, baby
Dance with me, darling
Step with me, sweetheart
The world is watching
Don't deny me any further
Let me have my way
Ooh, come closer, yeah
Let's dance the night away

When was the last time you danced?
When was the last time you danced?
Well, come rock with me, baby
Dance with me, darling
Step with me, sweetheart
The world is watchingEmbed
