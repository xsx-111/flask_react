St. Elsewhere Lyrics
I packed a few of my belongings
Left the life that I was living
Just some memories of it
Mostly, the ones I can't forget
Ah, whenever you need me, I'll be here
Until then, my dear
I'm going, I'm going, going there
Don't ask me to make time, to travel back and forth
Let nature take its course
Maybe I'm open from all this ocean air

And if it weren't for you
I'd be without a care
Settin' sail to St. Elsewhere, yeah

Anywhere you sit, you can see the sun
Unfortunately, on this island, I'm the only one (One)
Same rules apply on a rainy day
And it's not such a pretty place to be
It just rains, and rains, and rains, on me
Send a simple sign I can understand
Then a flower grew out that sand
Before you know it, I was back out on that sea
Now, I don't mind it so much
Because as long as I'm not there
Anywhere, St. Elsewhere, yeah

Way over yonder, there's a new frontier
Would it be so hard for you to come and visit me here?
I understand
Well, just send me a message in a bottle, then, baby
