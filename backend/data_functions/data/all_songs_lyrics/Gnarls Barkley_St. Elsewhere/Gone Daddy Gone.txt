Gone Daddy Gone Lyrics
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
High school smiles, oh, yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone away

When I see you
Eyes will turn blue
When I see you
A thousand eyes, turning blue

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone away
And I can tell by the way that you switch and walk
And I can see by the way that you baby talk
And I can know by the way that you treat your man
I can love you baby, 'til it's a cryin'

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone away

Beautiful girl, lovely dress
15 smiles, oh, yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess

'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
It's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone
The love is gone away
Going away
Going away
Gone away
Going away
Going away
Gone away
Going away3Embed
