Loose Change Lyrics
I built a house of cards
Built a house of rain
Built a house of love
It's hard to build again
Built a road to reason
Built a road to fate
Built a road
To the promised land
Right up to the gate

Loose change in my pocket
Future in my hand
Too many distractions
For me to understand

Too many distractions
Got to get back home
Get into something solid
Get out of the zone
Some roads bring renewal
Some roads hide and wait
Some roads
Promise everything
And steal your fuel away

Some roads I been flying
Some roads I crashed
Some roads
I been sleeping on
Some roads I got back
Some roads I been running
Some roads I was stopped
Some roads
I been walking down
Some roads I was lostEmbed
