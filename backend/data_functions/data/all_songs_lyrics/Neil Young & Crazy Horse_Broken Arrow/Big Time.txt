Big Time Lyrics
Going to leave the pain behind
Going to leave the fools in line
Going to take the magic potion
Getting in an old black car
Going to take a ride so far
To the land of sun tan lotion
Going to take it state by state
Til I hit the golden gate
Get my feet wet in the ocean

I'm still living
In the dream we had
For me it's not over

Walking on the bridge on day
Looking out across the bay
I saw a rippling in the water
Once a big ship had passed
I borrowed a traveller's glass
And focused on
The ocean's daughter
Kind of like a wave confused
Dancing in the sunset hews
She waved to me
And called me over

Talking bout a friend of mine
Talking bout a gold mine
Richest vein in any mountain
Talking bout the enemy
Inside of me
Talking bout
That youthful fountain
Talking bout you and me
Talking bout eternity
Talking bout the big time
