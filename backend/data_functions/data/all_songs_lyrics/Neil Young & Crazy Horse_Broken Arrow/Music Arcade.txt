Music Arcade Lyrics
Have you ever been lost
Have you ever been found out
Have you ever felt all alone
At the end of the day
Yeah I'm talking bout getting down
Take it easy - there's no one around
Just a mirror and you and me
And the TV screen

I was walking down main street
Not the sidewalk but main street
Dodging traffic with flying feet
That's how good I felt
Took a spin in the laundromat
Played a game in the music arcade
Kept winning while the band played
That's how good I felt

Have you ever been lost
Have you ever been found out
Have you ever felt all alone
At the end of the day
Yeah I'm talking bout getting down
Take it easy - there's no one around
Just a mirror and you and me
And the TV sky
Have you ever been singled out
By a hungry man
You're listening to the radio
He's washing your window
When you look in those vacant eyes
How does it harmonize
With the things that you do?
That's how good I felt

Have you ever been lost
Have you ever been found out
Have you ever felt all alone
At the end of the day
Yeah I'm talking bout getting down
Take it easy - there's no one around
Just a mirror and you and me
And the TV screen

There's a comet in the sky tonight
Makes me feel like I'm alright
I'm moving pretty fast
For my size
I really didn't mean to stay
As long as I have
So I'll be moving onEmbed
