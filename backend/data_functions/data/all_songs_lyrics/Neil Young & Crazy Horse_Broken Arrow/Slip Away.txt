Slip Away Lyrics
She lives in the TV sky
She lives in such pain
She rides in a bulletproof
Stretch limousine
The smoke in the barroom nights
The faces in the window
The sound of the harbor horn
She recognized

And when the music started
She just slipped away
Just like a river rolling down
And when the music started
She just slipped away

High on a windy hill
The turbine did whine
Low in the valley chill
A baby was crying
Impossible to take the time
The moment is here
Cry out from behind the pines
A voice coming near
