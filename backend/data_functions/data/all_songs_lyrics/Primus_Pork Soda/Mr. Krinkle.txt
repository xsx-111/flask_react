Mr. Krinkle LyricsHello, Mr. Krinkle
How are you today?
Seems the rumors are about your team might move away
Now, me, I'm sentimental
But I'm not one to cry
(Yep, yep)
Say there, Mr. Krinkle, let's cruise the bastard boat
Damn then sonsabitches with their gill-nets set afloat
I flip on my tele, and I watch the waters die
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, tell me why
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, tell me why
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, won't you please tell me why
Tell me why
Hey ho, Mr. Krinkle, have you heard the brand new sound?
It's a cross between Jimi Hendrix
Bocephus, Cher and James Brown
It's called "Heavy Hometown"
New Wave, cold-filtered, low-calorie dry
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, tell me why
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, tell me why
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, tell me why
C'mon, Mr. Krinkle, tell me why
Mr. Krinkle
Mr. Krinkle
Mr. Krinkle
