The Pressman Lyrics
By the light of lamp, I sit to type
My notes on tab at my side
I don't see the sun much these days
A fluorescent tan covers my hide

How much impact shall I have this time?
My goal today is to reach the deadline
I write between the lines, I deal with fantasy
I report the facts, give them to me, please

Ham and egg salad on white bread
Keeps me company on nights like this
A pack of mentholated cigarettes
Keep my air nice and thick

When I write, words flow like coins from a candy box
Get out of my way, I've got something to say

The pulse is beating louder now
The pulse is beating louder now
The cramps in my hands grow
More intense with each tik, tik
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap on the keys
My social life is at an end
So it seems to be
Why don't I trample on your lawn today?
I'll take skies of blue, turn them over to skies of grey, 'cause
I write between the lines, I deal with fantasy
I am the pressman, acknowledge me

Mother always told me, "Never stray too far from home"
The little lady said, "Boy, you'll never have to be alone, because
You build with fountain pen, you create the memory stain
You are the pressman, stand up straight, boy."1Embed
