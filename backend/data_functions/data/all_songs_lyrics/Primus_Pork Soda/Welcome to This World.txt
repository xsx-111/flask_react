Welcome to This World Lyrics
Welcome to this world of fools
Of pink champagne and swimming pools
Where all you have to lose is your virginity
Perhaps you'll have some fun tonight
So stick around and take a bite of life
We don't need feebleness in this proximity
What!

Ask good MacDuff and Donalbain
So many good ideas are slain
By those who would dare not step out of line
But if I have my way tonight
And chances are I think I might
I'll turn those sour minds to grapes of wine
Grapes of wine

Welcome to this world

Don't judge the boy by what you hear
The words are heard beyond the ear
The heart and mind are focus for this conversation
But be abound in mystery for that so much you do to me
For there are those who drown in adulation
Adulation!
Welcome to this world
What!
Welcome to this world

If I had a dime for each time that I had heard them preach
Why, I'd have wicked thoughts upon my brain
Ha hah hah hah hah!

Oh, welcome to this world of fools
Of pink champagne and swimming pools
Where all you have to lose is your virginity
Perhaps you'll have some fun tonight
Stick around and take a bite of life
We don't need feebleness in this proximity

Welcome to this world
Welcome to this world4Embed
