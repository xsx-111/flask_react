Bob Lyrics
I had a friend that took a belt
Took a belt and hung himself
Hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
His woman and his little bro
Came home from the grocery store
Only to find him dangling in the apartment where he lived

I had a friend who shaved his head
Put his Doctor Martens on
And drew such wondrous pictures in the apartment where he lived
He praised my creativity
Though he spoke sarcastically
Oh, the conversations there in the apartment where he lived

I had a friend who took his belt
Took the belt and hung himself
Hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
Rock, she thought him spiteful;
Ler, he thought him pitiful
Me, I've never been back to the apartment where he lived

I had a friend that took a belt
Took a belt and hung himself
Hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
I had a friend that took a belt
Took a belt and hung himself
Hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
I had a friend that took a belt
Took a belt and hung himself
Hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
I had a friend that took a belt
Took a belt and hung himself
He hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
I had a friend that took a belt
Took a belt and hung himself
Hung himself in the doorway of the apartment where he lived
