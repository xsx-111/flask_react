Blue Room Lyrics
We'll have a blue room
A new room for two room
Where ev'ry day's a holiday
Because you're married to me
Not like a ballroom
A small room, a hall room
Where you can smoke your pipe away
With my head upon my knee

We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With Mister and Misses
On little blue chairs
You sew your trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs!

We'll have a blue room
A new room for two room
Where ev'ry day's a holiday
Because you're married to me
Not like a ballroom
A small room, a hall room
Where you can smoke your pipe away
With my head wee upon your knee
We will thrive on, keep alive on
Just nothing but kisses
With Mister and Misses
On little blue chairs
You sew your trousseau
And Robinson Crusoe
Is not so far from worldly cares
As our blue room far away upstairs!
Our blue room far away upstairs!Embed
