With a Song in My Heart LyricsThough I know that we meet ev'ry night
And we couldn't have changed since the last time
To my joy and delight
It's a new kind of love at first sight
Though it's you and it's I all the time
Ev'ry meeting's a marvelous pastime
You're increasingly sweet
So whenever we happen to meet
I greet you ...
REFRAIN
With a song in my heart
I behold your adorable face
Just a song at the start
But it soon is a hymn to your grace
When the music swells
I'm touching your hand
It tells that you're standing near, and ..
At the sound of your voice
Heaven opens its portals to me
Can I help but rejoice
That a song such as ours came to be?
But I always knew
I would live life through
With a song in my heart for youEmbed
