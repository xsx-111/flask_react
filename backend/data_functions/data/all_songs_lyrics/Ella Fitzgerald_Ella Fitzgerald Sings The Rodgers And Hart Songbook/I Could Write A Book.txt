I Could Write A Book LyricsA B C D E F G
I never learned to spell
At least not well
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
I never learned to count
A great amount
But my busy mind is burning to use what learning I've got
I won't waste any time
I'll strike while the iron is hot
If they asked me, I could write a book
About the way you walk, and whisper, and look
I could write a preface
On how we met
So the world would never forget
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
And the world discovers
As my book ends
How to make two lovers
Of friends
Instrumental
And the simple secret of the plot
Is just to tell them that I love you a lot
And the world discovers
As my book ends
How to make two lovers
Of friendsEmbed
