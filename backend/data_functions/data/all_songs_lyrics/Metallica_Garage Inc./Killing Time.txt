Killing Time Lyrics
Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight
Reports come in of the heavy attack
Message is seen, we are moving back

Preparations are made for the journey back
It is a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out

Killing time - Your life's on the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill
Killing time - What do you say
Killing time, ah killing time

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he will take your life

The silence is over, they attack again
Killing and hatred drive me insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message is seen, we are moving back
Killing time - You left from the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill
Killing time - What do you say
Killing time, ah killing time

Sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it is a terrible sight
Reports come in of the heavy attack
Message is seen, we are moving back

And he knew what he needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he will take your life

Killing time - You left from the line
Killing time - Your turn to kill
Killing time - What do you say
Killing time, ah killing timeEmbed
