Breadfan Lyrics
Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse
Open up your bones, never, never gonna lose it
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch
Got to make a mint, got to make me a million
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Going to lose it in the end, who is a fool
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man
Stay a ghost, stay what you want to be

Loser, give it all away, never stay with the winner
With the man with all the filthy money
Come on, keep it on the side, with a ride on a record
On the top if you're gonna be a bad boy
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Going to lose it in the end, who is a fool
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man
Stay a ghost, stay what you want to be
Breadfan, open up your mind, open up your purse
Open up your bones, never, never going to lose it
Breadfan, take it all away, never give an inch
Got to make a mint, got to make me a million
Breadfan, you got it wrong, some long time friend's
Going to lose it in the end, who is a fool
Seagull, give it all away, stay a bird, stay a man
Stay a ghost, stay what you want to be
Mommy, where's fluffy?3Embed
