Astronomy Lyrics
Clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Like acid and oil on a madmans face
His reason tends to fly away
Like lesser birds on the four winds, yeah
Like silver scrapes in May
And now the sand has become a crust
Most of you have gone away (yeah, gone away)

Come Susie dear, let's take a walk
Just out there upon the beach
I know you will soon be married
And you will want to know where winds come from
Well it is never said at all
On the map that Carrie reads
Behind the clock back there you know
At the Four Winds Bar
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Four winds at the Four Winds Bar
Two doors locked and windows barred
One door left to take you in
The other one just mirrors it
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hellish glare and inference
The other one's a duplicate
The Queenly flux, eternal light
Or the light that never warms
Yes the light that never, never warms
Yes the light that never
Never warms, never warms, never warms

The clock strikes twelve and moon drops burst
Out at you from their hiding place
Miss Carrie nurse and Susie dear
Would find themselves at Four Winds Bar
It's the nexus of the crisis
And the origin of storms
Just the place to hopelessly
Encounter time and then came me
Hey, hey, hey, hey

Call me Desdinova
Eternal light
These gravely digs of mine
Will surely prove a sight
And don't forget my dog
Fixed and consequent
Astronomy, a star
Astronomy, a star
Astronomy, a star
Astronomy, a star
