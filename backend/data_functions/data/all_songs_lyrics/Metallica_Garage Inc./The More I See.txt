The More I See Lyrics
From where I stand I see
Pain, suffering, and misery

The more I see (the more I see)
The less, the less I believe

From where I stand I see
Hate, violence, and war

The more I see (the more I see)
The less, the less I believe, yeah

The more I see (the more I see)
The less, the less I believe, yeah

I believe

From where I stand I see
Pain, suffer, and misery, yeah
The more I see
The less, the less I believe, yeah

The more I see
The more I see
The more I see, yeah
The more I see, yeah
The more I see, yeah
The less, the less I believeEmbed
