Overkill Lyrics
Only way to feel the noise
Is when it is good and loud
So good I can't believe it
Screaming with the crowd

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill, Overkill, Overkill

On your feet you feel the beat
It goes straight to your spine
Shake your head, you must be dead
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill, Overkill, Overkill
Know your body's made to move
It goes straight to your spine
You got to move it
If it don't make you fly

Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Don't sweat it
Give it back to you
Overkill, Overkill, Overkill1Embed
