Helpless Lyrics
I've got to see you moving fast, see you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away
Got to see the lights above, make it loud tonight
Got to set it all afire, set it all alight

See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
I am going to set you all alight
Got to make it man, I haven't got a choice
Got to fill this hall tonight
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless

I don't know what I'm going to do, maybe not tonight
Got to set you all afire, got to treat you right
I can see the flashing lights, lit before your love
Got to hear the thunder roar, coming from above

See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
I am going to set you all alight
Got to make it man, I haven't got a choice
Got to fill this hall tonight
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless

I can see the stars, I can see what's going on
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine, music is my destiny
Cannot squeeze the life from me

I can see the stars, I can see what's going on
Every night alone I sing my song just for fun
Only time will tell if I'll make it myself someday
This stage is mine, music is my destiny
Cannot squeeze the life from me
