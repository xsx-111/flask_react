Blitzkrieg Lyrics
Let us have peace, let us have life
Let us escape the cruel night
Let us have time, let the sun shine
Let us beware the deadly sign

The day is coming, Armageddon's near
Inferno's coming, can we survive the blitzkrieg
The blitzkrieg, the blitzkrieg

Save us from fate, save us from hate
Save ourselves before it's too late
Come to our need, hear our plea
Save ourselves before the earth bleeds

The Day is dawning, the time is near
Aliens calling, Can we survive the blitzkrieg

Burp
HAH HAH HAH!
(I fucked up, in one place)1Embed
