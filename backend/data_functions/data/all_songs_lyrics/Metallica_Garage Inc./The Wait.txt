The Wait Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

Motives changing, day to day
The fire increases, masks decay
I look at the river, white foam floats down
The body's poisoned, got to sit tight

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait

After wakening, silence grows
The screams subside, distortion shows
Mutant thoughts of bad mouthed news
Is just another birth of distorted views

The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait
The wait
The waitEmbed
