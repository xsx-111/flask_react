The Small Hours Lyrics
 this

Look out at the darkness
And you will see
Just call my name and I'll be there
You cannot touch me
You would not dare
I am the chill that's in the air

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day, haha

Dark rivers are flowing
Back into the past
You are the fish for which I cast
And what of the future?
What is to be?
As the rivers flow into the sea

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day

Do not take for granted
Powers out there
Don't step into the demon's lair
Time is an illusion
Rising from time
Steep is the mountain which we climb

And I try to get through to you
In my own special way
As the barriers crumble
At the end of the day2Embed
