Stone Dead Forever Lyrics
You think you see me in the glass
You think you hear me better listen fast
I think I see you gone to seed
Think your reason is your guilt and greed

You are out there on your own
Your face turned to stone
What ever happened to your life
Stone dead forever
All right

You are a financial wizard
Top tycoon
You are Sweet long lizard
With a silver spoon
You know you have never had it
Quite so good
And you didn't know
That you even could

Your time has come to own
Your touch turned to gold
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
All right
It's been a long time
It's been a long long wait
And you caught your fingers
In the pearly gates
You better leave your number
And we will call you
You know your problem
That's not exactly new

Your time has come today
Your face has turned to hey
What ever happened to your life?
Stone dead forever
That's rightEmbed
