Sabbra Cadabra Lyrics
Feel so good, I feel so fine
Love that little lady, always on my mind
She gives me love every night and day
Never going to leave her, never going away

Someone to love me, you know she makes me feel alright, alright
Someone to need me, love me every single night, yeah

Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we are making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time, ah

Someone to live for, I'll love her 'til the end of time
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine

I am the world that hides the universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces is my one and only crime
I lived a thousand times, I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images, the unborn child never was conceived
You got to believe me, hey, I'm talking to you
Well, I know it's hard for you to know the reason why
And I know you'll understand when it's time to die
I don't believe the life you have will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep to let your soul live on
Feel so happy since I met that girl
When we are making love it's something out of this world
Feels so good to know that she's all mine
Going to love that woman 'til the end of time, ah

Someone to live for, I'll love her 'til the end of time
She makes me feel happy, it's good to know that she's all mine2Embed
