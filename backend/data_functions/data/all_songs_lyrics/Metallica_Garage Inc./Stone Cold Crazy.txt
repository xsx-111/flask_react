Stone Cold Crazy Lyrics
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning
I was dreaming I was Al Capone
Rumors going round, got to clear out of town
Smell like a dry fishbone
Here come the law, going to break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it anymore
Got to get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon, ought to kill a typhoon
And she is playing on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here come the deputy, try fucking getting me
Gotta fucking get up and run
They got the sirens loose, I ran right out of juice
They are going to put me in a cell
If I can't go to heaven, let me go to hell
Crazy, stone cold crazy, you knowEmbed
