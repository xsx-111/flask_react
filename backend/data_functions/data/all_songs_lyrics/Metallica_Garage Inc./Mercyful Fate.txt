Mercyful Fate Lyrics
They're walking by the night
The moon has frozen blue
Long black coats as shelter for the rain
Their load must get through
Now bats are leaving their trees
They're joining the call
Seven satanic Hell preachers
Heading for the hall
Bringing the blood of a newborn child, yeah
Got to succeed, if not, it's Satan's fall

Way out in Egypt in the valley of kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep, yeah
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you've been hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes, you've been hit, and the curse is on you

Ooo, the curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Just destroying your future
Making it all shady, yeah yeah
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill (in for the kill)
Or you'll be hit by the curse of the pharaohs
Yes, you'll be hit, and the curse is on you
Listen, yeah, I'm a corpse, I'm a corpse
I'm a corpse without soul
Satan, yeah, he has taken, he has taken
He has taken his toll
He took it on me
I, yeah, I'm trapped, I'm trapped
I'm trapped in his spell
Tonight, yeah, I'm going, I'm going
I'm going to Hell, inside his spell

Howl like a wolf
And a witch will open the door
Follow me and meet our high priestess
Yeah, come, come into my coven
Yeah, and become Lucifer's child

Undress until you are naked
And put on this white coat
Take this white cross and go to the center of the ring
Yeah, come, come into my coven
Yeah, and become Lucifer's child
I was born in the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
In the legions of Hell
Now I'm king of pain, I'm insane, yeah
You know my only pleasure
Is to hear you cry
I love to hear you cry
I love to see you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral
And I'll be the last to leave
I love to hear you cry

And when you're down beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (goodbye)
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
Yeah, you got to say goodbye
Yeah. 'cause I will eat your mind!
