So What? Lyrics
So fucking what?

Well, I've been to Hastings and I've been to Brighton
I've been to Eastbourne too
So what? So what?
And I've been here, I've been there
I've been every fucking where
So what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little cunt?

Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you

Well, I fucked a queen, I fucked Bach
I've even sucked an old man's cock
So what? So what?
And I fucked a sheep, I fucked a goat
I rammed my cock right down its throat
So what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little fuck?
Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you

And I've drunk that, I've drunk this
I've spewed up on a pint of piss
So what? So what?
I've had skank, I've had speed
I've jacked up until I bleed
So what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little cunt?

Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you, hey

I've had crabs, I've had lice
I've had the clap and that ain't nice
So what? So what?
I fucked this, I fucked that
I've even fucked a school girl's twat
So what? So what?
So what? So what, you boring little fuck?
Well, who cares, who cares what you do?
Yeah, who cares, who cares about you?
You, you, you, you, you

So fucking what?! Yeah!4Embed
