The Seventh Seal Lyrics
Anybody seen a knight pass this way?
I saw him playing chess with Death, yesterday
His crusade was a search for God and they say
It's been a long way to carry on

Anybody hear of plague in this town?
The town I've left behind was burned to the ground
A young girl on a stake, her face framed in flames
Cried, "I'm not a witch, God knows my name"
The knight, he watched with fear, he needed to know
He ran where he might feel God's breath
And in the misty church, he knelt to confess
The face within the booth was Mr. Death

"My life's a vain pursuit of meaningless miles...
Why can't God touch me with a sign?"
"Perhaps there's no one there," answered the booth
And Death hid within his cloak and smiled
"This morning I played chess with Death," said the knight
"We played that he might grant me time...
My bishop and my knight will shatter his flanks
And still I might feel God's heart in mine!"
And through confession's grille, Death's laughter was heard
The knight cried, "No, you've cheated me!
But still I'll find a way, we'll meet once again
And once again continue to play!"
They met within the woods, the knight, his squire, and friends
And Death said, "Now, the game shall end"
The final move was made, the knight hung his head
And said, "You've won, I've nothing left to play..."

The minstrel filled with visions, sang to his love
To look against the stormy sky
The knight, his squire, and friends, their hands held as one
Solemnly danced toward the dawn
His hourglass in his hand, his scythe by his side
The master, Death, he leads them on
The rain will wash away the tears from their faces
And as the thunder cracked, they were gone5Embed
