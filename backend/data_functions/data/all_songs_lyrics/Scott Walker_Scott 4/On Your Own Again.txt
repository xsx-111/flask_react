On Your Own Again Lyrics
Wasn't it a good year?
Wasn't filled with talking
It still moves through my heart
From time to time

City after city
Granite gray as morning
Heroes died in subways left behind
Far behind like our love

You're on your own again
And you're your best again
That's what you tell yourself
I see it all the way as far as anyone can see
Except when it began I was so happy
I didn't feel like meEmbed
