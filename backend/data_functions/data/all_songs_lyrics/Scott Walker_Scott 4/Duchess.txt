Duchess Lyrics
It's your bicycle bells and your Rembrandt swells
Your children alive and still breathing
And your look of loss when you're coming across
Makes me feel like a thief when you're bleeding

Duchess, Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess, Duchess
Put all your love back in me
I come listening, I touch touching

With the Persian sea running through your veins
You shed your names with the seasons
Still they all return with their last remains
And they lay them before you like reasons
With your shimmering dress, it says no, it says yes
It says I've nothing left for concealing
It's your shiftless flesh and your old girl's grace
It's your young girl's face that I'm breathing

Duchess, Duchess
Light up your candles for me
Duchess, Duchess, Duchess
Put all the love back in me
I'm lying, she is crying1Embed
