Rhymes of Goodbye Lyrics
I've come far from chains from metal and stone
From makeshift designs and seeking a star
To grab for the truth, to keep myself warm
I turn and it's gone, you smile and it's born

The rhymes of a woman's
A river that never ends
The rhymes of dimension
Surrounds us with fire and friends

And roaring through darkness
The night children fly
I still hear them singing
The rhymes of goodbye

There's nothing within, but within says a voice
That's still my empire and I've got a choice
Its healers of death, it's still got a fire
And I'll keep it burning with hands of desire
The bells of our senses can cost us our pride
Can toll out the boundaries that level our lives
Can slash like the sunlight through shadows and cracks
Our nakedness calling, our nakedness back
The rhyme of our passions
Find beauty in loving love
The rhyme of our madness
Burn cities and push and shoves

And roaring through darkness
The night children fly
I still hear them singing
The rhymes of goodbye2Embed
