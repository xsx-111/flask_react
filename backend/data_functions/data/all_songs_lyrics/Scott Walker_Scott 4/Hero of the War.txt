Hero of the War Lyrics
He's a hero of the war
All the neighborhood is talkin' 'bout your son
Mrs. Reiley, get his medals, hand them 'round to everyone
Show his guns to all the children in the street
It's too bad he can't shake hands or move his feet

He's a hero of the war
You can see his picture in the local news
Mrs. Reiley, seems the girl next door is nowhere to be found
Once you couldn't keep that whore from hangin' 'round
Never mind dear, you're with your mum once more

He's a hero of the war
Like his dad who gave his life for war before
It was tragic how you almost died of pain when he was born
With no husband there beside you through it all
Ring the bell if you get hungry, or you fall

You're a hero of the war
Why those teardrops on your cheek? It's so absurd
Feelin' empty, it's the emptiness of heroes, like your son
And what made him leave his mother for a gun
Driven forward, driven back and nothing more
He's a hero of the warEmbed
