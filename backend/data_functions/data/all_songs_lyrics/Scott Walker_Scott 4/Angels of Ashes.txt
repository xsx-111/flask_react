Angels of Ashes Lyrics
The Angels of Ashes
Will give back your passions
Again, and again
Their light shafts will reach
Through the darkness and touch you
My friend
They'll fly in a mind dance
And blind you with wings
Wrapped in flame
If you're down to an echo
They just might remember
Your name
In the unbroken darkness
Where emptiness empties
Alone
There's no starting or stopping
Where there is no right
Or no wrong
Well that's all right for some
Who can hang the absurd
On their wall
If your blind hands can't grope
Through these measureless waters
You'll fall
You've been following patterns
And fleeting sensations
Too long
And the fullness that fills up
The pulse of durations
Is gone
Let the great constellation
Of flickering ashes
Be heard
Let them burn with a fire
All it takes to confess
Is a word, just a word
I can recommend angels
I've watched as they've made a man
Strong, oh so strong
If your humbleness shows
Then I'm sure that they'll take you
Along
You can tell them who sent you
It might help to get you
Above
You can say that he laughed
And he walked like St. Francis
