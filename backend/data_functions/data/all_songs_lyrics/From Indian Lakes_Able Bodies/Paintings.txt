Paintings LyricsGod took all of my research
And ate it up
One by one
I havenâ€™t thought for a while
Who is my teacher?
I'll never learn anything
And who has been my lover?
She waits in the dark
To steal my love
To steal my love
Take these hands
What have I made them do?
What have you made them for?
Am I the only one left to sin at all?
I met a fallen creature
I picked him up
I licked his wounds
He bit my hand
I see the preacher
To fill my cup
Please fill my cup
I had to take away all of the paintings
Inside of my head
Oo whoa oh
Oo whoa oh
Oo whoa oh
Oh
I can only remember the first ones
And when the curtains were closed
I could still see your eyelashes beating
Oo whoa oh
Oo whoa oh
Oo whoa oh
Oh oh
I can still see your breath on the window
But I think I want it to go away
But I think I want it to go away
But I think I want it to go away
But I think I want it to go awayEmbed
