Anything LyricsI took all of my pride
And I shoved it in a box full of deadly sins and threw away the keys
And if I don't get out of bed
And try and see the sun
I will waste away and never dream again
Do we ever dream at all?
If I take what I have
Am I holding on to anything at all?
I have looked out to see
And seen that I don't see anything at all
If I take what I have am I holding on to anything at all
I have looked out to see and seen that i don't see anything at all
I could say that I tried and wait to see
If anyone would say that I'm a liar
They can cast me out alone
I am always without her
But where is she now?
I can only search for answers outside
Can my feet touch the sand
Or is everything turning to gold, ooh
If my legs are no more
Is there anyway to get back to you, oh
You, oh
You, ooh
Can I get back to you, oh
You, oh
You, ooh
Can I get back
Can I get back to you, oh
You, oh
You, ooh
Can I get back to you, oh
You oh
You ooh
Can I get back to you, oh
You oh
You ooh
Can I get back
I'm never coming back again
I'm never coming back again
I'm never coming back againEmbed
