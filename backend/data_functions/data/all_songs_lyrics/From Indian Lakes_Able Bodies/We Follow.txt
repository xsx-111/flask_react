We Follow LyricsI took my time I took down every light as if they were mine
I went straight home I looked up every flight as if I could go somewhere
And if I never have to look in your eyes it'd be fine
And if my only way to get out is to lose my mind
I'll leave it somewhere or I'll leave it anywhere for you to find
I took them down I broke down every thought as if they were mine
I went straight home I told my family to stay and I begged them not to follow
And if I never have to go back inside it'd be fine
And if my only way to get out is to lose my mind
I leave it somewhere or I'll leave it everywhere for you to find
And I guess my time is fading now
But I guess my time is against my own
And I guess my pride is fading now
But I guess my pride is against my own
And I guess my bride is running out
But I guess my pride is against my own
And I guess my time is fading now
If I get taken away without a choice or a say
If I can never see the sun out my window
If I get caught in my sleep if I can no longer speak
I'll say this quickly to you
I swear that I'll be, I swear that I'll be good
If I was taken away before I knew who I was
And I was given a name among your daughters and sons
To be love just to love I think I've heard that before
But I love them I do it so to be loved some more
I would've loved some more
I thought I knew but I don't
I thought I knew but I don't
I don't know anything at all
I thought I knew but I don't
I thought I knew but I don't
I don't know anything at all
I thought I knew but I don't
I thought I knew but I don't
I don't know anything at all
I thought I knew but I don't
I thought I knew but I don't
I don't know anything at allEmbed
