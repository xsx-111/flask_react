Below LyricsI wish I never touched the surface of the sun
Suddenly I'm burning brightly, burning too bright
Falling faster to the deep
And I'm anchored to the ocean floor below
Sleeping softly on and on
Between my daydreams and my nightmares of the sun
I'm anchored to the ocean floor (I'm anchored)
The words were there but I had never heard them
Not like this
I'm anchored to the ocean floor (I'm anchored)
I stood at the bottom
While I watched as lovers share first kiss
I remember it like it happened only moments ago
In November this will be the only thing I have left to hold
These creatures stare at me while passing on their way
Can I touch them now or when they sleep
Or will they try to stop me if I do
And I'm angry at the waves from far below
Can they see that I am trying
I am like them, reaching for anything else
My arms are reaching out
But I was always trying to cure what I could never cure before
And my love isn't over now
I can still feel the cold, I can see that I'm still alone
My arms are reaching out
But I was always trying to cure what I could never cure before
And my love isn't over now
I can still feel the cold, I can see that I'm still alone
I caught them swimming down below
I found them running
My friends were there but I had never seen them not like this
I caught them swimming down below
I felt their running
I lay at the bottom
While I wait for my lover's last kiss
I remember it like it happened only moments ago
In November this will be the only thing I have left to hold
I remember it like it happened only moments ago
In November this will be the only thing I have left to hold
To hold ontoEmbed
