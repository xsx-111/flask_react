Stay Outside Lyrics
We came from outside
And our boots were dirty
But we hurried to get in from the cold
Can we rest our eyes
If you tell us you’ve been looking for another able body
But not you
Or anyone that looks like you
But if you
Can find anyone that looks like me, oh

We hate the outside
And our chests were hurting
But we worried you’d see into our souls
Can we take our time
If you tell us you've been looking for somebody you can trust?
But not you
Or anyone that looks like you
But if you
Can find anyone that looks like me

I was allowed to push you around
To take you outside
To make you believe you’re nothing
Outside everyone looks the same without you
I would do anything to feel it again
Wait for the sound at your door
Stay outside
We’ve been hiding in our houses together
Screaming stay outside
Please, stay outside
You can see it in our bloodshot eyes
That we’ve been looking for someone
Anyone no, but not you
Or anyone that looks like you
Oh, if you could find anyone who looks like me

And I was allowed to push you around
To take you outside
And make you believe you’re nothing
Outside everyone looks the same without you
I would do anything to feel it again
Wait for the sound at your door
Stay outside
I would do anything to feel it again
Wait for the sound at your door
Stay outside
Stay outside
Stay outside
I saw your death, oh
But you won’t leave
I'll never be like them
I saw your death, oh
But you won’t leave
I'll never be like them
I saw your death, oh
But you won’t leave
I'll never be like them
I saw your death, oh
But you won’t leave
I'll never be like them
Stay outsideEmbed
