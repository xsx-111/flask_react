We Are Sick LyricsI wake up but I don’t go out
I sit and I sit and I lay back down
Will I be there for a long time?
And were my eyes only half way closed?
Did I see you in the doorway ?
Making sure I was sleeping so soft?
And keeping so still
And I never made a sound
But if you weren’t there to hold me down
Loving you was never hard to do
But I’m sick and they’re coming to get me soon
If they never bring me back to you
Will you tell me the truth?
Will you tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me the truth?
I walk around but I don’t breathe out
I stumble like a child and I fall to the ground
Will I be there for a long time?
Will I be there for a long time?
And did my thoughts only make me numb?
Did I pretend to be normal
Making sure I was keeping in line?
And keeping so still
And I never made a sound
But if you weren’t there to hold me down
Loving you was never hard to do
But I’m sick and they’re coming to get me soon
If they never bring me back to you
Will you tell me the truth?
Will you tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me the truth?
I was sleeping so soft
And keeping so still
And I never made a sound
But if you weren’t there to hold me down
I'm in line
And keeping so still
And I never made a sound
But if you weren't there to hold me down
Loving you was never hard to do
But I’m sick and they’re coming to get me soon
If they never bring me back to you
Will you tell me the truth?
Will you tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me?
Holding on was all that I could do
But I’m sick and there's nothing here left for you
And if you hear me from behind your pews
Will you tell me the truth?
Will you tell me the truth?
Would someone tell me the truth?Embed
