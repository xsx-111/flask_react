Breaking My Bones LyricsI'm always home not for myself
But it was about me
Every song has been about me
And I saw it all
And I fought to tell
As it if was about me
Every dream has been about me
And my love of making everyone my downfall
And if they serve me while it is only by my instruction
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
And if I find another bone to break
I hope it's only my own
'Cause I'll be breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
And if I find another bone to break
I hope it's only my own
I discard everything I know and everywhere I go
I kiss the lips of creatures that I barely know
And would never touch again
I feel like I find another shows
And walls around me grow
My fingertips are calloused but I'll never try
To scale these walls again
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
I'm sure you'll never call
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
Breaking my bones
