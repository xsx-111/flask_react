Your Son LyricsThey're running outside
And they're telling me
There's been an accident
Somebody do something quick
But what can I do when the deed has been done?
Am I so full of pride
That I took you for granted
And never said
"I could use someone like you"
Now I can't get it out of my head
Pictures of you crying
They make me cry too
Am I losing my mind when I'm telling you I was an accident
I've got to do something quick
And how can you stand there and call me your son?
Am I so full of pride when you tell me
That this wasn't worth it
And I'm only wasting my breath
But now I can't get it out of my head
Sounds of you trying to get my attention
But I stood, I stood up when you called
And I held out my hands when you told me to
And I saw you were hiding when I spoke your name
But if you won't wake up
I don't want to wake up
I don't want to wake up
I don't want to wake up at all
I don't want to wake up at allEmbed
