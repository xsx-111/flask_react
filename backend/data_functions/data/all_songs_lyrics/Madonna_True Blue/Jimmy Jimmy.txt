Jimmy Jimmy Lyrics
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)

Where you going, boy? I see your legs twitching
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
My Daddy says you just need a good licking
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
You say you gonna be the king of Las Vegas
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
You're just a boy who comes from bad places
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Do fools fall in love with fools like you?
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)

Why did you go and crash up your new car?
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
Is it because it didn't take you too far?
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
Why do you always have such a sad face?
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
Is it because you want to get out of this place?
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Do fools fall in love with fools like you?
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)

You're much too wild for this town
There's not much here that's going to hold you down
You got to lot of style it should take you far
Take you further than my back yard

Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la

Took my advice and got out of this place
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
This ol' town ain't never going to be the same
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
I really love you, I just couldn't tell you so
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
I should've said it then, now you'll never know
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Do fools fall in love?

You're much too wild for this town
There's not much here that's going to hold you down
You got to lot of style it should take you far
Take you further than my back yard

(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)
(Jimmy Jimmy, oh Jimmy Jimmy)

Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Do fools fall in love with fools like you?

Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Oop shoo boop oop oop sha la la la
Hey! I really love you, Jimmy
Hey! I really love you, Jimmy
Hey! I really love you, Jimmy
Hey! I really love you, love you, Jimmy
Sha la la la la
