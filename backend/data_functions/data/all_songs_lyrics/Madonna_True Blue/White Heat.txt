White Heat Lyrics
A copper... how do ya like that boys? A copper!
And we went for it... I went for it!
Treated him like a kid brother
And I was going to split fifty-fifty with a copper
They were there waiting to pin a medal on him
"C'mon, get up, get your hands up!"
Yeah, that's it, a nice gold medal for the copper
Only maybe he's going to get it sooner than he thinks!

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

You think you can have my love for free
But I've got news for you
That's not the way it's gonna be
So don't come hanging 'round my door
If you're not ready to give
You're not gonna get much more
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
C'mon, make my day

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Can you feel the rhythm of my mind?
Boy, I've got so much to give
But I don't want to waste my time
I can't let my heart put on a show
Till you surrender, baby, you've got to let it go

I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
C'mon, make my day
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

Drop your weapons
You'd better come clean
I've got you covered
I'll catch you when you fall to me
I'm not gonna hurt you
'Cause I'm not that kind
We're not going nowhere
Till you have a change of mind

You haven't got a chance, come out with your hands up
'Come out with your hands up', the man says
How do you like that, ma? Heh!
Here's my answer, you dirty...
I don't want to live out your fantasy
Love's not that easy
This time you're gonna, gonna have to play my way
C'mon, make my day

Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust
Get up, stand tall
Put your back up against the wall
'Cause my love is dangerous
This is a bust

(Get up, stand tall)
C'mon, baby, make my day
('Cause my love is dangerous)
Going to have to play my way (This is a bust)
(Get up, stand tall)
Put your back up against the wall ('Cause my love is dangerous)
This is a bust (Get up, stand tall)
Get up, get up, get up, get up ('Cause my love is dangerous)
This is a bust (Get up, stand tall)
I'm so good for you, baby here I come
I'm going to get to you before the day is done ('Cause my love is dangerous)
This is a bust (Get up, stand tall)
C'mon, baby, make my day ('Cause my love is dangerous)
Going to have to play my way (This is a bust)
(Get up, stand tall)
('Cause my love is dangerous)Embed
