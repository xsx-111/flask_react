Stranglehold Lyrics
Can I get you to give me a minute of your time?
Can I get you to slip me the answer?
Can I get you to show me a little of your mime?
You were always a very good dancer

I'd be happy to show you a bit of what I found
I'd be happy to share in its beauty
I'd be happy to lay low, inevitably bound
I would only be doing my duty

I wait, I wait
I can wait
I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car
I'll be waiting for you

Stranglehold, you know you've got one on me
I don't want to go without you
Stranglehold, you've got me where you want me
But I want to know more about you
I want to know more about you
Are you willing to wager a little of your life?
Are you willing to take such a gamble?
Are you ready to walk on the edge of the knife?
Then I think we can skip the preamble

I wait, I wait
I can wait
I can wait
I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car
I'll be waiting for you
I'll be waiting

Stranglehold, you know you've got one on me
I don't want to go without you
Stranglehold, you've got me where you want me
And I want to know more about you
I want to know more about you

I can wait
I can wait back in the bar
I can wait, I can wait
I can wait back in the car
I'll be waiting for youEmbed
