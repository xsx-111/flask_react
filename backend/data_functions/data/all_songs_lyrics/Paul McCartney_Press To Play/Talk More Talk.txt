Talk More Talk Lyrics
A master can highlight the phrases
Sleazy instruments, half talked, half baked ideas
Dad, you didn't say O.K.!
The window was open, outside was a spaceship
(A master can highlight the phrases)
It took off into the sky, leaving a trail of smoke behind it...

Short of the standard, was it the sun?
What was rehearsal? Conventional drum?
Not quite a hundred, less than a ton
Clearly the time came, the plan had begun

With talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
I'm happy to do it for you

Developed since earlier days at the school
Cheapest sensations were used as a rule
Outstanding to memory, major free flow
Bio-degradable, look out below for
Talk, more talk
Oh, I love to hear the gentle sound
Of conversation sprinkled around
A room where I can be at one with you for
Talk, more talk (Talk, talk, talk)
Chat, more chat (Chat, chat, chat)
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
I'm happy to do it for you
I'm happy to do it for you
I'm happy to do it for you
I'm happy to do it, I'm happy to do it
I'm happy to do it for you

Digital organ, finishing stretch
Instrumentation, analogue Gretsch
Not quite a thousand, lower than that
Possible bargain for listening at that

Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
I'm happy to do it for you
All you want is a handyman and all you want is quick service
Because I'm a house owner
I am a house owner
It may be worth something someday
I hear water going through the pipes
I don't actually like sitting down music
Music is ideas
Talk, chat
Talk, chat
Talk, chat
Talk, chat

Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Talk, more talk (More talk)
Chat, more chat (Chat, more chat)
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat
Words of a feather are worn in a hat
Talk, more talk
Chat, more chat

A master can tell (Talk, more talk)
Highlight the phrases his words to digress (Chat, more chat)
Grey flannel trousers
Grey flannel trousers (Words of a feather)
A blazer and grey flannel trousers (Are worn in a hat)
(Talk, more talk)Embed
