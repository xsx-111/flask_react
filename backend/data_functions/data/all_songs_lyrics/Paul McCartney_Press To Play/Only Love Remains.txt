Only Love Remains Lyrics
And if you take your love away from me
I'm only going to want it back
I'll probably pretend I didn't see
But knowing me, I'll want you back again, and again
Till the word has lost its meaning

And love is all that stays
Only love remains

If you should ever feel that something's wrong
I'm gonna wanna put it right
To bring a happy ending to our song
I'll carry on believing in a love
If your love was to trickle through my fingers
What would it leave me with?

Only love remains
(Only love, love remains)
Only love (remains)

Old enough and strong enough to stretch across the world
Taking the sand inside an oyster, changing it into a pearl
Making another magic transformation
Find the right boy for the right girl
When all our friends have gone and we're alone
There's nothing left to shout about
Together we'll explore the great unknown
I'd say we won't be going out tonight
Let tonight be the one that we remember

When love is all that stays
Only love remains
When love is all that stays (Only love, love remains)
Only love remains
Only love remains1Embed
