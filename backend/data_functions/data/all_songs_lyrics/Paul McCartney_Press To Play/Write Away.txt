Write Away Lyrics
You need love, write a letter, you need love write away
Get it down, you'll feel better, send it now, write away

Hey Cinderella, did you need that other fella?
On the wrong side of midnight your defences slipped away
You need attention, so I think it's worth a mention
That if I can deliver
Well there wouldn't be no heavy price to pay

You need love so write a letter, you need love, write away
If you need to feel better do it now, write away

Hey Margarita, I can't think of nothing sweeter
But the taste of your nectar seems to leave the boys astray
Don't you forget it, well you know you won't regret it
I've got the answer, you were looking at it long before today

You need love so write a letter, you need love write away
Get it down, you'll feel better, send it now, write away

You need love, love, love, write a letter
You need love, write away
If you need to feel better, do it now, now, now write awayEmbed
