However Absurd Lyrics
Ears twitch, like a dog
Breaking eggs in a dish
Do not mock me when I say
This is not a lie

It's a funny thing, half serious
With our hands on our ears
Living dreams with mouths ajar
Wide awake, we go to sleep

However absurd, however absurd... It may seem
However absurd, however absurd... It may seem

Something special between us
When we made love the game was over
I couldn't say the words
Words wouldn't get my feelings through
So I keep talking to you

However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
Custom made dinosaurs
Too late now, for a change
Everything is under the sun
But nothing is for keeps

However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... that may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd, however absurd,... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seem
However absurd, however absurd... it may seemEmbed
