Pretty Little Head Lyrics
Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen
Oh oh, oh oh

Hillmen come down from the lava
Forging across the mighty river flow
Always forever
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head

Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen
Oh oh, oh oh

Hillmen bring garments, spices
Carrying trinkets, silk and precious stones, oh oh
Exotic legends
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head

Hillmen, hillmen, hillmen, hillmen
Oh oh, oh oh
Hillmen are sworn to allegiance
Living a life of silent dignity, oh oh
For your protection
Only so you don't worry
Your pretty little head

Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
Ursa Major, Ursa Minor
The hillman
Living in the higher reaches
Ursa Major, Ursa MinorEmbed
