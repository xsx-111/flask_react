Tough On A Tightrope Lyrics
You don't feel right when I come on strong
Don't get it wrong
I wait all night but you won't be long
Don't get it wrong

Hear me right
I love you from the bottom of my heart
You make the answer bright
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you

And if you're tempted to tell a lie
Don't get it wrong
Well it breaks my heart when I see you cry
Don't get it wrong

Get it right
The brightest light that's shining in the skies
Is shining from your eyes
I love you in a way, that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you
I'm often accused of giving too little
It's got me confused, I'm split down the middle
Conflicting reviews of our life coming in
It's tough on a tightrope, yes it's tough on a tightrope

Hear me right
I love you from the bottom of my heart
You make the answer bright
You touch me in a way that no-one else could ever do
If you only love me, I'll love you

Tough on a tightropeEmbed
