Angry Lyrics
What the hell gives the right to tell me what to do with my
Life?
Especially when you made a mess of every chance you had to
Success
Look at you... Just look at you. I said I'm angry just
Looking at you

I'm sick and tired of sitting back listening to all of
Your clap-trap
If you could get me to take the rap I guarantee
You'd leave me with a backslap
Push me to the left, push me to the right try to take me
Out of the way
Even if you kick me off the edge of the world
You're still going to hear me say


Shouting down again Mahama
Shouting down again
I can't begin to tell you all the reasons
Why you're making me crazy
I've got so many answers
Like you're stupid, like you're crooked, like you're lazy
Hit me with your left, hit me with your right
Hit me from the top to the toe
Even when you chew me up and spit me out
I'm still going to want to knowEmbed
