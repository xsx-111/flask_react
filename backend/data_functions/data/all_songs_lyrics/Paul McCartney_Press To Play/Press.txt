Press Lyrics
Say one, say two, say three

Darling, I love you very, very, very much
And I really am relying on your touch
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we could hit upon a word
Something that the others haven't heard
When you want me to love you
Just tell me to press

Right there, that's it, yes
Oh when you feel the stress, don't just stand there
Tell me to press

You can give me what I want I must confess
My body needs attention, my mind is in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this
Never like this, it was never like this
Ever like this, say was it ever like this?
Oklahoma was never like this
Oh it was never like this
Darling, I know it really wouldn't be a crime
If I say I want to love you all the time
But with all these people listening in
I don't know where I ought to begin
Maybe we should have a secret code
Before we both get ready to explode
When you want me to love you
Well just tell me to press
(Tell me to press)

Right there, that's it, yes
When you feel the stress
Don't just stand there
Tell me to press
(Tell me to press)

My minds's in a mess
Oklahoma was never like this

Tell me to press (Never like this)
Right there (Never like this)
(Never like this)
When you feel the stress (Oh oh oh)
Oh come on now (Never like this)
Will you tell me to press (Never like this)
Will you tell me to press (Never like this)
Right there (Never like this)
That's it yes (Oh oh oh)
Yeah yeah (Never like this)
Tell me to press
Well just tell me to press
Whoa been so good
Like you knew that it should (Never like this)
Oh you tell me to press (Never like this)
(Never like this)
A little bit higher (Never like this)
Woo that's right (Oh oh oh)
Whoa you feel the stress (Never like this)
Tell me to press (Never like this)
A little bit harder (Never like this)
A little bit higher (Never like this)
A little bit farther (Never like this)
Go on now (Never like this)
Will you tell me to press (Never like this)
Right there (Never like this)
That's right (Never like this)
That's right (Oh oh oh)
Well you feel the stressEmbed
