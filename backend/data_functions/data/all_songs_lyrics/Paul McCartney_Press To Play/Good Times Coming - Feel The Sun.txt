Good Times Coming / Feel The Sun Lyrics
Good times coming
Good times coming in
Good times coming
Good times coming in
Good times coming
Good times coming in
Good times coming
Good times coming in

I was thinking about that summer so long ago
Pack up your bags and yell, "Geronimo!"
That was a golden summer, wasn't it hot?
We laughed a lot that summer, laughed a lot

Laughing at the good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in

There was something about the weather, what can I say?
Nothing like any other holiday
That was a silly season, was it the best?
We didn't need a reason, just a rest
Happy at the good times coming
Happy at the good times coming in
Good times coming, happy at the good times coming in


I'm loving you, I'm loving you, I'm loving you now
I'm loving you, I'm loving you, I'm loving you now

There was a golden summer before the war
They laughed a lot that summer, la de dah

Laughing at the good times coming
Laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming, laughing at the good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in
Good times coming, good times coming in

Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
All the beauty, all the pain
Will it ever be the same again?
If you love me, show me now
It's the only way that we know how

Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on you
Feel the sun shine in, shine in, shine in
Feel the sun shining in on youEmbed
