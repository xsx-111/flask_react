Strange Thing Lyrics
Strange thing happened one day
Someone thought they heard someone say
"Gotta face new directions
Get new expectations"
Strange thing happened one day
Someone thought they heard someone say
"Get rid of complications
Free yourself from frustrations"
Gotta control depression
Gotta control this depression

Strange thing happened today
I thought I heard somebody say
"Gotta face new directions
Get new expectations"
Strange thing happened today
I thought I heard somebody say
"Get rid of complications
Free yourself from frustrations"
Gotta control depression
Gotta control this depression

Strange things will happen one day
You think you hear somebody say
"Gotta face new directions
Get new expectations"
Strange thing will happen one day
You think you hear somebody say
"Get rid of complications
Free yourself from frustrations"
Gotta control depression
Gotta, gotta control this depressionEmbed
