Lipstick Lyrics
When you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
When you miss me
In your dreams, does your lover have my face?

Ah, when you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
Ah, when you miss me
In your dreams, does your lover have my face?

It's the morning
And the mourning, is it dawning on me too?
I'd no warning
Just a condolence card to tell me that we're through

Ah, it's the morning
And the mourning, is it dawning on me too?
Ah, I had no warning
Just a condolence card to tell me that we're through

When you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
When you miss me
In your dreams, does my lover have your face?

Ah, when you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face?
Ah, when you miss me
In your dreams, does your lover have my face?Embed
