Just Lust Lyrics
There's bed in your eyes, but there's nothing there to trust
Just lust, just lust
You're telling me lies when you say that it's a must
Just lust, just lust

You shattered all my dreams and my head's about to bust
Is it all real? That's how it seems, but it all comes down to dust

Your hands feel a need, I don't know if it's too much
Just lust, just lust
It seems it's only greed to taste all that you touch
Just lust, just lust

You shattered all my dreams and my head's about to bust
Is it all real? That's how it seems, but it all comes down to dust

You're driven to possess, it hurts, it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing matters less, then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust
I was slow to catch on, and that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion, then emotion is a curse


I was slow to catch on, and that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion, then emotion is a curse

You're driven to possess, it hurts, it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing mattered less, then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust

It's my imagination to see things as I choose
Love has a reputation that it can only loseEmbed
