What Do I Get? Lyrics
I just want a lover like any other, what do I get?
I only want a friend who will stay to the end, what do I get?

What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?

I'm in distress, I need a caress, what do I get?
I'm not on the make, I just need a break, what do I get?

What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?

I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you, things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead

What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get? Ah

I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you, things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead

What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?

I just want a lover like any other, what do I get?
I only want a friend who will love to the end, what do I get?

What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?
What do I get? O-o-oh, what do I get?

Well, let me tell you now (What do I get? What do I get?)
(What do I get?) I get no love
(What do I get?) I get no sleep at nights
(What do I get?) I get nothing that's nice
(What do I get?) I get nothing at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
'Cause I don't get you3Embed
