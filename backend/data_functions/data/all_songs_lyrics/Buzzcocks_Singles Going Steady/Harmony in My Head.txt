Harmony in My Head Lyrics
Whenever I'm in doubt about things I do
I listen to the high street wailing sounds in a queue
I go out for my walking, sailing social news
Don't let it get me down, I'm long in the tooth
When I'm out in the open, clattering shoppers around
The neon signs that take your eyes to town
Your thoughts are chosen, your world is advertising now
And extravagance matters to worshipers of the pound

But it's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head

The tortured faces, expressions out aloud
And life's little ironies seem so obvious now
Your cashed in checks have placed the payments down
And there's a line of buses, all wait to take you out

But it's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head

It's a...
It's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head
Whenever I'm in doubt about things I do
I listen to the high street wailing sounds in a queue
I go out for my walking, sailing social news
Don't let it get me down, I'm long in the tooth

'cause it's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head, it's a harmony in my headEmbed
