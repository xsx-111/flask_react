Noise Annoys Lyrics
Pretty girls, pretty boys
Have you ever heard your mommy say "Noise annoys"?
Pretty girls, pretty boys
Have you ever heard your mommy shout "Noise annoys"? Go


Pretty girls, pretty boys
Have you ever heard your mommy scream "Noise annoys"?
Pretty girls, pretty boys
Have you ever heard your mommy scream "Noise annoys"?


Pretty girls, pretty boys
Have you ever heard your mommy say "Noise annoys"?Embed
