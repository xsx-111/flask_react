Are Everything Lyrics
Your looks, my charm, my own imagination
My loves, your hates, your own infatuation
Are everything
Are everything

My hopes, your fears, your only limitation
Your thoughts, my schemes, my own evaluation
Are everything
Are everything

My looks, your charm, your own imagination
Your loves, my hates, my own infatuation
Are everything
Are everything

Your hopes, my fears, my only limitation
My thoughts, your schemes, your own evaluation
Are everything
Are everything

Your looks, my charm, my own imagination
My loves, your hates, your own infatuation
Are everything
Are everything
My hopes, your fears, your only limitation
Your thoughts, my schemes, my own evaluation
Are everything
Are everything
My looks, your charm, your own imagination
Your loves, my hates, my own infatuation
Are everything
Are everything
Your hopes, my fears, my only limitation
My thoughts, your schemes, your own evaluation
Are everything
Are everythingEmbed
