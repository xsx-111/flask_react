Promises Lyrics
Ah, loving you is easy, you are on my side
We played the game strictly to our rules
We led the field, a love affair
Which made all other lovers fools

Oh, how can you ever let me down? (Down)
How can you ever let me down? (Down)
How can you ever let me down?
These promises are made for us (A-ah, o-o-oh, oh-oh)

We promised that we'd always have time for each other
Whenever I needed, you'd be there
We promised to be true, there'd be no other
We promised that forever, we would care

Oh, how can you ever let me down? (Down)
How can you ever let me down? (Down)
How can you ever let me down?
These promises are made for us (A-ah, o-o-oh, oh-oh)

We had to change, oh, but you stayed the same
You wouldn't change, oh, what a shame
'cause loving you's not easy, you're not on my side
We play a game with two sets of rules
We lead the field in a love affair
Oh, strictly meant for fools

Oh, why did you ever let me down? (Down)
Why did you ever let me down? (Down)
Why did you ever let me down?
Those promises were made for us (A-Ah, o-o-oh, o-oh)

You never have any time for me
Whenever I need you, you're not there
You've never been true and it's plain to see
The fact is, you never really cared

Oh, why did you ever let me down? (Down)
Why did you ever let me down? (Down)
Why did you ever let me down?
Those promises, we made for us (A-Ah, o-o-oh, o-oh)Embed
