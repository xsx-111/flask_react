Orgasm Addict Lyrics
Well you tried it just for once, find it alright for kicks
But now you found out that it's a habit that sticks

And you're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Sneakin' in the back door with dirty magazines
And your mother wants to know "What are those stains on your jeans?"

And you're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah
Ah, ah, ah

You get in a heat, you get in a sulk
But you still keep on beatin' your meat to pulp

And you're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict
You're a kid Casanova, you're a no-Joseph
It's a labour of love, fucking yourself to death

Orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Uh-huh, uh-huh, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

You're makin' out with school kids
Winos and heads of state
You've even made it with the lady
Who puts the little plastic robins on the Christmas cakes
Butcher's assistants and bellhops
You've had 'em all, here and there
Children of God and their joy strings
International women with no body hair

Ooh, so well, you're asking in an alley and your voice ain't steady
The sex mechanic's rough, you're more than ready
You're an orgasm addict
You're an orgasm addict

Johnnie want fuckie, all ways, and always
He's got the energy, he will amaze

He's an orgasm addict
He's an orgasm addict

He's always at it
He's always at it
And he's an orgasm addict
He's an orgasm addict2Embed
