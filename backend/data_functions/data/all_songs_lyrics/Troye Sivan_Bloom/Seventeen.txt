Seventeen Lyrics
I got these beliefs that I think you wanna break
Got something here to lose that I think you wanna take from me
You say that I'm asleep, but I wanna be awake
Got something here to lose that I know you wanna take

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

You should know I'm green, but I'll find my way around
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about
I'm taking in the sights and measuring the sounds
Heard the whispers, now let's see what all the talk's about

And he said age is just a number, just like any other
We can do whatever, do whatever you want
Boy becomes a man now
Can't tell a man to slow down
He'll just do whatever, do whatever he wants
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen

I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen
I went out looking for love when I was seventeen
Maybe a little too young, but it was real to me
And in the heat of the night, saw things I'd never seen
No-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, seventeen

Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen
Seventeen, seventeen, seventeen25Embed
