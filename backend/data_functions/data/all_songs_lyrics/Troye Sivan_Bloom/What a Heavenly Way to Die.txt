What a Heavenly Way to Die Lyrics
Tell each other you're the one
While we're laying by the poolside, poolside
Getting tired from the sun
Fading in and out of long nights, long nights
There's no limit to your love
East or west we got the north lights, north lights
Oh oh, take in it all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

When our prime has come and gone
And our youth is all but melted, melted
We can listen to this song
So we don't have to accept it, accept it
Just as long as you'll be home
In the world we've manifested-fested
Oh oh, just take in it all
What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you

Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all
Just take it in all, all, all, all

What a heavenly way to die
What a time to be alive
Because forever is in your eyes
But forever ain't half the time

I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you
I wanna spend with you, you
I wanna be with you, you14Embed
