Red Alibi Lyrics
In the back of my mind a voice speaks
Spells out the master plan
Now I know
She swings with the ease of a hammer
From the truth down through the past
And I know

What's right, went wrong
From when it started
To this the finish
I'll try to find
A place in your new life...

To set the fire
And cover your tracks
Time will tell
The past laughs last
Set the fire
And cover your tracks
Time will tell
The past laughs...

Syllables will try and judge you
Will pierce this anecdote
Now I know
Your plea is a case of reason
This deletes your alibi
And I know
Once tried, left wrong
From where it started
To here the finish
I'll try to find
The place in your new life

In your life
In your life
The traps have been set
And this will change everything
Everything
And the traps have been set
And this will change everything
Everything

Set the fire
And cover your tracks
Time will tell
The past laughs last
Set the fire
And cover your tracks
Time will tell
The past laughs lastEmbed
