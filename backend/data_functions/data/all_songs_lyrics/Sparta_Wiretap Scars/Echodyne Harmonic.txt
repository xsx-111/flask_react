Echodyne Harmonic Lyrics
They say it takes a ring of gold
To fix the outer shell
So hold on until they return
Enslave the native tongue
To mine their freedom out
So hold on and don't give in

Our world is only what we're told
How do we know?

Life spans 1000 years have gone
But just a minute above
So hold on until they return
Sheltered thoughts and fears
If they claim what's theirs
So hold on and don't give in

Our world is only what we're told
How do we know?
Our world is only what we're told
How do we know?
So hold on
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
So hold on
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
So hold on
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
So hold on
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
(Fading out, now we're fading out)
So hold onEmbed
