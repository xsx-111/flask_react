Cataract Lyrics
Locked up in the distance
In the faltering fervor
As the contrails pass
You spoke your mind
Old photos distort you
And you're frowning a smile
As the misery
Makes you act blind

Stand down, fall apart
And the trouble starts
Yeah, the trouble starts over again
Stand down, fall apart
And the trouble starts
Yeah, the trouble starts over again

In the scenes of this casting
Where a tragedy follows
As the contrails pass
This vacant sky

Stand down, fall apart
And the trouble starts
Yeah, the trouble starts over again
Disappear, Orlean
Away from tarnished golden arsenals
You're laying down, again
Disappear, Orlean
Because your swansong fell on fallen heads
You're laying down again

Locked up in the distance
In the faltering fervor
As the contrails pass
You spoke your mind
In the scenes of this casting
Where a tragedy follows
As the contrails pass
This vacant sky

Disappear, Orlean
Away from tarnished golden arsenals
You're laying down, again
Disappear, Orlean
Because your swansong fell on fallen heads
You're laying down again
Time
Goes
No
Where
Time
Goes
No
Where

(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
As the contrails pass this vacant sky
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
As the contrails pass this vacant sky
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
As the contrails pass this vacant sky
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)
As the contrails pass this vacant sky
(Away, away, away, away)
(Away, away, away, away)Embed
