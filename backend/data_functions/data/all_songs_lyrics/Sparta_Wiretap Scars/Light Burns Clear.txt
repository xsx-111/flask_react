Light Burns Clear Lyrics
Looking back with perfect symmetry
Mistakes were you, mistakes were me
Photos fall through the glass
Paint it black to hide your face
Static screams deaf the masses
But what do they have to say?

Fan the flames to the landslide
Crown yourself in the wake
We play this disaster
Fanfare, fanfare, liar

Concrete eyes and flash bang imagery
You're bored with home, you're bored with me
Rings were thrown out the window
Rolled down empty streets
Walls will talk for the widow
But what does she have to say?

Fan the flames to the landslide
Crown yourself in the wake
We play this disaster
Fanfare, fanfare, liar
It comes, pulls the stakes up
You hold back, roll back and slid the ring off your finger
Throw it as hard as you could at a wall
Your eyes blink too many times before they tear
Run away from it before it comes too real to hide from
Loneliness and boredom start turning into anger and then hate
And melodies begin to escape
You hold back, roll back and give in
And it starts all over, and then

Fan the flames to the landslide
Crown yourself in the wake
We play this disaster
Fanfare, fanfare, liar

Edges dulled at the end of the day
Edges dulled at the end of the day
Edges dulled at the end of the dayEmbed
