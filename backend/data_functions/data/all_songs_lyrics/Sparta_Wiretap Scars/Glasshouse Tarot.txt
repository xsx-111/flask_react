Glasshouse Tarot Lyrics
I don't snap on like you want me to
Because it still hurts my eyes when they turn red
I sit down, rode all the way next to my heart
It beats to the time too close to your truth

Yeah the tarot broke
Open the glasshouse
So this might just be
The saddest day I've ever known
Yeah the tarot broke
Open the glasshouse
So this might just be
The saddest day I've ever known

My arms are tied behind disease
I'll probably be gone the next time too
In a corner in a shadow I sit self-obsessed
Too busy, too important to say goodbye

Yeah the tarot broke
Open the glasshouse
So this might just be
The saddest day I've ever known
Yeah the tarot broke
Open the glasshouse
So this might just be
The saddest day I've ever known
This regret, it kills
You'll never forget
Take the time, this time
To say your goodbyes
This regret, it kills
You'll never forget
Never forgetEmbed
