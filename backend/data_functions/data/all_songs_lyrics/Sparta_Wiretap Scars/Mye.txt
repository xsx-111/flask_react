Mye Lyrics
I'll qualify this circumstance
Broadcast, renew this chance
Pin hope on this promise
Graduate to a settled score
Projects through mansion doors
Stand up, dust yourself off
It's troubled now by swelling tide
Beached hope and sandstone lies
You're dazed in the moment

This time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined
This time, this time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined

You know I'll sit at the bottom space
Trace lines in the vacant face
It's all about these changes
Small flat in a smaller town
Steal hope to pass around
You're caught in the memory
This time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined
This time, this time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined

I'll qualify this circumstance
Broadcast, renew this chance
Pin hope on this promise
Graduate to a settled score
Projects through mansion doors
You're dazed in the moment

This time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined
This time, this time I'll get it right
You can't defend it
It's predetermined

These shores aren't out of reach
These shores aren't out of reach
These shores aren't out of reach
These shores, these shores
These shores, these shoresEmbed
