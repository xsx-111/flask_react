Cut Your Ribbon Lyrics
Wake up
Can you hear me?
You're so clever
Did you find me
In the back room
In your closet
In your suitcase?
There's no running
I will find you
Like a glacier
Cuts the seabed
Leaving canyons
In your cheekbones
Passing through you
In the shadows
Scenes undo you

Cut your ribbon
As it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night
As it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night
Face it
Can you hear it?
Violation
You'll remember
It's all harmless
Incidental
Disengaging
These thoughts break you
Conscious, vicious
It has found you
Monovision
Synapse fails you
Frequent syndrome
Stings and burns through
Monovision
Then dilutes you

Cut your ribbon
As it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night
As it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at night
Can you escape these motives?
Can you escape these motives?
Can you escape these motives?

Cut your ribbon
As it follows you
Everything, everything
How can you sleep at night
As it falls apart
Anything, anything
How can you sleep at nightEmbed
