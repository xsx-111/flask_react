Air Lyrics
Apathy falls in the ocean
At least we went down fighting
At the bottom of the ocean
The scenery can fail calm
Up till now been riding fine, yeah
But the curving walls leave me behind, yeah

Do you remember the days?
Did you forget those days?
What would the oddsmaker say?
Would the oddsmaker say?

We're drinking on jet streams
Through to
Ideas won't happen
Laid out on benches
Through to
Sink for this reason

If you see through, these motives
You'll please report your progress
To the captain, our captain
So he can mark the atlas
Never considered this a prize, yeah
But the curving walls leave me behind, yeah
We're drinking on jet streams
Through to
Ideas won't happen
Laid out on benches
Through to
Sink for this reason

Do you remember the days?
Did you forget those days?
What would the oddsmaker say?
Would the oddsmaker say?

We're drinking on jet streams
Through to
Ideas won't happen
Laid out on benches
Through to
Sink for this reasonEmbed
