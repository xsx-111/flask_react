Sans Cosm Lyrics
Arms open but I've just broken in
Through a crack in a long division
Can I make a decision
Without confusion?
Seemed something
But became nothing at all
What happened to the old and stable
When the powers that be fail
And heads will roll?

Someday low notes fade away and go
True and stale, true and stale
Somewhere words don't crater in at all

Currents shifting and green lights on my right
These miles hold an infinite time
Long enough to remember
And regret precursors
Tide turning
Foundations shaking away
It's a matter of time and distance
And tested opinions that force a change
Someday low notes fade away and go
True and stale, true and stale
Somewhere words don't crater in at all
Someday low notes fade away and go
True and stale, true and stale
Somewhere words don't crater in at all

Do you owe this?
I am what you thought you were
Can you pay it?
What you've indebted
You're back and forth
You're the lottery
Do you owe this?
I am what you thought you were
Can you pay it?
What you've indebted
You're back and forth
You're the lottery

Someday low notes fade away and go
True and stale, true and stale
Somewhere words don't crater in at all
Someday low notes fade away and go
True and stale, true and stale
Somewhere words don't crater in at allEmbed
