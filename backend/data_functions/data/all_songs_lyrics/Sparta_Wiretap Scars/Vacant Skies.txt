Vacant Skies Lyrics
Crumbling around the freefall
This missing air will forever make
Your nerves crawl
Crumbling
We will assume the worst

Encapsulation, fists clenched and falling
Mistakes make it easy

Harmonic turbulence shakes
Ties red booths to magazines
Stand and clear
Harmonic
We will assume the worst

Encapsulation, fists clenched and falling
Mistakes make it easy
Encapsulation, eyes dry and vacant
Mistakes make it easy

Say no more
Say no more
Say, say, no more
Encapsulation, fists clenched and falling
Mistakes make it easy
Encapsulation, eyes dry and vacant
Mistakes make it easy

We recall, it's all meaningless
Green eyes blur, give in easier
And make you blind
We recall, we recall
