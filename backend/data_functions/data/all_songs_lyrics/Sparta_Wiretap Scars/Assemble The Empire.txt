Assemble The Empire Lyrics
Don't make this fake
Last second of life
Faux obsolete
Assemble the empire

Following fell on hard times
This one won't count
We won't count it at all
Slow down
These factions cast a failure of crowns
Benevolence forces itself
Fallen from state
Into the hands of the law
Slow down
These factions cast a failure on crowns

Don't make this fake
Last second of life
Faux obsolete
Assemble the empire

Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow downEmbed
