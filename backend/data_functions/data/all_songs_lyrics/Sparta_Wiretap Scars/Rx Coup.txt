Rx Coup Lyrics
At the bottom you set it down
From the top I counted you out
Cascading, the end draws near
These rail lines, drown in fear

In the dark days, hunger's free
Illumination, end with greed
Drag your feet, and strung along
Fight back, until you're gone

This tunnel vision breaks my mind
Dark days leave this world behind
Humiliation takes its toll
Proud hope stands tall

At the bottom you set it down
From the top I counted you out
Drag your feet, and strung along
Fight back, until you're gone

This tunnel vision breaks my mind
Dark days leave this world behind
Humiliation takes its toll
Proud hope stands tall
Fight back, until you're gone
Fight back, until you're gone

This tunnel vision breaks my mind
Dark days leave this world behind
Humiliation takes its toll
Proud hope stands tallEmbed
