New Map LyricsThere's a hole in your heart, begging for adventure
Play yourself a new track, set traps for the future
On your own
Can you do it?
The unknown
Can you face it?
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
Rules of conformity, heavy clouds of reason
They're hiding the beauty of your free distortions
On your own
Can you do it?
The unknown
Can you face it?
With your soul, now you see it
The landscape is infinite
Shifting desire
Shifting desire
