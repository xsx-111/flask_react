Apparition Lyrics
She says she's gonna come over tonight
Look like a ghost sound like a whisper shivering down my spine
I'm just a traveling soul, say you'd never leave me alone
Tell me you need me so tonight

She come creeping up slow, I got no place, no place to go
But now I'm feeling like I fell for you, oh baby, no don't you sell it
Story's always different, no matter who's telling it
Now I'm feeling like I fell for you
(Apparition, apparition, apparition)

I know she lurking the streets tonight
Sound like silence, slink like a drifter
'Tween the darkness and the flickering light
She's just a wandering soul, oh I just can't let it go
Tell me it isn't so tonight

She come creeping up slow, I got no place, no place to go
But now I'm feeling like I fell for you, oh baby, no don't you sell it
Story's always different, no matter who's telling it
Now I'm feeling like I fell for you
(Apparition, apparition, apparition)
Oh, I swear I heard something sneaking through my corridor
Memories float like specters, keeps on haunting me evermore

She come creeping up slow, I got no place, no place to go
But now I'm feeling like I fell for you, oh baby, no don't you sell it
Story's always different, no matter who's telling it
Now I'm feeling like I fell for you, you, you, you, you
(Apparition, apparition, apparition)Embed
