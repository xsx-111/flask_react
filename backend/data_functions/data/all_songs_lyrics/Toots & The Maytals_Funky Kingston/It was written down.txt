It was written down LyricsIt was written down there by those prophets
It was written down there on the ground
It was written down there by those prophets
It was written down there on the ground
One love, one heart
One eternity, one joy
Come sing a song with me and do your harmony
Go sing a song with me and do your harmony
My father sent me to warn the nation
It was written down there from creation
My father sent me to warn the nation
It was written down there from creation
One love, one heart
One eternity, one joy
Come sing a song with me and do your harmony
Go sing a song with me and do your harmonyEmbed
