Funky Kingston Lyrics
Everybody, give it to me! (Uh!)
Yeah-he-he-hey-he-he-he-ye-yeah (Oh, yeah)
Yeah-he-he-hey-he-he-he-ye-yeah

I want you to believe every word I say
Want you to believe everything I do
I said, music is what I've got to give
And I've got to find some way to make it
Music is what I've got, baby
I want you to come on and shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, baby (Oh, yeah; yeah!)

Na-na-na (Oh, yeah!)
Na-na-na

Funky-funky-funky
A funky Kingston, is what I've got for you, yeah (Oh, yeah)
A funky Kingston, now, yeah (Is what I've got for you)
A funky Kingston (Uh!)

Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Lemme hear your funky guitar (Eh-eh, eh-eh)
Yeah, reggae (I do it)
Hear the piano (Stick it to me, yeah, stick to me)
Na-na-na (Oh, yeah, alright, oh, yeah)
Na-na-na (Watch me now; you watch me now)

Playing from east to west, now
I just play from north to south, yeah
All over America
People keep on asking me for

Funky Kingston
But I ain't got none
Someone take it away from me
You got to go on and fetch one
Funky Kingston, now
They keep on asking me
But I ain't got none
Somebody take it from me
You got to go on and fetch one
Funky Kingston, now
Funky Kingston, now
Funky Kingston, now (Order!)

Na-na-na
Na-na-na

East to west, north, north
From north to south, now
Over America
People keep on asking me for

Funky Kingston, now
But I ain't got none
Somebody take it away from me
You got to go on and fetch your funk
I ain't got none
Funky Kingston, now
Somebody take it away from me
You got to go on and buy the same one
Funky Kingston, now
