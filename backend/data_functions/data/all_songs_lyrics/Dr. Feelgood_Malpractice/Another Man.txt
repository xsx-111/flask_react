Another Man LyricsI'm an easy going kind of man
I really am
But I can tell there's trouble close at hand
You know I can
Heard your name in town
You've been walking round
Acting like a clown
Then I'll understand
That you've got
Another man (8 x)
You can stay out anytime at night
Do what you like
Even come spoiling for a fight
But thats alright
I keep my cool before
But I just can't take no more
When I hear my best friend talking behind his hand
All about
Another man (8 x)
- Guitar Break -
I know you can rock me on the floor
Til I get sore
But just one of those little smiles of yours
And I want more
You got plenty of the things your daddy loves
But there's one thing that you've got that I just won't stand
I'm talking about
Another man (7 x)
Another man
Another man
