Back in the Night LyricsBack in the night I lay down by your fireside
Back in the night you shook me like a landslide
I nearly missed the early shift
Dreamin' in the morning 'bout the things we did
Back in the night
Back in the night
Back in the night
Back in the night
Beneath your love light
I woke up on the floor, I asked you for some breakfast
You shoved me out the door, I jumped on to the late bus
I got to smile, I like your style
You put me out this morning but you know that I'll be
Back in the night
Back in the night
Back in the night
Back in the night
Beneath your love light
The days go by so slow, I feel just like I'm dying
Stop work whistle blow and then I start reviving
Across your yard, beneath the stars
I made it thru another day and here we are
Back in the night
Back in the night
Back in the night
Back in the night
Beneath your love lightEmbed
