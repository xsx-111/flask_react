I Can Tell LyricsI can tell 'cos it's plain to see
I can tell the way you look at me
The way that you smile when you hold my hand
I know pretty baby 'cos I understand
I can tell
I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
Gonna tell your mama
Gonna tell your papa too
Just what more can a good man do
You been running round with Joey Brown
I know pretty baby that you put me down
I can tell
I can tell
I know you don't love me no more
I called you up on the phone
Strange voice tells me you're not at home
Your mama told me you know you can wait
When you show up you know your draggin' real late
I can tell
I can tell
I know you don't love me no moreEmbed
