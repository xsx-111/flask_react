Watch Your Step LyricsYou better take it easy baby
Before you go away
You keep me worried
And you get yours one day
Watch your step (4 x)
Keep your eyes wide open
Cos you'll be hurtin' down inside
You better leave me all your money
Before you go away
Don't think I'm falling for it
All I gotta say is
Watch your step (4 x)
Cos when you take your love from me
Be full of misery
I'm gonna miss your loving every night
Get myself together
I'm gonna be alright
Watch your step (4 x)
When you sneak up by my side
I'm gonna say 'Go somewhere and hide'Embed
