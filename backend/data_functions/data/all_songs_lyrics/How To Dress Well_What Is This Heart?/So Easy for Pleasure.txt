So Easy for Pleasure LyricsSo easy for pleasure
To recast itself as pain
To return from whence it came
Came, yeah, yeah
Say, no warning, no measure
Just attack and total shame
Just a faceless lack of grace
But I was told there was a place in bodies 
That was captured in the way
That wouldn't turn from pink to grey
But I've seen their faces and their change
Lifted out of this sweet embrace
Seen their beauty cast away
So easy for pleasure
To recast itself as pain
To return from whence it came
Yeah, no fullness, no measure
Just a lack and total shame
Just a faceless mask of hate
But I, I wanna hold you in my hands
I wanna feel your different shapes
I wanna see the world as pain
But I, I think about this feeling
And I see it cast away
See it turn from pink to the grey1Embed
