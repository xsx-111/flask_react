What You Wanted LyricsYou said: “I know that I want it & I live like I love it, but when I’m sad, that changes
When I want some peace or truth I’m constantly assailed, assailed”
“And I’m wanting wanting waiting waiting wanting: love deferred” –
But I won’t stay: “No”

You never say just what you wanted when you want it
And I never talked to you when I was sore about it
Ohhhh I don’t wanna wait until the dawn and tell myself I’ll learn by morning
But I never listened to myself and never said one word about it
Change has come and changed just how I look upon myself
Ya you could have lived happily and gone to somewhere else, someone else, somewhere else
But who would stand for me if, if you weren’t standing there?
Say “no”, say “it won’t ever be, won’t ever be that way”!
But talking how it (could be) different’s more that words it’s more like willing for the time to steal away (whoa whoa)
Now I see your face in everything and make a song, make a song sing it far away

You never say just what you wanted when you want it
And I never talked to you when I was sore about it
Ohhhh I don’t wanna wait until the dawn and tell myself I’ll learn by morning
But I never listened to myself and never said one word about it
Said I know that I want it, but the soon as I got it
It'll change, I hate it
Everytime I see some proof, oh God, I want that one to beg
I want that chase, want that bad
And I know it's lame, this basic job, I'm so obsessed
Yeah, I know it's so absurd
But when I love it, I love it
All I want is that loving, girl
But I won't stay
No, But I Won't stay
No, but I won't stay
No, you can never say just what you want when I want you

You never say just what you wanted when you want it
And I never talked to you when I was sore about it
Ohhhh I don’t wanna wait until the dawn and tell myself I’ll learn by morning, yeah
But I never listened to myself and never said one word about it, hey yeah2Embed
