Face Again LyricsGo in daylight, they don’t have to hide truth
And you knew this before I have told you
And when they pass by they don’t ask for nothing
You say your skin breaks like glass when they touch it
No, there’s no way in, there's no way in, there's no way
No, we weren’t meant to hunger in the night
(They’re coming straight for me)
No, we were made to wonder about what is right
(They're coming straight for me)
Put the hand in your mouth they hate you when you bite
(They’re coming straight for me)
I look into the future and see just so little light
(They’re coming straight for me)
Look me in my face again and tell me what you wanna see
I don’t think you know what’s best for me
I don’t think you know what’s best for me
Just kiss me on my face again
And tell me what love’s supposed to be
No, I don’t think you know what’s best for me
No, I don’t even know what’s best for me
Yeah, your pain babe ain’t got shit to buy you
And so if they could, they’d leave us out to die too
And when they pass by, they don’t ask for nothing
We live on brittle bones, we weren’t meant to fly boo
But no, there’s no way in, there's no way in, there's no way
No, we weren't meant to hunger in the night
(They’re coming straight for me)
We were made to wonder about what is right
(They're coming straight for me)
Put the hand in your mouth they hate you when you bite
(They're coming straight for me)
I look into the future and see just so little light
(They’re coming straight for me)
You know I want an answer, but I forgot the question
You know I wanna change, change, change, whoa whoa
When thought becomes a cancer, it's supposed to be a blessing
You know it’s time to change, change, change, whoa whoa
When lives hang in the balance, it’s bleak I know you feel it
You know we gotta change, change, change, whoa whoa
I know I want an answer, but I forgot the question
You know I wanna change, change, change, whoa whoa
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa, whoa whoa
Look me in my face again and tell me what I oughtta be
I really think you know what’s best for me
I know you know what’s best for me
Just take me in your arms and tell me
In the future we’ll be home and free
Cause I don’t even know what’s best for me
Yeah, I don’t even know what’s best for me4Embed
