Pour Cyril LyricsI said there’s no shame in this love
There’s no pain in this love
I’ve got the world to gain with this love
There’s no pain in this love
No pain, no pain, no pain, no pain
A tender heart, so truly kind
He wants her love, he wants to try
Caress this child, destroy his violence
No more seduction no jealousy no abandon no lies
No father no mother just sweet little life
You hold her hand, you know this sweet little life
 no world with a broken child
No consolation, please no more lies1Embed
