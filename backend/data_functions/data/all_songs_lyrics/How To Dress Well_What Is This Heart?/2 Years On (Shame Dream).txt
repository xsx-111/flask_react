2 Years On (Shame Dream) LyricsWe were on the road
She heard where my brothers had gone
She thought she had failed for her life
My father he was terrible
Yeah, God knows how much love they could find
And they built a house all of lies
Yeah, he knew that they were born to love
Yeah, he knew they were men he knew they were no different than
You or me or any other guy
Yet he knew that they were never just alright
You thought they were imaginary
No one ever told you life would be this unfair but oh it is!
No one would ask this for themselves
The windows down, the wind on my skin
My brothers in bed with these women
That day I learned that for me pride was cut with shame
There was silence in the car
My mother was so angry but she saw
That this was our fate crystallized
That for them there was so much frustrated desire
That their pain it would never expire
That these loving hearts would always just burn on fire
Just no satisfaction, just these twisted hearts on fire
There’s no design, no god, no!
Just the future and my mother’s broken heartEmbed
