Childhood Faith in Love (Everything Must Change, Everything Must Stay the Same) LyricsWhen I wasn’t falling asleep
When I wasn’t fighting myself
When I wasn’t falling or failing to call
And I wasn’t false when I said I would call
I was running up and down just harassing myself!
Oh yes I wish I was out of it all
Nothing up my sleeve and no sign of a God
No, not never a sign, just standing here outside of the fall…
But if I listened to my dreams I would say
When it’s time to sing just make them see
Everything must change and everything must stay the same
When it’s time to sing with childhood faith in love
Everything must change
Everything must stay the same
When I wasn’t falling asleep
When I wasn’t fighting myself
When I wasn’t falling or failing to call
And I wasn’t false when I said I would call
I was running up and down just harassing myself!
Ooh yes I wish I was out of it all
But you knew that before I said “The rest is death”
But I wish I’d never said that!
Cuz if I listened to my dreams I would say:
When it’s time to sing just make them see
Everything must change and everything must stay the same
When it’s time to sing with childhood faith in love
And ya I know I’ve been drunk all night, then we fucked all night, and that I loved our time
Fear was the last thing that was on my mind (but I think that could be drinking that was on my mind)
(Why would I) go on the record on say you’re on my mind?
Why would I (when I) could sing with it!
And you can just stay right on my mind
But say you’ll walk along me in my dreams!
