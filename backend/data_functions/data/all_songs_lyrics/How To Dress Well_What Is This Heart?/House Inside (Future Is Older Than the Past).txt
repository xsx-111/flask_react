House Inside (Future Is Older Than the Past) LyricsNo mercy baby always crying
No open the sea out on the water
I see the world through so much poison
Didn’t bury his own father
Just a few years ago she told you
“We think it’s new but the future is older”
I can’t understand how the world could hold up
All this pain and all this weight
I’m not asking you to just wait for tomorrow
Deep in your chest stay sequestered and somber
Now instead I guess I’ll smash my fists on the walls of
This emptiness, baby, this house inside
If you could hope so much, change everything!
But you know the future holds more deadly, deadly things!
And I can’t help you out unless you tell me, tell me things!
And who could have ever known you were running on empty, empty babe?!
When your face is opened up, there’s so many, many things!
These stories of the world before any, anything
Had crawled out on this globe, these deadly, deadly things!
Yet you came back for me, such a pretty, pretty thing…
Yet you came back for me
Such a pretty, pretty thing
The future is older than the past
Every new day carries the weight of the last
The future is older than the past
Every new day carries the weight of the last
Ya if I could I’d hold your face in my hand and stop your sighing
“Oh I know this earth, this earth is just so giant
Got you thinking that you’re nothing”
But mama your pain and your silence
Fills my future with such hopeless
Hopeless fear that the world won’t be my home that
My heart can’t bear this journey through the night!1Embed
