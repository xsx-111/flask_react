Precious Love LyricsYou say you “wanted to relax”
Say you “want to live this right”
But you know I can’t hold back, baby
“On and on over again?”
This is the question you must ask yourself
But I see what I want and I see what I got and it’s a perfect match whoa ohhh
What would mean to relate? To relate, to relate, to really relate?
When all the symp- all the sym- frustrate –toms symptoms frustrate?
We’re on a weird adventure, made to meet, so no, don’t go
Just wait just wait just wait just wait
Come on be my precious love
You said you’ll wait so wait even when you wanna go, you’ll make it safe for me to stop
Be my precious love
You say you “wanted to relax”
I know you want to do this right
You say that I’m holding on too tight
But you say with regret that “it goes too fast”
Ya it goes too fast!
I see you pulling in for me, you want to go, but baby wait for me to say
That you’re holding it and when the morning comes you’ll be awake for me to see
You want it all I know you want to be the one to come to say to me
Be my precious love3Embed
