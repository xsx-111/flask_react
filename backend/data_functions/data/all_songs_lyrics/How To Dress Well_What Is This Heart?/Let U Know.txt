Let U Know LyricsAnd I will let you know
And I will let you see
Always you hurt me, yeah
Always you took it from me
And I will let you know
And I will let you see
Always you hurt me, yeah
Always that you took it from me
See boy, nothing you know has changed
And yet there's differences
Nothing feels quite the same
Yeah, would it be strange for me to say
That I don't miss yesterday
That I don't feel no past
Standing in my way, no
But what is this love, this love
This love, this love
And what is this heart, this heart
This heart, this heart
And what is this truth, this truth
This truth, this truth
Say I don't feel no past standing in my way, but
I will let you know
I will let you see
Always you hurt me, yeah
Always you took it from me
And I will let you know
And I will let you see
Always you hurt me, yeah
Always that you took it from meEmbed
