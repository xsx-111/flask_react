Repeat Pleasure Lyrics
Now that I’ve loved you
You know that I want it all the time
I say there’s no one above you
But now there’s a new place above that line
Now that I’ve known you
The truth could never come without your smile
But life should’ve warned you, a limit known is a limit left behind
And in innocence I had wanted all of this to never subside
I never wanted miss a moment alive
Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night
And now I know

If you want it once you’ll want it more baby
But once you got it you’ll need something else
Even if you’re holding on for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you’ll want something else
If you want it once you’ll want it more baby
But once you got it you’ll need something else
Even if you’re holding on for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you’ll want something else

You shouted: ”I told you!”
And I saw the sun reflected in your eyes
The whole world in a dark hue
Repeated without grace, a broken light
Now that I’ve known you
The truth could never come without your smile
But life should’ve warned you, a limit known is a limit left behind
And in innocence I had wanted all of this to never subside
I never wanted miss a moment alive
Without your neck to kiss, I was thrown to the night
And now I know
Even when we get what we wanted
Our hearts babe will never stop longing
Pleasure repeats on and on:
Even broken my heart will go on!

If you want it once you’ll want it more baby
But once you got it you’ll need something else
Even if you’re holding on for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you’ll want something else
If you want it once you’ll want it more baby
But once you got it you’ll need something else
Even if you’re holding on for something unchanging
Yeah, once you got it, you’ll want something else4Embed
