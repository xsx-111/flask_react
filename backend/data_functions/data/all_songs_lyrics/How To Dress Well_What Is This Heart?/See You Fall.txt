See You Fall LyricsI wanna see you fall
And know somehow the world went wrong
I wanted to burst you in song
To show you were finally wrong
You won’t ever be better than that
And you were always on my back
And we were in love with those things we thought
And ya that other thing ya that other thing we’d become

And now it’s in strange damp places
And old dark places when you’re against the wall
When the whole world faces and we all know you’ve faked it
And we’ve got you against the wall
Strange reputations and torn off faces
Throwing flowers against the door
I remember saying “clear out the basement
Of those strange dark places inside”
I want to see you crawl
And know something that the world won’t know
You wanted to burst inside
So no one would find our cub
And we won’t ever be better than that
And you are all but done with the fact
That we were in love and we saved each other
And ya that other thing that comes
