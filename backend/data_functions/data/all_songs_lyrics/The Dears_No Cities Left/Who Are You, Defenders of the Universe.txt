Who Are You, Defenders of the Universe LyricsWe want your information
We will do what we must
But not here
Or in front of people
Or on the phone
We're not all blood-sucking leeches
For we all have families too
But that don't mean
That we really love them
Or that we don't
'Cause I can't love you
And you can't love me
But I can love you
And you can love me
Love me
It's not a confrontation
(All across the world, open your eyes)
We are here because we are broke
(Give us what we want, we've had enough)
But we don't expect a handout, or anything
(So, so, so, so, so)
'Cause I can't help you
And you can't help me
But I can help you
And you can help me
I can help you
You can help me
I can help you
You can help me
Help me
Help you
(It's not an impossible situation)
Help me
(It's not an impossible situation)
Help you
(It's not an impossible situation)
Help me
(It's not an impossible situation)
I know there is doubt we can do this
But I can help youEmbed
