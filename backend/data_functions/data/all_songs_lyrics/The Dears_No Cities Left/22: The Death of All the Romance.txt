22: The Death of All the Romance Lyrics
I have never cried in anybody's arms
The way that I have often cried in yours
Please be the one to take my tears away
I was 22, I've had my share of views
I just can't take that "happiness" from you
Still, I'll be the one to take your tears away
Hey

I can't believe the things you say
(I can't believe the thing you say)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me the lies
I can't believe the things you say
(I can't believe the thing you say)
Tell me, tell me
Tell me the lies
Oh, oh

Fasting love will lead us all to nowhere
(I have never cried in anybody's arms
The way that I have often cried in yours)
When, when will we learn
(Please be the one to take my tears away)
I shall avenge the death of all the romance
(I was 22, I've had my share of views
I just can't take that "happiness" from you)
Until, until I'm gone
(Still, I'll be the one to take your tears away)
I can't believe the things you say
Tell me, tell me
Tell me the lies
I can't believe the things you say
Tell me, tell me
Tell me the lies
I can't believe the things you say
Tell me, tell me
Tell me the lies
Tell me the lies
Tell me the lies
Tell me, tell me the liesEmbed
