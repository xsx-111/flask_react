We Can Have It LyricsLast night all the horrible things in life stormed through my dreams
And I just want to shut it up, shut it down, or shut it off
Going where we lost it all, yet things before are with us now
It hurts, it kills, it takes the joy
It brings no light, it brings no love
And what we want most is nowhere to be found
Some people care, they're going long, they're going deep
And still it's nowhere to be found
We're looking far, we're searching wide
Still, it's nowhere to be found
What we want is gone for good
It's simply nowhere to be found
Somewhere is the one
That never will burn out
Is out there
Looking for a heart
Looking for a home
Looking for a hand to stoke its head
You're not alone
And you never said I'll see you again
You never said I will
I will
Someone somewhere says they got it all
But that's not even what we want
Not even close, not even close
It won't ever be what we wantEmbed
