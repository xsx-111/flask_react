No Cities Left LyricsLet's just keep fighting the end
We're holding hands
We're making plans
For Life
Let's just keep fighting the end
Last time I swear
Or we'll be nowhere tonight
Don't you think that now
Is the time to move on
If you don't mind well I'll
Just keep holding on for good
Let's just keep fighting
The end of the world
We will hold hands and
We will make plans
For LifeEmbed
