Aja Lyrics
Up on the hill, people never stare
They just don't care
Chinese music under banyan trees
Here at the dude ranch above the sea
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
Up on the hill, they've got time to burn
There's no return
Double helix in the sky tonight
Throw out the hardware, let's do it right
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you

Up on the hill, they think I'm okay
Or so they say
Chinese music always sets me free
Angular banjoes sound good to me
Aja, when all my dime dancin' is through
I run to you
