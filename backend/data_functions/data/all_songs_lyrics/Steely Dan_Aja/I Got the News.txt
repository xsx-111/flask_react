I Got the News Lyrics
You, in your Lark
You're a mark
You're a screamer
You know how to hustle
Daddy is a rare millionaire
I don't care
Yeah, you got the muscle
I got the news

Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow
Take it in your hand
All the sirens and the band
Get to bendin' my ear
How was I to know
About the warm
Soulful secret
You been keepin' for years
I got the news

Slow down I'll tell you when
I may never walk again
Broadway Duchess
Darling if you only knew
Half as much as
Everybody thinks you do
What I hear may be true
I would still be proud
To know you


Spanish kissin'
See it glisten
You came ragin'
Love rampagin'

I got the news
Yes dear
How did you know
Can't you see our love will grow
