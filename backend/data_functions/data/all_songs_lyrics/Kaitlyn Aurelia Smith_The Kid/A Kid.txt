A Kid Lyrics
I sway
Telling you it's gonna shake
Sounds wait till they form in low rumble ways
To send through the body in certain ways
All is gonna come to life when
Movement breaks the dance we made so
Let the kid grow for the joy of play
Stop wasting your time with the good and unknown
And I'm open up to everything

I sway
Telling you it's gonna shake
Sounds wait till they form in low rumble ways
To send through the body in certain ways
All is gonna come to life when
Movement breaks the dance we made so
Let the kid grow for the joy of play
Stop wasting your time with the good and unknown
And I'm open up to everything

I, I, I, I'm on a
I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
And overtake
Everything
I, I, I know, I, I, I know
I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
And overtake
Everything

I, I, I, I'm on a
I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
And overtake

I, I, I, I'm on a
I, I, I have a brain
And let it maybe
An overtakeEmbed
