Until I Remember Lyrics
All the ways that fire could ignite
But I 
But I 
But I love a soul and I 

Even all on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail

All the ways that fire could ignite
But I 
But I 
But I love a soul and I 

Even all on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail

But I 
But I 
But I 
All the ways that fire could ignite
But I 
But I 
But I love a soul and I 

Even all on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I fail
All on the way I'm going, but I failEmbed
