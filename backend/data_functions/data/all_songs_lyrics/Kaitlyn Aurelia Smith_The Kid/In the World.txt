In the World Lyrics
The guide, the guide, the guide
The guide, the guide, the guide

Why didn't you 
It kinda wakes you up without 
Why didn't you 
It kinda wakes you up without 

Since you met the guide
The guide, the guide, the guide

Why didn't you 
It kinda wakes you up without 
Why didn't you 
It kinda wakes you up without 

Since you met the guide
The guide, the guide, the guide
The guide, the guide, the guideEmbed
