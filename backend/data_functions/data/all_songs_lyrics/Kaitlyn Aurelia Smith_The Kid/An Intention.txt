An Intention Lyrics
The hardest part of finding out your name
Is owning it in all that it contains
And if I let go of holding on to my ego
Will you let go too?

This cold hand to the face when I'm inside a place
And you can't stand behind what it takes
An artisan knows what it takes
An artisan knows what it takes
I feel everything at the same time

This cold hand to the face when I'm inside a place
And you can't stand behind what it takes
An artisan knows what it takes
An artisan knows what it takes
I feel everything at the same time1Embed
