In a World, but Not of the World Lyrics
I wake up from the apathetic night
Every time I push things
Of knowing everything and keeping a routine
I tried, I put life in
Everything I touch, it wants to be seen
And carried forth, just like you and me
Give it a reason to feel without you
I love it when I think I knew something and then
I find out that it's the opposite
I'm always running to fall in love with
Contradicting myself, it's what I thrive on
To surprise myself again

I wake up from the apathetic night
Every time I push things
Of knowing everything and keeping a routine
I tried, I put life in
Everything I touch, it wants to be seen
And carried forth, just like you and me
Give it a reason to feel without you
I love it when I think I knew something and then
I find out that it's the opposite
I'm always running to fall in love with
Contradicting myself, it's what I thrive on
To surprise myself againEmbed
