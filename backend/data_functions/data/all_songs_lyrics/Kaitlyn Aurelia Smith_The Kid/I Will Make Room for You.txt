I Will Make Room for You LyricsI will make room for you
To take, to take, to take, take, take, take, take
To take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take, take
Up space, to roam
All I want: to live my whole life for
A chance to explore the unknown with you
I hold eyes wide open
For you to feel your best
I want for you to feel your best
I want for you to feel your best
I want for you to feel your best
The best, the best, the best, the best, the best, the best
