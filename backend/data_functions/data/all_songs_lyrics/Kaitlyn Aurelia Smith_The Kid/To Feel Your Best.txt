To Feel Your Best Lyrics
I'm gonna wave and wave till
My hat's down my brow, watch!
I'm gonna wave and wave till
I can't see a sliver of you
Till I walk away, walk away
So I know that you are safe

'Cause I'm gonna wake up one day
And you won't physically be there
Even though I know it's all perspective
I wanna soak up the sight of you
That's why I stare
At you

I'm gonna wave and wave till
My hat's down my brow, watch!
I'm gonna wave and wave till
I can't see a sliver of you
Till I walk away, walk away
So I know that you are safe

'Cause I'm gonna wake up one day
And you won't physically be there
Even though I know it's all perspective
I wanna soak up the sight of you
That's why I stare
At you
I'm gonna wake up one day and you won't be there
I'm gonna wake up one day and you won't be there
I'm gonna wake up one day and you won't be there

'Cause I care, that's why I stare
'Cause I care, that's why I stare
'Cause I care, that's why I stare at you

I'm gonna miss, miss, miss, miss, m-miss your face
I'm gonna miss, miss, miss, miss, m-miss your face
I'm gonna miss, miss, miss, miss, m-miss your face
I'm gonna miss, miss, miss, miss, m-miss your face1Embed
