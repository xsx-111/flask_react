I Am Curious, I Care Lyrics
Talk a, talk a tongue to me I understand
Not through the words you're saying but what's something
I could learn more about you through your eyes

Talk a, talk a tongue to me I understand
Not through the words you're saying but what's something
I could learn more about you through your eyes

And watch emotions rise like on the path
I wanna make you feel alright
For all the times you were told that's not right

Talk a, talk a tongue to me I understand
Not through the words you're saying but what's something
I could learn more about you through your eyesEmbed
