To Follow & Lead Lyrics
I'm pulled to the way that you move
Makes me put a little focus in the way that I move
It's changing my mood
Now I put a little focus in the way that I move
Watching you provokes my groove

I'm pulled to the way that you move
Makes me put a little focus in the way that I move
It's changing my mood
Now I put a little focus in the way that I move
Watching you provokes my groove

I'm pulled to the way that you move
Makes me put a little focus in the way that I move
It's changing my mood
Now I put a little focus in the way that I move
Watching you provokes my groove
Watching you provokes my groove

I'm pulled to the way that you move
Makes me put a little focus in the way that I move
It's changing my mood
Now I put a little focus in the way that I move
Watching you provokes my groove
I'm pulled to the way that you move
Makes me put a little focus in the way that I move
It's changing my mood
Now I put a little focus in the way that I move1Embed
