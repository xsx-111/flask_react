All Your Gold Lyrics
Never see the big church steeple when I call you on the phone
Never feel the rush of angels, when we stay up late alone
Never whisper you a great love story, only scream and cry and moan
But you’re a good man, but you’re a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
Oh, let go of the one who took all your gold

I get home and there’s a love note waiting
But only he is here tonight
And the words, the promises you’re making
Only echo all his lies
And for every sweet nothing you whisper
Why is goodbye my reply?
'Cos you’re a good man, 'cos you’re a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go

There was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past that I cannot forget
I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have nothing left of all my gold

A ghost from the past has turned my heart black
Am I ever gonna let him go? And get my gold back?
And today I was a dead girl walking, city light burnt through the tears
Heard you say my name and get to talking about the love and all the fear
And you saw all the pain I was holding, and yet still you’d hold me near
'Cos you’re a good man, 'cos you’re a good man
I keep telling myself to just let go
There was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past, that I cannot forget
I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have nothing left
Cause there was someone that I knew before
A heart from the past, that I cannot forget
I let him take all my gold, and hurt me so bad
But now for you, I have nothing left of all my gold6Embed
