Lilies Lyrics
Again tonight I sang a song, a prayer if you will
Fell to the floor on blackened knees, and all the trees fell still
Pressed my hands between my thighs, and poured the thistle milk
Begged the thunderbolts to strike and mark me as alive

Oh the lilies on the hill
Oh the lilies on the hill
Oh the lilies on the hill
Scented the night

And so I finished up my prayer, rose slowly and I stared
But I was empty as a grave and ghostless was the air
Lay back to bed and dulled my eyes and searched those fruitless skies
Again begged the thunderbolt to strike to mark me or else I would die

Oh, the lilies on the hill
Oh, the lilies on the hill
Oh, the lilies on the hill
Scented the night

And in the seconds before sleep
And in the second before sleep
Did I believe what I did see?
Did I believe what came to me?
Appeared the figure of a man, waving upon the hill
To the window I ran and saw what he had sent
Children of a private world, to be conceived in milk
A hundred marching to my door, all bringing dreams to drink

Thank God I'm alive!
Thank God I'm alive!

Oh, the lilies on the hill
Oh, the lilies on the hill
Oh, the lilies on the hill
Scented the nightEmbed
