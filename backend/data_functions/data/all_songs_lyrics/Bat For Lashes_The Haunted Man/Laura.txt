Laura Lyrics
You say that they've all left you behind
Your heart broke when the party died
Drape your arms around me and softly say
"Can we dance upon the tables again?"

When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar
And in this horror show
I've got to tell you so
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar

You say that you're stuck in a pale blue dream
And your tears feel hot on my bed sheets
Drape your arms around me and softly say
"Can we dance upon the tables again?"
When your smile is so wide and your heels are so high
You can't cry
Get your glad rags on and let's sing along
To that lonely song

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar
You'll be famous for longer than them
Your name is tattooed on every boy's skin
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

You're the train that crashed my heart
You're the glitter in the dark
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar
And in this old horror show
I've got to let you know
Ooh, Laura, you're more than a superstar
You're more than a superstar10Embed
