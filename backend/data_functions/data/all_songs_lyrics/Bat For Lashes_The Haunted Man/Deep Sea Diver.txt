Deep Sea Diver LyricsYou came running out of the dark
With the tears in your eyes
This time I'm not afraid
Cause my heart's ablaze
Baby, throw your head back
Let your hair down
Oooooooh
Baby, let your hair down
It's time to get enchanted
You're a deep sea diver
Tides are turning in your favour
You came running out of the dark
With the tears in your eyes
And the moth and the moon saw
A new religion being born
Baby, let your head fall back
And laugh like you never
Tasted such a good thing on your tongue
Baby, let your scream come
Baby, let your scream come
Said you'd been taken over
By a deeper animal
You'd been changed
What's grown up around you
Is a different skin
You thought I wouldn't know your face
Baby, if you can't see out
Know that I can hear you shout
And darling if you can't see out
You know that I can hear you shout
HooooohhEmbed
