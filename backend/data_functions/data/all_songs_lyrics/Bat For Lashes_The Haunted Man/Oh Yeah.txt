Oh Yeah Lyrics
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)

I am whole, hot is the night
The grass is so tall and slow
The air is wet and I feel alive
Let the perfume drip
Let it rise

I am whole and I walk the night
Luscious and lost, so alone
Touch the rocks and lick the light
Let the hot winds howl
So slow

Here am I
Looking for a lover to climb inside
Waiting like a flower to open wide
I'm in bloom!
I lie low, I'm ready to try
The tapestries turn and grow
Creepers crawl and kiss my thighs
And the headiness howls
Rise and rise!

Here am I
Looking for a lover to climb inside
Waiting like a flower to open wide
I'm in bloom!
Here I lie
Lying like a flower with no more time
Waiting for another to come inside
I'm in bloom!

Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Oh yeah, oh yeah!
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah!
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)Embed
