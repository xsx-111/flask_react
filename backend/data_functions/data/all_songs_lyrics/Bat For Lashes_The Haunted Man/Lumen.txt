Lumen Lyrics
She did curl, up in the cold
And the sleeping man you reached inside her dress
A glowing tear spilled on the boat
And the lighthouse beamed, it's softly spoke

Lumen, Lumen
Lumen, I'll see you again (see you again)

Just stand to life, bathe in the lake
A fall down drift, roll around
I found all the hurts, I see them both
Throughout the night, clean out the ghosts

Lumen, Lumen
Lumen, I'll see you again
