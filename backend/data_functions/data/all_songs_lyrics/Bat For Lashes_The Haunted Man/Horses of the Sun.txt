Horses of the Sun Lyrics
I cursed the road, I cursed the road
And I came home to the love you gave
And as I walked through my door
I saw the stars spelled out saved
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away
Now I'm saved, baby, saved

And all was alive
And all was alive
And all was alive
And all was alive

You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens
Like the horses of the sun

I cursed the road, I cursed the road
And I came home to the love you gave
And as I walked through my door
I saw the stars spelled out saved
And all the gardens bloomed a flower for each day I was away
Now I'm saved, baby, saved
And all was alive
And all was alive
And all was alive
And all was alive

You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens
Like the horses of the sun
You and me
We're wild and on the run
Busting out the heavens
Like the horses of the sunEmbed
