Marilyn Lyrics
See your face at night
Touch you black and white
You're a silver screen
Visual balladry
Wanna move in the dark
Play the part
Put your star in me
Visual balladry

Holding you I'm touching a star
Turning into a Marilyn
Leaning out of your big car
Holding you I'm touching a star
Stay the night if you think you know
Think you know what you're good for

See your face at night
In forever light
You're a silver beam
Visual balladry
Wanna move in the dark
Play the part
Put your star in me
Visual balladry
Holding you I'm touching a star
Turning into a Marilyn
Leaning out of your big car
Holding you I'm touching a star
Stay the night if you think you know
Think you know what you're good for

Holding you I'm touching a star
Turning into a Marilyn
Leaning out of your big car
Holding you I'm touching a star
Stay the night if you think you know
Think you know what you're good for
Holding you I'm touching a star
Stay the night if you think you know
Think you know what you're good for1Embed
