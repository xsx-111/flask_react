A Wall Lyrics
From inside his mouth, I lick the blood
While he's roaring and biting, I wash off the mud
'Cause the tempest is out to wrestle a while
Stop charging, my darling, get closer, be quiet

'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(We're entering a brave new world)
Set out with no map and turn off your torch
(And we're only but a second away!)
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(Take my hand and we can out-run time!)
You'll get through, you'll be home, you'll be home

From inside his mouth, I lick the scars
In the woodland, the leaves are marking a path
And if you'd just rest your head, stop repeating the charge
You know that this time will turn all the locks

'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(We're entering a brave new world)
Just set out with no map and turn off your torch
(And we're only but a second away!)
'Cause where you see a wall, I see a door
(Take my hand and we can out-run time!)
You'll get through, you'll be home, you'll be home
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?
Just sit still, does it hurt? Does it hurt?Embed
