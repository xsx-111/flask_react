Daphne Lyrics
12, 11, 10, 9
Outside my house I've built a shrine
8, 7, 6, 5
But I have dreamt he's still alive
4, 3, 2, 1
In the lands of light his voice is sung
Row, row, row, row
The time is right for us to go

Bloom the night in all her darkness
Daphne froze in her white night gown
Cotton bill'd around her body
The sea is calling me down
The sea is calling me down

Bloom the night in all her darkness
Daphne froze on the precipice
Years of tears have salted her body
And she cried nevermore
And she cried nevermore

1, 2, 3, 4
For you, my love, I'll wait no more
5, 6, 7, 8
Lay your kisses to rest at the garden gates
9, 10, 11, 12
Because I've got to save myself
Row, row, row, row
The time is right for you to goEmbed
