Rest Your Head Lyrics
Come on now, rest your head
And I’ll protect you
You’ve been running too fast, running for fear
You’ve got to stop sometime soon

Pushing through barriers and pushing through seas
And the witch will come for you
You’ve been running up hills and running too slow
But just keep on running, keep on running
Look what you find, look what you find

Come on and rest your head!
And I will protect you
Come on now!
Come on and rest your head
You gotta stop sometime soon

The power’s so strong and if you don’t know why
There’s a deeper knowing in that big old sky
Could say you’re in the wrong place at the right time
But don’t keep on running, keep on running
Stick to the spot
Come on and rest your head!
And I will protect you
Come on now!
Come on and rest your head
You gotta stop sometime soonEmbed
