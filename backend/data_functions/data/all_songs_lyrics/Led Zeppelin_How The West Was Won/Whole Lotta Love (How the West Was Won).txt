One night, one ni-ee-ii-ee-i-i-ight
One night I was layin' down
I hear my mama and papa talking-ahh
I hear them say Lo-ooo-oh-ord
You've gotta let that boy b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boo-gie
I think John Lee Hooker said that
Oooh boogie, oooh boogie
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, boo-gie mama

A-mama done told me, a-papa done too
The way that you move, its no good for you
A-boogie mama, a-boogie mama
Boogie mama, boogie all night long

Baby told me late last night
Way that ya move it's just a little too tight
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it baby
Shake it one time, one time

Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and-a groovin' gonna
Satisfy my soul

Let's have a party, who
Let's have a party
Send 'im to the store let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight

Honky-tonky Joe

So bring 'im in and fill 'im up
And send 'im t' buy some more

Let's have a party, who
Let's have a party
Ooh, send to the store let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight, rock it


I've never kissed a bear

But I can shake a chicken
In the middle of

Let's have a party, who
Let's have a party
Send to the store let's buy some more
Let's have a party tonight, we gonna have a party tonight


I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart

She passed me by one sunny day, avoid those big brown eyes my way
Oooh I never did see you before
I'm not one that gets around, swear my feet stuck to the ground
Ooh I never did see you before

I said hello Mary Lou, oh, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, Iím so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, weíd never part
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart, rock it, rock it, rock it


I saw your lips I heard your voice, believe me I just had no choice
Wild horses couldn't make me stay away
I'm not one that gets around, swear my feet stuck to the ground
Ooh, I never did see you before

I said hello Mary Lou, oh, goodbye heart
Sweet Mary Lou, I'm so in love with you
I knew Mary Lou, we'd never part
So, hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart
I said hello Mary Lou, goodbye heart


Well, I did not say I was a millionaire
I said I could have spent more money than a millionaire
An' if you and I'd 've kept all the money that we already spent
We would have been millionaires a long long time ago, don't you dig it
And women, and women, good little women
Oh, I'm goin' down slow

I have had my fun
If I never, never, never, never, never get well no mo'
Ooooh, I have had my fun, children
If I never, never, never get well no mo'
Whoa yes, my health is fadin'
Ooh yeah, I'm goin' down slow, it ain't all that bad


Pleaaaaaaaaaaase write my mama
Tell her, tell her the shape I'm in
Please, please, please, please, please, please, oh-oh-oh, please write my mama
Tell her, oh, the shape I'm in
You can tell her pray for me, pray for me
Please forgive me, whoa-oh-oooh-oh-oooh, whoa-ooh-oh
Forgive me for my sins
Woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman, woman

Way down inside
You need-yeah, love
Alright
