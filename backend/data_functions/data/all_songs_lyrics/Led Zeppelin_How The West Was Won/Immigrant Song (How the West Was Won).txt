Immigrant Song (How the West Was Won) Lyrics
Ah, ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs flow

The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands
To fight the horde, sing and cry
Valhalla, I am coming, yeah

On we sweep with, with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Ah, ah
We come from the land of the ice and snow
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green
Can whisper tales of gore
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with, with threshing oar
Our only goal will be the western shore

Oh
I think you'd better stop
And rebuild all your ruins
For peace and trust can win the day despite, despite of all your losingEmbed
