Bring It On Home (How the West Was Won) Lyrics
Ba-by, whoa-mm, ba-by
Gonna bring it on home to you
I've bought my ticket, I've got that load
Up, we're goin' higher, all aboard
Take my seat, a-right way back, Lord
A-watch this train goin' down the track
Gonna bring it on home
Bring it on home to you

A-try to tell you baby
What you tryin' to do
Try to love me baby
Love some other man too
Bring it on home, bring it on home

Sweetest little baby daddy ever saw
I'm gonna keep you lovin' baby
I'm gonna give you more
Bring it on home, bring it on home
Bring it on home, bring it on home, babe

A-try to tell you, baby
I know it don't need fixed
I bet you love me, baby
I'm gonna get some spirits
Bring it on home, a-bring it on home
Gonna bring it home, a-bring it on home
Went 'n a little walk downtown
Missed 'n got back late
A-found a note there waiting
An' it said, Robert, I just can't wait
Bring it on home, a-bring it on home
A-bring it back home, A-bring it back home to me, babe


A-try to tell you, baby
I know it don't need fixed
A-now you got me, baby
Robert gets his best
Bring it on home, a-bring it on home

Went 'n a little walk downtown
Missed 'n got back late
A-found a note there waiting
An' it said, daddy, I just can't wait
Bring it on home, a-bring it on home
Bring it back home, A-bring it back on home, babe
I'm gonna bring it on home, bring it on home to you
Do it, children
Oh, see yaEmbed
