Happiness LyricsWhat I'm a longing for is some happiness (x2)
Happiness is when you share dat love wit one another
Happiness is when you ?? together
You got to ??? ??
They can get no time to press
Because of all the distress that the society leads
What I'm a longing for is some happiness
Happiness is when you give Jah praises
Happiness is when you livin with the feel of mind, oh yeah
So long we be living and we can't uniteEmbed
