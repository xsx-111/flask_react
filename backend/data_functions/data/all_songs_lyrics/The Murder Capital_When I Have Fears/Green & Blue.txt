Green & Blue Lyrics
With their wings flung the choir sung their final song today
As the doors appear to clear the space in which she lay
She'll collapse, she'll collapse as the amber sisters softly say

I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you
I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you

Pulling on my weight a thousand sirens took their time
Where the wayside came out in front of wild and squalling signs
I went into a state inside of thought and wandering mind
He'll relax, he'll relax as the amber sisters twist and whine
And I cry

I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you
I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you

I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you
Oh, I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green and blue
The green and blue, the green and blue for you

I felt you
I felt you
I felt you
I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you
I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you
I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for you
I'll correlate the blue, the green and blue, the green for youEmbed
