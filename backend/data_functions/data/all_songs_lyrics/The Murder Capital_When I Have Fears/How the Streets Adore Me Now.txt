How the Streets Adore Me Now Lyrics
Well, where were we when stolen turns
Of torment heard crept through the trees?
The faceless page of loaded leaves
The mountain mounds around our feet

The soiled and severed dormant reeds
On shopfronts filled our brooding streets
The love we draw, upon so sweet
The moment strained our stillness

Above the calls of only men
That brave the dirt of handheld pen
And in the end our weightless state
Was all we had to break away
I know I should have stayed that day
Your eyes wrapped 'round me still

And in the now, this wistful town
Was swept and drowned beneath its ground

But how the streets adore me now
But how the streets adore me now
My love, my light, my darknessEmbed
