On Twisted Ground Lyrics
I can't watch it all
As it's left like this
So the moment folds
Into permanence
And the clouds amass
Not a breath of wind
But a final gasp
All engulfed within

Like a patch in time
The extent of this
Could erode outside
Of the evidence
For the question now
Will we always be
On the twisted ground
Of our horrid dreams?

You could've watched it all
You could've watched it all
You could've watched it all
You could've watched it all
You could've watched it all
Where the answer lies
In a midst the waves
So erupts the tide
Upon which you sail
Oh, my dearest friend
How it came to this
With your searing end
Into the abyss

In my experience
Of any permanence

You could've watched it all
You could've watched it all
You could've watched it allEmbed
