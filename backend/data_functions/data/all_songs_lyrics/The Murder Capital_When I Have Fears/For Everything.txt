For Everything Lyrics
I am a blissless star, corroded through the core
The very many, no, I'm dodgin' holes
There's nothin' left in store, for
I am a weightless diver, terrified and free
The possibility of symphony within my tragedy seen

I am the underworld, the one you want to leave
A frail democracy, benign treaty, couragously foreseen, dreamed
Delusion lines the walls, the ceilings and the floor
We'll lay the carpet out, invade with doubt
This territory needs more

Not at all
Not for everything
It's not for everything at all
Not for everyone
It's not for anyone at all
Not for everything
It's not for everything at all
Not for anyone at all
It's for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, it's for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, it's for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything, it's for nothing
For everything, for nothing
For everything we haveEmbed
