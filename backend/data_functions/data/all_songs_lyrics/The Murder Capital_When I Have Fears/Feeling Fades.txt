Feeling Fades Lyrics
As the feeling fades away, the tearing streets create a wave
Of never-seeing stills in time, a sway of settled lines
The creeping sounds of children ring to curling toes in spring
Well, they now are lapsed 'round you and me

They now are lapsed 'round you and me
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
They now are lapsed 'round you and me

So yet, we flow together
So yet, we flow together
So yet, we flow together
So yet, we flow together
And with the change in the time, we flow together
So yet, we flow together
And with the change of it all, we float together
Well, so yet we
I was passin' the thrill of none
Onto the streets below
For many cares were taken for the Dillinger beats of the feet
And a terrible impression lay
Upon the chorus and plated alleyways
They kept us all together
They kept us all together
They kept us all together, those streets, they keep us all together
They kept us all together
They kept us all together

As the feeling fades away, the tearing streets create a wave
Of never-seeing stills in time, a sway of settled lines
The creeping sounds of children ring to curling toes in spring
Well, they now are lapsed 'round you and me

It kept up all together
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
It kept us all together
They now are lapsed 'round you and me
And it kept us all together
