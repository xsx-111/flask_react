More Is Less Lyrics
If I gave you what you wanted, you'd never be full
As the trappings of your boyish mind become unshakeable
If I gave you what you wanted, you'd never be full
All the trappings of your romance lie within the eyes of fools
And I love it

More, more, more
More, more, more
More is less, more is less
More, more

If I put my life in my back pocket, you'd know soon
That the alternating atmosphere was far outside that room
If I put my life in my back pocket, you'd know well
That I kept all your belongings for the sweetness of their smell
And I love it

More, more, more
More, more, more
More is less, more is less
More, more, more
More, more, more
More, more, more
More is less, more is less
More, more

Why do you look that way?
That's what you said to me
I'm an anomaly
Still, in the park that day
I sat alone in ways
And I just gave you more and more and more and more
You want more
Gimme moreEmbed
