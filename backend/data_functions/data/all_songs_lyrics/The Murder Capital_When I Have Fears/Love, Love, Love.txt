Love, Love, Love Lyrics
In the room where it took place
In the rain, the romance lay
My heart stood still

Love, love, love
Love, love, love

As the storm begets the eye you find time to cry as I say goodbye
Well, goodbye, goodbye
In the corner of your eye I find time to lie when I say goodbye
Well, goodbye, goodbye

Love, love, love
Love, love, love

In the rain, the romance lay
Baby, in the rain, the romance lay
In the rain, the romance stays
Maybe in the rain the romance will say goodbye

Well, goodbye, goodbyeEmbed
