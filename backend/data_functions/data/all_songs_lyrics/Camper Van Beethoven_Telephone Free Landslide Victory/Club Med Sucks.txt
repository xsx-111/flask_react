Club Med Sucks LyricsI don't have to go to school for an entire week
I just wanna go down to Newport Beach
Mom and Dad wanna tell me where to go
They wanna go to Club Med San Carlos
Club Med sucks
Authority sucks
I hate golf
I don't wanna play lacrosse
The people there, they are so stupid
They exploit the poor and the weak
I want no part of their death culture
I just wanna go to the beachEmbed
