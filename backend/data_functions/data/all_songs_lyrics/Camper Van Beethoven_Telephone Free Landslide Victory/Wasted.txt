Wasted Lyrics
I was so wasted

I was a surfer
And I had a skateboard
I was so heavy
And I lived on the Strand
I was a dumb shit
And I was a fuck-up
I was so napped out
I was out of my head


I was a hippie
And I was a burn-out
I was so wasted
I was out of my head
I was a punker
And I had a mohawk
I was so gnarly
And I drove my dad's car
