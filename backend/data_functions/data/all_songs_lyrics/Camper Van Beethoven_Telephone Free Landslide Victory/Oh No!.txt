Oh No! LyricsSat on the porch
Listened to the rain
Smoked a cigarette
And counted to ten
CHORUS:
Oh no, here it comes again, that funny feeling
Oh no, here it comes again, that funny feeling
One was not serious
And one was confused
One was just vicious
And one was like you
REPEAT CHORUS
I sat on the porch
Listened to the rain
Smoked another cigarette
And counted to ten
REPEAT CHORUS
Here it comes againEmbed
