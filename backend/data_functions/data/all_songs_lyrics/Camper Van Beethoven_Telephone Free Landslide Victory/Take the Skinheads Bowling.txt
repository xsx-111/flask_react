Take the Skinheads Bowling Lyrics
Every day, I get up and pray to Jah
And he increases the number of clocks by exactly one
Everybody's comin' home for lunch these days
Last night there were skinheads on my lawn

Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling

Some people say that bowling alleys got big lanes
(Got big lanes, got big lanes)
Some people say that bowling alleys all look the same
(Look the same, look the same)
There's not a line that goes here that rhymes with anything
(Anything, anything)
Had a dream last night but I forget what it was
(What it was, what it was)

Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Had a dream last night about you, my friend
Had a dream--I wanted to sleep next to plastic
Had a dream--I wanted to lick your knees
Had a dream--it was about nothing

Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling
Take the skinheads bowling
Take them bowling2Embed
