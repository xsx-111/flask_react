The Day That Lassie Went to the Moon Lyrics
My little dog ran away the other day
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I can't believe my little dog Lassie ran away
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
She packed her bags, got into a hot air balloon
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Then my little dog Lassie, she sailed off to the moon
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

The day, the day
That was the day that Lassie went to the moon

My little dog Lassie packed her bags
Wnd went out on to the porch
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Her golden fur glistened in
That sunny blue backdrop sky of Kansas
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Before her stretched majestic wheat fields
And hope of that great city in the west
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Lassie knew she had the duty to
Serve the youth of America in the stars above
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
The day, the day
That was the day that Lassie went to the moon
The day, the day
That was the day that Lassie went to the moon
The day, the day
That was the day that Lassie went to the moonEmbed
