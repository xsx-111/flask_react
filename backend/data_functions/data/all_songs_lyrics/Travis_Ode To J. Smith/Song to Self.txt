Song to Self LyricsI'm singing a song to myself
I'm singing a song to myself
Pictures in your mind
Out of focus and unkind
Picture me
I picture you
Outside the sun is shining
At the back of your mind there's a memory
By the time you hear this I'll be gone
I'm singing a song to myself
Cos I don't belong any longer
Just making it up in my head
This feeling is strong and getting stronger
Do you see the light?
Tell me you see the light
Just making it up in my head
Cos I need someone to sing along with
Sing along with
Pictures in your heart
Out of focus torn apart
Picture me
I picture you
Outside the moon is shining
At the back of your mind there's a memory
By the time you hear this I'll be gone
I'm singing a song to myself
Cos I don't belong any longer
Just making it up in my head
This feeling is strong and getting stronger
Do you see the light?
Tell me you see the light
Just making it up in my head
Cos I need someone to sing along with
Sing along with...
Yeah...
Ooohhh...
I'm singing a song to myself
Cos I don't belong any longer
Just making it up in my head
This feeling is strong and getting stronger
Do you see the light?
Tell me you see the light
Just making it up in my head
Cos I need someone to sing along with
Singing a song to myselfEmbed
