J. Smith LyricsThere's a man on the street
And he looks at his feet form his window
And he sweares at the sun
And he curses the moon for its shadow
Ohh...
Take a leaf from his book
Take a thread from his suite
He's a new man
And he prays to his god
That he reaps his reward
For his new plan
Oh, the mould has been cast
The radio's in the bath
Yeah yeah yeah
Labor tuus nunc ad terminum
Sed per deos, vade retro
LET'S GO!
Nomen nusquan video
Carbo in culo in aeternitatem
Placet satanae te vedere
Placet satanae te vedere
Ohh...Embed
