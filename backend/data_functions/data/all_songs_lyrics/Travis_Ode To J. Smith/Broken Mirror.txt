Broken Mirror LyricsEach time you go away
Part of you turns to grey
The jingle of the chains
Singled
Rearrange
Broken mirror steal my reflection
Tell me what you see
A hundred shattered eyes in the looking glass
Staring back at me
Inside
Inside
Inside tolls the bell
Outside all is well
Broken mirror steal my reflection
Tell me what you see
A hundred shattered eyes in the looking glass
Staring back at me
I never want to be alone
I never ever want to go home
This I know for sureEmbed
