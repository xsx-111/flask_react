Friends LyricsWho cheers you up
When you are down
Who brings you cups of coffee
Who picks you up
When you're in town
Whatever makes you happy
And I'm glad you're better now
But I'm sad you're not around
Friends
Will never desert you
Or turn against
Friends
Won't love you and leave you
To mend the fence
Ooohhh...
Ooohhh...
Who wakes you up
When you're late for work
Who makes the bed so lovely
Who found your sock
Who picked your shirt
Whatever makes you love me
And I'm glad I'm better now
But I'm sad you're not around
Friends
Will never desert you
Or turn against
Friends
Won't love you and leave you
To mend the fence
Ooohhh...
Ooohhh...
Friends
Will never desert you
Or turn against
Friends
Won't love you and leave you
To mend the fence
Friends
Will never decieve you
And turn against
Friends
Won't love you and leave you
To mend the fence
Ooohhh...Embed
