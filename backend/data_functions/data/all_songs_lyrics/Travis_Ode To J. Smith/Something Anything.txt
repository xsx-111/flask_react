Something Anything LyricsLike a melody that is impossible to play, I wait
In my memory there's a part of you that's gone away, yeah
To keep my mind from wondering
I'm wondering
To keep myself on falling in
I'm following
Something Anything just to keep believing
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer
Something Anything just to keep believing
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer
I'd tell you anything if i had anything to say, yeah
I keep it bottled in 'cause there's a time and there's a place for this, yeah
I keep my story where it is
An act as if
I don't even know what it is
When all i need is
Something Anything just to keep believing
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer
Something Anything just to keep believing
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer
Something Anything just to keep believing
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer
Something Anything just to keep believing
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer
