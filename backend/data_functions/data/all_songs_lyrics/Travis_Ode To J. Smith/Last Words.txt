Last Words LyricsTrying to shine a light into the dark
Corners of the mind and of the heart
Find out what you're carrying around
Things you can't remember having found
Holding on
All the best you can
Finding out
In a nick of time
Of the last words
Are hanging on my phone
Of the last words
Even when you're standing on your own
Of the last words
Are lying on my floor
Of the last words
Trying to find a place you can begin
Cling to fill the space you're living in
Rip it up and start it all again
Turning all your enemies into friends
Holding on
All the best you can
Finding out
In a nick of time
Of the last words
Are hanging on my phone
Of the last words
Even when you're standing on your own
Of the last words
Are lying on my floor
Of the last words
Of the last words
Are hanging on my phone
Of the last words
Even when you're standing on your own
Of the last words
Are lying on your floor
Of the last words
I know, in know, you know
Of the last words
Are hanging on my phone
Of the last words
Even when you're standing on your own
Of the last words
Are lying on your floor
Of the last words
Of the last wordsEmbed
