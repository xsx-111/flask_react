Strangered in the Night LyricsWell it was dark at midnight
There was hardly any moon
And no one really saw much
No one was really sure
But something didn't seem right
Something was kind of queer
A roar turned into whispers
Everyone stood there
As the sound split the night
They ran hiding from the light
Like strangers in the night 
Well I didn't see no shotgun
I didn't see no knife
But I saw this crazy black guy
With the demon in his eye
And I heard him say "white man"
I've seen that silver cue
You don't remember me well
But I remember you
(Chorus)
Well the knife just left his fingers
As the black guy took his aim
White guy's head exploded
The black guy howled in pain
Then everybody scattered
I heard some woman scream
God damn you old black bastard
You've blown away my dreams
(Chorus)Embed
