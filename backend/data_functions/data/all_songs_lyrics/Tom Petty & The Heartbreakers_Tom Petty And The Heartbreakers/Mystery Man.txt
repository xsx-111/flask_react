Mystery Man LyricsDon't hide from me baby
Shame on you
Incognito baby you're so crude
I don't mind
Take my hand
Baby I want to be your mystery man
Yeah you got ruby lipstick
Too much rouge
And dime store jewelry
Cheap perfume
I don't mind, take my hand
Honey I want to be your mystery man
You know I do, you know I do
Oh you know I do, you i do
Yeah you know I do, you know I do
Baby you know I do, you know I do
(Chorus)1Embed
