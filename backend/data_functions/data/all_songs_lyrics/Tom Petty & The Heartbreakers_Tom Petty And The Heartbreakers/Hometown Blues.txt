Hometown Blues LyricsBaby can't wait, baby got to go
Got to do a number on a late night show
Do a little song, do a little dance
Going to make the best of her big chance

It don't really matter if she don't or if she do
Just trying to make the best of the hometown blues
Blues
I got to friend, got to little girl
Say she's the best in the whole wide world
Said it's so good, said it so unreal
Might not last, but it's no big deal
(Chorus)
Baby, save me, save me
Save me with your sweet smile
Honey, I really need you
To help me kill a little bit of time
All of the girls run with the crowd
They go wild when the lights go down
They got to little money, little in a dream
Want to be the queen of their little scene
Don't really matter if they don't or if they do
They're trying to make the best of the hometown blues
Blues
