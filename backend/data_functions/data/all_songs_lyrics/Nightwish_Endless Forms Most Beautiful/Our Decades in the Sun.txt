Our Decades in the Sun Lyrics
I climbed off your back
Not so long ago
To a blooming meadow
To a path you'd made for the lightest feet

Mother
I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you
The care, the love, the memories
We are the story of one

Father
I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you
The care, the love, the memories
You are forever in me

This verse we wrote
On a road home
For you
All this for you
All this for you
Our walk has been sublime
A soaring ride and gentle lead
You have the heart of a true friend
One day we'll meet on that shore again

Mother
I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you
The care, the love, the memories
We are the story of one

Father
I am always close to you
I will be waving every time you leave
Oh, I am you
The care, the love, the memories
You are forever in me2Embed
