Edema Ruh Lyrics
One by one we light the candles of this show
One by one enter the theater of the primal birth
Silently watch the planetary curtain go down
Laugh and rejoice, as the powerful play greets you tonight

We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us dream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home

We'll give you a key to open all of the gates
We'll show you a sea of starlight to drown all your cares
Mirror houses, the sweetest kisses and lights
A Debussy dialogue between the wind and the roaring sea

We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us dream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home

Dance to the whistle to the play to the story
To infinite encores
Laugh at the royalty with sad crowns
And hear the chorus once more

We are the Edema Ruh
We know the songs the sirens sang
See us dream every tale true
The verse we leave with you will take you home3Embed
