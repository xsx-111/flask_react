The Body Electric Lyrics
One humanoid escapee
One android on the run
Seeking freedom beneath a lonely desert sun
Trying to change its program
Trying to change the mode...crack the code
Images conflicting into data overload

In distress

Memory banks unloading
Bytes breaking to bits
Unit One's in trouble and it's scared out of its wits
Guidance systems break down
A struggle to exist
To resist
A pulse of dying power in a clenching plastic fist

In distress

It replays each of the days
A hundred years of routines
Bows its head and prays
To the mother of all machines
