Red Lenses LyricsI see red
And it hurts my head
Guess it must be something
That I read
It's the color of your heartbeat
A rising summer sun
The battle lost or won
The flash to fashion
And the pulse to passion

Thinking about the overhead

Couldn't we talk about something else instead?

And the mercury is rising
Barometer starts to fall
You know it gets to us all

And the rain that is burning
Feel red
