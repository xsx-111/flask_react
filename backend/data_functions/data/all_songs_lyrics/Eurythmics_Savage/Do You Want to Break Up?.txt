Do You Want to Break Up? Lyrics
Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?
Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?

I've got a heavy heart
Got heart filled full of lead
Pocket full of heartache
Car crash in my head
I've got a steady hand
Gonna lead me to my home
Take me up to heaven
Heaven's where I'm goin'

Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?
Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?

I've seen trouble
I looked right up to its face
Never tried to turn away
And I've been sad
I've been overjoyed
So let me disembrace you now
My little trouble boy...
Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?
Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?

You took me to the ocean
Dropped me like a stone
Took me to the deep blue ocean
I don't wanna stay there baby
I don't wanna swim alone
I don't wanna, I don't wanna...

Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?
Yeah! Oh yeah! Yeah!
Do you want to break up?Embed
