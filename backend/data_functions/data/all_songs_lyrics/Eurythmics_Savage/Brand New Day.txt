Brand New Day Lyrics
Six o'clock in the morning
And I'm stepping through the streets
The pavement's cold and empty
Got the blues beneath my feet
Big old sun is rising up
So elegant and thin
Another day is over
For a new day will begin

And the word said, "Hey!"
It's a brand new day
And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!

Oh, baby, baby, baby
I dreamed about you
Please tell me, tell me, tell me
What I've seen could not be true
You have taken my existance
You have filled it full of stones
You have turned into a stranger
Now I need to walk alone
But I won't be sad
I won't be destroyed
But I won't be...
No, I won't be sad
I won't be destroyed

And the word said...
It's a brand new...
And the word said...
Listen to the word, listen to the word
Listen to the word, listen to the word
It's a brand new...
It's just a got to say, it's just a got to say
And the word said, "Hey!"
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
New day, brand day
And the word said, "Hey!"
New day, brand day
It's a brand new day

And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!
And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!
And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!
And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!
And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!
And the word said, "Hey!"
Hey! Hey!
It's a brand new day
Hey! Hey!Embed
