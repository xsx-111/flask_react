I Need You (Live) Lyrics
I need you to pin me down
Just for one frozen moment
I need someone to pin me down
So I can live in torment
I need you to really feel
The twist of my back breaking
I need someone to listen
To the ecstasy I'm faking

I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you

I need you to catch each breath
That issues from my lips
I need someone to crack my skull
I need someone to kiss
So hold me now
And make pretend
That I won't ever fall
Oh, hold me down
I'm gonna be your, baby, doll
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah! You!
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you
I need you, you, you

I need...
You
I really doEmbed
