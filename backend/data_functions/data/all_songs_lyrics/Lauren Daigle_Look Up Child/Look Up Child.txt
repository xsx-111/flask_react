Look Up Child Lyrics
Where are You now
When darkness seems to win
Where are You now
When the world is crumbling

Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

Look up child
Look up child

Where are You now (Where are You?)
When all I feel is doubt
Where are You now
When I can't figure it out

Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say
Look up child
Look up child
Look up child
Look up child
Look up…

You're not threatened by the war
You're not shaken by the storm
I know You're in control
Even in our suffering
Even when it can't be seen
I know You're in control

Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

Look up child
Look up child
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say (Look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say (Look up, look up, look up, look up)
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say
I hear You, I hear You calling my name, oh
Look up child
I hear You say, You say, You say (Look up, look up)
Look up child
Look up child
