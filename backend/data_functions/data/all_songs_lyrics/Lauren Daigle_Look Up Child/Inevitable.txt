Inevitable Lyrics
I can feel when my mind starts to creep into doubt
On the days when the strength in my heart's giving out
There's a light, but it hides from me deep in the cloud
There's a voice that I need, but I don't hear a sound

Ever running to what I can't see
Fighting out of all my unbelief
Father, even then my song will be
I know You will always carry me

It's inevitable

Set Your promise to play on repeat in my head
When You meet my anxiety, put it to death

Ever running to what I can't see
Fighting out of all my unbelief
Father, even then my song will be
I know You will always carry me

It's inevitable
It's inevitable
It's inevitable
It's inevitableEmbed
