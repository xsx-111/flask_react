Everything Lyrics
Even the sparrow has a place to lay its head
So why would I let worries steal my breath
Even the roses, You have clothed in brilliant red
Still I'm the one You love more than this

You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
I need

Even the oceans push and pull at Your command
So You can still my heart with Your hand
You tell the seasons when it's time for them to turn
So I will trust You, even when it hurts

You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
I need
You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
I need
When I can't see, You lead me
When I can't hear, You show me
When I can't stand, You carry me
When I'm lost, You will find me
When I'm weak, You are mighty
You are everything I need

You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
I need
You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
I need
You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
I need
You give me everything
You give me everything
You give me everything
