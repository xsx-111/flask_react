This Girl Lyrics
I've been a winding road, oh, I know You know
Sometimes a stranger in my home
Keep going back and forth through the open door
I'm still learning to be still

This girl ain't going anywhere
This girl ain't going anywhere
I can promise You this, now I know for sure
This girl ain't going anywhere

I've run for miles and lost sight of where You are
But You have seen me all along
Maybe I'm the last to know when I've gone too far
And yet I'm always by Your side

This girl ain't going anywhere
This girl ain't going anywhere
I can promise You this, now I know for sure
This girl ain't going anywhere

Oh, I know
I searched the world to find my heart is Yours
Oh, my heart is Yours
I searched the world to find my heart is Yours
Oh, my heart is Yours
This girl ain't going anywhere
This girl ain't going anywhere
This girl ain't going anywhere
This girl ain't going anywhere

I searched the world to find my heart is Yours
Yes, my heart is Yours, ohh, oh-oh-oh
I searched the world to find what I'm looking for
I want nothing more
Oh, my heart is Yours
