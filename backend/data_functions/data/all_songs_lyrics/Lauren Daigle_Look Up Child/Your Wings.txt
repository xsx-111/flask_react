Your Wings Lyrics
When ten thousand arrows take flight
Remind me that You are my armor
There's always a place I can hide
When I am desperate for shelter

You're my covering
I'm safe, I'm safe
Whatever comes at me
I'm safe, I'm safe

You got me under Your wings
Under Your wings
I'm under, I'm under Your wings
You got me
You cover me, You cover me
I'm under, I'm under Your wings

With every step that I take
You are before and behind me
In every fear that I face
Oh I'm constantly finding
You're my covering
I'm safe, I'm safe
Whatever comes at me
I'm safe, I'm safe

You got me under Your wings
Under Your wings
I'm under, I'm under Your wings
You got me
You cover me, You cover me
I'm under, I'm under Your wings
You got me under Your wings
Under Your wings
I'm under, I'm under Your wings
You got me
You cover me, You cover me
I'm under, I'm under Your wings

You're my covering
I'm safe, I'm safe
Whatever comes at me
I'm safe, I'm safe
(I'm under, I'm under Your wings)2Embed
