Rebel Heart Lyrics
Lord, I offer up this rebel heart
So stubborn and so restless from the start
I don't want to fight You anymore
So take this rebel heart and make it Yours

Father, I no longer want to run
You've broken my resistance with Your love
And drowned it underneath the crimson spill
So bend this rebel heart into Your will

I give it over to You
I give it over to You
Your love is like an arrow straight and true
And now this rebel heart belongs to You

Help me lay the renegade to rest
Turn the stone inside me back to flesh
And hold me 'til my best defenses fall
And watch this rebel heart surrender all

I give it over to You
I give it over to You
Your love is like an arrow straight and true
And now this rebel heart belongs to You
Take my life and let it be Yours
Take my life and let it be Yours
Take my life and let it be Yours
Take my life and let it be Yours

I give it over to You
I give it over to You
Your love is like an arrow straight and true
And now this rebel heart belongs to You

Now this rebel heart belongs to You
Now this rebel heart belongs to You1Embed
