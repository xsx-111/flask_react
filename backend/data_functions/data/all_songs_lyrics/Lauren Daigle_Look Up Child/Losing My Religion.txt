Losing My Religion Lyrics
I've been an actor on a stage
Playing a role I have to play
I'm getting tired, it's safe to say
Living behind a masquerade

No more performing out of fear
Trying to keep my conscience clear
It all seems so insincere
I'd trade it all to meet You here

I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion

Light a match and watch it burn
To Your heart I will return
No one could love me like You do
Why would I want a substitute

I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
To find You
I'm losing my religion, and finding something new
I need something different, and different looks like You
I'm losing my religion, and finding something new
'Cause I need something different, and different looks like You

I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
I'm losing my religion
To find You, to find You
To find You, to find You
