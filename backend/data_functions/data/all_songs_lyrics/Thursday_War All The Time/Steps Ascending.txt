Steps Ascending LyricsSteps ascend to a loaded gun
The scent of matches hangs in the air
(a lit one flickers out in a hearbeat)
We don't want to see this:
A flash of light that's letting go
Of an empty bullet case
By the time it hits the ground
He's out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach
The wolves are closing in
There's no room left to make amends, but
Do you remember when we'd fly that kite so high?
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
Will burn
In the fire of our regrets
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
It's blood
And it's running down the stairs
Freeze the frame
Between the gun shot and the hole it makes
A spinning bullet hangs in the middle
There's no way to stop it
It will surely hit the mark
You can try to understand
But I'm giving up
Giving up
Giving up
The synapse fires, it's right in time
I'm giving up
Giving up
Giving up
This should always stay
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
Out of reach. (let go, let go.)
The wolves are closing in
There's no room left to make amends, but
Do you remember when we'd fly that kite so high?
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
Will burn
In the fire of our regrets
All the time we've wasted
Spent fighting
It's blood
And it's running down the stairs
I ran down the stairs
And into the garden
Put both my hands into the soil
In the spring
You will bloom
Like her heart
Through the blouse
In the back of the ambulance
As it turned and turned down the street
(one more turn won't you come back to me?)
As it turned on its red lights
You were turning into
Red roses
Red roses
Red roses
Red roses
But I'm not giving upEmbed
