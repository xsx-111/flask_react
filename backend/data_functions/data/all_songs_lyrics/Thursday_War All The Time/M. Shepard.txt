M. Shepard LyricsThe stage is set to rip the wings from a butterfly
The stage is set, the stage is set
Don't forget to breathe
Between the lines if the whole world dies
Then it's safe to take the stage
And these graves will stretch
Like landing strips
Hospitals, all the dead museums
We won't have to be afraid anymore
The crowd is growing silent with the gathering storm
When the curtain falls and you're caught on the other side
(Just trying to keep up the act)
We'll lie in the back of black cars
With the windows rolled up
Joining the precession of emptiness
If we say these words
It will be too late to take them back
So we hold our breath and fold our hands
Like paper planes (and we're going to crash)
We don't have to be alone (don't have to be alone) ever again
There's a riot in the theater
Someone's standing in the aisle
Yelling that the murderers are everywhere and they're lining up
Carving the M in your side
Stand alone
When the curtain falls and you're caught on the other side
(Just trying to keep up the act)
We'll lie in the back of black cars
With the windows rolled up
Joining the precession of emptiness
The stage is set to rip the wings from a butterfly
Pull the curtain back
Kill all the house lights
Pin the dress with lotus flowers
The silk is spinning 'round and around
With the ceiling fan
I'm disappearing into the spotlight
I'm on display
With the butterfly and the scarecrow
With smiles like picket fences, you tie us all up and leave us outside
"That voice is silent now and the boat has sunk..."
We're on our own but we're not going to runEmbed
