Signals Over the Air LyricsThis is what you see when you look in my direction
Incandescent corsets draw eyes tight like wires
This is how it feels calling out but no one even hears
The signals that we send over the air, over the air
Over the air, over the air
When you say my name I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say my name I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio
Is this how it feels
When you don't even fit into your own skin?
And its getting tighter
Every day I'm getting smaller
If I keep holding my breath I'm going to disappear
When you say my name I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say my name I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio
There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
If I keep holding my breath, all of this will fade away
If you keep driving we'll be lying in the wreck
Changing the shape folding like an envelope to keep each other in
Shattered glass, broken looks, and mascara gets
Washed away by windshield wiper blades safe, safe
When you say my name I want to split it from your lips
And hide like whispers in the rain
When you say my name I want to stop it in your lungs
And collect all of your blood to put in the radio
There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
There's no where to hide
They stole the love from our lives to put the sex on the radio
Yeah that's where we hide
The love and lies and sex, on the radioEmbed
