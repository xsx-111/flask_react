Division St. Lyrics
Lights out on Division Street
And all the hate that rises
Through the cracks in the pavement
As the temperature falls
(This is where it hits the ground)

Lights out on Division Street
I'm repeating
Goodbye to the memories
(The fever that will not break)
The night is pouring down
It's not enough to put this out
I'll burn up before I wake up
(On Division Street)

This is serious
This is serious
If this is serious
I'll hide my heart in dark parades

Lights out on Division Street
I held you tight like an empty bottle
But the glass broke
(And the poison spilled out of your mouth)
Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?
The house turned black and sat in silence
(While a mockingbird sang)
La la la la la la la
Listen to yourself
(La la la la la)
Go on and on
As if you spoke to someone else
(La la la la la)
Lights out on Division Street
I'm repeating
Goodbye to the memories
(The fever that will not break)
The night is pouring down
It's not enough to put this out
I'll burn up before I wake up
(On Division Street)

This is serious
This is serious
If this is serious
I'll hide my heart in dark parades

Dance between the scissors blades
Without getting cut
I drew an X on your city's name
Lights out
Black out
Blow out the candle again
Spin the room around
Fall down
Pass out
Get up
I can't keep repeating
Between the footsteps I hear crickets in the trees
A silent army marching with me through a swarm of bees
A needle dragged across a record slowing down
Along Division Street the lights were dying out
(Endless rows of houses stretched on for miles and miles and miles)
Turn the windows black

Lights out on Division Street
Repeating
Repeat it
Lights out on Division Street
Repeating
Turn the windows black
Lights out
Lights out
Lights out
Turn the windows black
La la la la la la
(Lights out
Lights out
Lights out
Turn the windows black)
Listen to yourselfEmbed
