This Song Brought to You by a Falling Bomb LyricsDo you hear the jet plane yawning miles across the sky?
Do you hear the garbage truck back down the boulevard
Setting off the car alarms as it passes by?
Do you hear the static of one thousand detuned radios?
Shut the window, love
Keep the world outside
I don't want to think about anyone
But the footsteps are getting louder
Drowning out the sound of the rain
As it knocks on the windowsill
I'm not answering the phone, let it ring
Lately I've been feeling like a falling bomb
The ground is getting closer and the sky is falling down
This song has been brought to you
This song has been brought to you
By a falling bomb
