Between Rupture and Rapture Lyrics
In the veins of the ultraviolet light
Phosphor is starting a fire
Shooting up in the iodine
It's turning on

(Rupture, rupture) Rupture the wall around my heart
I feel so lost
I've been shaking
You can't save me
(Forget what the doctor said)
Every bird in mid-flight is calling out your name
Before it hits the window and it sings the rapture

Without a second opinion
The chemicals saturate
(To counteract the code)
Through the double-helix we are twisting
(Too scared to let this go)
Someone call the head nurse
She's coming to the capitol
To wrap us up and throw us in the dirt
With a dream that's turning off
(Rupture, rupture) Rupture the wall around my heart
I feel so lost
I've been shaking
You can't save me
(Forget what the doctor said)
Every bird in mid-flight is calling out your name
Before it hits the window and it sings the rapture

We're coming to the capitol
We are coming to the capitol
The distance between us will rupture
(Coming to the capitol)
In our hearts the disease won't touch us
(Coming to the capitol)

(Love) Now it's too late
(Love) To turn this off
Alone is all we are
Even when we feel this close
It's just a lie we believe
These are the words that escape from our lungs
Rupture the wall built around my heart
I've been shaking
You can't save me
I'm turning off
We can't find a way
(Out of this moment)
(We're lost in a dark hallway)Embed
