Waiting To Hit Lyrics
Waiting to

In the morning glow with light so low
The day begins as night shields her skin
In the aftermath of the long dark past
I'm beginning to see the light
Through drunken days and spinning scenes
The lifting of weight that God's freedom brings
Till genius awakes with hungover snakes
And remembers the dreams one more
Tossed from bed to floor

Sometime, somewhere just when you think it couldn't get any worse
It'll hit you unaware and you realise:
It sure as hell ain't gonna get any better
So tune into the radio and listen to the words we say
Tune into the T.V. show, when we will appear to show you the way
Homeward to the Promised Land

The stars did align in nineteen ninety-nine
When we getting ready for the moment to shine
With luck, star-struck
On the front of the storm we shall be born
Under the red and the blue and the white
These angels will take flight
Sometime, somewhere just when you think it couldn't get any worse
It'll hit you unaware and you realise:
It's gonna get far worse before it gets better
So turn your heads to the starry skies above
Give those sore eyes a sight
When the host of heavenly Angels takes flight
With crippled wings and songs to sing

Just a stupid ranch hand in a Texas rock band
Trying to understand God's master plan
When the Lord said "Son! Tell the world before it explodes
The glory of the Texas-Jerusalem Crossroads."
I said "Lord I'll make you a deal;
I will if you give me a smash hit so I can build a 'city on a hill'."
And He said "Son! I will if you will."
I said "My sweet Lord, it's a deal."

Waiting to hit with crippled wings
Waiting to hit with songs to sing
Waiting to hit the silver screen
Waiting to hit the scene
So we approach the grand conclusion
When the world receives its retribution
On the eve of our destruction
Standing at the edge looking over
Waiting to hit the center stage
At such a gold and tender age
Shot forth out of the miry clay
Cuttin' all the corners along the way
Born in a manger covered in after-birth
We're taking her for all she's worth
With stars above, lone star below
Upon the earth a star is bornEmbed
