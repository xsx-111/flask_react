To Guard And To Guide You Lyrics
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echo back their joyous strains
Marching on toward Zion
Marching on toward Zion

Under the X in Texas
Is where you'll find me, it's where I'll be
Singing out the songs
Warnin' the world of the perils to come
With a cloud by day and a cloud by night
Forced out of 'The Garden Of Earthly Delights'
And one by one the states will know
As they crumble like Jericho
From Canada to Mexico
That Texas is the rock
To lift you up when your words collide
With the angels to guard and the angels to guide
Upon this truth you can rely
So take two steps toward Texas tonight
For the sheep shall flock
To the call of that mighty Texas rock
Singing:
"Angel of God, my guardian dear
To whom God's love commits me here
Ever this day be at my side
To light, to rule
To guard and to guide."

Angel dons the metaphor
Swings open wide those prison doors
There's going to be a war
To end all war
When your heart hears the call
Feels the weight of the fall
And the gravity of life's circumstance pulls you down
Follow your fate to the Lone Star state
And join us as we sing along:

"Angel of God, my guardian dear
To whom God's love commits me here
Ever this day be at my side
To light, to rule
To guard and to guide."

If you survive the coming rains
And the crash and the tide of the latter days
You can secure your slot and fall in rank
With the crippled and the faint
As the saints go marching on toward Zion
With guns in hand
As the saints go marching on toward Zion
With guns in hand
As the saints go marching on toward Zion
With guns in hand
Singing:
"Angel of God, my guardian dear
To whom God's love commits me here
Ever this day be at my side
To light, to rule
To light, to rule
To light, to rule
To guard and to guide."

Take two steps toward Texas tonight
Take two steps toward Texas tonight
"Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains
To teach the world to sing
In perfect harmony
"As for me and my house
We will not go gently."
Now the time has come when you must decide
To take two steps toward Texas tonight

So follow the Lone Star in the sky
And beg for the angels to guard and to guideEmbed
