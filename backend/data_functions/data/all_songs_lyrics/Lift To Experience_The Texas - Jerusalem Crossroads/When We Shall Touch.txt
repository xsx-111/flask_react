When We Shall Touch Lyrics
Falling, just angels falling
When we shall touch
The worlds will shake
When these touch down and storm
Just angels falling
And if I don't make the climb
To the higher times
Know that in my heart
I'm still your man

“Adam, Heaven’s high behest no preface needs:
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard; and Death
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress
Defeated of his seizure many days
Given thee of grace; wherein thou mayest repent
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayest cover: Well may then thy Lord, appeased
Redeem thee quite from Death’s rapacious claim;
But longer in this Paradise to dwell
Permits not: to remove thee I am come
And send thee from the garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil
He added not; for Adam at the news
Heart-struck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood
That all his senses bound.”
“Oh unexpected stroke, worse than of death!
Must I thus leave thee, Paradise? thus leave
Thee, native soil, these happy walks and shades
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend
Quiet though sad, the respite of that day
That must be mortal to us both. Oh flowers
That never will in other climate grow
My early visitation, and my last
At even, which I bred up with tender hand
From the first opening bud, and gave ye names
Who now shall rear ye to the sun, or rank
Your tribes, and water from the ambrosial fount?
Thee lastly, nuptial bower, by me adorned
With what to sight or smell was sweet, from thee
How shall I part, and whither wander down
Into a lower world; to this obscure
And wild? how shall we breathe in other air
Less pure, accustomed to immortal fruits?”
“Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or named
Of them the highest; for such of shape may seem
Prince above princes, gently hast thou told
Thy message, which might else in telling wound
And in performing end us; what besides
Of sorrow, and dejection, and despair
Our frailty can sustain, thy tidings bring
Departure from this happy place, our sweet
Recess, and only consolation left
Familiar to our eyes, all places else
Inhospitable appear, and desolate;
Nor knowing us, nor known: And, if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of Him who all things can, I would not cease
To weary him with my assiduous cries:
But prayer against his absolute decree
No more avails than breath against the wind
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth:
Therefore to his great bidding
I submit.”
Just angels falling
Wings weighing soft
Just angels falling
Wings weighing soft
Just angels falling
Wings weighing soft
Just angels falling
Wings weighing soft
Wings weighing softEmbed
