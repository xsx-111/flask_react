Falling From Cloud 9 Lyrics
Rising to the top knowing I must fall
Refeathered wings, salt the strings to remake the crawl
To the top
And then take the fall again
Blood soaked, gagged and choked, lined face on stone
Stripped bare, sucking in air
This is my home, it seems
With rock and the hard place stuck between
The Godman Christ cause cursed man to the test
And this Goddamned cross crushed into my chest
I'm still doing my best

And so the winter time comes calling
Through the skies I'm crawling, from cloud nine, I've fallen
And then the foolish times rush in
It's no longer mine, life on cloud nine

Place your dreams in a bottle, smash it to the ground
Slip off you slippers and dance all around
It's blood baby, it's just blood baby
It's just blood baby, it's just your precious blood

I've come this far and I said I'd go all the way
But these fevered winds sway stronger each day
And I'm fool's gold, and my heart's not right
But I'd still sell what's left in my soul just to pay the tithe
Shot down the glory of my prime
Only to find the bullets were divine
So don't speak to me of heavens above
'cos Cloud 9 is where I've fallen from
Carry on the wayward son, the way that lovers doEmbed
