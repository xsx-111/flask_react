With Crippled Wings Lyrics
Yeah the storms will surely come
As sure as the sun sets in the sky it shall be done
From that city on the hill
We're gonna wait it out till the winds do still
At the pay for view, for the chosen few
Yeah the storms will surely come, sure as that setting sun

All aboard the engine number nine
Those bound for the Jordan on Texas state line
Here at the shelter for the saints
You'll find rest for the weary and the faint
Dry amidst the deluge in our city of refuge

From Athens to London to Paris to Rome
The stars are gonna shine
From here to Palestine
When the angels take flight
Deep from the heart of the dark Texas night

So begins the Exodus
To the land of the unclouded day
With blood bought ticket in your hand
Carving out a 'trail of tears' along the way
Travelling ever homeward under
A crippled, angry, new America
Travelling ever homeward under
A crippled, angry, new America
On that railroad underground
(Travelling ever homeward under)
Those bound toward Texas till that great whistle sounds
(A crippled, angry, new America)
And if the train does the tracks
(Travelling ever homeward under)
Don't think for a second that you're getting your money back
(A crippled, angry, new America)
No exchanges, no refunds
(New America, new America)
Onward on foot till you see the rise of the Texas sun
(Our song)
And if you make it over the Jordan
You still have to make it through the night
And if you reach the Holy City
It won't be without a fight

And at that final resting place
We shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty's saving grace
And when the bough does break
Under the Bible Belt we're safe
Where there'll be no hitting allowed
From a single storm cloud

From Athens to London to Paris to Rome
The stars are gonna shine
From here to Palestine
When the angels take flight
Deep from the heart of the dark Texas night
With crippled wingsEmbed
