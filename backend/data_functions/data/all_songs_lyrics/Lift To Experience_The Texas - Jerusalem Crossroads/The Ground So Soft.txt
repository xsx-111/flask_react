The Ground So Soft Lyrics
Lord rescue me
Place your hand underneath my wings
And lift me up above the raging sea
And carry me to your shore
Place my body upon the rocks
Where the farthest I can fall is to the ground so soft
And in the coming days, when the waters rage
Help me to clearly see above the sea, Lord
Lord you ask so much
For someone with so little to give
This ain't my life and it never will be
I'm just trying to endure the sea, Lord

If you choose to let me sink to the floor
Of this ocean's bed
And let the waves come crashing down
Up above my head
I'm gonna take the rope from the millstone that's
Tied around my neck
And with body bound for death wrap my feet back up
Underneath my legs
So when I sink to the bottom of this deep dark sea
I will wait for Thee on bended knee
Death where is thy sting?
Grave where is thy victory?
For my saviour will come and rescue me
And redeem his treasure at the bottom of the sea
And when that light breaks through the clouds
We're all gonna sing and we're all gonna shout
When the death shall rise from their resting place
And sing the chorus to "Amazing Grace"
Lord rescue me, place your hand underneath my wings
Lift me up above the raging sea
And carry me to your shoreEmbed
