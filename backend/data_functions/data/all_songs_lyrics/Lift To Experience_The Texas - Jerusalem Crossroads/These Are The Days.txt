These Are The Days Lyrics
These are the days
Marching toward us with visions in their eyes
These are the days
Racing toward us with blood on their teeth and lips

And I can hardly wait to hear that great trumpet sound
Pouring down out across the land

These, these are the days that must happen to you
These, these are the days that must happen to you

These are the days that must happen to you
Bloody times ahead for God's chosen few
With our instruments swords, weapons of war
Marching around the city seven times

And I can hardly wait to hear that great trumpet sound
Pouring down out across... out across the land

So we approach the end, when God judges man's sin
Yeah the time is running thin
Let the countdown begin
Four... three... two... one...
Yeah the whole world is gonna shake
When The Levee Breaks
And it feels the wrath
Of God's terrible swift sword

(These, these are the days that must happen to you)
These are the days that must happen to you
These are the days that must happen to you
Christ is the word, Christ is the word
These are the days that must happen to you
(These, these are the days that must happen to you)
These are the times that must happen to you
These are the things that must come out of love
To bring out the best to bring out the worst
Times of it all

These are the days that must happen to you
The stars are aligned for all God's chosen few
These are the days that must happen to you
The stars are aligned for all God's chosen few
So all you haircut bands, doing headstands
Thinking you'll turn the world upside down
Put your guitars up over your shoulders
A new sort of experience is taking over
'cos we're simply the best band in the whole damn land
And 'Texas Is The Reason'
The city is ours for the taking
And a host of many
More Heavenly angels
Are on their way
These are the daysEmbed
