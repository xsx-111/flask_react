Down With The Prophets Lyrics
Stubborn horses standing on the lead rope
No other forces but you keep holding back
Off God's track
On a mission impossible
To lead the troops out of the enemy's hand
Into the promised land
Headed to Texas where it's safe and dry
The ground is rough but so is life
And this ain't your life
Headed to Texas with gun in hand
To set our feet upon a dry land

Down with the prophets who speak the words
And warn us of the perils through song and verse
Here's my body I lay it down
Give my head to receive my crown
Let's cut the heads off the John The Baptists
Bring them on an altar to the King
For the songs that they sing
Those wretched, wretched things
This is the lot of the chosen
Who give their lives just to save a
Few more chosen few
What's a boy to do when he's seen the truth?
And when the profits peak, the prophets speak
"We are troubled on ev'ry side
Yet not distressed, perplexed
But not in despair
Persecuted, but not forsaken
Cast down but not destroyed."
Yeah this is the drink, stronger than you think
Shaken but not stirred
And if you want to survive put the cup to your mouth
And turn your body to the south

And if you go or if you stay
We could give a horse's ass either way
Just trying to feed
The stubborn horses standing on the lead rope

The coming revival will be one of survival
The coming revival will be one of survival
And if you wanna survive
You gonna keep your heads
Down with the prophets, down with the prophets
Down with the prophets, down with the prophets
Down with the prophets, down with the prophets
Down with the prophets, down with the prophets
Down with the prophets, down with the prophets
Down with the prophets, down with the prophets
We sing these songs because we have to
Not because we want to
We sing these songs because we have to
Not because we want to
Just doing our part trying to feed
Stubborn horses standing on the lead rope
And all of rock and roll until now was to
Give a place for the angels to spread their wings
With songs to sing, with songs to sing
And when the rock starts to roll
Know that the bell soon will toll
We are the ones that told you so
The angels are coming with bells on
The angels are coming with bells on
The angels are coming with bells on
Behold, the angels are coming with bells on

And you may not need God now
But you'll need Him then
After all the alcohol
When the room really starts to buzzEmbed
