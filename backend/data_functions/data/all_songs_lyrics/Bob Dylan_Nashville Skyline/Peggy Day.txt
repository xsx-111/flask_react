Peggy Day Lyrics
Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day

Peggy Night makes my future look so bright
Man, that girl is out of sight
Love to spend the day with Peggy Night

Well, ya' know that even before I learned her name
Ya' know I loved her just the same
And I tell ’em all, wherever I may go
Just so they’ll know, that she my little lady
And I love her so

Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
Turned my skies to blue from gray
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day


Peggy Day stole my poor heart away
By golly, what more can I say?
Love to spend the night with Peggy Day
Love to spend the night with Peggy DayEmbed
