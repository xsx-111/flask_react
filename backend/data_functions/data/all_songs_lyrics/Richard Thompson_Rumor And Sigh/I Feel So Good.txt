I Feel So Good Lyrics
I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
I feel so good I'm gonna take someone apart tonight
They put me in jail for my deviant ways
Two years seven months and sixteen days
Now I'm back on the street in a purple haze

And I feel so good
And I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight

I feel so good I'm gonna make somebody's day tonight
I feel so good I'm gonna make somebody pay tonight
I'm old enough to sin but I'm too young to vote
Society been dragging on the tail of my coat
Now I've got a suitcase full of fifty pound notes
And a half-naked woman with her tongue down my throat

And I feel so good
And I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
They made me pay for the things I've done
Now it's my turn to have all the fun
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight

And I feel so good
I feel so good
Well I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
Oh Oh Oh
I feel so good I'm gonna break somebody's heart tonight
Mmm break somebody's heart
Break somebody's heart
Mmm break somebody's heart
Ooh break somebody's heart2Embed
