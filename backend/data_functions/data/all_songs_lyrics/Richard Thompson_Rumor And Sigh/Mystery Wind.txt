Mystery Wind Lyrics
Mystery wind blowing tonight
Driving rain, close up tight
Don't leave a crack for the rain to get in
Don't leave a hole for the mystery wind

From some other time and some other place
Mystery wind make a fool say grace
Lord above how great thou art
Mystery wind blowing right through your heart

Ah whistling down from out of this world
Take an honest man away from his girl
Stir up trouble in a married man's bed
Make you say things better left unsaid
The mystery wind
The mystery wind

It's a cruel wind, screams and moans
Don't know where from, don't know where it goes
Rustling the leaves around your door
Cold cold fingers through the cracks in the floor
The mystery wind
Ah can't you smell it, you can almost feel it
Mystery wind, you just can't see it
Foul your water and steal your bread
Wake up things better left for dead

Mystery wind ,are you strong enough
To fight for your right when the time gets tough?
Plague and hunger and burning rain
Too many good men blown away
By the mystery wind
The mystery wind

It's a cruel wind, screams and moans
Don't know where from, don't know where it goes
Rustling the leaves around your door
Cold cold fingers through the cracks in the floor
The mystery wind

Ah, mystery wind blowing tonight
Driving rain, close up tight
Don't leave a crack for the rain to get in
Don't leave a hole for the mystery wind
For the mystery windEmbed
