I Misunderstood LyricsShe said "Darling I'm in love with your mind
The way you care for me, it's so kind
Love to see you again, I wish I had more time"
She was laughing as she brushed my cheek
"Why don't you call me, angel, maybe next week
Promise now, cross your heart and hope to die"
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
Things I tried to put shine in her eyes
Wire wheels and shimmering things
Wild nights when the whole world seemed to fly
She said "The thing that's so unique
When we're together we don't have to speak
We'll always be such good friends, you and I"
Oh but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good bye
But I misunderstood, but I misunderstood, but I misunderstood
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying good
I thought she was saying good luck, she was saying goodbyeEmbed
