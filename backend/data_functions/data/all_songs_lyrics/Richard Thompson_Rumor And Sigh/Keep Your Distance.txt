Keep Your Distance Lyrics
If I cross your path again
Who knows where, who knows when
On some morning without number
On some highway without end
Don't grasp my hand and say
Fate has brought you here today
Oh, fate is only fooling with us, friend

Keep your distance
Oh, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me
What can I do but fall?
Keep your distance
Keep your distance
Ah, with us it must be all or none at all

It's a desperate game we play
Throw our souls, our lives away
Wounds that can't be mended
And debts that can't be paid
Oh, I played and I got stung
Now I'm biting back my tongue
I'm sweeping out the footprints where I strayed
Keep your distance
Keep your distance
When I feel you close to me
What can I do but fall?
Keep your distance
Oh, keep your distance
With us it must be all or none at all


Keep your distance
Oh, keep your distance
When I feel you close to me
What can I do but fall?
Keep your distance
Oh, keep your distance
With us it must be all or none at all
With us it must be all or none at all
With us it must be all or none at allEmbed
