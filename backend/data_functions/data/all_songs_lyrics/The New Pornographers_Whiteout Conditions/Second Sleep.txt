Second Sleep Lyrics
Been awake for awhile, going deep
Going long, rifling through what I keep
In the floats, what we found, under glass
All the hours filled with Hail Mary passes
It all sort of fastens to you as you sleep

Been awake, thinking fast, cannot sleep
Second thoughts, second rate Socrates
At dream's door, feeling flat, searching high
Left outside, like a vampire in light
At this time of the morning you'd swear it was night

It's enough living proof of the use of lights on (Lights on, lights on)
It's enough living proof of the use of lights on (Lights on, lights on)

Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhile
Been awake for awhileEmbed
