Colosseums Lyrics
Colosseums, colosseums of the mind

Colosseums, colosseums of the mind
An ancient con, the shadow of a song
Exhibitions, international in size
I close my eyes, I can see the lion

Colosseums, colosseums of the mind
Right on time, celebration in the ruin
Elation is moving in a wave
I avert my gaze, but still I see the lions

Say it like a soothsayer
On repeat for days
Don't listen when the fool says
You can't fool your way
You can't fool your way

Colosseums, colosseums of the mind
A scalper's price, built into the design
Jubilations, lively up the place
Look in my face, you can see the lion
Say it like a soothsayer
It will keep for days
Don't listen when the fool says
You can't fool your way
You can't fool your way
Say it like a soothsayer
On repeat for days
Don't listen when the fool says
You can't fool your way
Say it like a soothsayer
It will keep for days
Don't listen when the fool says
You can't fool your way
You can't fool your wayEmbed
