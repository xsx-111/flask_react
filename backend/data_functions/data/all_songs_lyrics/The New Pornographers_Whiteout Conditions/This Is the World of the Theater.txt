This Is the World of the Theater Lyrics
Since they've come, I've tried to go it straight
But I've got no clue how to
Was gonna make it up just now, try to
Come up with some high-brow move
Kid gloves, and stranger loves you've known
You sort it out somehow
You used to chime in quietly, you sing
But you're a moaner now
Think of all the life we're saving
Think of all the waves we're breaking

Is it too late to live in your heart
Too late to burn all your civilian clothes?
As you break into a million parts
Too late to learn it?  Yes, we're all elbows

Conquerors at the daybreak
Conquerors at the daybreak
This is the world of the theater
This is the world of the theater
All the phantom minor notes they passed
You on your way to dying
They called you from their hiding places on
The shoulders of your giants
Think of all the cold they're braving
Think of all the ways we're caving

Is it too late to live in your heart
Too late to burn all your civilian clothes?
As you break into a million parts
Too late to learn it, will it come to blows?

Conquerors at the daybreak
Conquerors at the daybreak
This is the world of the theater
This is the world of the theater

Is it too late to live in your heart
Too late to burn all your civilian clothes?
As you break into a million parts
Too late to learn it? Yes, we're all elbows
Conquerors at the daybreak
Conquerors at the daybreak
Conquerors at the daybreak
Conquerors at the daybreak
This is the world of the theater
This is the world of the theaterEmbed
