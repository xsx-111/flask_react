Play Money Lyrics
I only play for money, honey
Look at what this run has done to me
It has me gunning for the country
Skies memory and moonless
A vision copied from the bootlegs
We are out of tune so mostly tuneless
For a fee, I'll fight any foe
For a fee, I'll take any blow

I only play it cool and bruising
But only when my lips are moving
You've been careful here to keep the tempo
Only play with money, careful
Not to trigger some reversal
And to live by an obscure example
For a fee, I'll fight any foe
For a fee, I'll stop any show

I know, have an eye on you to get this right
Have an eye on you to climb these heights
Have an eye on you, oops, pay-per-view
I had to know
I beat the path of least resistance
Over the hills and out of wisdom
And just when I thought we beat the system
I knew a gentleman of leisure
He loved to talk about his treasure
And of how he got it for a song, song, song, song
For a fee, I'll right any wrong
For a fee, I'll right any wrong
For a fee, I'll fight any foe
For a fee, I'll stop any show

I know, have an eye on you to get this right
Have an eye on you to climb these heights
Have an eye on you, oops, pay-per-view
I had to know
Have an eye on you to get this right
Have an eye on you to climb these heights
Have an eye on you, oops, pay-per-view
I had to know

Only live for happy endings
Stop them like we started
Pardon my affinity for clothes and Clueless
Never been an opportunist
I accept the prize if I somehow surprise us all and get there soonest
I only play for money, honey
I only play with money, honey
I only play with money, honey
I only play with money, honey
The song (The song)Embed
