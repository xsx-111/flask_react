Juke Lyrics
Been through here, crystal ball
You crashed, shattered into souls above you
There are rules here, into shapes
You can, can and so you will surrender

Juke you, juke you, juke you
(Feels like the dawn took you out)
Juke you, juke you, juke you
(Feels like the dawn took you out)

You pass through here, on the way to call
Call to tell us "stop, surrender"
Some of you feel it has come to pass
At last, last September, what? You lost me

Juke you, juke you, juke you
(Feels like the dawn took you out)
Juke you, juke you, juke you
(Feels like the dawn took you out)
Took you out, took you out, took you out, took you out
Took you out, took you out, took you out, took you out
Been through here, some of you can run
Underneath the world beyond earth
Been through here, crystal ball
You crashed, shattered into souls above me

Some of you
Some of you get life
Some of you
Some of you get lifetime
Some of you
Some of you will run
Some of you
Some will feel the strange cold
Some of you will run
Be 
Some will take a lifetime

Juke you, juke you, juke you
(Feels like the dawn took you out)
Juke you, juke you, juke you
(Feels like the dawn took you out)
Took you out, took you out, took you out, took you out
Took you out, took you out, took you out, took you out
Juke you, juke you, juke you
Juke you, juke you, juke youEmbed
