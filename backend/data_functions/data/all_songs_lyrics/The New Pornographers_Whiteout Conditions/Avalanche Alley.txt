Avalanche Alley Lyrics
Cover your eyes! Surprise, your fate
It's only an avalanche away, you're safe
It's only a scratch, you're great
Several years after the flood
Your singularity under the gun
So late, so late to the game, so late
We thought it was wise to wait

Sent you blues from the lost world
News from the future
Blues from the lost world
News from the future

Several miles behind the wave
We needed to cross the ocean
We missed the ride
Lord knows we could use a ride
You summon the breath to finally say
"It's only an avalanche away", feels right
And you can stay here tonight
Yeah, you can stay here tonight
Sent you blues from the lost world
News from the future
Blues from the lost world
News from the future

Better angels formed the cottage industry
The testimonials, warning weather
Rules of the house
Are all graffiti scrawled
Ceremony calls for tar and feathers
Jewels in your crown
Are loud and proudly fake
Ceremony calls for overthrowing

Consigned to the dustbins
Of bloodlines turned away
Defined by the daylight, which we found in Avalanche Alley
Controlled demolitions
Of the times, far away
In line for the festival that we call Avalanche Alley

Blues from the lost world
News from the future
Blues from the lost world
News from the futureEmbed
