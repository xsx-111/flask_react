Darling Shade Lyrics
When you add your voice to bad choices
Then your not-so-white becomes mannered
Stripping down the walls like quicksilver
Dripping down as slowly as solvent

And for you, the Pulitzer Prize
For stepping into traffic
Now the new, the Americas
You broke through, you're laughing

We have found no use for the profane
Searching for the gods in our corners
With the ignorance of a poet
An unbreakable focus of mortars

Darling, shade or shadow
Darling, shade or shadow

Was the singer from the bad choices
Or a singer without a pretense
When you give your mind to your voices
You accept the terms of your sentence
And for you the Pulitzer Prize
For time served, you're walking
Now the new, the Americas
You broke through, it's nothing

Darling, shade or shadow
Darling, shade or shadow

You can get to climb the new tower
Thinking you could learn a new language
Don't you want to turn a few favors
Since you left everybody hanging

Darling, shade or shadow
Darling, shade or shadow
Darling, shade or shadow
Darling, shade or shadowEmbed
