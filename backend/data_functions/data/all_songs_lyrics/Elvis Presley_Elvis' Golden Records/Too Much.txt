Too Much Lyrics
Well, honey, I love you too much
I need your lovin' too much
Want the thrill of your touch
Well, gee, I can't love you too much
You do all the livin' while I do all the givin'
'Cause I love you too much

Well, you spend all my money too much
I have to share you, honey, too much
When I want some loving', you're gone
Don't you know you're treatin' your daddy wrong
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much

I need your lovin' all the time
Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close
Please, please hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much
Well, every time I kiss your sweet lips
I can feel my heart go flip-flip
I'm such a fool for your charms
Take me back, baby, in your arms
Like to hear you sighin'
Even though I know you're lyin'
'Cause I love you too much
I need your lovin' all the time
Need you huggin', please be mine
Need you near me, stay real close
Please, please hear me, you're the most
Now you got me started
Don't you leave me broken-hearted
'Cause I love you too much2Embed
