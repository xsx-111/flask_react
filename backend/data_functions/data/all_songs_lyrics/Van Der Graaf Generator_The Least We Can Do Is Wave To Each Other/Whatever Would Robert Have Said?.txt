Whatever Would Robert Have Said? Lyrics
I am the suck of air you take
That you've had many times before;
I am the blow you try to fake
But which still throws you out the door;
I am the air that fills your lungs
But leaves you emptier below;
I am the void that you can't explain
But which is where you want to go

Flame sucks between the balls of steel;
Nothing moves, the air itself congeals

Look at the flame if you want to
Hear the sharp crack of the fission
Smell the brief vapour of ozone
Feel static motion

I am the love you try to hide
But which all can understand;
I am the hate you still deny
Though the blood is on your hands;
I am the peace you're searching for
But you know you'll never find;
I am the pain you can't endure
But which tingles in your mind
Flame sucks between the balls of steel;
Nothing moves, the air itself congeals

Look at the flame if you want to
Hear the sharp crack of the fission
Smell the brief vapour of ozone
Feel static motion

I am the joy you really pay for
But which comes completely free;
I am your god on the final day
For the truth is you are me...Embed
