Refugees LyricsNorth was somewhere years ago and cold
Ice locked the people's hearts and made them old
South was birth to pleasant lands, but dry
I walked the waters' depths and played my mind
East was dawn, coming alive in the golden sun
The winds came gently, several heads became one
In the summertime, though august people sneered
We were at peace, and we cheered
We walked along, sometimes hand in hand
Between the thin lines marking sea and sand
Smiling very peacefully
We began to notice that we could be free
And we moved together
To the West
West is where all days will someday end
Where the colours turn from grey to gold
And you can be with the friends
And light flakes the golden clouds above
West is Mike and Susie
West is where I love
There we shall spend our final days of our lives
Tell the same old stories
Yeah, well, at least we tried
So into the West, smiles on our faces, we'll go
Oh, yes, and our apologies to those
Who'll never really know the way
We're refugees, walking away from the life
That we've known and loved
Nothing to do nor say, nowhere to stay
Now we are alone
We're refugees, carrying all we own
In brown bags, tied up with string
Nothing to think, it doesn't mean a thing
But we can be happy on our own
West is Mike and Susie
West is Mike and Susie
West is where I love
West is refugees' homeEmbed
