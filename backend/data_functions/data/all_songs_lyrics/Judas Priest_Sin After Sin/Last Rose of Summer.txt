Last Rose of Summer Lyrics
Throughout the soft and timeless days of August
Till now the shadows begin to grow much longer
The sunset's fire has deepened blood red
I give you this, the last rose of summer

A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mantle stills the earth
And all around seems dead and cold, this rose
Reminds you of a time when all was warm and living

Do not despair, mother nature simply rests
In sleep she has well earned
Till one day, not so very far from now
With the opening of the first rose bud, I shall return

A token of my unyielding love
So that when winter's mettle steals the earth
And all around seems dead and cold, this rose
Reminds you of a time when all was warm and living

The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
In your long shadows, the last rose of summer
In the sunset, the last rose of summer
Take this rose that I give you
The last rose of summer, the last rose of summer
Don't worry about the winter, the last rose of summer
I shall return, the last rose of summer
The last rose of summer...Embed
