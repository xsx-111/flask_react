Starbreaker Lyrics
Look out, here's Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every little heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never seen again

Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

Paradise is waiting
For the chosen few
Let's hope maybe this time
He picks me and you
Star voyage to a new world
Light-year miles away
Cross your fingers, here he is
Take us now this day
Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high

Starbreaker, take my hand
Starbreaker, understand
Starbreaker, you're the one
Starbreaker, lead us on and on


Look out, here's Starbreaker
Cruisin' into town
Set his mind to stealin'
Every heart around
Step out on the sidewalks
If you're feeling game
He comes but once a lifetime
Never ever seen again, oh
 
Starbreaker
Glides in from the sky
Starbreaker
Takes you up so high
Starbreaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker, breaker
Starbreaker
Starbreaker...Embed
