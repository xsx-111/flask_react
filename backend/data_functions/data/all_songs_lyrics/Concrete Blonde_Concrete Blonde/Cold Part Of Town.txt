Cold Part Of Town LyricsDear darling
Haven't seen you in a while
Found some change in my pocket
I thought I'd take a chance and dial
I'm all right
Just right now, a little down
'Cause it gets chilly over here
It's a cold part of town
Dear darling
You were right about them all
When my luck went bad
They never came around or called
That's all right
'Cause I don't miss them anyhow
But it gets chilly over here, sometimes
It's a cold part of town
(Chorus) Cold part of town
Cold part of town
I'll go now
There's someone waiting for the phone
It's raining out
It's getting dark and I'm alone
Can I call ya (you)?
And can I sometime come around?
Well, it gets chilly over here sometimes
It's a cold part of town
And it gets lonely over here, sometimes
Cold part of town
And it gets lonely over here.....
(Chorus) Cold part of town
Cold part of town (sounds like: It's been a while and I still think about you)
Cold part of town (I know right where I am)
Cold part of town (Woahh)
Cold part of townEmbed
