Song For Kim (She Said) LyricsOh, Kim
Your diary said
The voices calling you from the edge
They finally called you away
You know I hear them too
They're telling me to stay
Oh, Kim
Remember when
We had a million plans
And we believed them
Angry words ring in my head
I'd give every song I got in me
To bring it back again
She said I could
She said hold on, hold out
'Cause it's good
She said you're right
She said hold on, hold out
'Cause I know that you can fight
I know that you can
You're right again
There is an easy way
Out of this world
I'm staying
I wonder why
It may be all I have
But it's mine, it's mine
She said I could
She said hold on, hold out
'Cause it's good
She said you're right
She said hold on, hold out
'Cause I know that you can fight
I know that you can
She said
(Kim used to say)
I could
(I know you could)
She said hold on
(Hold on)
Hold out
(Hang on)
'Cause it's good
She said
(Kim used to say)
You're right
(You know you're right)
She said hold on
(Hold on)
Hold out
(Hang on)
'Cause I know that you can fight
I know that you canEmbed
