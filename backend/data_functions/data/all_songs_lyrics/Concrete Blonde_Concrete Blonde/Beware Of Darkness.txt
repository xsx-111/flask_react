Beware Of Darkness LyricsWatch out, now, take care, beware of fallen singers
Dropping all around you
The pain that often mingles
In your fingertips
Beware of darkness
Watch out, now, take care and beware of thoughts that linger
Winding up inside your head
The hopelessness around you
In the dead of night
Beware of sadness
It can hit you
It can hurt you
Make you sore and what is more
That is not what you are here for
Here for
Watch out, now, take care and beware of softshoe shufflers
Dancing down the sideboards
As each unconscious sufferer
Wanders aimlessly
Beware of darkness
Watch out now, take care, beware of greedy leaders
They take you where you should not go
While weeping at the cedars
They just won't grow
Beware of darknessEmbed
