True LyricsWell when I've had enough
I'll get a pick-up truck and I'll drive away
I'll take my last ten bucks just as far as it will go
Ahh sometimes I'm easily fooled
I take a painful step and I get knocked back two
I do all I can and it's all I can do, but I'm true
And if I had the choice I'd take the voice I got
Cause it was hard to find
You know I've come too far to wind up right back where I started
Ahh they tell me who I should be
I'll never let the monkeys make a mess out of me
I give all I can and it's all I can do
But I'm true
One more sunset
Lay my head down - true
One more sunrise
Open my eyes up - true
And then they talk you up and then they talk you down
And you begin to doubt
Sometimes the reasons seem so very far away
Ahh but I'd stop breathing today
But if I can't walk proud, I'd rather walk away
I do all I am and it's all I can do
Oh I'm true
I'd give all I am and I'd give it to you
So trueEmbed
