Your Haunted Head LyricsBlackest eyes I've ever seen like moonstones shine
And all the while behind the dancing eyes the boy was crying
He creeps like ivy on the stairs, you know I liked him then
When we would sit and drink for hours and watch the sidewalk spin
(Chorus)
Well baby, I don't wanna hear your secrets
I don't share your pain
I don't wanna know about the wrinkles in your bed
I don't wanna hear about the ghost inside your haunted head
Inside your haunted head
Now, I don't need your tragedy and I don't need your shame
You can't keep your promises, but you keep naming names
He laid his troubles out to me like a deck of playing cards
Well don't you know that I can tell the Kings and Jokers well apart?
(Chorus)
Now, I don't wanna hear your secrets, I don't share your blame
I don't wanna hear about the wrinkles in your bed
I don't wanna hear about the ghost inside your haunted head
Inside your haunted head!
