Make Me Cry LyricsLots of guys can make me laugh
And show me some good time
Treat me nice and want me by their side
Lots of people call themselves my friends
And that's alright
But you're the only one I let inside
You're the only one who leaves me warm and satisfied
And you're the only one who takes me wrong and makes me right
Oh, and if you took your love away
You'd leave me high and dry
Cause baby, you're the only one can make me cry
Now lots of people talking at me
Tell me what is right
And lately I just don't know what to do
Ah, the only thing that matters is
If you're with me at night
Everything's all right when I'm with you
You're the only one who leaves me warm and satisfied
And you're the only one who takes me wrong and makes me right
Oh, and if you took your love away
You'd leave me high and dry
Baby, you're the only one can make me cry
You're the only one can make me cryEmbed
