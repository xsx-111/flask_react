Over Your Shoulder LyricsWherever you go
Whatever you do
Whereever you are, I'm watching you
No. There I am
I'm watching you eat
I'm watching you sleep
I see you in between your sheets
Oh no, there I am
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Oh no. There I am again
My eyes, when you see
My ears, when you hear
You can't get away from the face in the mirror
No, no, no, no, no -
There I am
Wherever you go
However you do it
Baby, I'm the only one true to you
There I am
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Over your shoulder
Oh no, honey there I am
There I am again
Everything we did
Everything we said
If ever you're with another
I'll be in your bed
Oh no. 'Cause there I am
Trying to forget my face and my name
As hard as you can
It won't be the same at all
And you know, there I am
Over your shoulder
Oh no, baby there I am
There I am againEmbed
