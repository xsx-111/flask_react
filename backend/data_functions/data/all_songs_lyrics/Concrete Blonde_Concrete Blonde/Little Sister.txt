Little Sister LyricsOur mama's nest is empty, all the babies gone and grown
And you're talking. But I hear me, you should hear you
Look into a younger face that used to be my own
Years apart they make it harder to be near you
Little sister
Oh little sister
All the times you couldn't tell her how you miss her
But I'm only half a heart away
But I'm only half a heart away
Over all the time and distance I know where you are
And I love you. Above all we're flesh and blood
Little sister
Oh little sister
All along the way the road gets turned and twisted
And it hurts some, yeah you know it hurts some
Trying to find your way home
Only half a heart awayEmbed
