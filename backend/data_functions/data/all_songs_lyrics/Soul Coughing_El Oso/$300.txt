$300 Lyrics
Lifting me up
Lifting me up
Lifting me up

Lifting me up like a garage door
I need to feel it when the drug starts coming on
I know you Lord are a jealous Lord
I know the tablet is your competition

I need for you to be reasonable
I need for you to be reasonable

How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it

Beating me down just like a rain storm
I need to feel it when the rain starts coming on
I know the skin is a jealous skin
I know the sky it is its competition
I need for you to be reasonable
I need for you to be reasonable

How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it

I need for you to be reasonable
I need for you to be reasonable
I need for you to be reasonable
I need for you to be reasonable

How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it
How much? She said, for $300 I'll do it2Embed
