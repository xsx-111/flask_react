Pensacola Lyrics
Oh, pride is not a sin
And that's why I have gone
On down to Wal-Mart with
My checkbook to just to get you some

Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
And I know, you must've realized by now
And I know, you must've realized by now

And by the lawn chairs there
Next to the racks of guns
Your self-esteem is waiting
Canned up in aluminum

Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
And I know, you must've realized by now
And I know, you must've realized by now
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
And I know, you must've realized by now
And I know, you must've realized by now

Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Like waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shouting
Waves in which you drown me, shoutingEmbed
