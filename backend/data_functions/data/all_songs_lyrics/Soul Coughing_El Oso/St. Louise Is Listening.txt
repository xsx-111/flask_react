St. Louise Is Listening Lyrics
I stopped the thought before its drip became insistent
I rubbed it out and loved the spot where it were missing
She's widely known, the only maquereau that pays her taxes

I got to box her for the money, said it might end...
Reeling and stumbling, I've got to bump around a while

You don't use words like that — St. Louise is listening
You don't use words like that — St. Louise is listening

You rang the Eskimo to meet you at the station
Oh, he's like milk to you, half-Swedish and half-Asian
And your aphasia strikes a bargain with the barter yardie

I got to box you for the money, said it might end...
Reeling and stumbling, I've got to bump around a while

You don't use words like that — St. Louise is listening
You don't use words like that — St. Louise is listening
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me, let me, let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me, let me, let me get up on it, let me get up on it
I could be your babydoll, I could be your doll, baby
I could be the thing you want, I could do it all for you

You don't use words like that, St. Louise is listening
You don't use words like that, St. Louise is listening

Let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me, let me, let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me, let me, let me get up on it, let me get up on it
Let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me, let me, let me get up on it, let me get up on it, let me, let me...Embed
