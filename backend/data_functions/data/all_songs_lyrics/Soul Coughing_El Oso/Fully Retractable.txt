Fully Retractable Lyrics
Shooed out like a housefly
This house was half my mind
I don't dispute the doubts you've outlined
But it's my right to waste your time

And these things
It stands to reason
These things won't kill me
Your feelings
The spattering
It bores me
Don't tell me

Burned in on the 8th of May
She was spectacular
I walk a half-moon by the bus stop
Sliding cross the street to her

Three stings
Sequentially
Three stings
Won't kill me
Your spieling
Gracelessly
Is my grief
Please tell me
Half-masted, bass-boosted, sling-back, fully retractable
Half-masted, bass-boosted, sling-back, fully retractable
Half-masted, bass-boosted, sling-back, fully retractable
Half-masted, bass-boosted, sling-back, fully retractable

Throw out the la-la by the busload
Match the photo to the description
I do indeed, and shall continue
Dispatch the shiftless man to points beyond

And these things
It stands to reason
These things
Please tell me
Your feelings
Oh gracelessly
It bores me
Don't tell me
 X 9
Half-masted, bass-boosted, sling-back, fully retractableEmbed
