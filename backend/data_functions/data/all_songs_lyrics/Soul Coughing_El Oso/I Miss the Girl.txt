I Miss the Girl LyricsDaughter to the pop veneer
Shining like a new mint quarter
Shining like the Franklin Mint
Seedy like the lampshade quarter
Rolling with the dopes you know
Rolling with the wrong gun on you
Going down to Baltimore
Going in an off-white Honda
Oh, well, I miss the girl, miss the girl, miss the girl...
I want to give myself to water
Speeding to the rupture line
Rat-a-tatting boombox moocher
Darling with the boop shuh-nai
Rat-a-tatting, lose your future
Oh, well, I miss the girl, miss the girl, miss the girl...
I want to give myself to water
I dream that she aims to be the bloom upon my misery...
She rocks mop-style, and leave the rest
And I know, I know it's not the same thing...Embed
