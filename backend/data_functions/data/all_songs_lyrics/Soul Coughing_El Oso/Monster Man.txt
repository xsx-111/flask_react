Monster Man Lyrics X 2
Stop hitching with the monster man
It was a bad plan
But I had to get to town
Unbitten
But the way I found it was a hand came down
And pow
I got illuminated

That's why I have got my mind in my own
That's why I have got my mind in my own
That's why I have got my mind in my own (Why,oh why,yeah)
Hand over the wave yeah, hand over the water
Hand over the wave, hand over the water
The realest of the real
The realest of the real
It's like the burnout said "Phenomenon."
It's like the burnout said "Phenomenon."
 X 2
Stop hitching with the monster man
It was a bad plan
But I had to get to town
Unbitten
But the way I found it was a hand came down
And pow
I got illuminated
To the ruder bar in a Buddha plump van
It was a stamped can
It was a clamor
Understand again
All you people jumping but we raised the bar
You're dumber than a box of rocks
So give up star
X2
That's why I have got my mind in my own
That's why I have got my mind in my own
That's why I have got my mind in my own (Why,oh why,yeah)

The inscrutable
The irrefutable
The illegible
The indisputable
The undisputed

Stop hitching with the monster man, it was a
Stop hitching with the monster man, it was a
Stop hitching with  the monster man, it was a
Stop hitching with the monster man, it was a
Bad plan
But I had to get to town
Unbitten
But the way I found it was a hand came down
And pow
I got illuminated
Stop hitching with the monster man
It was bad plan
But I had to get to town
Unbitten
But the way I found it was a hand came down
And pow
I got illuminated

 X 2
Stop hitching with the monster man
It was a bad plan
But I had to get to town
Unbitten
But the way I found it was a hand came down
And pow
I got illuminated
