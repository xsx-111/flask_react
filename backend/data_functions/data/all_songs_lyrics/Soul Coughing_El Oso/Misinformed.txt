Misinformed LyricsHis eyes go funny, you can't place why...
All dolled up in bellhop drag
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
I was once misinformed about your intentions...
Were you right to burn the rock star?
Were you right to drop the roster?
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
It is like a burden to the beat, to the long gone
I was once misinformed about your intentions...
One dollar bill, one dollar bill...Embed
