Houston LyricsI met a girl on roller skates
She had a spare bag
She had lost some weight
Where I used to work
She was a waitress
She proposed a trade
It was generous
She's gone to Houston
Feel like I'm floating in a warm sea
And if she finds out when she comes back
I know that she will leave me
Oh, I heard a sign
It was a dull crack
It was a clock hand
It was snapping back
Oh well, it wasn't her's
It was the dope's kiss
I'll take the blame upon my shoulder
I just love to feel like this
She's gone to Houston
Feel like I'm floating in a warm sea
And if she finds out when she comes back
I know that she will leave me
Roller boogie, motherfucker Embed
