Rare Star Ball LyricsTo the jerked-out man that rides the cycling
Drop a rope outside the ramp the wrong pipe again
Come meet me at the Rare Star Ball
Come meet me at the Rare Star Ball, yeah
To the girl what hold to call and heated it
But did not stop bots to call the pole implements
Come meet me at the Rare Star Ball
Come meet me at the Rare Star Ball, yeah
Now the dream is stemmed I had to dam it
Now the stream is dammed I had to dam it
Now the steam is dammed I had to dam it
Some people do, some people don't
Some people do, some people don't
Some people do, some people don't
Some people do, some people don't
Come meet me at the Rare Star
Come meet me at the Rare Star Ball, yeahEmbed
