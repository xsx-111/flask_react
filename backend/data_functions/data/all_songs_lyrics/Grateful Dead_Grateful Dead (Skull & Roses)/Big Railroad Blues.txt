Big Railroad Blues Lyrics
Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, Papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed

Oh!
Woo!



Well, I went to the depot, I never got there on time
Went down to the depot, never got there on time
Well, my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line

Mister jailer, go away now, don't tell me no lies!
Mister jailer, go away, don't tell me no lies!
Well my train's going down, she's a-rolling down the line
Down the line



Well, my mama told me, my papa told me too
Now my mama told me, Papa told me too
Well, I shouldn't be here trying to sing these railroad blues
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Wish I had a-listened to what my mama said
Well, I wouldn't be here trying to sleep in this cold iron bed1Embed
