Me and Bobby McGee Lyrics
Busted flat in baton rouge, waiting for a train
Feeling nearly faded as my jeans
Bobby flagged a diesel down, just before it rained
Took us all the way to New Orleans
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna
I was blowing sad while Bobby sang the blues
With them windshield wipers slapping time, Bobby clapping hands
We sang every song that driver knew

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, good enough for me Bobby McGee

From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Standing right beside me, lord, in everything I done
Bobby's body kept me from the cold
Then somewhere near Salinas, lord, I let her slip away
Looking for that home, I hope she finds
And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
Holding bobby's body close to mine
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose
Nothing was all she left for me
Feeling good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, good enough for me Bobby McGee
Lelela, lelelala, lelela, lelela, laleleha, laleleha, lalala
Leleleheee, lalala, leleleheee, lalala, leleleha, leleleha
Lala, lala, lala (heyyy)

Freedom's just another word for nothing left to do
Nothing ain't worth nothing, but it's free
Feeling good was easy lord, when bobby sang the blues
Feeling good was good enough for me, good enough for me Bobby McGeeEmbed
