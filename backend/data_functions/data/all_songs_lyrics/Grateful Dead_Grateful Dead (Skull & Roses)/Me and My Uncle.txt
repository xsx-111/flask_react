Me and My Uncle Lyrics
Me and my uncle went riding down
South Colorado, West Texas bound
We stopped over in Santa Fe
That being the point just about half way
And you know it was the hottest part of the day

I took the horses up to the stall
Went to the barroom, ordered drinks for all
Three days in the saddle, you know my body hurt
It being summer, I took off my shirt
And I tried to wash off some of that dusty dirt

West Texas cowboys, they's all around
With liquor and money, they're loaded down
So soon after payday, know it seemed a shame;
You know my uncle, he starts a friendly game
High-low jack and the winner take the hand


My uncle starts winning; cowboys got sore
One of them called him, and then two more
Accused him of cheating; oh no, it couldn't be
I know my uncle, he's as honest as me
And I'm as honest as a Denver man can be
One of them cowboys, he starts to draw
And I shot him down, lord he never saw
Shot me another, oh damn he won't grow old
In the confusion, my uncle grabbed the gold
And we high-tailed it down to Mexico

I love those cowboys, I love their gold
I loved my uncle, god rest his soul
Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know
Taught me so well, I grabbed that gold
And I left his dead ass there by the side of the road1Embed
