Oh, Boy! Lyrics
All my love, all of my kissing
You don't know what you been missing

Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
Want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me

All my life, I've been waiting
Tonight there'll be no hesitating

Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
I want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me
Stars appear and the shadow is falling
You can hear my heart calling
Little bit of loving makes everything right
I'm gonna see my baby tonight

All my life, I've been waiting
Tonight there'll be no hesitating

Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
I want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me


Stars appear and the shadow's falling
You can hear my heart calling
A little bit of loving makes everything right
I wanna see my baby tonight
All my life, I've been waiting
Tonight there'll be no hesitating

Oh boy
When you're with me
Oh boy
I want the world to see
That you
Were meant
For me
That you
Were meant
For me
That you
Were meant
For meEmbed
