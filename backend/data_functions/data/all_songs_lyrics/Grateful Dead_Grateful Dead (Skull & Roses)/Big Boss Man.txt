Big Boss Man Lyrics
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
Big boss man, can't you hear me when I call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all
You got me working boss man, a working around the clock
I want a little drink of whiskey, you sure won't let me stop
Big boss man, can't you hear me when i call?
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about all
I'm going to get me a boss man, one going to treat me right
I work hard in the daytime, sure get drunk at night
You ain't so big, you just tall, that's just about allEmbed
