Enchantment Lyrics
Like a fever, fever, inside of me
Like a fever, fever, inside of me

Stand fast, faithful one
See the moon and not the sun but I
All I need is a simple reminder
Breakdown frail affairs
Turn from the elusive stares but I
All I need is a simple reminder

Guilt is feeding, feeding, inside I'm cold
Guilt is feeding, feeding, inside I'm cold

In depth grasp the chains
Struggle as the waters gain but I
All I need is a simple reminder
Observe the formation
Fight until the battle's won but I
All I need is a simple reminder

There's no rule to say you'll cry alone
Just find the strength to help you carry the load
Reverse the frown and let the power surge
But when alone you cannot resist the urge
Can you feel it, feel it, like the pain of dying
Can you feel it, feel it, like the pain of dying

Hold on face to face
Damaged by the sad disgrace but I
All I need is a simple reminder
Twisting the knife in vain
End the grief but who will gain but I
All I need is a simple excuseEmbed
