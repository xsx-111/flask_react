The Last Time Lyrics
It's a struggle with a failures frown
And it crashes in front of me
I see the clouds divide
Will you stay or try to leave
The time you're looking at the door
And you're thinking to walk right through
I want to ignore
I only wish that it passes soon

Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating

I raise a sunken smile
As I serve the ones who served
What can I achieve
As you steal the air I breathe
It's a cruel misfortune
Forbidding us to see
When stories may collide
It's a sad state of mind
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating
Hearts beating for the last time


Hearts beating for the last time
Hearts beating still a state of mind
Hearts beating
Hearts beating for the last time
Hearts beating, the peace you cannot find
Hearts beatingEmbed
