Shadowkings Lyrics
A spiral movement, the ultimate mystery
Will you show, will you show who you are?
It's the truth that untrue suspicion is spreading like a disease
Do you know, do you know if it's real?

Voices appear inside my brain
Their need to set me free
Onward they lead before the dawn
Teach me what's right and wrong

Encourage the madness they welcome impurity
I don't know, I don't know who I am!
Fallen blind to the cruel hysteria
Constantly challenging me
All alone, all alone, can't be real

Voices approve, I can't relate
Their need to celebrate
Onward they lead before the dawn
Teach me what's right and wrong

What's right and wrong
Right from wrong
What's right from wrong
Voices appear, the quest begins
Fuel for the shadowkings
Onward they lead before the dawn
Teach me what's right and wrongEmbed
