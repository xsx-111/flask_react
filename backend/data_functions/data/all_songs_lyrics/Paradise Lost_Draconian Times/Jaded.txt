Jaded Lyrics
Opaque the dissident establishment that we all suffer
Refill the porous shell with words that mean so many things
Words mean so many things

The feeling can't avoid you
The feeling can't avoid you

Stoking the fires of absence
Loss and anguish long departed
Adjust to changing, re-arranging, burns in many ways
Pain burns in many ways

The feeling can't avoid you
The feeling can't avoid you
The feeling can't avoid you
The feeling can't avoid youEmbed
