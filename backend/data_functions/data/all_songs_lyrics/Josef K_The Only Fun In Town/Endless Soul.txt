Endless Soul LyricsFrom here I see another plan
And hearing voice can't understand
A thousand times for all to see;
Questioning the right to be
Barely able to define and this distress comes to my mind
If you knew you'd crash my soul
16 is where we'll go
Burning with your eyes;
Steal a way of life
Waste my endless time;
Steal a way of life
Moving to another town
While the week were standing still
Life pulsating all around
Where there's fear there's a willEmbed
