Sense Of Guilt LyricsI don't know where I went last night
What bar, what park, what beach
Did I cross to the other side
Or just move in-between
Yet the uncontrollable apprehensions remain
A distinct sense of guilt
That faint sense of perfume
What dark thoughts
My mind's a blank but for a faint reminiscence
Was she real, or maybe a dream
But last night I slept from 7 o'clock
Right through to this morning
I rested well apart from a recurring nightmare
So when the homicide people ask me questions
I'll tell them about my dreamsEmbed
