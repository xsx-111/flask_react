Variation Of Scene LyricsLet's cherish these galleries
The echo and the noise
We'll move right through them
And all these bitter joys
These colors they are rising
And changing beyond
The possibilities are reaching beyond
Light me a leader
And hold the future of men
With your child like dreams
You'd hold the world in your hand
I hear our footsteps echo
This trip is so much fun
One more eternal city
The psychos always rerun
These colors they are rising
And changing beyond
The possibilities are reaching beyond
Light me a leader
And hold the future of men
With your child like dreams
You'd hold the world in your handEmbed
