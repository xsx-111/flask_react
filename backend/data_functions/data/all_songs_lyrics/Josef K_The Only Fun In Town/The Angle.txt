The Angle LyricsJust moved in to the scheme of things
For a short while anyway
Don't cry when you see them grin
Not a love anyone can save
And you felt the right performance
Is the means, a means to an end
An end that's always conclusive
And is as is and so intends
But to (at)tempt this recognition
And about to change position
Feel emotion and let loose my fear -
See yourself from their angle!
Don't move away until you know
A chance like this - can't let it go
Feel emotion and let loose my fear -
See yourself from their angle!Embed
