Citizens LyricsEveryone in our town walks around to test the air
Even though that's torment there
They never love to take care
A car's crash in our town
Sidewalks paved with character
The populace that passed this way
None of them turned to pray
Even though there's torment there
They never love to take care
A citizens they walk odd
Their only aim is to get rich
A typic omen's not for us
We can't expect here sign of love
The treeless limits of this town
The walls a blanket of greyish dust
No ordinary sight to see
I feel la peste subconsciously
Even though there's torment there
They never love to take care
I am so bored with your ideals
I take the air on the balcony
Stroll along the boulevard
Hear the voices by the sea
Even know that's omen there
They never love to take careEmbed
