Drone LyricsWe're shifting in to setting sight
The transatlantic motion flight
So much up here to pass by
Are your ideas so hard to try
Storm-time, another distraction
I drink some gin and soak the action
I drive all winter, listen to noise
The lights behind the yellow voice
I'm on this trip, it's so much fun
A depth of view it's never re-run
So much up here to pass by
Are your ideas so hard to try
Ambient drone, soaking full
Inside my car I need a tool
I like to starve, fade away
Don't need the cash, just decayEmbed
