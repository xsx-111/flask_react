Crazy to Exist LyricsWish we hadn't smoked another cigarette
The place is near, so what do we get?
The shadow approach is in dress
I like to twist it, that was tin vase
I captured stranger's gaze, afraid to ask
I'd like to walk in town, but is always that smell
A caf√©, where I need a drink to be well
Oh, this is your life, this is so smart
Sleeping in doorways of Coniston hall
Sometimes I know, it's crazy to exist
Yes, it seems so, it's crazy to exist
I think I know, it's crazy to exist
I love to walk in town
C'mon let's go in town
I need to be in a town
But we can go in townEmbed
