Forever Drone LyricsWe're shifting in to setting sight
The transatlantic motion flight
So much up here to pass by
Are your ideas so hard to try
Stormtime and other distraction
Drink some gin, soak the action
Drive all winter, listen to noise
Lights behind, yellow noise
I'm on this trip, it's so much fun
A depth of view it's never re-run
So much up here to pass by
Are your ideas so hard to try
It's cold time inside my car
Never still till the next harbour
Drive all winter, listen to noise
Lights behind, yellow voice
Ambient drone, soaking full
Inside my car I need a tool
I'd like to starve, fade away
Don't need the cash, just decayEmbed
