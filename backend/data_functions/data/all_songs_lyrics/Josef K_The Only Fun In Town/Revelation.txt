Revelation LyricsForced to look at these pages
So many times exposed
Don't know I miss them
Gives the notion I`m not alone
See that pathway clear again
Got seen 'em and know what it means
The writings on a door again
See that pathway clear again
Does it look like you understand?
I'm not so divert with trends
A scream I can explain,if I can hear again
Take a look at this writing
Bring us there up with you
Crash ship or die again
We will all got clear again
Gives the notion I`m not alone
Many weeks on a transport
Looking on a dive boat
Many times died
Forced to look through this pages
So many times exposed
Don't know I miss them
Gives the notion I`m not aloneEmbed
