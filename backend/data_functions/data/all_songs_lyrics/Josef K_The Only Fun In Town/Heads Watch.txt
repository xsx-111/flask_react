Heads Watch LyricsI stand and look outside
At pseudo-punks and all the mindless
I see what they think about here
I watch the girls and watch the heads turn
Oh please, oh, take me away
To where you're going, I must be with you
Oh we can drive as fast as we can
A better future that no-one else could
Oh please, oh, take me away
To where you're going, I must be with you
Oh we can drive as fast as we can
A better future that nobody else couldEmbed
