16 Years LyricsYes, I stood by the roadside
Saw many happenings there
That's the place where the ghosts died
When we were young and still could care
How Jim & Jayne they once lay there
Around midnight when all was still
It wasn't cool, what did they care?
Bells rang out harsh & shrill
Jim left behind a real big mess
Afterwards he beat his chest
Had to leave to answer a call
Even though has ten foot tall
Cats like that don't give an inch
Love to see you squirm and flinch
They make good, they hit and run
No one else has so much fun
So I drove on it's all forgotten
Memories are layed to waste
But days may past and be forgotten
Who could ever forget that place?Embed
