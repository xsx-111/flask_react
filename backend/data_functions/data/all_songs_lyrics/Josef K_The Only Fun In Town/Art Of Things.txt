Art Of Things LyricsPictures out within are growing shorter
Are getting so hazy
Losing the place with time
Are pictures of Cindy so distorted, so unreachable
But have I seen the art of things to come?
These rooms they are filled with things that don't mean anything
There are sculptures of people that I've never seen
Just one more picture, I need to live one more
But nobody is ready for art of things to come...Embed
