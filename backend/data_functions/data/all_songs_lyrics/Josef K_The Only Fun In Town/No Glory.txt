No Glory LyricsWhat does it feel like to lie in wait
The spirits of chance gone without trace
But the start of the mystery, a moment ago
The only direction to follow our ways
Judging humiliate that seeps to your eyes
I, you, we make us disguise
We are the first to followed this fool
But they are the last to listen to you
Occasions arise where they're not due
The glory is now how long will it last
The termination is gonna come soon
The glory is now its passing too fast
An idea of time, maybe twice a week
Can never appeal like books of rules
The street's no place to start again
It's always the same I mixed-in bad
No glories now
No glories now
No glories now
No glories nowEmbed
