Involuntary LyricsHave you ever been alone in the night time
And you're thinking that you just don't know
And that feeling grows
Without control
And you're thinking about a place to go
But your body tells you
"Stay at home"
It's involuntary
And when the phone has lost it's bell
And the doorbell has lost it's sound
You're only hearing your heart pound
It's involuntary
And have you ever tried to leave at the right time
But the right time seems to come so slow
And that feeling grows
Without control
And you're thinking about a place to go
But your body tells you
"Stay at home"
It's involuntary
And when the phone has lost it's bell
And the doorbell has lost it's sound
You're only hearing your heart pound
It's involuntaryEmbed
