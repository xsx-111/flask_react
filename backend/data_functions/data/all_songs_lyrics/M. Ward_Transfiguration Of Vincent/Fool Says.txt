Fool Says LyricsHey, I ain't never met anyone like you before
I ain't never met anyone like you before
I thought all the good ones were gone
You're here to tell me I was wrong
Hey, you ain't never met a fool like me before
You ain't never met a fool like me before
They told you all romantic fools had died
I'm here to tell you that they lied
You can't be always right my friend
Come on and tell me I got it wrong again
Hey, I ain't ever seen anything like this before
I ain't ever seen anything like this before
I thought all the mistery was gone, I'm here to tell you I was wrong
You can't be always right my friend
Come on and tell me I got it wrong again...
Hey, you ain't never met a fool like me before
You ain't never met a fool like me before
They told you all romantic fools had died, I'm here to tell you that they liedEmbed
