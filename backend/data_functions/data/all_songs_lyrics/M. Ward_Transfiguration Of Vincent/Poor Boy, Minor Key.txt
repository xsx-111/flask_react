Poor Boy, Minor Key LyricsPoor boy
Head against a pillow
Fast asleep
Poor girl
Head against a window
Lost in a dream
One day they will be as giants
Stronger than the sun
But that day ain't yet come
Wide world
Wide world of sorrow
Won't stand a chance
Wide world
Wide world of sorrow
Won't stand a chance
One day they will be as giants
Stronger than the sun
But that day ain't yet comeEmbed
