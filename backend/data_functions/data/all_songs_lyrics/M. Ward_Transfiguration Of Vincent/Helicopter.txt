Helicopter LyricsThis song was recorded before..
I am somewhere in the city, I am climbing up a fire escape
I am somewhere in the city, I am climbing up a fire escape
I have gotta save my baby from a mess this world has made
I arrive through a window, I leave through a hole in the wall
I arrive through a window, I leave through a hole in the wall
I scramble down the stairwell with my baby, cradle and all
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset
I have done all I can do in this town
Tom Violence has taken the wind out of my sails
Tom Violence has taken the wind out of my sails
Helicopter has taken to breaking this dreaming spell
This song was recorded before..
My mind is a-racing, my heart is prepared somehow
My mind is a-racing, my heart is prepared somehow
For that searchlight to come shining and find me under a cloud
Helicopter, helicopter let your long rope down
Let us sway into the sunset
I have done all I can do in this townEmbed
