Undertaker LyricsOh, love is so good
When you're treated like you should be
The sky goes on forever in a symphony of song
And how the water can flow like it's streaming out of fountains
And all you gotta do is find a sword and a stone
And how it takes all the night
Like birds of paradise
Like way down in Pollyanna where the race runs wild
Oh, but if you're gonna leave
Better call the undertaker
Take me under, undertaker
Take me home
Oh, just place me in a box
And fasten all the locks
And with a one-two throw me over the bayside bridge
'Cause love is so good
When it's treated like it should be
The sea goes on forever in a symphony of song
Oh, but if you're gonna leave
Better call the undertaker
Take me under, undertaker
Take me home
Yeah, if you're gonna leave
Better call the undertaker
Take me under, undertaker
Take me homeEmbed
