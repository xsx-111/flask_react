Dead Man LyricsDead man, dead man don't cry
Dead man, dead man don't cry, don't cry
When you die it ain't the end
It ain't the end when you die
Dead man, dead man be brave
Dead man, dead man be brave, be brave
You shall be saved by and by
By and by you shall be saved
Dead man, dead man believe
Dead man, dead man believe, believe
You're a free man at last
At last dead man you are free
Dead man, dead man don't cry
Dead man, dead man don't cry, don't cry
When you die it ain't the end
It ain't the end when you dieEmbed
