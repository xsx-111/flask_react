Get to the Table on Time LyricsWell they called me once, and they called me twice
Third time they called me was cold as ice
They say "get to the table, get to the table on time!"
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Better get to the table, get to the table on time
And the lord of lords, he laid out a feast
He said "listen to me boys, this will be last one of these
So you better get to the table, get to the table on time."
Better make up your mind, if you wanna get to the table on time
Better get to the table, get to the table on timeEmbed
