Sad, Sad Song LyricsOh, I went to the doctor
I said "doctor, please, what do you do when your true love leaves?"
He said "the hardest thing in the world to do
Is to find somebody believes in you"
Make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song
Make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song
And so I went to the whippoorwill
I said "whippoorwill, please, what do you do when your true love leaves?"
He said "I only have but one trick up my sleeve
I sing it over and over till she comes back to me"
I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song
I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song
And so I went to the whale
I said "killer whale, please, what do you do when your true love leaves?"
He said "I only have but one trick up my sleeve
I sing it over and over till she comes back to me"
I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song
I make a sad, make a sad, make a sad sad song
And so I went to my mom
I said "Mama, please, what do you do when your true love leaves?"
She said "the hardest thing in the world to do
Is to find somebody believes in you"Embed
