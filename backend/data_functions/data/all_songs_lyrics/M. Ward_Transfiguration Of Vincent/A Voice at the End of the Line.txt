A Voice at the End of the Line LyricsIf all I had was just one final call
Would you answer my ring
Would you hear me at all
Oh when I spent my life
Trying to make someone mine
Now all I want is a voice at the end of the line
I lost my luck in a unlucky bet
Could you clear my name
Could you cancel my debt
Oh when I spent my life, trying to make up my mind
Now all I want is a voice at the end of the line
I spent way to much time beside myself
I don't know what I was thinking about
Oh but deep in my mind I am dialing your number nowEmbed
