Cry Baby Lyrics
I think it's pretty strange
Watching the passersby
Crawling all over one another
Trying to get ahead in life

Monday, you cough
Tuesday, you cry
Wednesday in bed
What if you die?

You say that I'm insane
I say you're probably right
We all got something important to say
But talking's a waste of time

Monday, you cough
Tuesday, you cry
Wednesday in bed
What if you die?

Cry, baby, cry
Kick, scream, fight, hold on with all your might
You're gonna die, die
Open up your eyes or life will pass you by
Don't you think it's pretty strange?
All got something to hide
House in the desert, top of a mountain
Lost in a deep-sea dive

Monday, you cough
Tuesday, you cry
Wednesday in bed
Thursday, you die

Cry, baby, cry
Kick, scream, fight, hold on with all your might
You're gonna die, die
Open up your eyes or life will pass you by
Without love, without love
Nothing else will ever be enough

Cry, baby, cry
Like it or not, like it or not
It's a matter of time
Cry, baby, cry
Like it or not, like it or not
It's a matter of time
It's a matter of time5Embed
