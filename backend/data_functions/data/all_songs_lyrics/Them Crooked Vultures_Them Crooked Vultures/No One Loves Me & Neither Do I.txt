No One Loves Me & Neither Do I Lyrics
Yeah, oh yeah (Oh)

Think I saw her for the first time maybe in a news stand
She was nickin' a mag and dressed oblique
She called me baby and
Was it me maybe with the song on the radio?
So I told her I was rich
Then she asked could I use a dirty bitch? (of course)

Then she said, 'No one loves me', neither do I
You get what you give
I give goodbye
And if I should vanish
Don't get caught off guard
Don't hold it against me
Unless it gets hard

Uh (Oi! Ooo)
Uh (Oh, yeah)
Oh, that's right

Well if sex is a weapon, then smash, boom, pow
How ya like me now?
You can't always do it right
You can always do what's left
So I told her I was trash
She winked and laughed and said I already know
I've got a beautiful place to put your face
And she was right
And I said, "no one loves me", neither do I
It makes perfect sense
So I never ask why
All gone tomorrow
'Cause life doesn't wait
You could keep your soul
I don't want a cell mate

Call me I'm loose, I'm ready to go
People in the world wanna lose control
Call me I'm loose, I'm ready to go
People in the world wanna lose control
Call me I'm loose, I'm ready to go
People in the world wanna lose control
Call me I'm loose, I'm ready to go
People in the world wanna lose (Uh)

I know how to burn with passion
Hold nothing back for future ration
Give all you are, do not make haste
Savor every single taste
You get got
I know how to be controlled
Do opposites of what you're told
Quick to react, to break the box
Turn on cue, as your cell door locks
Behind you

I know how to be lost in lust
Not because you should, but because you must
It burns white hot, and so clouds the mind
This lightning strike isn't always kind
So use me up
Use me up
