Interlude With Ludes Lyrics
I've always been behind you
So I think we should meet
I've sharpened my knives (Uh)
So I'm gonna use them
Oh, baby, oh
I'm gonna smother you with my love
Forever and ever, also forever

Acid and poison and chemicals baby
Is what I mean to provide
I know together we'll make the possible
Totally impossible, yeah

If you want me I'm yours
And even if you don't want me
I'm trained and licensed and armed to the teeth
I think you'll agree
It's so hard to apologize
So I'm just gonna skip it

Sleep deprivation will make you a million
Did you just hear something crazy?
I got my fingers crossed you'll catch something baby
Cause I just threw myself at you (You)

Yeah, yeah

Everyone run and hide
I'm coming to find you (Find you)
Is my face still bleeding?
Then what is your problem?
By the skin of my teeth
That's how I'm gonna to drive you

On the goodship lolly-gag
LSD and a bloody pile of rags
I hate to be the bearer of bad news
But I am (Yeah)
But I am
But I am1Embed
