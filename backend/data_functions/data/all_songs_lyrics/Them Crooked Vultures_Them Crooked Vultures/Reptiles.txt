Reptiles LyricsI tried to make a break
What a fool
I should've known I never listen
I'm in a cage
An animal I'm in a cage
But the reptiles
They won't let me go
I think they want you to stray
Watch the monkey dance
Give 'em a taste
Look at him, he's always smiling
Help me to escape
Your mouth agape
You foreign tourist
Woe is me, it will be a funeral
A circus, I'll rap on the cell door
Questions are a fire
That needs feeding to survive
So just you let those flames die down
Trained by consequence and the lash
It leaves me breathless
Their praise is a poison to us all
In the moonlight their scars flash like jewelry
Get too precious
Get locked up in a cage
Want to get, gotta risk any move
Misconstrued and you're screwed
Tongues flash and flick as if they're screaming
Oh, they lie just like a lover
Oh do they, those kisses will burn
Under the lights
They snap a finger
You jump, you answer
Like a naive hooker with a big dumb smile
For the reptiles
I guess you'll never know
They won't let you go
Cause you're the soup du jour, that's for sure
Questions are a fire
That needs feeding to survive
So just you let those flames die down
See them reptiles crawl
Getting closer
Why won't someone come to drive them away?
Don't rest too long
It's a mistake we can't take back
Take one lying down for a change
And oh it's like cleaning up after an orgy
When it's over
I wish someone would burn this place
To the groundEmbed
