Dead End Friends Lyrics
I drive all alone, at night
I drive all alone
Don't know what I'm headed for

I follow the road, blind
Until the road is dead end
Night's in my veins, it's calling me
Racing along these arteries, and
Law is just a myth
To herd us over the cliff

I follow the road at night
Just hoping to find
Which puzzle piece fell out of me

I know who you are, and I
Open the door and climb in
Hold me real close and do it again
Ache for the touch of my dead end friends

And oh, I gotta know
Is it dead at the end of the road?
I can tell by the look in your eyes
We're the same
My dead end friends and I

We drive all alone at night
A never ending begin
Sweet as a curse just out of reach
Awakens the dead end part of me
And oh, no more wandering
Just me and my dead end friends again
Yeah

Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead end friends
Dead
