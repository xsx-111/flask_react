Spinning in Daffodils Lyrics
Once, out in the rain
I was able to strangle my shadow
Then shackle the chain (Chain)

What?
What will you do?
Is it safe to play God in the garden and king of the zoo? (Zoo)

Holes
Well they need to be filled
Positions available
Yet some are quite hard to get out of, or in (In)

Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils

Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Cold
Alone and alive
You're afraid but that's not what I asked
Wanna go for a ride?
Sharpen your teeth my darlings
Sharpen your minds
Take a finger if the hand feeds you
Shit, take one scalp at a time (Get 'em, or else)
Oh, yeah-yeah

Fail, as big as the whale
Like a canine that chases the bone
That's tied to it's tail

I wish I was a beautiful balloon
I could rise up above it all
And fade out of view (Fade)
Gracefully fade, fade out of view
What have you turned me into?

Spinning in the daffodils
Dizzy from a dozen twirls
Spinning in the daffodils
Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah

What have you gone and done, my love?
Incinerated in the morning sun

Yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah



I feel so high
I just may never come down
I feel so high
I just may never come down
I feel so high
I just may never come down
I feel so high
I just may never come down
Yeah-yeah
