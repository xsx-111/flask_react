Gunman Lyrics
Gunman, bloodshot eyes
Gunman, grain of sand
Sisters could not sleep
Father is a holy ghost
And there's lions in a cage

It don't matter, don't try to explain
You're just another dog to be trained
Choke-chained
You're gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail

Brother does not dream anymore
Sisters could not sleep
Transformation incomplete
Mercy killing those counting sheep
I'm a trigger, quick to fire
Punctuate betwixt the eyes, you're clever
It ain't gonna help you

Violence is just an incomplete thought
Coming to a complete stop, stop
You're so clever, you'll tear us apart
Then masquerade it as art, not smart
If you can help anyone, help yourself
That's unless you hate yourself
Then don't help
Angry ants are crawling
Makes you wanna scream

Lions clawing
Building up steam
Flesh and bone has no persuasion
This is the pathway to my destination
Gunman, where you been?
You're my hero, savior, psycho, slayer

Follow the leader, you lead 'em the same
Slugs punctuate the refrain
Come again?
It don't matter don't try to explain
You're just a dog to be trained
Choke chained
You gonna end up under tooth and nail
If you catch a tiger by the tail
Don't fail
I wanna go blind, wanna stare at the sun
De-evolution
