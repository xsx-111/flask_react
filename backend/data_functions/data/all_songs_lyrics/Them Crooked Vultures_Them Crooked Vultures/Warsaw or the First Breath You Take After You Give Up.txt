Warsaw or the First Breath You Take After You Give Up Lyrics
Can't afford to lose my head (Lose my head)
Can't afford to lose my cool
You'll blow them all in king dumbcum (King dumbcum)
I can't afford to lose my tease
I just aim to please
Feel like a hotel motel painting
Out of place and ignored
It's all medals and trophies, trophies and medals
All before the race has been run

Oh, take off your mask (Take it off now baby)
Is it too much to ask? (Too much to ask)
Go on, give it a try (Give it up now)
Kiss your ass goodbye (Goodbye)

Autobiographical anonymous (Anonymous)
(Goddamn )
A cotillion of friction on my jurisdiction
It's a lovely disguise with the wandering eyes (Wandering eyes)
I get high, now you've got something to look up to
Trouble's a mangy stray dog
Play with it once, then it follows you home
It's all "Have not, have none, hey can I have some?"
Until I've had enough, yet I've had none
Oh, take off your mask (Rip it off now baby)
Lose it into the trash (Throw it all away)
Go on, give it a try (Throw it all away)
Kiss your ass goodbye

Suddenly it gets easy
The sun goes down
The long arm of important things
Disappears in her gown
You finally drop the knife
Forget you ever 
It's a goodnight but that ain't forever
It feels together, in love
In your arms


But still it hurts to be young
I know it hurts
It hurts to be young
Metamorphosis is...
It hurts to be young
Gotta learn every goddamn thing
You gotta hack your way through
And realize, it's almost entirely lies
But then you'll begin to smile
Smile for me, real
When you accept what you are
The transformation is done
You've become
Absorbed into and you know
I think I know what to doEmbed
