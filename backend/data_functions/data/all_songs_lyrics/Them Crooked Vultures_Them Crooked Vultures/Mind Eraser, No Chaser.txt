Mind Eraser, No Chaser Lyrics
Run along face lift
If it kills, I got news: it ain't a side effect
Call it a full reject or
A fuel injected, type-corrected, teenage obstacle

All I wanna do is have my mind erased
I'm begging you, pleading you, stop coma-teasing us all
Drug company, where's a pill for me?
I call it mind eraser, no chaser at all
On permanent leave of everything
Law-biding, dick-riding, fun police, leave us alone
Dulling up the edge of a razor blade
What does it mean when the knife and the hand are your own?

Give me the reason why the mind's a terrible thing to waste
"Understanding is cruel" the monkey said as it launched to space
I know that I'm gonna be your dangerous side effect
Ignorance is bliss until they take your bliss away

Robotic mom bought me
D-I-Y kit lobotomy
It's a tuck, taste, dance craze, movie of the week
You'll buy the doll, kick the ball
Then piss on the sheets
All I want to do is have my mind erased
I'm begging you, pleading you, stop coma-teasing us all
Drug company, where's a pill for me?
It reads "mind eraser, no chaser" in bright lights
On permanent leave from everything
New-age goose-step on a karma-collision
Dulling up the edge of a razor blade
What does it mean when the knife and the hand are your own?

Give me the reason why the mind's a terrible thing to waste
"Understanding is cruel" the monkey said as it launched to space
I know that I'm gonna be your dangerous side effect
Ignorance is bliss until they take your bliss away

Give me the reason why the mind's a terrible thing to waste
I know that I am your dangerous side effect
I know that I am your dangerous side effect
I'm not sorry to say we just ran out of give a shit1Embed
