Elephants Lyrics

We're painted as monsters
Borracho, cansado
And do you know what the people say?
I'm plucked from the garden of wretched beliefs
I offer a rose and smile with harmless teeth

Then slick back my hair
You know the devil's in there
Alone in the garden
Like lumbering giants in a shameful parade
We came to ruin all and make a rotten trade
And make you roll over
So roll over (Get over)

Scattered all on the shore
Surely they're washed away
Feeling somewhat deserving
Of what will be someday
No, I can never stay melancholy
I've the memory of your face
No, I can never stay melancholy for long
Before I move on
We're unwanted strangers
Exploited and dangerous
Unable to hide or even dream of it
Como estas?
Parting the seas
We're lepers who stroll
Why you afraid sweety?

I slick back my hair
You know the devil's in there
So keep one eye open baby
We're so easy to spot
Lepers riding atop
Pachyderms made of germs
Elephants broken and screaming and all (Roll over)
Are we coming over?

Scattered all on the shore
Surely they're washed away
Scattered all on the shore
Surely they're washed away
Away, away
Feeling somewhat deserving
Of what will be someday
No, I can never stay melancholy
I've the memory of your face
I'm alone in the garden
Of long lost hopeful plans
No I can never stay anything for long
So come on, move
Roll over
Are we coming over?
Here we go2Embed
