Scumbag Blues Lyrics
Innocence has no resistance
Against a wicked counselor such as I

You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Shall I lead you to my parlor?
Poison offers disguised in just your size

You won't make it out
You won't make it out


You may think me altruistic
Feel my dark hypnosis closing in
You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Then you grow cold, cold
As I stare
As if no, none
Could compare
But you don't know
How close, to ensnare
When I control
You will despair
You won't make it out
You won't make it out


Sycophancy, solipsistic
Spider plays the fool to lure the fly

You won't make it out
You won't make it out

Then you grow cold, cold
As I stare
As if no, none
Could compare
But you don't know
How close, to ensnare
When I control
You will despairEmbed
