Everyone Choose Sides Lyrics
Thirteen grand
A year in the Meadowlands
Bored and rural-poor, Lord, at 35, right?
I am the best seventeen-year-old ever

I've worked these sands
I won't go back again
Quitter, quitter, one boy bitter - rough luck
Man to man, hand to hand, fight forty

We're losing sand!
A Wrens' ditch battle plan
Record after record, Black and Decker-ed, tack, tack!
Definition: hell and high water

Fatty come a courting, Lord, the money!

Everyone choose sides
The whole to-do of what to do for money
Everyone choose sides
Poorer or not this year and hell's the difference
End of ropes and lines
Everyone choose sides

From a house damned
To divorce and back again
Split my off days and holidays and days done
With a card to Dad and calls to "Hi, Momma"

Let's talk plans
And luck said, "Double damned
Were you give the women worth winning or what?
A wasted share of shots at high-tide heaven"

Greener grasses fade from where you wind up

Everyone choose sides
I'm back! I'm back! So sing to raise the blind up
Everyone choose sides
I've walked away from more than you imagine
And I sleep just fine
We fought and brought up more
The shovel's high up on the ten-ton line
Everyone choose sides1Embed
