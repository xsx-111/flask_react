Thirteen Grand Lyrics
You talk about all that you can't bottle up inside
It makes you laugh then it makes you cry
I said it all too late

Is this real at all?
You're not so sure
It's easy now because you're safe
Can't change your mind

Moving on is not fair when it leaves me on my own
I lived my life waiting for tomorrow
But I guess it's your turn now

Is this real at all?
You're not so sure
It's easy now because you're safe
Can't change your mind

We trade these lines to get us by
But what's it matter?
You keep saying Jersey's not a home
I thought I had it all figured out
But look who got it wrong

Is this real at all?
You're not so sure
It's easy now because you're safe
Can't change your mind

Is this real at all?
You're not so sure
It's easy now because you're safe
Can't change your mind1Embed
