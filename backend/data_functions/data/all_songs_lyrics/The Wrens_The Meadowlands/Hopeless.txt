Hopeless Lyrics
Oh no, not this time too
I'm the only one you got to use
And if I tell you all this could be
Nothing more than a way to leave you
Would you want me?

And now you're sorry
For the things you did to me
I want you to know
I feel I was the one who got used and used to
Just about anything you would tell me
But those days are more than over now

Don't you say you want me to stay now
You've got to get away
You've got to get away
Go find someone who wants you
Someone to pray to you
Get on your knees to
Lay down and please you too
It just won't be me ever again

Hopeless that this will turn out better
This isn't want I wanted
I should have listened to them
Go thank yourself for nothing
It's really all you're good for
And every year you wasted
And every half-assed offer
Hopeless that this will turn out better
This isn't want I wanted
I should have listened to them
Go thank yourself for nothing
It's really all you're good for
And every year you wasted
And every half-assed offer

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeahEmbed
