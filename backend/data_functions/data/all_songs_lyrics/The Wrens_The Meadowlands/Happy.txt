Happy LyricsYou're the one I want
You're a chance to take
You're a hard break
And swore you'd never leave again
You're the only one
That I ever trusted
Or who ever cared at all
Is this how it's going to be?
Is this how you wanted me?
Broken down again
It's almost over now
Is this why you wanted me?
To watch as you walk away
Kept on killing me
And you don't even want to touch me
And you don't even want to touch me
I was wrong
I've wasted on
Can't figure out
What happened to us
I won't count on you anymore
I'll be all right
Don't worry about me
Aren't you happy now?
You got what you want
I wanted you
But I'm over that now
I'm over it
I'm so sick of you
What we went through
Your lies to me
Won't win again
So don't kid yourself
It's better this way
It's all back to meEmbed
