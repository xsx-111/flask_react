This Boy is Exhausted Lyrics
Lock me in
Tied to work
Splitting rocks
Cutting diamonds
100 days
With no pay
Not anymore

Cause I'm caught
I can't type
I can't temp
I'm way past college
No ways out
No back doors
Not anymore

But then once a while
We'll play a show
Then it makes it worthwhile
Our sights set low
As Jerry squares off the set, here we go
But this boy is exhausted
Get on up get out
This boy is exhausted
Eight hours long
A single song
Come to this
Triple guessing
Double down
A V.P.'s faith
Is one single long

Cause I can't
Write what I know
It's not worth
Writing
I can't tell
A hit from hell
From one sing-along

But then Greg plugs in
A treble checking that says we might win
Hell's Henry pearls
The woven strap wins the Galloway girls
But this boy is exhausted
Get on up get out
This boy is exhausted
But then Kev jumps in
And hits the floor as the stick hits the rim
I guess we're done
Cause every win on this record's hard won
But this boy is exhausted
Get on up get out
This boy is exhaustedEmbed
