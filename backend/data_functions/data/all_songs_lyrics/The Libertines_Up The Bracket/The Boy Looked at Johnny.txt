The Boy Looked at Johnny Lyrics
The boy looked at Johnny
And said "My word, that was fun"
When he did it with his hat on
Like in a saddle with his gun
We're in slow motion eating breakfast
At the side view hotel
Oh sipping down wine
Everything's going so well

New York City's very pretty in the night time
But don't you miss Soho
Where everybody goes
La de di la de di da diddy
La de di la de di da diddy
La de di la de di da diddy
La, la, la, la, la

The boy looked at Johnny
Said "Don't you know who I think I am"
He said I did it once before
Now I'm trying all I can, Lord
He says oh no no
Oh yeah yeah
I said oh no no no
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
New York City's very pretty in the night time
But don't you miss Soho
Where everybody goes
La de di la de di da diddy
La de di la de di da diddy
La de di la de di da diddy
La, la, la, la, la1Embed
