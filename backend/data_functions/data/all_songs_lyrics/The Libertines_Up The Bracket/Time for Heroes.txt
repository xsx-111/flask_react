Time for Heroes Lyrics
Did you see the stylish kids in the riot?
Shovelled up like muck and set the night on fire
Wombles bleed, truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love

But there's a rumour spread nasty disease around town
You caught round the houses with your trousers down
A headrush in the bush
You know I cherish you my love
Oh how I cherish you my love

Tell me what can you want now you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

He knows it's eating, it's chewing me up
It's not right for young lungs to be coughing up blood
And it's all
It's all in my hands
And it's all up the walls
Well the stale chips are up and the hope stakes are down
It's all these ignorant faces that bring this town down
And I sighed and sunken with pride
Well I passed myself down on my knees
Yes I passed myself down on my knees

Now tell me what can you want now you've got it all
The whole scene is obscene
Time will strip it away
A year and a day
And Bill Bones
Bill Bones knows what I mean

He knows there's fewer more distressing sights than that
Of an Englishman in a baseball cap
And we'll die in the class we were born
But that's a class of our own my love
A class of our own my love

Did you see the stylish kids in the riot
Shovelled up like muck
Set the night on fire
Wombles bleed truncheons and shields
You know I cherish you my love
Yeah I cherish you my love2Embed
