Vertigo Lyrics
Koreema knows just what it is she does
But it can't be hard for her to get a buzz
Down in the street below
Hear the drunken archangel sing
I know what's on your mind my boy
Cause I can see oh everything
Lead pipes, your fortunes made
Well take a tip from me
Climb up to her window ledge or you'll forever be

Just walking under ladders
As the people around you hear you crying, "Please"
As the people around you hear you crying, "Please"
As they hear you...

Lead pipes, your fortunes made
Well take a tip from me
Climb up to her window ledge or you'll forever be

Just walking under ladders
As the people around you hear you crying, "Please"
As the people around you hear you crying, "Please"
As they hear you...
Who really knows just what it is she does
It can't be hard for her to get a buzz
The rapture of vertigo
And letting go
Me, myself, and I was never sure
Was it liquor or was it my soul?Embed
