Death On the Stairs Lyrics
From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one-track mind and eyes for me
Half blinded in a war
With a pale, young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no notion to please him
Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind

A little boy in a stairwell who
Says 'I hate people like you'
I got matchsticks and cable TV
Half of less than 50P
We all clambered over the balcony
Banging on the window, waking Steve
Bringing with the true love his unholy friend
Singing, 'If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind'

So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway
Monkey asked to the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
Turns you into stone
Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
Cheap hotel where I can meet the past
Pay it off and keep it sweet
(aw) It's sweet and it's nothing, no
It's just like nothing at all

You know I've seen you there
How could I help but stare?
It rips the heart out of your baby
I've taken too far too much to see or think or touch what's real
Stranded on this street that paved my only way home
If you really need it all
You just won't leave him behind

Oh please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
Don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
And don't try joke about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

It's sweet like nothing no
It's sweet like nothing at all
It's sweet like nothing no
It's sweet like nothing at all
It's sweet like nothing no
It's sweet like nothing at all1Embed
