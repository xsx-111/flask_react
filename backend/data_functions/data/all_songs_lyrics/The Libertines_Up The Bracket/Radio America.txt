Radio America Lyrics
If I get the call
I will call across Radio America
Right across America, I will call
Yes, I will call all across Radio America
Right across America, I will call

If call I must do
To take my love, my love to you

There a lovely young girl on aboard
Walks down here
And all across Africa, China, and Australia
I will call
Call you down in New Mexico
In New Brighton and Tokyo
I will call

If call we must do
To take my love, my love to you

For well it may hap' that these, are they
Your happiest days
Oh my, good old friend
I see you chanced your arm again
You cut you arm again
Red faced president
Took afternoon tea with her majesty, the Queen
And they watched old films flicker
Across the old palace movie screen
Crying 'what a shame' as she slipped in the rain
The poor dancing girl she won't dance again
And they tell me this was a transmission
To take my love, my love to you
And only to you
Yes, this was a transmission
To take my love, my love to youEmbed
