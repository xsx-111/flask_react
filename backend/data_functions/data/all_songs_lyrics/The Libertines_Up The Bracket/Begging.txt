Begging Lyrics
All animals we are
Round the bench, in the park
Your sister's in the dark today
Watery pinned eyes
My soul has gone a little cold

Well, maybe, maybe next year
If it isn't too dear
We'll get ourselves some good time girls
Remember when you pay
You'll pay in many many ways

And he's crossing the road
To get his daily sport

Oh now they're begging you
They're begging you
What will you do?
Oh Lord they're begging you
Your friend begging you
What will you do?
And have you heard the singer said
He's a dead ringer for
A feeling that I used to know
Lord, she cries oh Hell
No no it's a funny way to go

And he's crossing the road
Off picking up his daily sport

Oh now they're begging you
They're begging you
What will you do?
Oh Lord they're begging you
Your friend's begging you
What will you do?Embed
