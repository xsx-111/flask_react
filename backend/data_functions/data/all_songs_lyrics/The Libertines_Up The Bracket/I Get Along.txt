I Get Along Lyrics
You caught me in the middle
Phased on the carpet
I was following that move like more snakes
Said
"Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side
Standing to your right come on."

You caught me in the middle
Dazed and confused
I was following the good steps
Fancy free and footloose
Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side
Standing to your right come on, come on

I get along, I get along
I get along, I get along, get along
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)

It's coming out my ears so baby here's what we'll do
Four for you and nine for him and six for her and let me see you now
Something ain't quite right
But if you get them on your side
Then we'll have a good time, come on
I get along, I get along
I get along, I get along, get along
I get along just singing my song
People tell me I'm wrong
Fuck 'em
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)

It's coming out my ears so baby here's what we'll do
Four for you and nine for him and six for her and let me see you now
Something ain't quite right
You got the devil on your side, standing to your right, come on

I get along, I get along
I get along, I get along
And when I do I'm singing get along
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)
(Get along, get along, get along, get along)
(Get along, get along, get along)Embed
