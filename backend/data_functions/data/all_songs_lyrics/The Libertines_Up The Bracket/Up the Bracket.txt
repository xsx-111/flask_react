Up the Bracket Lyrics
I saw two shadow men on the Vallance Road
They said they'd pay me for your address
Oh, I was so bold
I said you see these two cold fingers
These crooked fingers I show
You as a way to mean no
Well they didn't like that much I can tell you
Said "Sunshine, I wouldn't wanna be in your shoes"
Then they chased me up threeflights of stairs
Caught me in the lift how I sighed and said
"Hello," but you're impossible

And it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
Now he'll wind up like Joseph, bloody in a hole
It's just like she's in another world
You know they suit each other oh no
Cause you never get close
It's impossible

Saw the same two men on the Cally Road
Said now they double their offer
I was so bold
To say "You see these two cold fingers I know
These crooked fingers I show
Oh you's a way to mean no"

But it's just like he's in another world
He doesn't see the danger on show
And he'll end up like Joseph, bloody in a hole
It's just like she's in another world
And now they suit each other oh no
But you never get close
(Crazy, unstoppable)
Fuck Off!

But it's just like we're all in another world
And how we suit each other oh no
But you never get close
That's close enough now...2Embed
