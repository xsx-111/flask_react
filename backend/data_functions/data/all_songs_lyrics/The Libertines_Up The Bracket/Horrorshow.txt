Horrorshow Lyrics
I've been following
Following your mind's instructions
On how to just slowly, sharply screw myself to death
Oh yes, there is a screw
And it's pointed at my head

Then look a dream peddler
Stick it right through my bones
Something wrong with shit outta you
Oi, you and you, what's your game?

Laying me down to waste
Laying me down
Pin me up or put me down
Ah, ah, ah, now
Let it all go
It's a horrorshow, come around
Horrorshow, the horse is brown
I left something in Moscow

She said "I'll show you a picture
A picture of tomorrow
There's nothing changing, it's all sorrow"
Oh, no! Please don't show me!
I'm a swine, you don't wanna know me!

Still, I've been following
Following your mind's instructions
On how to just slowly, sharply screw myself to death
Oh yes, there is a screw
And it's pointed at my head
And it's pointing at you

And would you lay me down please let me down
Pin me up or put me down
Oh oh oh oh now I let it all go
It's a horrorshow, come around
Horrorshow, the horse is brown
I left something in Moscow

Still, I've been following
Following your mind's instructions
On how to just slowly, sharply screw myself to death
Oh yes, there is a screw
And it's pointed at my head
It's pointing at you

And would you lay me down please let me down
Pin me up or put me down
Oh oh oh oh now I let it go
It's a horrorshow, come on round
Horrorshow, the horse is brown
Hmm, ohEmbed
