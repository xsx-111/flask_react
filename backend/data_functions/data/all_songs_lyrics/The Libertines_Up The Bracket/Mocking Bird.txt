Mocking Bird LyricsI won me a mocking bird a mocking bird a mocking bird
I won me a mocking bird when I gambled all night long
Mocking bird was squawking bird squawking bird was squawking bird
Mocking bird was squawking bird squawking all night long
Let me tell you I tried for the money I just wasn't able
Two more drinks and then I slipped under the table
Watch me slide
And she mocked me all night long
Drinks served by a Chinese girl Chinese girl Chinese girl
Drinks served by a Chinese girl Chinese all night long
Let me tell you she said
"You can look my boy" said "you can't touch
You got a jack a five and a couple of threes
I got the royal flush"
She mocked me all night long
I won me a mocking bird a mocking bird a mocking bird
I won me a mocking bird when I gambled all night long
Mocking bird was squawking bird squawking bird was squawking bird
Mocking bird was squawking bird squawking all night long
I tried for the money I just wasn't able
Two more drinks and then I slipped under the table
Watch me slide she mocked me all night long
She mocked me all night long
I tried for the money I just wasn't able
Had two more drinks and then I slipped under the table
Watch me slide
And she mocked me all night long
Yeah she mocked me all night longEmbed
