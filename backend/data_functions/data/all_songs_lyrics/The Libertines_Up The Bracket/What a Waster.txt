What a Waster LyricsWhat a waster, what a fucking waster
You pissed it all up the wall
Round the corner where they chased her
There's tears coming out from everywhere
The city's hard, the city's fair
Get back inside you've got nothing on
No you mind yer bleedin own you two bob cunt
When she wakes up in the morning
She writes down all her dreams
Reads like the Book of Revelations
Or the Beano or the unabridged Ulysses
Oh I really wanna know
So tell me, where does all the money go
Where does all the money go
Straight, straight
Up her nose
And I never really liked it any way
So much preferred it the other way yeah
What a divvy
What a fucking div
Talking like a moron
Walking like a spiv
I was laying in bed paying my rent
He was knocking on the door for something
That he lent her brother
Meanwhile from under the covers she says
Save me from tommorow, save me from tommorow
Oh no, Oh no not me
And I never never liked it any way
So much preferred it the other way yeah
Never really liked it any way
So much preferred it the other way yeah
What a waster, what a fucking waster
You pissed it all up the wall
Round the corner where they chased her
There's tears coming out from everywhere
The citys hard the citys fair
Get back inside
You've got nothing on
No you mind yer bleedin own you two bob cunt
What a waster, what a fucking waster
You pissed it all up the wall
Round the corner where they chased her
There's tears coming out from everywhere
The citys hard the citys fair
Get back inside you've got nothing on
No you mind yer bleedin own you two bob cuntEmbed
