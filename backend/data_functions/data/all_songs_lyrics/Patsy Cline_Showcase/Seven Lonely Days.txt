Seven Lonely Days Lyrics
Seven lonely days make one lonely week
Seven lonely nights make one lonely me
Ever since the time you told me we were through
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you

Oh, my darling you're crying, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo
There's no use in denying I cried for you
It was your favourite pastime, making me blue
Last week was the last time I cried for you

Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears
Seven letters, too, I filled with my fears
Guess it never pays to make your lover blue
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you


Last week was the last time I cried for youEmbed
