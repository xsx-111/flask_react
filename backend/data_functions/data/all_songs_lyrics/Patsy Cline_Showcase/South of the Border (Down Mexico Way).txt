South of the Border (Down Mexico Way) Lyrics
Ay ay ay ay

South of the border, down Mexico way
That's where they fell in love when stars above came out to play
And now as they wander, their thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while he kissed the smile upon her face
For it was Fiesta and they were so gay
South of the border, down Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered "Manana"
Never dreaming that they were parting
And he lied as he whispered "Manana"
For that tomorrow never came
South of the border, he rode back one day
There in a veil of white by candlelight she knelt to pray
The mission bells told him that he mustn't stay
South of the border, down Mexico way

Ay ay ay ayEmbed
