Deus Ibi Est LyricsAgainst my will to these sad shores, an unknown force has drawn me
Bound unto a future shaped by ancestors before me
Day on day I march the beat to someone else's drum
I have searched far foreign lands there's nowhere left to run
Impending storm rise up rise up, oh demons I shall shame you
Down the barrel of my gun and one by one I'll name you
Day on day my brothers leave go marching off to war
Yet we never understand for what we're fighting for
Ubi caritas et amor
Ubi caritas
Deus ibi est
Worldly desires and worldly gains designed for worldly men
I'm a master of the heart with ears and hands to lend
Soldiers come and soldiers go some changed by love for thee
A circle in the chain of life all fighting to be free
Ubi caritas et amor
Ubi caritas
Deus ibi est
Ubi caritas et amor
Ubi caritas
Deus ibi est
So come my lord and we shall dance to God's own private drum
Sweet Jesus and the holy vine the afterlife to come
Day on day I march the beat to someone else's drum
I have searched far foreign lands there's nowhere left to run
Ubi caritas et amor
Ubi caritas
Deus ibi estEmbed
