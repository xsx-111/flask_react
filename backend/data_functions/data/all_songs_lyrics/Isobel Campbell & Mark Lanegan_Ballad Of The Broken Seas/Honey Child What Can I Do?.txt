Honey Child What Can I Do? LyricsWishing, hoping for that old familiar feeling
That takes you miles above, yeah it's called love
Would you do it for me
Cause I'm feeling lonely
Praying, hoping and I leave the door wide open
I see you and you catch your spill
But come and sit by me
Cause I'm feeling lonely
Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasing butterflies like you
On these days they seem so cruel
But honey child what can I do
Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasing butterflies like you
On these days they seem so cruel
But honey child what can I do
Maybe I'm a stupid fool
Chasing butterflies like you
On these days they seem so cruel
But honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I do
Honey child what can I doEmbed
