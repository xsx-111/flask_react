The False Husband LyricsWhere have you been, my darling
Where have you been, my friend
Where have you been, my darling
Where have you been, my friend
A crow flew past my window sill
Stole me away from you until
You change your heart or change your will
Aren't you darling
Where have you been, my darling
Where have you been, my friend
Where have you been, my darling
Where have you been, my friend
And all the while that you would burn
Your tongue was working overtime
Love foregone and life's so good
Aren't you darling
In my words I cherry picked
Something fought and died today
With all our words I care not say
I need you darling
I've been chasing up loftier mountains
Be it against my will
You keep telling me "don't get no higher"
But I'll be higher still
I've been chasing up loftier mountains
Be it against my will
You keep telling me "don't get no higher"
But I'll be higher still
I've been chasing up loftier mountains
Be it against my will
You keep telling me "don't get no higher"
But I'll be higher still
I've been chasing up loftier mountains
Be it against my will
You keep telling me "don't get no higher"
But I'll be higher still
(Where have you been, my darling)
(Where have you been, my friend)Embed
