Revolver LyricsAnd I know what you do
I will soon catch you
Now after all
Don't it feel like nothing
Like walking away
Like a mouth full of rain
At twelve o'clock
A bell starts ringing
A dog starts barking
And you're still missing
Still missing something
You've never known what it was
And I'm not one for thinking twice
But I know this much is true
The earth will turn, the powder burn
And you are my revolver
Just waking up
Some dogs start barking
A bell starts ringing
And you're still missing
And after all
Don't it feel like nothing
Like walking away
Like a mouth full of rain
I'm holding on
Cause you're my revolver
And I dreamed of an ending
In a violent wayEmbed
