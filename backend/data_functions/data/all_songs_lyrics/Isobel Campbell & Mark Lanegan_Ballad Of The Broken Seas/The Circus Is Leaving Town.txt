The Circus Is Leaving Town LyricsThe party is over now
So draw the curtains down
Your secret is safe to keep
Unzip your velvet gown
And let your hair hang loose
Kick off your satin shoes
Throw back the eiderdown
Farewell to Friday's clown
The circus is leaving town
Oh Ruby, roll your stockins down
Circus is leaving town
Oh Ruby, dry your eyes
Fix up something to heap
Still water still run deep
The dogs are barking now
Get back out on the street
The circus is leaving town
Oh Ruby, roll your stockins down
Circus is leaving town
So Ruby, dry your eyes
The party is over now
Stop howling at the moon
You need a different beat
You need a different tune
Remember that old song
We heard when we were young
Life was an empty page
The world would ride upon
Do you recall the meadow past
We sit and watch the hours pass
You were such a good girl then
Oh Ruby, dry your eyes
Circus is leaving town
Oh Ruby, roll your stockins down
Circus is leaving town
So Ruby, dry your eyes
You're searching when you walk
You're searching when you talk
You could make me believe
That the sun sets in the east
The sun sets in the east
The sun sets in the eastEmbed
