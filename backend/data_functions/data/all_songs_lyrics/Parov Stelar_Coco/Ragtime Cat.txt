Ragtime Cat Lyrics
Ladies and gentleman  Parov Stelar with Ragtime Cat
:
Come on boys, let's get it straightened out now
Don't you know
Do you think you cannot swing
Everybody loves that thing
Pluck up courage, lose control
Push the trigger, free your soul
Do you think you cannot swing
Do you think you cannot swing
Everybody loves that thing
Pluck up courage, lose control
Push the trigger, free your soul
Don't you know
Don't you know

I love you, darling, I love you, and nothing will change it
Get in, we'll push it out of the way
Okay, but uh, take it easy
I am interested to see what sways your mind so heavily
Do you think you cannot swing
Everybody loves that thing
Pluck up courage, lose control
Push the trigger, free your soul
Do you think you cannot swing
Everybody loves that thing
Pluck up courage, lose control
Push the trigger, free your soul
Don't you know
Don't you know

I love you, darling, I love you, and nothing will change itEmbed
