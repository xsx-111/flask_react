The Mojo Radio Gang LyricsI gotta get a date
Fall the gather, forward…
I gotta get a date
Fall to the date
I gotta get a date
Fall the gather, forward…
I got a get a date
Fall to the date…

Just who do you think you are, a bigshot?
Yeah?
Down there! Filthy with fuzz!
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)

I gotta get a date
Fall the gather, forward…
I gotta get a date
Fall to the date
I gotta get a date
Fall the gather, forward…
I gotta get a date
Fall to the date…Embed
