Bone Marrow LyricsThus, now he knelt before the ruins
Cold of sweat and heat of flame
To vow the severed heads of those who brought the village
The village to it's shame
Those who plundered, pilfered, pillaged lives
Would now accept the blame
He would find them all with mighty vengeance paid for in their pain
Shah-Jan, the king of kings, wore seven rings
And sixty feathers plucked from sparrow's wings
Growing fat on the throne
Where he sat like a stone
As a man who has never known no hunger or shown no mercy
In, in promises broke like a bone, bone
And there he sat like a stone
With promises broke like a bone
Dispersed about his people
Rostam calls out for his equals
In thirst to rise and curse
Exact the worst revenge on
Enemies to hang from trees
Exact the worst revenge on...
The royalty must die! Must die (Must die!)
The royalty must die!
The royalty must die!
The royalty must die!
Like common beggars and petty thieves
"Tomorrow they will find us. Oh God, oh God, oh God."
Thus, now he knelt before the ruins
Cold of sweat and heat of flame
To vow the severed heads of those who brought the village to it's shame
The king of kings wore seven rings
And sixty feathers plucked from sparrow's wings
He's growing fat, growing fat on the throne
Where he sat like a stone
A man who has never known no hunger, shown no mercy
Those who ride against us will be murdered where they stand
Let our arrows rain from sky to drain blood into the land
If a mortal stands before us, strike him down with sleight of hand
And if heaven rides against us, then God himself must be damnedEmbed
