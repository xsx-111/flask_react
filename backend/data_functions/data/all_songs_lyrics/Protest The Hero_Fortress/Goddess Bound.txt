Goddess Bound LyricsTake everything your parents taught you
Throw it to the dogs
It's the forgotten flesh of something dead
Its blood drips from your jaws
Take everything your school has taught you and
Throw it to the dogs
It's the meat in the summer heat and reeks now of its rot
It speaks now of the fate that we await, to be forgot
Just as mountains live outside of rocks
And time outside of clocks
We hope this life exists beyond our lonely bones
In the, in the pine box
From the bottom of my heart
At the top, at the top of my lungs
From the corner of my eye
At the tip, at the tip, at the tip, at the tip of my tongue
Take everything your parents taught you
Throw it to the dogs
It's the forgotten flesh of something dead
From the bottom of my heart
Take everything your fucking school has taught you
Throw it to the dogs
It's the meat in the summer's heat and reeks now of its rot
It's everywhere, it's everywhere, it's everything, it's everyone
It's anywhere, it's anywhere, it's anything, it's anyone
It's the neighbor saving face by saying grace today for yesterday's behavior
It's the neighbor saving face by saying grace today for yesterday's behavior
Oh my God
Live to fuck and fuck 'til death
Drink to sorrows and regrets
Live to fuck and fuck 'til death
Drink to sorrows and regrets1Embed
