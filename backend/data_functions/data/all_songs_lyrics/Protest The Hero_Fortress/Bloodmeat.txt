Bloodmeat Lyrics
Enemies of Khanate
Strung on hooks like
Pigs to slaughter
Heads will roll
Heads will roll
Throats will be slit
Blood will flow
Like springs of water
Heads will roll
To the river red
Across the ochre steppe

A thousand fathers killed
A thousand virgin daughters spread
With swords still wet, with swords still wet
With the blood of their dead

Nurjan is upon us
He kills in silence after prayers
Genghis Khan is upon us
He slays his betrayers
Genghis Khan is upon us
He slays his betrayers
Thus now the fools of God
Will guard the city of our birth
Hold an ear to the ground
Yeah
Hear the sound
Clamoring
And horses stammer
As their gallop meets the earth

A thousand fathers killed
A thousand virgin daughters spread
With swords still wet, with swords still wet
With the blood of their dead
A thousand fathers killed
A thousand virgin daughters spread
With swords still wet, with swords still wet
With the blood of their dead

Tomorrow
Tomorrow they will find us
Hide the children free of sin
We will meet their blades by morning
Protected only by our skin
Tomorrow we will find them
Seek the youngest of their kin
And we will meet them with our fury
And we will crush them all like
Vermin, yeah
We will crush them all like vermin6Embed
