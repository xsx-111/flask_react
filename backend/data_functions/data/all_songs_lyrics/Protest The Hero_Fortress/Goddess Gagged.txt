Goddess Gagged LyricsOh God!
The sound they must have heard in the distance
A wilderness of sound and movement repeating itself across the narrows of the mountainsides
The cries of creatures crashing
On cold rock
The human voices heralding the hillside
Their bellows bounding ripe with resonance
From here the unimportant call received the all important answer
Oh goddess who bore us what we must have done
Goddess who bore us what we must have done
Bury your daughter and pray for a son
The wind and the rain
Spoke a language of wonder
To a species rising thickly to a dialogue with thunder
In the empty space between hunger and thirst
In the empty space between better and worse
Language unravels and irony hurts
Yeah!
In the commonplace between hunger and thirst
The words that confined us were blessing and curse
The words that confine us, ideas traversed the ear to hear the song without verse
The sound of the sound of the sound utter first
With a burst into nothing so sudden
So sudden and soft
The sound of the sound of the sound utter first
Burst into nothing so soothing and soft
The silence inside you when the music has stopped
The silence inside you when the music has stopped
When the music has stoppedEmbed
