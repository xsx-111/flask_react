Sequoia Throne (instrumental) LyricsDid you come here to kill
Or did you come here to die
And did you really think
That spaceships would descend
From the sky
Bending light and beaming forth
Across space-time
To see us scared in the reflection
Of their oil-black eyes
To stalk us like a predator
Like our movies imply
They're not the ones who've come to
Kill us
Come to fill us full of blood
They're not the ones who hate us
And they are not the ones
Who mutilate our animals
Or travel through the stars
They're not the ones who cause us harm
We are, we are, we are
We are still life in cold blood and
We feel nothing
We are still life in cold blood and
We feel nothing
Hell bent on heaven
Hell bent on heaven
Hell bent on heaven
Hell bent on heaven
While our righteous men are stuffing
Corpses full of shit and faith
We are, we are, we are still life
We are, we are, we are still life
We are, we are, we are
Still life
They're not the ones who cause us harm
We are, we are
(Did you come here to kill
Or did you come here to die)
We are still life in cold blood
We are still life in cold blood
And we feel, and we feel
Stuffing corpses
Full of shit and faith
They bloviate about a
Future beyond the moon
To bring about another planet's doom
To discover peaceful life
And beat our war drum to its tune
Unless my prayers are answered
Our end is coming soonEmbed
