Limb from Limb LyricsSplit the sky asunder
Noble huntress of the clan
In your left hand raise the sword
In your right hand cast the spear
Summon all the thieves and bastards hiding in the woodland
Crack their skulls in the cauldron for invading our frontier
The shadows fall, the hammer falls, the stone is placed above us all
We forge our weapons in the furnace
Soar to heights like oak trees tall
Do not beg before me, I'll not heed your appeal
With your final words be grateful you died by Irish steel
Do not crawl before us, your fate has been revealed
The heavens would not desecrate their gates with your admittance
Do not beg before me
I will not heed your appeal
With your final words be grateful you died by Irish steel
Do not beg before me
Your fate has been revealed
Do not crawl before me, I'll not heed your appeal
Son of flesh, I cast you out into exile forever hence
Flidais rides again
Flidais rides again
She is the forest, she is the rain
She is the huntress, she is the...
She! is the dusk, and
She! is the dawn
She! is the moon, and
She! is the sun

See her bellow out
See her, see her
Bellow out in anger
See her raise the infant fawn
She is drawn by a cart of Cervidae
She is here, she is gone
She is here, she is gone
She is goneEmbed
