Spoils LyricsEndowed with the art of casting names
Upon its beings
The humans claim dominion
Over every living fucking thing
Proud as
Purpose
As they became to walk the earth
As they arraigned the common creatures
Caught within the corpus-cursed
Conscious human brain
Caught within the corpus-cursed
Conscious human brain
Every word ever written will fall short
Of its intent
Even sung or spoke or screamed
They will betray what they have meant
They will betray what they have meant
They will betray what they have meant
Language is the heart's lament
A weak attempt to circumvent
The loneliness inherent in the search for permanence
All the future ghosts
Who scratch their names in wet cement
Demeaning meaning as they shout out at the emptiness
Demeaning meaning as they shout out at the emptiness
Abstractions are stake between the anima and animus
Deflesh the world of human destiny
Behold the world in other people
Life is clarityEmbed
