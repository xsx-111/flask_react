Wretch LyricsChews the fat with his creator
Over breakfast in the sunlight
Though when he says grace, when he says
Grace! He feels enveloped like a shadow
But there are evenings
There are evenings when this decimated world of movement, colour, and form
Gets thin
And getting thinner
When lights are dim
And getting dimmer
When nights are grim, and they're only getting
Only getting grimmer
As they barter their boulders
And martyr their soldiers
Teach a man to tear her fucking head from her goddamn shoulders
Held into the sun
By the threads of her hair
By the threads of her hair
By the threads of her hair
They impart the secret hatred of the fathers to their heirs
In a silence left unbroken, Oh
On a bed bound and gagged
Bound, bound and gagged
With culture, language, myth, and law
Our goddess gave birth, our goddess gave birth to your god
On a bed bound and gagged with culture, language, myth, and law
From a wounded womb where flesh was scarred and raw
Our goddess gave birth to your god
Our goddess gave birth to your god
Our goddess gave birth to your god
Our goddess gave birth to your god
Goddamn!
Culture, language, myth and law
(Our goddess! Gave birth!)
Culture, language, myth and law
(Our goddess! Gave birth you your god!)
(You want to see the galaxy?)Embed
