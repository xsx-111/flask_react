The Dissentience LyricsDown the street half a block away
In a familiar place regular people
Agree with each other in smoke signals
(Down the street half a block and in a familiar place
Regular people are agreeing with each other)
Interprets the law as aging with its eyesight failing
The law is aging (oh yes it is)
Sitting across, telling stories
Eyes unclosed like books we've read twice
(So sit across the table, feed me some lies)
So cry ghost, baby
So on the shelves lined with spines
The dust collects as scattered ash
From an urn unturned
Spilling over someone regular
And other such regulars
Cry ghost, or boast
Of a friend of a friend
Who saw a strange sight
Or heard a strange sound
Now whisper tall tales of murder
Down the street, half a block away
In a familiar place, regular people
Agree with each other in smoke signals
Brought together to burn, brought together to burn
Interpret the law as aging with its eyesight failing
Interpret the law as aging with its eyesight failing
Somebody's little girl
Dreams of the things she's read
Somebody's somebody's little girl
Dreams of the things she read
Or the monsters in her bed
Who hacked her
To blood-meat
Somebody's little girl
Dreams of the things she read
Or the monsters in her bed
Who hacked her to blood-meat1Embed
