Palms Read LyricsAs often as always
Evolution comes crawling from the sea
Alive with the urgency
Like suicide, like suicide
Convinced the grass is greener
On dry earth;
The march of serrated utterance like a soft cough
Muffled murmur sneaking through the lecture halls
They crawl across the island
The sound of waves in muddied water
Sprouting legs as loud as gallop,...
All the young people took a leap of no faith
In a riverbed that drowns about as much as it saves
...Throwing down on the ground against the cries of gravity
Belly-up, half buried in the sand
Extend your own hand to the smallness of death
Understand that only dying is this colossal
Creation shedding skin to find the perfect equilibrium like fossils
All the young people took a leap of no faith...
All the young cowards acting out...
All the young cowards acting out for the brave
Forever hurled into the water of their indifferent graves
For a million years raise your glass
We will never answer where we came from...
For a million years raise your glass in a cheers
We will never answer where we came from, only how we got...
For a million years raise your glass
We will never answer where we came from...
For a million years raise your glass
...only how we got here
(Two minutes, and then the lads are in for a surprise)Embed
