Soft Touch / Raw Nerve Lyrics
Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?
Is my radar that off?
Is my radar that off?

I'm thinking
That you're sinking
And I'll drown
I've got a confession
That your depression
Will take me down


Am I on the right track?
Am I on the right track?
Have I picked a bad time?
Have I picked a bad time?

It's seeming
That you're dreaming
With my eyes
But why protest
When your success
Is my prize
Oh brother
Give me a helping hand
Oh brother
Tell me you understand

Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?

I'm thinking
That you're sinking
And I'll drown
I've got a suspicion
That your position
Is unsound

Oh brother
Give me a helping hand
Oh brother
Tell me you understand
Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?
Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I hit a raw nerve?
Have I got a soft touch?
Have I got a soft touch?1Embed
