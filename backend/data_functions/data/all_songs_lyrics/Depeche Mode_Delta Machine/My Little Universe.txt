My Little Universe Lyrics
My little universe is expanding… slowly
Those who know me say I'm growing every day
Beautiful emptiness surrounds me
I take small steps
I'm making progress in an unspecific way

Here I am king
I decide everything
I let no one in
No one
No one
No one


The limited consciousness preserves me
It protects me
And just connects enough to keep the walls at bay
My little universe is expanding… slowly
Those who know me say I'm growing every day

Here I am king
I decide everything
I let no one in
No one
No one
No oneEmbed
