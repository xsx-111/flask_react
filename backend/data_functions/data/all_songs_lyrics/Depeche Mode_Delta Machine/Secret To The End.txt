Secret To The End Lyrics
When I look at you
I'm probably the same way too
I got a feeling that it's coming soon
Could this be the end?
And when I look around this room
It must be something I can do
Can I convince you that it isn't true?
We've come to the end

Oh did I disappoint you?
I wanted to believe it's true
Oh the book of love
Was not enough to see us through

The problem should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Could've been you)
Should've been you
If it hadn't been me
(Could've been you, could've been you)
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Could've been you)
Should've been you
If it hadn't been me

It seems so obvious to you
You're feeling what I'm feeling too
The final chapter in the contract expires soon
We've come to the end
Thank God I'm not the same as you
You always know exactly what to do
Is who I am, is not for you
We've come to the end

Oh did I disappoint you?
I wanted to believe it's true
Oh the book of love
Was not enough to see us through

The problem should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Could've been you)
Should've been you
If it hadn't been me
(Would've been you, could've been you)
Should've been you (Should've been you)
Should've been you (Could've been you)
Should've been you
If it hadn't been me3Embed
