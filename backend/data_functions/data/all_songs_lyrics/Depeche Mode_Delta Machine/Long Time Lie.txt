Long Time Lie Lyrics
It's been a while since you did something
Not too long since you complained
You sit around here doing nothing everyday
You're the coward who points a finger
I understand that I'm helping you
You have delusions in some spaced out fantasy
That's what you do

He loves to wallow in the glory
Loves to cut you down to size
He tried to make you believe in all of his lies
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
Long time lie


Don't you ever look in the mirror
Oh don't you know you're so much more
Locked up inside that box behind your door
All your twisted conversations
When you're sitting all alone
Just remember we know your secret while you moan
He loves to wallow in the glory
Loves to cut you down to size
He tried to make you believe in all of his lies
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
It's been a long, long, long, long, long, long time
Long time lie1Embed
