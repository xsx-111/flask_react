Welcome To My World Lyrics
Welcome to my world
Step right through the door
Leave your tranquillizers at home
You don't need them anymore
All the drama queens are gone
And the devil got dismayed
He packed up and fled this town
His master plan delayed

And if you stay a while
I'll penetrate your soul
I'll bleed into your dreams
You'll want to lose control
I'll weep into your eyes
I'll make your visions see
I'll open endless skies
And ride your broken wings

Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world

Watch the sunrise set
And the moon begin to blush
And make it in a search
Translucently too much
And I hold you in my arms
I keep you by my side
And we sleep the devil's sleep
Just to keep him satisfied

And if you stay a while
I'll penetrate your soul
I'll bleed into your dreams
You'll want to lose control
I'll weep into your eyes
I'll make your visions see
I'll open endless skies
And ride your broken wings

Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world4Embed
