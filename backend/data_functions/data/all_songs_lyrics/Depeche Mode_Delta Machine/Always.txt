Always Lyrics
The well is dry and the spring runs shallow
And the sun is high and the field lies fallow
My tongue is tied and my body aching
Now I'm opened wide and afraid of breaking
The food is hot and the tables are ready
But my stomach's knots make my hands unsteady
So I take to pacing up and down the room
While my heart keeps racing and my mind's consumed

I just want to be part of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes
I just wanna be part of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light, of the light in your eyes

The bed is made and the candle's burning
All our games are played and the clock keeps turning
We're out of tricks with the silence cutting
And the daggers stick as the doors keep shutting

I just wanna be part of the fight, of the fight, of the fight, of the fight, of the fight in your eyes
I just want to be part of the fight, of the fight, of the fight, of the fight, of the fight in your eyes
Always, always, always, always (forever)
Always (forever), always (forever), always (forever), alwaysEmbed
