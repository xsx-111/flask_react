Goodbye Lyrics
It was you that took my soul
And threw it in the fire
And tamed it in the rapture
And filled me with desire

Now I'm pure, now I'm clean
I feel good and serene
In you


There is no denying
How I have been changed
You won't hear me crying
Now misery is strange

I can dream, I can fly
Now it seems I get by
With you

Goodbye again
Goodbye again


I was always looking, looking for someone
Someone to stick my hook in
And pull it out and run

Now I'm caught on your ride
All my thoughts are entwined
In you


Goodbye again
Goodbye again


If you see me walking
To the golden gates
Then turn around, stop talking
Stop and hesitate
I'll be waiting up there
With my fate in the air
For you


Good goodbye Embed
