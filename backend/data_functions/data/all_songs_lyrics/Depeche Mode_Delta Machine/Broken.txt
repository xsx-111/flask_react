Broken Lyrics
If you want control without any pain
How long will you suffer?
How long will you reign?
You see, the friend that I knew
He cannot be found
Replaced by another wearing his crown

There's a place where I go without any sound
Only you can reach me
Only you're allowed
And you're so far away
You're so far from here
Do you remember a time without tears?

When you're falling
I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start

When you were a child
You'd dream all day long
You'd dream of the future
Get lost in your songs
Now that time is gone
It's lost for you now
Words long forgotten
Forgotten somehow
When you're falling
I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start
When you're falling
I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start
When you're falling
I will catch you
You don't have to fall that far
You can make it
I will be there
You were broken from the start5Embed
