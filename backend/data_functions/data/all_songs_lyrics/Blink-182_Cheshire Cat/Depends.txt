Depends Lyrics
I don't want to urinate on myself
I don't want to urinate on anyone else
Well, I guess that really doesn't matter anymore
Because I can't control my bladder anymore

Well, I guess it all depends
Undergarments
Well, I guess it all depends
Undergarments

Step back in the light
No more soiled nights alone
But I guess I don't have a care
Because there's not a load in my underwear

I'm sick of offending everyone I meet (go, go, go, go)
I'm sick of crying myself to sleep on rubber sheets (go)
I had an accident today
I left a soil on a bus seat, I didn't know what to say

But I guess it all depends (undergarments)
Well, I guess it all depends (undergarments)
Step back in the light (go, go)
No more soiled nights alone
Well I guess that I don't have a care if I
Don't have a load in my underwearEmbed
