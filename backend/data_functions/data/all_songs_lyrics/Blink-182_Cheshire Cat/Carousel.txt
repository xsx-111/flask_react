Carousel Lyrics

I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
I stop to think at a wishing well
My thoughts send me on a carousel
Here I am standing on my own
Not a motion from the telephone
I know not a reason why
Solitude's a reason to die

Just you wait and see, as school life is a
It is a woken dream, aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another, I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another night alone

Now as I walk down the street
I need a job just to sleep in sheets
Buying food every once in a while
But not enough to purchase a smile
A tank of gas is a treasure to me
I know now that nothing is free
I talk to you every now and then
I never felt so alone again
Just you wait and see, as school life is a
It is a woken dream, aren't you feeling alone?
I guess it's just another, I guess it's just another
I guess it's just another night alone17Embed
