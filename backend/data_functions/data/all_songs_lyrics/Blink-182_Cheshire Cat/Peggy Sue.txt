Peggy Sue Lyrics
I know what it's like to be alone sitting in your room
Listening to all the doubts that your parents have to say to you
And as your head gets all cluttered inside
Try to stay awake
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggressions
Because you're grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be, you're not alone

I know what it's like to be denied at everything you do
It's not the same reason why that
Makes you change the things that you once knew
As your head gets all cluttered inside
Give more than you take
Everything they say are lies
That's all the shit that you ever have to take

So hold in all your aggressions
Because you're grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at everything they say that
They tell you what to be, you're not alone
You say you want to take off your shoes as you
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week (Go!)
You say you want to take off your shoes as you
Walk barefoot down the street
Just to be the things that you can be
Just live for one more week

So hold in all your aggressions
Because you're grinding your teeth on down to
The bottom of your chin
It's not easy or so damn pleasing
To not laugh at every word they say that
They tell you what to be, you're not alone2Embed
