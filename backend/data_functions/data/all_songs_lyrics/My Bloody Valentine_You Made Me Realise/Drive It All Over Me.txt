Drive It All Over Me Lyrics
Cover up your windows
Close up all the doors
Time has come for me to really shine
Pick myself up off the floor
Things that'll make yourself cry
Can be tied above the well
Helplessly withering away
But I'll never ever tell

Run, run away, run, run away
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Got no one to talk to
Leave me alone, I'm happy to die today
Run, run away, run, run away
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Oh, the travel always gets me
Get in the car and drive it all over me

Cruelty in the winter
Happy when you're down
Pulling faces running after me
And we're sleeping underground
I didn't mean to hurt you
Didn't mean to make you sad
Wandering through all the memories
Of the good times that we had
Run, run away, run, run away
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Got no one to talk to
Leave me alone, I'm happy to die today
Run, run away, run, run away
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Oh, the travel always gets me
Get in the car and drive it all over me

Welcome to the fun time
We're so happy here
We've no minds, we might as well be blind
We can lie together here
You can come down and join us
You're more than welcome to
Even though it's painful to the ears
But it might not all be true

Run, run away, run, run away
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Got no one to talk to
Leave me alone, I'm happy to die today
Run, run away, run, run away
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Oh, the travel always gets me
Get in the car and drive it all over me1Embed
