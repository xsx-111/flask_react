LOADED Lyrics
Hey father, I can feel a
Fever eating up this home
In the hallway, voices say
Kill the things that you love the most

There's no space in the valley of the gods
Sign your name on the dotted line above

Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
'Cause I was pretty fucking poor
Take your elevator up to the sky
I'm gonna be on the TV tonight
I sold my soul to the devil tonight
And I'm still pretty fucking poor
But my gun is fucking loaded

I can see Central Park
Reflected in your eyes
But there's no passion, there's no spark
In the pupils nor the whites
Daddy's cool with a bullet 'tween his eyes
Momma too, she's paid up for her crimes

Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
'Cause I was pretty fucking poor
Take your elevator up to the sky
I'm gonna be on the TV tonight
I sold my soul to the devil tonight
And I'm still pretty fucking poor
But my gun is fucking loaded

My home and my possessions, they rendered me a slave
So I set my heart free, I went home and blew it all away
The espresso machine drip, the plasma screen displayed
The hum of the V8 whip, baby go home blow it all away

Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
Yeah I sold my soul to the devil tonight
'Cause I was pretty fucking poor
Take your elevator up to the sky
I'm gonna be on the TV tonight
I sold my soul to the devil tonight
And I'm still pretty fucking poor
But my gun is fucking loaded1Embed
