149 Lyrics
Confession 149
The incidents of 12th July
I’ve played them over in my mind
I wake screaming in my cell each night
Swear to God it weren’t my fault
I been schizo since the day Luella threw
Her engagement rings in the water
And issued her restraining orders

Do you need it?
Do you want it?
Now you got it
What you waiting for?

Oh no don’t tell me I got the wrong idea
I built an image you can’t live up to
I think I’m falling in love with what I fear
I’m just in love with the fiction of you

In the Chrysanthemum hotel
I wrote her name on every page
Of the Holy Bible and the Psalms
But I didn’t learn a fucking thing
So I took a drop of Methadone
And took a taxi to our home
I split the blood of our firstborn
And painted him across your door
Oh no don’t tell me I got the wrong idea
I built an image you can’t live up to
I think I’m falling in love with what I fear
I’m just in love with the fiction of you


Oh no don’t tell me I got the wrong idea
I built an image you can’t live up to
I think I’ve fallen in love with what I fear
Helsinki syndrome, it creeps up on youEmbed
