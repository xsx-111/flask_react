MMXX A.D. LyricsThe 21st century?
Don't talk to me about the 21st century
I am the fucking 21st century
I am the triplet and the millennial whoop
Asymmetry
The new Europe
I am every lonely, empty internet cafe in every lonely, empty American city
I am the BP oil spill
The desolate main street
I am a disgraced Hollywood mogul
I am revenge porn
The Soviet hangover
The baffled spectator at a flash mob
I am the lovingly graspable futureEmbed
