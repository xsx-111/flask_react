The West is Dead LyricsThree years ago I said
The West is dying right underneath my nose
And I'll be so glad when it finally goes
I hate to say I told you so
The West is dead
A sick pod of dolphins lap at the tide
The West is dead, flipper
Two drowned dogs float belly side up
The West is dead
Two girls spin around a mobius strip club
The West is dead, girls
Football fans with their heads in their hands
The West is dead
And the insects that you filter in the swimming pool each morning
Are really the likes of us
I am the West
And the West is dead
And I have danced on its grave
For six days straight
The Dalai Lama wore Dolce & Gabanna in vermilion red
And the West is dead
CEOs hang themselves by their neckties
And the West is dead
When I looked inside myself I found the dream of a lifeless glass desert
And all of this is lovely graspable
And all of this is pure pollution to the cosmos
I am the West
And the West is dead
And there will be no resurrection
No direction
Another lost erection
Signals the West is dead
The apocalypse will be so compassionate
Tenderness is filled with end
The West is dead
West is dead
The West is dead
The West is dead
The West is dead
The West is dead
The West is dead
The West is dead
The West is deadEmbed
