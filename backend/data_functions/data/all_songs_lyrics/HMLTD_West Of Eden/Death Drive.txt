Death Drive Lyrics
Tell me something, something stupid
Something to help me fall asleep
Give me a fuck or a glass of whiskey
Lie to me right through your teeth
Holy moly-moly why you so cool
Insect suicide, Hollywood swimming cool
You left me for God and left me for dead
Stumbling around with a hole in my head
I'm going up, up, up
I'm going up, up, up
I'm gasping for air, gasping for  love
Gasping for air but it's not enough
And what is that smell, what is that noise
I ain't a fool, I just got no choice

I'm on a death drive
I'm on a death drive

I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive, woah-oh-oh
I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive
Death drive, yeah
I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive, woah-oh-oh
I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive
Death drive, yeah
Oh mama-mama-mama-mama-mama-mama-mam Americans
What is on your mind?
Who put the soul on auto drive?
You got automatic souls, automatic cars
American idol superstars
And seventy virgins on a string
Well, baby that's just the American dream!

Americans-ah are on a death drive
Americans are on a death drive

I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive, woah-oh-oh
I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive
Death drive, yeah
I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive, woah-oh-oh
I'm on a death drive
Baby, baby, baby, I'm on a death drive
Death drive, yeah
