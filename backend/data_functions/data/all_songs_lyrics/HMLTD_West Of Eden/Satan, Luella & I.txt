Satan, Luella & I LyricsWe’ve been up and down these hills
And found ourselves in different pills
And I met Satan in a cheap motel
She talked at length about Orson Welles
You were washed up on the shore
Lamb’s blood ran down your door
Soft, gentle stranger
Remember me when you’re tired and old
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now
You were washed up on the shore
Lamb’s blood ran down your door
(Now let me tell you a story about war and peace)
Not every filth is art
Not every strangers fall
No row﻿ is Madonna
No stranger is god
Not every church is strong
Not every city's wrong
No struggle is in vain
No system is safe
And no law in this world
Is sacred and sane
Not every man would rather be dead than in chains
Not every war's unjust
Not every faith is love
No orgasm is ever enough
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now
Not every filth is art
Not every strangers fall
Not every generation is doomed to despair
Not every hate is wrong
Not every lust is sin
Not every revolution begins from within
You were washed up on the shore
Lamb's blood ran down your door
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now
Not every filth is art
Not every strangers fall
Not every generation is doomed to despair
Not every filth is art
Not every strangers fall
No orgasm is ever enough
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now
Soft, gentle stranger
Luella, babe won’t you marry me now1Embed
