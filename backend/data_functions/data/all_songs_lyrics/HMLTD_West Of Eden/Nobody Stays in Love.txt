Nobody Stays in Love Lyrics
Take my car (take my car), smash it up (smash it up)
I can’t find a way to stop
Hurting you (hurting you) and I don’t know (I don't know)
How and why we stooped so low

Drive off a bridge or drive
Into the night (baby, a light)
I told you our love was just
Just born to die (just born to die)

Nobody stays in love
It’s always bound to happen
Nothing perfect’s everlasting, ooh-ooh
Nobody stays in love
One way or another
We were bound to hurt each other, ooh-ooh
Nobody stays in love

Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Oh, I'm still in love, love, love
Here she lies (here she lies), cold as ice (cold as ice)
They say she won’t make it through the night
Hope is dwindling to a cinder
She was hurled right through the window
Cried “I can’t hold on much longer to you”

Now she says to me under
Hospital light (hospital light)
Lovers, not love, are the
First ones to die (first ones to die)

Nobody stays in love
It’s always bound to happen
Nothing perfect’s everlasting, ooh-ooh
Nobody stays in love
One way or another
We were bound to hurt each other, ooh-ooh
Nobody stays in love

Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Oh, I'm still in love, love, love

Nobody stays in love
It’s always bound to happen
Nothing perfect’s everlasting, ooh-ooh
Nobody stays in love
One way or another
We were bound to hurt each other, ooh-ooh
Nobody stays in love

Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Nobody stays in love
Oh, I'm still in love, love, love1Embed
