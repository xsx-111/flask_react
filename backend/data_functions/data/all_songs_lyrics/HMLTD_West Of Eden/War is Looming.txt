War is Looming LyricsWar is looming
And rags are all we have
Tie a makeshift noose or
Tie your colors to the flag
And pick a side to fall down on
And pray that you'll survive
Meet me in Hamburg
Or meet me in the afterlife
Murder in the border town
It was murder in the first degree
She was running away from the state
And taking refuge in my dreams
She said a blood-dimmed tide is loose
Lucifer is on the rise
Hiding in the dole queues
And in the bread lines
But I know, it's different for girls
I know, it's different for you
I know, for the likes of us
I'm g-g-g-g-g-g-gonna tell you
How we lost our heads at the rendezvous
In an old cafe where the music played
Her foreign tongue gave it all away
I know, it's different for girls
I know, it's different for you
I know, for the likes of us
And I hope someday
(We'll know who we are)
(x5)
Wake up darling, morning's breaking
The world is ending
But it's fine 'cause all
We ever want and ever were is lost in timeEmbed
