Blank Slate Lyrics
All I ever do is dream
And when I'm dreaming of you
I'm dreaming of the day when the west fell through
The day we stood, the day that we fought
The day that we lost everything
There were voices in the streets, people whispering

Row, row, row, there's a river of hate
There are cops in our heads
And we're killing them day-by-day
Oh, and all our fears can fall away

Throw away your books
Rally in the squares
The world is ours and the world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
And all my dreams were born today
Throw away your books
Rally in the squares
The world is ours and the world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
And all my dreams were born today
Within a couple of weeks, we'd won it all
We climbed skyscrapers just to watch them fall
We built a palace out of rubble, and a place out of bones
And now we know for good, there's no returning home

Oh, I've forgotten who I am
Oh, and I know you feel the same
Oh, I've got nothing left to give
I tried my best to keep you safe

Throw away your books
Rally in the squares
The world is ours and the world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
And all my dreams were born today
Throw away your books
Rally in the squares
The world is ours and the world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
The world is a blank slate
And all my dreams were born today
I won't forget you that easily
I tried my best to make you see
I'd rather die than let you go
