Streets of Gold LyricsWell I know what I want, I know how to get it
These streets in my mind, needing more
I long to survive, I call for yesterday
Feel all this passion, love some more
Streets of gold
I gotta make my stand
Streets of gold, oohh
Well I know what I need, when Ma wrote me a note
Said come home to stay, I said no
Can you see the light, long to her far away
Streets of gold
I gotta make my stand
Streets of gold, oohh
Well I know what I want, I know how to get it
These streets in my mind, needing more
I long to survive, I call for yesterday
Feel all this passion, love some more
Streets of gold
I gotta make my stand
Streets of gold, oohhEmbed
