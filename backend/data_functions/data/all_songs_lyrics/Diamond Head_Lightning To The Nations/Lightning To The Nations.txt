Lightning To The Nations LyricsYes i'm coming
Angel from the sky, put his hand in mine
I can spread your gifts, for golden present time
I'm going to set you down
I'm going to make it right
I'm going to bring it home
I'll bring you lightning to the nations
To the nations
To the nations
To the nations
From the shores of home, we send a gift of love
To sweet and hopeful hearts, a gift from high above
I'm going to set you down
I'm going to make it right
I'm going to bring it home
I'll bring you lightning to the nations
To the nations
To the nations
To the nations
Here it comes now
London
New York
To the nations
To the nations
Lightning to the NationsEmbed
