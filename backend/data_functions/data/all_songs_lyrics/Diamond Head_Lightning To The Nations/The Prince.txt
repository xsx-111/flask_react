The Prince LyricsNow I see his face, I've seen him smile
Such a lonely place, no golden mile
His eyes tell morbid tales of his black heart
His deeds through ages past tell of his part
I see his face, I see his smile
Time to die
Oh, oh, oh
An angel from below, change my dreams
I want for glory's hour, for wealth's esteem
I wish to sell my soul, to be reborn
I wish for earthly riches, don't want no crown of thorns
I see his face, I see his smile
Time to die
Oh, oh, whoa-oh


I was born a fool, don't want to stay that way
Devil take my soul, with diamonds you repay
I don't care for heaven, don't you look for me to cry
And I will burn in Hell, from the day I die
I see his face, I see his smile
Time to die
Oh, oh, whoa-ohEmbed
