Waited Too Long LyricsNow I feel I must say goodbye, I wanted you to see
It's not over between you and I, I'm sure you must agree
I gave you time but not enough it seems
I'm saying baby
Waited too long, waited too long for you to see
Waited too long, I've waited too long
Waited too long, waited too long
Waited to long for you to be
Waited too long, waited too long
Ooh baby, I must be moving on
Cos now I know we're not in love
And soon I will be gone
The times that we've had, good and bad
I'm saying baby
Waited too long, waited too long for you to see
Waited too long, I've waited too long
Waited too long, waited too long
Waited to long for you to be
Waited too long, waited too long
I will be moving on, I've waited so long
Soon I will be gone, oh don't you seeEmbed
