Diamond Lights LyricsI have just arrived the soundcheck gets underway
Three hours to go, then it's time to play
Check guitars now baby, everything looks fine
Now to do a number, take our time
I smile as I look around me
The band plays so tight
I look around me, I see and feel
Diamond lights, Diamond lights
Soundcheck's finished baby, time to tell a joke or two
Relax, can't let it get to you
The haunted theatre now has come to life
Time to tip your hat to the band
Curtain up, the people welcome you
Guess everything's alright
I see the people now, hypnotised by
Diamond lights, Diamond lights
Diamond lights, Diamond lights
Diamond lights, Diamond lights
Diamond lights, Diamond lights
Diamond lights, Diamond lightsEmbed
