Helpless LyricsI got to see you moving fast, see you come my way
See the dreams, I hope they last, never fade away
Gotta see the lights above, make it loud tonight
Gotta set it all on fire, set it all alight
I can see the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you alight
Gotta make it, man, I ain't got no choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless, ooh!
I don't know what I'm gonna do, maybe not tonight, yeah
Gotta set you all on fire, gotta treat you right
I can see the flashing lights, laser for your love
Gotta hear the thunder roar, coming from above
See the flashing lights, hear the thunder roar
I am gonna set you all alight
Gotta make it, man, I ain't got no choice
Gotta fill this hall tonight
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless
Helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless, ooh!
Yeah, yeah
Uh!
I can see the stars, I can see what's going on
Every night alone, I sing my song just for fun
Only time will tell if I make myself someday
The stage is mine, music is my destiny
Cannot squeeze the life from me
I can see the lights, but I can see what's going on
Every night alone, I sing my song just for fun
This business ain't for laughs, businessmen don't like it so
Helpless maybe babe, but you can still enjoy the show
Cannot squeeze the life from me, yeah
Woo!
Gotta be good, see you tonight
I know that was fine
Gotta be safe, gotta be true
You know that you're mine
Help me now, I'm coming out, oh whoa oh
Gotta be fine, gotta be right
You'll set me alight
Help me now, I'm coming out
I can see the band from miles away
It looks so right, feels so tight, oh whoa oh
It feels so fine, feels so good, whoa whoa
Makes a man a whole man
Lord, it's gotta make my day
Helpless, helpless, oh whoa oh
Helpless, helpless, oh whoaEmbed
