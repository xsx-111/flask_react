Play It Loud LyricsHey mom, what do you say
I've seen the lights more than what they say
The music's fine, I like it loud
I play my song, loud and proud
Yeah baby, it's alright
It's so late, I'll take my time
Light the lights and burn my brain
Sweeten me, it's just the same
Hey dad, what do you say, oh yeah
You gotta know, know, know what makes my day
You hit it good, you hit it right
I'm going on now, I'll be good tonight
Yeah baby, it's alright
It's so late, I'll take my time
Light the lights and burn my brain
Sweeten me, it's just the same
Play it loud...
Oh I want you to, I'll groove you too
Loud, oh, that's gotta be
You know it's gotta beEmbed
