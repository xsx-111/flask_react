Sweet And Innocent LyricsYou live it good girl
And baby you live it high
You reach it easily, makes me wanna cry
You look so good girl
I suppose you always do
So fine and so sweet
It's good to look at you
Sweet and innocent
And settled down
Sweet and innocent
I'll pass around, yeah
You ain't in fashion
Baby you're as one
It's not long before - it's much more than fun
Yes it's taking chances, but they don't want to know
And since your fine baby left you
Don't know which way to go
Sweet and innocent
And settled down
Sweet and innocent
I'll pass around, yeah
You live it good girl
And baby you live it high
You reach it easily, makes me wanna cry
You take it good girl
I don't know who will bring you down
Sweet and innocent
And settled down
Sweet and innocent
I'll pass around, yeahEmbed
