Shoot Out the Lights LyricsLet me tell you now, about a friend of mine
He tried to shoot them lights, with whiskey and the wine
He didn't get so far, ah his gun was wrong
Now my sweet friend, where's your song?
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Now that friend of mine, he never made a day
Didn't know what to do, told him to get away
I ain't going yet he said, I'm gonna be a star
I got a gun my friend, sitting in the car
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Let me tell you now, about a friend of mine
He tried to shoot them lights, with whiskey and the wine
He didn't get so far, ah his gun was wrong
Now my sweet friend, where's your song?
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lights
Shoot out the lights, shoot out the lightsEmbed
