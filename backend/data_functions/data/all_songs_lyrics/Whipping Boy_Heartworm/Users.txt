Users LyricsI have used so many people
For no reason or no gain
Sometimes it's just for fun
Or a way to keep me sane
There's someone lost inside of me
Who drowned in risky games
You ask too many questions for me to feel okay
What if you lost all those fears of me
And I tell you it's not easy
Cause with grace I made you pay
The limits that we set make good lovers turn away
Remember how not long ago
We screwed away the pain
I tell you it's not easy, each dog must play his game
What if you lost all those fears of me
I'll let you go, so don't beg me, beg me
I'll let you go, so don't beg me, beg me
I'll let you go, so don't beg me, beg me
Now you've gone and I'm still the same
But that will never change
A bitter love, a broken love, a love that stays the same
Now you've gone and I'm to blame
There's nothing left to say
I told you it's not easy, each dog must play his game
Walk out of here, you could run out of time
But I'm never gonna get to you
You have loved all my lies and plagued my desires
But I'm never gonna get to you
It's the end of my time and I have to decide
If I ever wanna see it through
Beg me, beg me, beg meEmbed
