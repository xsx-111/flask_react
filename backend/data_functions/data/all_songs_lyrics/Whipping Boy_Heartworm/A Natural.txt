A Natural LyricsToday is not a good day for me
For today I found out I was mad
As I have discovered this in the last 45 minutes
My madness is still new
Fresh in my mind so to say
So I can understand it more
It has come to my attention that over the past year and a half
I have acquired a condition known as acute paranoid schizophrenia
In relation to everyone and everything I did
It gradually worsened
Through the year to this point of realisation
That I have a twin mind
And in the intervening time I consumed with a passion various things to keep the main side happy
And as the main side grew hungrier quicker
And if it wasn't fed each time
It began to eat the other
Distrust of everything, it ran in the family
At least on my mothers side
There was too much trust in the other
I am its eldest offspring and I too have distrust too much
That's why I don't want children
Each person has their own tragedy
Mine as I found out, was this fear of my old lady turning into the very same old lady that I despised when I grew up
But you fall in love
And is it possible to fall in love with Every woman you meet?
You just stand there with your mouth
Open thinking wishing I never existed
But this is my time and the girl I just met should be here
'Cause here was a woman
Who held me and did not copy my every move
She just let it happen
Never asked
But I answered
For I myself am heaven and hell
Today is not a day for me
Today is not for me
Today is not a day for me
Today is not for me
Today is not a day for me
Today is not for me
Is not for meEmbed
