The Honeymoon Is Over LyricsThe honeymoon is over
And you're still with me
I'm sitting here and I'm tired
I've found my disease
My back's against a wall now
This time I'll prove you wrong
And you had to stop, you had to stop and say
It's not right, it's not right
I've been a liar all my life
Love is something we find in danger
What a feeling when it's not right
You're a master of disguise now
You had to learn to tell your lies
I'm steady on my knees
I'm steady on my knees
All ready on my knees
My back's against a wall now
This time I'll prove you wrong
And you had to stop and say, you had to stop and say
It's not right, it's not right
It's not right, it's not right
It's not right, it's not right
It's not right, it's not right
I've been a liar all my life
A rambling rose with a musky smell walked
Into my life and told me things that I cannot tell
I'm gonna sow the seeds of doubt in your mind
Now I'm gonna change the way you wonder
The way you lie
But the beeps are coming baby and it's time to say goodbye
I'll phone you back again, I'll phone you back and lie
So you remember now how to get your story straight
I follow in your footsteps
I've been telling the same old lies
For the same old sake
So you remember now
What it takes to make a mother cry
You stupid boy
So you remember now
What it takes to make a woman cry
You silly boy
So you remember now
What it takes to make a mother cry
You stupid boy
So you remember now
What it takes to make a woman cry
You silly boyEmbed
