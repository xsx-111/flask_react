Tripped LyricsIt's easy to believe in you
Reasons to cast doubt on me
Easy to believe in you, in you
I'll put my faith in womanhood
Just like my mother said I would
Easy to believe in you, in you in you
Was I the only one to know
That she'd been letting go
Accept your mind and your body lives
She had nothing left to give
Need you to fall back on to
Need me more than I need you
Easy to be just like you, like you
I've lost my faith in all things good
Just like mother said I would
You'll be left there on the shelf
Can't save someone from themselves
Was I the only one to know
That she'd been letting go
Accept your mind and your body lives
She had nothing left to give
She tripped, she tripped
She tripped, she tripped
She had nothing left to give
She had nothing left to give
Except you
You know you were the only one
You said to me, why did you stop
You know you were the only one
You said to me, why did you stop
Alone again alone
She tripped, she tripped
She tripped, she tripped
She had nothing left to give
She had nothing left to give
Except you
You know you were the only one
You know you were the only one
You know you were the only one
You know you were the only one
It's easy to be just like youEmbed
