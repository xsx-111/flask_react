Morning Rise LyricsHeard the news that Johnny's free
Not that that means much to me
I look down and all I see
There's nothing staring back at me
I remember all the things you said
I remember all the things you said
When our time comes
When our time comes
I will know
I will know
When our time comes
When our time comes
I will know
I will know
Misery and Wednesday's dead
He's thinking of the life she's led
I don't owe you anything
I can't change the life you live
Maybe I'm no ordinary fool
Maybe I'm no ordinary fool
When our time comes
When our time comes
I will know
I will know
When our time comes
When our time comes
I will know
I will know
John came home from work one day
And watched her tidy things away
Don't look at me like I'm insane
Don't take for granted life this way
I can't do anything for you
I can't do anything for you
When our time comes
When our time comes
I will know
I will know
When our time comes
When our time comes
I will know
I will know
I can't suppress these feelings any longer
You excite me, delight me, inspire me, drive me
It's in your eyes a fire that's wild and glorious
Unhibited, unfinished in everything I do
Let the morning rise like our hearts desire
I can't help thinking that I love youEmbed
