Fiction LyricsDone with drinking, thinking, fighting
I've sat down and washed out greed
Turned on shyness, conquered weakness
Out of kindness some say need
Hear me, I can't find a place where I belong
Hear me, never give much thought to what went wrong
I can't control myself
I can't control myself
No more songs for swinging lovers
Streams of whiskey over me
You. C. Bjorling be my teacher
Dress me down like Kid Chelene
Bleed me, there must be more to life than this
Bleed me, I can't recall the things I miss
I can't control myself
I can't control myself
God knows that I'm only trying
Only trying to please me
Not for me your idol worship
Not for me your games of greed
Forgive me, I can't find a line to fit this song
Forgive me, I'm not a friend who lasts for long
I can't control myself
I can't control myself
I can't control myself
I can't control myselfEmbed
