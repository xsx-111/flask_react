Twinkle LyricsWaiting to be bled
Turning tricks just like your mother
Left my dreams for dead
Making out with every other
She's the air I breathe not too pure for me
She's the air I breathe not too cheap for me
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me
Hole right through her head
I think I might be nothing to her
Sing it now she said
Fuck I might be here forever
She's the air I breathe not too pure for me
She's the air I breathe not too cheap for me
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me
Ringing in my head
Too clearly I can hear you moving
You talk sister fear
You're gonna pay for all the hate I'm giving
She's the air I breathe not too pure for me
She's the air I breathe not too cheap for me
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for me now and always
She's the only one for meEmbed
