Settle Lyrics
Every night before I, go to sleep
I listen long to the, bustling streets
And I wonder, how long, I’m gonna settle
Oh I’m gonna settle

They raised me up, on brick and bread
Concrete jungle living, in your head
And I wonder, how long
I’m gonna settle
I’m gonna settle

My mama, was told by them
And my daddy, he was told by them
Oh man, won’t you be the one
To help me understand?

No answer, just waiting
Anticipating why

Hmm --
Ooh --
Hmm --
Hmm --
A little patchway up, in the sky
It says “you can leave here, any time you like”
And I wonder, how long, I’m gonna settle
How long I’m gonna settle
How long
I’m gonna settleEmbed
