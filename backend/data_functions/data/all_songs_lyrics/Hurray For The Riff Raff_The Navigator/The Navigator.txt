The Navigator Lyrics
Today I feel weak
But tomorrow I’ll feel a queen
I was raised by the street
Do you know what that really means?
All the hurt I've suffered
It just begins again
In a baby girl
Or a full-grown man

Tomorrow will come
Like the turning of the sun
Over tall buildings
And the beating of a drum
It lives in my heart
But buried in the past
Here comes the navigator
She knows you’re fading fast


Oh where, will all my people go?
The navigator wants to know
(Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Oh, where, will all my people live?
The navigator won’t forgive
(Hmm, mm-hmm)
Oh where, will all my people go?
Navigator wants to know
(Oh, hmm, mm-hmm)
Oh, where, will all my people go?
The navigator wants to knowEmbed
