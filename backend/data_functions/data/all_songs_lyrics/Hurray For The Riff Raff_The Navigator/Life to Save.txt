Life to Save Lyrics
I’m gettin’ heavy
I’m feelin’ sad
Lost my good daddy
Best friend I ever had
Mmm-hmm

And it’s getting lonely
Oh, at the bottom of a bottle
My mind gets full up on moonlight
The morning opens like a Bible
Mmm-hmm

Oh, I, still got a life to save
I still got a life to save
Well, I, still got a life to save
Life’s funny that way
Oh, that way
(Hey!)

Ooh-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Hmm
Well, it’s gettin' harder
I’ll just-ah give up the past
Everyday a reminder
Just that nothing can last

And it’s gettin' lonely
Way down at the bottom of a well
My baby, I’ve been lookin’ for you
Oh honey, couldn’t you tell?
Hell --

Oh, I, still got a life to save
Well, I, still got a life to save
I still got a life to save
Life’s funny that way
That way --
That way --
That wayEmbed
