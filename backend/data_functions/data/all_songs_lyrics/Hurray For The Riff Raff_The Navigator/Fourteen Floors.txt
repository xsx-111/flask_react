Fourteen Floors Lyrics
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been lying
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been crying
When I woke up, it was all gone
They took it when I was asleep
When I woke up, it was all gone
They took it when I was asleep
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been lying
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been crying

My father said it took a million years
Well he said, that it felt like, a million years
My father said it took a million years
Well he said, that it felt, like, million years
My father said it took a million years
Well he said, that it felt like, a million years
My father said it took a million years
Well he said, that it felt like, a million years --

Oh, just to get here
Just to get here
Just to get here
Just to get here
Just to get here
Just to get here, here
Just to get here
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been lying
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been crying
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been lying
Fourteen floors, up in the sky, I been crying
