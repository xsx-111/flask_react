Hungry Ghost Lyrics
Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh

I've been a lonely girl
I've been a lonely girl
But I'm ready for the world
Oh, I'm ready for the world

I've been a heart for hire
I've been a heart for hire
And my love's on a funeral pyre
Oh my love's on a funeral pyre

When will you
When will you help me out
You can't even pick me out of the crowd
Ohhh ohh ohh ohhh
Ohh ohh ohh
Ohh
Ahh Ahh
Ahh Ahh
I've been nobody's child
I've been nobody's child
So my blood started running wild
Oh, my blood started running wild

I've been a hungry ghost
I've been a hungry ghost
And I've traveled from coast to coast
Oh, I've traveled from coast to coast

When will you
When will you help me out
You can't even pick me out of the crowd

Oh and I
I don't need you anymore
So then why am I standing at your door
Ohhh ohh ohh ohhh
Ohh ohh ohh ohh

I've been a lonely girl
I've been a lonely girl
But I'm ready for the world
Oh I'm ready for the world
Well I'm ready for the world
Oh I'm ready for the world
Oh I'm ready for the world
Oh I'm ready for the world
Well I'm ready for the worldEmbed
