Living in the City Lyrics
I've got her cane
Oh and Big Danny is wasted
He said I'm the sweetest thing
Oh that he's never tasted
Mariposa's singing love songs
All in her dark apartment
Fourteen floors a'birthin
And fourteen floors a'dying

Livin' in the city
We're just livin' in the city
Livin' in the city
Well it's hard, it's hard, it's hard

Oh I'll take you to the stairwell
And give you something I can offer
You know the heart is not the hopeless
The heart is a lonely hunter
Hot long summer days
We're just sneakin' by the river
Well, I'll lock my dreams away
And I'll watch the city quiver
Livin' in the city
We're just livin' in the city
We're livin' in the city
Well it's hard, it's hard, it's hard

Gypsy bit the dust
You know the shit he had - it was poisoned
You know now everybody wants
Just a taste of what we sold him
Standing on the roof tops
We're just yellin' till the morning
All surrounded by the visions
Of all who came before them

Livin' in the city
We're just livin' in the city
Oh, livin' in the city
Well it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
Livin' in the city
We're just livin' in the city
Oh, livin' in the city
Well it's hard, it's hard, it's hard
Oh, it's hard, it's hard, it's hardEmbed
