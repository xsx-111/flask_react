Halfway There Lyrics
Walked down the street
Hold my head up high
Everywhere I go
Someone tells me a lie
A lie --
A lie --
A lie

Mothers and babies
Well they’re both the same
Oh, they’re born to each other
And they’re given a name
A name --
A name --
A name

Rain starts to fall and --
Like the leaves on the trees
And everywhere you go
Someone’s down on their knees
Begging please --
Please --
Please

So we sing a song
And we say a prayer
And someone says
“Baby, you’re only halfway there”
Ooh --
Ooh --
You’re halfway there (Ooh)Embed
