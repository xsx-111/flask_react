Entrance Lyrics

One for the navigator --
Call my Lord!
Work for the navigator --
Call my Lord!

If you feel you don’t up with your soul surprised
(Bum-bum-ooh)
Heaven gonna look you right in your eyes
(Ooh)

One for the navigator --
Call my Lord!
Two for the train that’s rollin’
Won’t you get on board?
Whoa-oh-oh-yeah!
Two for the train that’s rollin’
Get on board!

Listen real close to the engines roll
(Bum-bum-ooh)
Hear quiet angels sing the heavenly scores
(Ooh)
One for the navigator --
Call my Lord!
One for the navigator --
Call my Lord!
Whoa-oh-oh-yes!Embed
