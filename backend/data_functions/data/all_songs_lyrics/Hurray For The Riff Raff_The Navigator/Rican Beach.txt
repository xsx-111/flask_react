Rican Beach Lyrics
Man built the railroad, man got a move
Man put out a record, put a needle to the groove
Man been up, oh man been down
Now man don't want no woman around

First they stole our language
Then they stole our names
Then they stole the things that brought us faith
And they stole our neighbors
And they stole our streets
And they left us to die on Rican Beach

Well you can take my life
But don't take my home
Baby it's a solid price
It comes with my bones

Now all the politicians
They just flap their mouths
They say we'll build a wall to keep them out
And all the poets were dying
Of a silence disease
So it happened quickly and with much ease
Well you can take my life
But don't take my home
Baby it's a solid price
It comes with my bones

I may never see you again
I may never see you again
I'll keep fighting til the end
I'll keep fighting til the end
I'll keep fighting til the end
I'll keep fighting til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Til the end
Til the endEmbed
