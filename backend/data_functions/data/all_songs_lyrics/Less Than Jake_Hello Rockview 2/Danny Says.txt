Danny Says Lyrics
Danny says that he got caught up
In all the talk of how it used to be
And he says, "I never used to mind that same lame line
It's just you and me"
Danny says that he's so bored now
Since he figured out that back in the day
He rarely says how I remember this
And don't give a shit about what you have to say

He's only nineteen
Burnt out on the scene, yeah
He's only nineteen

Danny says that he got caught up
In all the talk of how it used to be
And he says, "I never used to mind that same lame line
It's just you and me"
Danny says that he's so bored now
Since he figured out that back in the day
He rarely says how I remember this
And don't give a shit about what you have to say

He's only nineteen
Burnt out on the scene, yeah
He's only nineteen
He's only nineteen
Burnt out on the scene, yeah
He's just getting by on the memories
Oh-oh
Woah-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
He's only nineteen
Burnt out on the scene, yeah
He's only nineteen (only nineteen)
He's only nineteen
Burnt out on the scene, yeah
He's just getting by on the memories
Oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh-ohEmbed
