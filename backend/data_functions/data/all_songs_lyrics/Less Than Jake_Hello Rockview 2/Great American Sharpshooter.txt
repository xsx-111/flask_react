Great American Sharpshooter LyricsSo you think
Of what it could've been
When time is all you've lost
It keeps burning through your head
Now you fall asleep standing
But lie awake in bed
Watch the clock drag on
And think of what you should've said
It's for the better
Your better half's gone
It's okay, you didn't need her anyway
And I don't wanna hear you say
Nobody can take her place
And what more can I say?
You don't need her anyway
And so you think
Of how it should've been
And it's just stubborn
It keeps going through your head
You're hearing all those words
Time and time again
Watch the phone all night
And think of what you should've saidEmbed
