Nervous in the Alley LyricsOn a Tuesday in the rain
I never thought there'd come a day
I never thought there'd come a day, yea
If I put myself to the test
Would I ever raise a fist
Would I just shut my mouth
Would I just block it out
I've swore it a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness left standing
Just nervous in the alley
I've swore it a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness left standing
Just nervous in the alley, woah
Just nervous in the alley
And when all is said and through
Would I know just what to do
Would I know just what to do, yea
If I put myself to the test
Would I ever raise a fist
Would I just shut my mouth
Would I just block it out
I've swore it a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness left standing
Just nervous in the alley
I've swore it a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness left standing
Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh.. Woah-woah
It's a change of heart
That keeps us apart
(you say it's true
You know it's true
Nothing left except for me and you)
It's not that strange
With all I have to say
I wonder what I'm fighting for, yea
I've swore it a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness left standing
Just nervous in the alley
(Woooooaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh)
I've swore it a million times
Never to be left again with that feeling
Of hopelessness left standing
Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alley
Woah-oh... Just nervous in the alleyEmbed
