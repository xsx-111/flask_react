Theme Song For H Street LyricsYou know my best friend
Just left yesterday and I know
I know your girlfriend
Wasn't here to stay, she moved away
Things are so the same
And all I really can really bring
Myself to say is that I know
That I know
That I know
And remember when they said
"Just how long can your ideals keep you warm?"
And we just laughed that kinda nervous laugh
We just sang along to that song that's on the radio
To that song that's on the radio
And yeah just outside
The conversation's getting old
And I know they're right
Betting smokes that our end is just as close
Things are so the same
And all I really can really bring
Myself to say is that I know
That I know
That I know
And remember when they said
"Just how long can your ideals keep you warm?"
And we just laughed that kinda nervous laugh
We just sang along to that song that's on the radio
To that song that's on the radio
You were right about
Just how we'd figure out
Things change but beliefs stay the same
And you were right about just how we'd figure out
A change of ideas I've known
That I know
That I know
That I know
And remember when they said
"Just how long can your ideals keep you warm?"
And we just laughed that kinda nervous laugh
We just sang along to that song that's on the radio
To that song that's on the radio
To that song that's on the radio
To that song, it's on the radioEmbed
