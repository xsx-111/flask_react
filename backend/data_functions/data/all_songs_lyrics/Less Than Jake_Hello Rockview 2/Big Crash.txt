Big Crash LyricsSometimes, I think somethings
Wrong with me because
I was never one
To believe in anyone or anything
Its always been just me
Its always been just
And you know, they've always had
Always had big plans for you
Just to walk you through
And cloud your views. Woah-oh-ho
And I'll never say
Everythings ok
Don't wanna say that
You're giving up right now
Just hold your ground
And don't give up
In what you believe
Big plans
Big crash
Don't be different
When you can't be yourself
Big plans
Big crash
Don't be different
When you can't be yourself
Sometimes, I think somethings
Wrong with me because
I was never one
To believe in anyone or anything
I can't say I'll ever change
Won't say I'll ever change
And you know, they've always had
Always had big plans for you
Just to walk you through
And cloud your views. Woah-oh-ho-oh-ho-oh
And I'll never say
Everythings ok
Don't wanna say that
You're giving up right now
Just hold your ground
And don't give up
In what you believe
Big plans
Big crash
Don't be different
When you can't be yourself
Big plans
Big crash
Don't be different
When you can't be yourself
Big plans
Big crash
Don't be different
When you can't be yourself
Big plans
Big crash
Don't be different
When you can't be yourself
Big plans
Big crash
Big plans
Big crash
Big plans
Big crash
Big plans
Big crashEmbed
