Scott Farcas Takes It On the Chin Lyrics
When I think of how things are
Right now, it feels like
Yeah, it all feels like some kind of circus show
And how this town
It keeps you pinned down
The same old song from years ago

And how this place will chew you up
Then spit you out before you go
And when they drag you kickin' and screamin'
From the scene you know
That it's time to leave

When I think of how this town
Right now it's filled with
Speed freaks and assholes
And all kinds of creeps
And somehow every new face
In every single case
In a year or two will be erased

And how this place will chew you up
Then spit you out before you go-oh
And when they drag you kickin' and screamin'
From the scene you know
That it's time to leave
When I think of how I'm
Feeling right now, somehow
I still remember how I felt four years ago
And when I think
Of how things are right now
It's the same old song from years ago

I know this place will chew you up
Spit you out before you go
I know, I know
And when they drag you kickin'
And screamin' from the scene, you know
That it's time to go
That it's time to goEmbed
