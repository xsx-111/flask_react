Sweetheart Sleep Tight LyricsI left town, you got me down
You've got some new friends now
But you heard me say
I miss the days we got to spend
Is this the end?
What's going on?
Where are your songs?
Are you okay?
Moving away, thinking about someone else
I’ll be alright sweetheart, sleep tight
I know you will, through my dreams
I’ll be okay, you’ll hear me say
"Sweetheart, sleep tight"Embed
