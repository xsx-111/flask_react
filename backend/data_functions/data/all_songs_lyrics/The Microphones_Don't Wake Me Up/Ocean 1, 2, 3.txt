Ocean 1, 2, 3 Lyrics
You swam further out into the ocean
I climbed higher in the tree
At the top it started bending
I swayed down to you in the sea
When I saw you I called out your name
And I let go and fell into the water

And in between the crashing waves
I swam out right underneath you
Above me, you began to evaporate
You floated up while I was reaching for you

And now, as a cloud, you visit me
Every night and every morning
In between these times
I'm floating towards youEmbed
