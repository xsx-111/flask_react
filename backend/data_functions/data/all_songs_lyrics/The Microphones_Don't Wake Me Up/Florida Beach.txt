Florida Beach Lyrics
Close my eyes
She's somehow closer now

Lying sick with my face pressed into the sound vibrations
And I'm sleepy and out of my mind
She’s floating above me with palms reaching out
And legs that are gone, just smoke and a huge face with eyes
I asked, "What? Why do you float there
And watch me sleep every night when I’m sick?”

But she didn't answer and hovered there still
Going away when I turned on the lights
She kept watching to make sure I'm okay
And said, in my head, to me
"I came all the way from Florida in my sleep
To watch you and help you get well while I do that too"Embed
