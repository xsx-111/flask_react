I Need Your Love LyricsI need someone's hand to lead me through the night
I need someone's arms that's gonna hold and squeeze me tight
Now, when the night begins, ya know I'm at an end
'Cause I need your love so bad
I need some lips, baby, to feel next to mine
I want someone, baby, to stand up and tell me when I'm lyin'
And when the lights are low and it's time to go
Oh, I need, I need your love so bad
So, give it up, and bring it home to me
Or write it on a paper, baby, so it can be read to me
Tell me that you love me and stop drivin' me mad
'Cause I, I need your love so bad
Yes, I need a soft voice, baby, to talk to me at night
And don't you worry, baby, we can make everything alright
Listen to my plea, baby, bring it home to me
I need your love so bad, oh
I need your love, baby, so badEmbed
