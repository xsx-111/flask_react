Watch Yourself LyricsYes people are talkin' all over town
They say you don't love me
You gonna put me down
You better watch yourself baby
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
Cause I got my eyes on you
Now you tell me what's the matter
What you gonna do
First you say you love me
Then you say we're through
You better watch yourself baby
Watch yourself
You better watch yourself woman
Cause I got my eyes on you
I gave you my money
Everything too
A big fat house
Now baby what you gonna do
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself woman
Cause I got my eyes on you
Now you're gonna leave me
Leave me here to cry
Now you know I love you
You're my whole heart's desire
You better watch yourself baby
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself woman
Cause I got my eyes on you
Yes!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
Yes, yes baby!
You better watch yourself woman
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself baby
Cause I got my eyes on youEmbed
