Country Girl LyricsYou know my little girl
She's a country girl
Yes my little girl
She's a country girl
But she means more to me
Than anything in this world
Yeah she fix my breakfast lunch and dinner
And she bring it on home on time
She fix my breakfast lunch and dinner
And bring it all home on time
Yes you know I'm glad to be back home
Hey with this little girl of mine
You know I'm glad glad glad
I'm glad to be back home at last
Whah I'm glad glad glad
I'm so glad to be back home at last
Since I've seen my baby
Yeah how many days have passed
Yah you know I flew into the station
About six forty-five
Yeah my plane it made it into the station this morning
About six forty-five
Yes you should've seen my baby's face
To see my plane arrive
Yes it made me feel so good
To walk in through the door
Yes it made me feel so good to walk into the door
You know and find everything the same
Even my pallet layin on the floor
And I said hi hi baby I won't worry no more
Whoa I said hi hi hi baby, I won't ever worry any more
You know I got home this mornin
And I ain't goin outa that doorEmbed
