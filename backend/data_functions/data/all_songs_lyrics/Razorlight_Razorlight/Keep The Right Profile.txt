Keep The Right Profile LyricsYou keep the right profile
Eat the right food
Keep the right profile
You do what you do
You keep it all tied up
You keep it all tight
You don't stay in bed all morning
Don't stay up all night
When your gone you don't come back
You've got to keep the right profile all the time
And it's a wonderful life
Yes it's a wonderful life
Yes it's a wonderful life when you do what you like
I heard about your problems
I know you got yourself
I don't care that much though
Your dad is a millionaire
He keeps the right profile
He keeps it tied up with string
But all your fake tears easy money
They don't mean a thing to me
And when your gone you don't come back
Just go and keep the right profile all the time
And it's a wonderful life
Yes it's a wonderful life
Yes it's a wonderful life
When you do what you like
Yes its a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful life
When your gone girl
You don't come back
When your gone girl
You don't come back
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right
Keep the right profile all the time
And it's a wonderful life
Yes it's a wonderful life
And it's a wonderful life
When you do what you like
And it's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful lifeEmbed
