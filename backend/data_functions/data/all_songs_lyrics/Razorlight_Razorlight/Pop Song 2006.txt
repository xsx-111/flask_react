Pop Song 2006 LyricsEveryone is losing it
Everybody's given up
Given up the ghost
And turn it in on themselves
Lets head for somewhere
Absolutely anywhere
Get outta here
And leave this city alone
So let me know, I'll take you there
Just think it over
Then take what you need
Concealing a weapon with the light turned it low
You see it like that now
Oh!
Some have it easy, but this is hard to touch
T' to define yeah, but then its all too much
Hard to want, yeah, you're hard to get yeah
You're hard to play yeah!
So let me know, I'll take you there
You think it over
You take waht you need
Concealing a weapon like the pick to your soul
You're sunning the truth now
But I believe in you
But I believe in you
But I believe in you
Hey!
I know you will find you drawn to
You are the new you, you, youEmbed
