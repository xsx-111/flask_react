Who Needs Love LyricsOoh darling who needs love?
Who needs a heaven up above?
Who needs the clouds, in the sky, not I
Ooh darling who needs the rain?
Who needs somebody that can feel your pain?
Who needs the disappointment of a telephone call, not I
No I don't need that at all, not I
I'm, tired of love
Yeah, sick of love
I've taken more than enough
Ooh darling who needs the night?
The sacred hours, the fading light
Who needs the morning and the joy it brings, not I
I've got my mind on other things, not I
Ooh darling who needs joy?
Who needs a perfect girl or boy?
And who needs to draw, that person near, not I
Because they always disappear, not I
And you know I'm, tired of love
(Yeah)
Yeah I'm, sick of love
(Yeah)
You give me more than enough
I'm gone!
Ooh darling who needs love?
Who needs a heaven up above?
Who needs all the arguments, who needs to be right, not I
But I just can't give up without a fight, not I
No I just can't give up without a fight, not I
No I just can't give up without a fight, not I
No no no not I
Ooh no no not I
No no no no no not I
Ooohhhooo...Embed
