Hold On LyricsWell now your here you are in your life
And now your finding out why
You've got to learn how to fight
Before you learn how to fly
So stick your fist up prove them wrong
Don't lose the words to the song
Coz its a long way down
I guess you know that by now
But if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up
Yeah I will reach up too
Well now your here in your life
Its such a long way down
Somehow you figure it out
So now you turn it around
But I know
But if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up
Yeah I will reach up too
Too...too.. too...
And one thing before you go
Just let everyone know
You refuse to regret it
Just like everyone said you would
Just like everyone knew you would
Just say that you can
Sleep at night
Just say that you get nervous
With the struggle you fight
You can't believe what your told
And you can't be alone and you can't let it go and you can't lose control and you know
You are not just anyone
No your not just anyone
And if you hold on
Well I will hold on too
And if you reach up.. then I will reach up too
And if you hold on.. and I will hold on too
And if you reach up..Embed
