Back To The Start LyricsBack to the start
Back to the start again
I'll go back to the start
Back to the start again
And i dont know why
I feel this way
But i couldn't stay here for
One more day
I go back to the start
Before i lose my mind
Mary got the message
It was monday morning
Five o'clock
Well she put it in her pocket,yeah
Calling for the boys
But the boys dont stop
Walk into the bedroom
You could say yes
You could say no
I could take it easy
If you can take me
Back to the start
Lonly day at the railway station
You go to london
You leaave me here to test my patience
I dont know why
I feel this way
But i couldn't stay here for
One more day
I go back to the start
Before i lose my mind
Back to the, back to the
Back to the start
Back to the, back to the
Back to the s-s-still
I dont know why
I feel this way
But i couldn't stay here for
One more day
I go back to the start
Before i lose my mind
Back to the, back to the
StartEmbed
