In the morning - acoustic LyricsI don't know what I'm doing wrong
Maybe I've been here too long
The songs on the radio sound the same
Everybody just looks the same
But then last night was so much fun
And now your sheets are dirty
The streets are dirty too but
You never look back on what you're gonna do
Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning, you know you won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be alright
I wake him up when I'm up
When I'm on the stage, well
A boy can't help it, it's not his fault
Just a dangerous dangerous thing
But then every night's still so much fun
And you're still out at dawn
I'm clinging on to the wrong ideas but
I never regret anything I've done
Remember when you were young
You'd lose yourself
In the morning you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning you know it's gonna be alright
In the morning, you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be all. . 
In the morning, you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be all...
In the morning, you know he won't remember a thing
In the morning, you know it's gonna be alright
Are you really gonna do it this time?
Are you really gonna do it this time?
Are you really gonna do it this time?
Are you really gonna do it this time?
X2
You've got got to do it this time
Are you really gonna do it do it do what?
Are you really gonna do it do it do it yeah
Are you really gonna do it what
In the morning you know he won't remember a thing
No not a thing and
In the morning you know he won't remember a thingEmbed
