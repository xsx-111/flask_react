America Lyrics
What a drag it is
The shape I'm in
Well I go out somewhere
Then I come home again
I light a cigarette
Cause I can't get no sleep
There's nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That means that much to me

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Yesterday was easy
Happiness came and went
I got the movie script
But I don't know what it meant
I light a cigarette
Cause I can't get no sleep
There's nothing on the TV, nothing on the radio
That means that much to me
There's nothing on the TV nothing on the radio
That I can believe in
All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's trouble in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh

Yesterday was easy
Yes I got the news
When you get it straight, but stand up you just can't lose
Give you my confidence, all my faith in life
Dont stand me up
Don't let me down
I need you tonight
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold me, say you'll be here
To hold...

All my life
Watching America
All my life
There's panic in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
She's just in America
Oh Oh Oh, Oh
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel
Tell me how does it feel4Embed
