Los Angeles Waltz LyricsI've been sitting here patiently
I've been talking too myself
Trying to shake that sinking feeling
Wishing I was somebody else
And I know it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
You can say that you love me
But that's not what I've heard
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Well it's got to be that way
Tonight in L.A
Maybe ill get right out of here
On the way back to *ton popular*
Find me a girl that can calm me right down
It's been such a fucked up year
And I know it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
You can say that you love me
But that's not what I've heard
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Well it's got to be that way
Tonight in L.A
Maybe ill get myself together
Or fall to pieces and run back home
Get me a ticket for an aeroplane
I'm tired of been alone
I was on mulholland drive
With the radio on
They played augusstus pablo
And Kings of Leon
He say he knew it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
And I know it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
You can say that you love me
But that's not what I've heard
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Well it's got to be that way
Tonight in L.A
I think of you now we own each other
I think of you now we own each other
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Mars and the USA
And fall and the Milky Way
It's got to be that way
The gift is on Broadway
Home a million miles away, away, away
You met your match
Stars catch your eyes
You cry a bed
You've met your match
You burn like fire
I'd hire your love
You trust your man
You burn like a fire
I steal I lie I try with you
You built your love
You steal you lie
And love too steal
Like me you try
You cry a bed
You met your matchEmbed
