When My Mind Is Not Live LyricsWhen my mind is not live, I see you there before me
Every night in my mind your face flies by me
Then the morning light comes to bring reality
But my dream lingers on a little while for me
Then I wake to see a world full of misery
Lots of people rushing by who don't know what they wanna be
Soon the day draws to its end and pretty soon I'll be
Back with you in my mind because I want to see
When my mind is not live, I see you there before meEmbed
