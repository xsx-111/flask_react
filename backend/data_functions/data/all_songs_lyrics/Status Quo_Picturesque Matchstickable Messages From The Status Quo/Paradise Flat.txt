Paradise Flat LyricsShe was sold at the paradise flats
Tell me, what d'you think of that?
No goodbye, just a pat on the back
Well I know she's made her mind up
That she don't need me around
I'm trying just to see what you're trying to do to me
Your trying to screw me down
Right through the ground oh yeah
In paradise flats there's rooms for hire
No-one cares who you are
You won't come back, it's too late now
You've been seen too much
I know what you are
You won't come back, no you won't come back
Well I know she's made her mind up
That she don't need me around
Oh I'm trying just to see what you're trying to do to me
Your trying to screw me down
Right through the ground oh yeahEmbed
