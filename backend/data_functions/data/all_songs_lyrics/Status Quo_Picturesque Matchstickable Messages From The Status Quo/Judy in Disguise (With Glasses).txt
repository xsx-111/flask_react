Judy in Disguise (With Glasses) LyricsJudy in disguise, well that's a-what you are
A-lemonade pies, with a brand new car
Cantaloupe eyes come to me tonight
You're Judy in disguise, with glasses
Keep a-wearing your bracelets, and your new brand rah
A-cross your heart, yeah, with your living bra
A-chimney sweep sparrow with guys
You're Judy in disguise, with glasses
Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
I've taken everything at sight
Unzipper the strings of my kite
Judy in disguise, well that's a-what you are
A-lemonade pies, with a brand new car
Cantaloupe eyes come to me tonight
You're Judy in disguise, with glasses
Come to me tonight
Come to me tonight
I've taken everything at sight
Unzipper the strings of my kite
Judy in disguise, well what you aiming for
A-circus of a-horrors, yeah yeah, well that's what you are
You make my life a nightmare
I guess I'll just take your glassesEmbed
