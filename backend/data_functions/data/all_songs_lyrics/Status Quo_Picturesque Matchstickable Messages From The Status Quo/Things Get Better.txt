Things Get Better LyricsYou can bring joy
I never had
I’m gonna be right near now
Long as it lasts and that’why
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeah
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeah
I can be lonely
You can be found
I’m not lonely baby, but
You’re always around and that’s why
Things get better baby
When I‘m with you, yeah
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeah
Never in doubt or without you
I know that you’re mine
I can’t lose this feeling
You stay on my mind and that’s why
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeah
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeah
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeah
Things get better baby
When I’m with you, yeahEmbed
