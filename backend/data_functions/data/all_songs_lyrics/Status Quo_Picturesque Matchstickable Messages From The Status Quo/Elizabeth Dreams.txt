Elizabeth Dreams LyricsElizabeth dreams of the day when the way
That I looked at her made her feel she was real
Elizabeth dreams of the time she was mine
When she didn't need any more, she was sure
She was sure
Out of sight, by candlelight
And sea green, and see green horses
I said she's out of sight by candlelight ??
And fairy, fairy stories
Elizabeth is not what she seems
Elizabeth dreams, Elizabeth dreams
Elizabeth dreams, holding fast through the past
When a morning was something new, flowers grew
Elizabeth dreams but it's late and she's waited too long
And tomorrow goes, now she knows
Now she knows
Out of sight by candlelight
And sea green, and sea green horses
I said she's out of sight, by candlelight
And fairy, fairy stories
Elizabeth is not what she seems
Elizabeth dreams, Elizabeth dreams
Elizabeth dreams
Elizabeth dreams, Elizabeth dreams
