Spicks and Specks LyricsWhere is the sun that shone on my head
The sun in my life, it is dead, it is dead
Where is the light that would stay in my street
And where are the friends I could meet, I could meet
Where are the girls I left far behind
The spicks and the specks of the girls on my mind
Where is the sun that shone on my head
The sun in my life, it is dead, it is dead
Where are the girls I left far behind
The spicks and the specks of the girls on my mind
Where are the girls I left far behind
The spicks and the specks of the girls on my mind
Where is the girl I have loved all along
The girl that I love, she is gone, she is gone
All of my life I've tossed with the day
The spicks and the specks of my life gone away
All of my life I've tossed with the day
The spicks and the specks of my life gone away
Where is the sun that shone on my head
The sun in my life, it is dead, it is deadEmbed
