To Be Free LyricsIf I find a place to hide
Where I can put those people of my mind
I'm gonna lay my head down hard
And sleep that stops my head from spinning round
Help me with my situation, I just wanna be me
I'm living frustration just to be free, I must be free
I just wanna be left on my own
Leave me to a life that's mine alone
Take my hand, come with me
To a place where we'll be free
Help me with my situation, I just wanna be me
I'm living frustration just to be free, I must be free
I just wanna be left on my own
Leave me to a life that's mine alone
I just wanna be left on my own
Leave me to a life that's mine aloneEmbed
