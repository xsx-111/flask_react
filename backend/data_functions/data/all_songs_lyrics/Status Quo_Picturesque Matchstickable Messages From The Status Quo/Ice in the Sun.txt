Ice in the Sun LyricsI'm not a little boy, I've lived alone and never loved so more
But when she touches me I'm on the way, I'm underneath the floor
Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like ice in the sun I melt away
I sit down in a chair and read a book as if I couldn't care
But she is in a room and I must look I see her everywhere
Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like ice in the sun I melt away
She opens up her eyes as if to speak
She looks at me and I am weak
Her eyes they seem much bigger than before
I cannot think anymore
Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like ice in the sun I melt away
Like ice in the sun I melt away
Whenever she comes I melt away
Like ice in the sun I melt awayEmbed
