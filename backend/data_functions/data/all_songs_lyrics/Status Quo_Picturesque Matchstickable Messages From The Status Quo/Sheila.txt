Sheila LyricsSweet little Sheila, you'll know her if you see her
Blue eyes and a ponytail
Cheeks are rosy, she looks a little mosey
Man, this little girl is fine
Never knew a girl like little Sheila
Her name drives me insane
Sweet little girl, that's my little Sheila
Man, this little girl is fine
Me and Sheila go for a ride
Feel funny inside
Then little Sheila whispers in my ear
I love you Sheila dear
Sheila said she loves me, she said she'd never leave me
True love that will never die
We're so doggone happy, just being around together
Man, this little girl is fine
Never knew a girl like little Sheila
Her name drives me insane
Sweet little girl, that's my little Sheila
Man, this little girl is fine
Me and Sheila go for a ride
Feel funny inside
Then little Sheila whispers in my ear
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I love you Sheila dear
Sheila said she loves me, she said she'd never leave me
True love that will never die
We're so doggone happy just being aorund together
Man, this little girl is fine
Man this little girl is fine
Yeah, this little girl is fineEmbed
