Black Veils of Melancholy LyricsIf I see you hiding in the night by a peppercorn tree
The tree it moves, lets me see what I wanna see
A poison gaze of your mind is all that's worrying me
The pictures that I see are seen by no-one else but me
To cause the night to be in sight, a little point of me
I imagine nearly anything I want to see
Black veils of melancholy falling on me
Black veils keep shadowing my mind
Black veils that make my mind seem small
Black veils of melancholy falling on me
Black veils keep shadowing my mind
Black veils that make my mind seem small
I see you with my eyes closed getting closer and closer to me
I open my eyes up and you're not there
It's all in my mind
Black veils of melancholy falling on me
Black veils keep shadowing my mind
Black veils that make my mind seem small
Black veils of melancholy falling on me
Black veils keep shadowing my mind
Black veils that make my mind seem smallEmbed
