Hong Kong Bar LyricsSittin' in a Hong Kong bar
Sweet dreams of you darling
Ah, when we were sweet sixteen
Mama, makin' love in the belly of an old freight train
Life was so simple and easy
Oh, the sun went down
You took care of the children darlin'
(??) wanna (??) everyday
Then you felt like movin' away
Lord now you didn't stand and stare
You felt like movin' and leavin', Darlin'
Ah, then I paid your fare
It's all right now, Darlin'
It's alright now, Mama
It's alright, Mama
Cause things have got to change
Makin 'love to you darlin' was like at moonlight on the shore
Makin' love to you darlin' was like the tide clawing at the shore
And when I dream about you darlin' Lord I long to be the sand
I need those sweet dreams of you mama
That's the only thing this poor little man can be tonight
I found somebody else mama gonna help me get my rest at night
I found somebody else mama gonna help me get my rest at night
Remember the house we were going to build on the far side of the hill
Whatever happened to those dreams of me mama
Don't dreamers ever win
But darlin' when I think about you honey Lord I shed some tears
Got my pillows wrapped between my legs
And I think about love you every day and night
It's all right now mama It's alright now mama
It's all right now darlin'It's alright now mama
It's alright now mama
Sittin' in a Hong Kong Bar
Dreamin' about the way things used to be
Ah when I first made love to you darlin'
Like riding in the belly of an old freight train
Then you felt like moving and I paid your fare home
Then you felt like leaving you could not stand and stay
It's alright now mama
It's alright It's alright It's alright It's alright
I found somebody else mama gonna help me get my rest at night
I found somebody else mama gonna help me get my rest at nightEmbed
