Make It Right LyricsI'm fitting out
I'm fitting in
And those diesel rigs
Ah, they're rambling by
But, I ain't blue
Now, if I go lame
Ah, I just flag a ride
I'm looking out now
For a street corner girl
I'm looking out
For a street corner girl
And she's gonna beat me, whip me, spank me
Ah, make it right again
Trying a little trick honey
Ah, that you never used before
I wanna be your victim
Your sweet little victim of love
Come on and beat me, whip me, spank me
Mama, make it right again
Ah, make it right
It's been wrong too long
Oh, Johnny dreams
And you and my white queen been rolling again
But the talk around town is
She might be burned out
But, I know by midnight
She gonna burn you down, oh yeah
Yeah, she gonna burn you down
But I'd been looking out in the wings
For a street corner girl
I'd been looking out
For a street corner girl
Ah, she's gonna beat me, whip me, spank me
Ah, make it right again
Trying a little trick honey
You never used before
I wanna be your victim
Your sweet little victim of love
Come on and beat me, spank me, whip me
Ah, mama, make it right again
Oh, mama, make it right
Ah, make it right
Make it right, mama
Make it right again
Ah, make it right
Come on, make it right again
I wanna be your victim
I wanna be your victim
I wanna be your victim of love
I wanna be your victim of love
Come on and beat me, whip me
Ah, make it rightEmbed
