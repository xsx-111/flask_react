Sweet Surrender LyricsNow you wanna know the reason
Why I cheated on you
Well,  I had to be a hunter again
This little man had to try to make love feel new again
'Cause there's just a few things honey
I'm not old enough to do for you
And they're the things mama
You just never care to show me
So this flimflam lover boy found him a flamingo
And his flamingo showed him how to tango
And when they tangoed it'd send their hearts a flutter
Tease him til he stuttered
Young and tender
Seemed to surrender in so sweet surrender
In sweet surrender
Ah, sweet surrender to love
But, now you're gonna go out and get yourself a reputation
But,  I'm gonna have to show you where to start
And then you're gonna bring back your little reputation
And prove to me what I could not prove to you
Cause I was just too young at heart
Just too cold, Honey
Just too hard to care
Just too hard, right
Too surrender
Surrender to love
Sweet Surrender
Surrender to love
If we could just Surrender
Love would heal the mess we made
So give it up, Mamma, it a'int gonna be no good going round and around
You'l hurt me, then i'll hurt you again
All that's left to do
Is give it , ahhh
Give it up and Surrender
Sweet Surrender
Sweet Surrender
Surrender your love
Surrender
Oh, Surrender
Surrender that love
Sweet, sweet, sweet Surrender, Mama to love, to love to loveEmbed
