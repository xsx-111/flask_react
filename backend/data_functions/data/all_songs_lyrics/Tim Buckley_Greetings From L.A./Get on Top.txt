Get on Top LyricsWell, that girl walks on in a stormy bitch and whine
Well, she moves that cobra waltz all across the floor
Tell that mama to sing out a cry
Like a slow burn,  slow burn
Ya move that waltz,momma, over to me
Get on top of me woman
Get on top of me breathe
Get on top of me woman
Let me see what you learned tonight
Well, I talk in tongues,mama
Oh, when I love you
Yes, I talk in tongues
Lord, Lord, Lord
Get on top of me woman
Get on top of me breathe
Get on top of me woman
I just wanna see what you learned
Well. like a bitch dog in heat we had those bed springs a
Squeakin' all day long
And didn't you hear those walls a talkin' voodoo
I feel you right, right, right with me
Get on top of me woman
Get on top of me breathe
Get on top of me woman
Let me see what you learned tonight
I talk in tongues honey when you love me
I talk in tongus moma
Oh lord lord lord
Get on top of me , Darling
Get on top of me, Darling, alright
Get on top of me, Darling, oh lord
I talk in tongues mama
Oh, when you love me, Mama
Oh, when you love me, Mama
Oh, I can't help but talk in tongues
I talk in tongues
I talk in tongues
Can't stop my lovin' you
Get on, get on, get top of me
I wanna do the cobra waltz, Darling
I wanna do the cobra waltz, Darling
