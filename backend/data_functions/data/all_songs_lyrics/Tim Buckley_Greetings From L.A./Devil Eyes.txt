Devil Eyes LyricsI got so tired of meaningful looks
I got so tired of comin' up tame
I was so bothered by those balmy breezes
I was side swiped in by swamp fever
They was a crawlin'
Oh, down beneath my skin
Til mama came a runnin' mIxin' devil rum
A mama came a runnin'
That little black rhythm
Mama came a runnin'
Lord said she got a recipe
Oh, and she don't need no fancy sauce
Lord,  those devil eyes
Lord,  they stare right through me
Those devil eyes
Look right through me
Aw, melt my soul down
Ah, well I Long for those devil eyes
Show me what i'm worth
Show me what I'm made up
Down beneath the sheets
Do the monkey rub
Down beneath the sheets
That big old girl doin' the monkey rub
Down beneath the sheets
Do that monkey rub
That big old girl doin' the monkey rub
OH, darlin', pull those black silk stockings down
Oh, mama, pull those black silk stocking down
I wanna lick all around the stretch mark
Put the tongue between the toes
Wanna put my tongue stretching out those stretch marks,  mama
Lick between the toes(2x)
Oh, mama
All I need from you, Mama
All I need from you, Mama
All I need from you, lover love

Ah, those devil eyes they're looking right through me
Those devil eyes oh,they're  looking right through me
Show me what i'm worth
Show me what i'm made for
Down between the sheets
Do the monkey rub
Down between sheets
Do the monkey rub, Mama
Down between the sheets
Do the monkey rub
Ah, hahaha
That big old girl doin' the monkey rub
