Move with Me LyricsI went down to the meat rack tavern
And I found myself a big old healthy girl
Now she was drinkin' alone, oh, what a waste of sin
So I went down on over to sweet talk that girl
Lord, I moved on in
Oh,I whispered
Come on and move with me
Move with me, move with
Move with me darlin', oh don't be shy(2)
I'm gonna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha
Mess witcha, mess witcha now
Well, I don't care if you tell me you're married
Cause I can be your kid man
Ohh, when your husband ain't home
Now if he should walk in, you just tell him I'm your houseboy
And that you just can't stand oh, to sleep here alone no more, oh, Honey
I wanna move with you, move with you
Move with you, move with you darlin', all night long
I wanna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha
Mess witcha, mess witcha now
Instrumental
Well, now he finally walked in
And Lord, that man filled up the doorway
Well, he grabbed me by my throat
And he bounced me down the stairs
And Lord, I swear, huh
He broke every bone in my body
But it was worth every second that I was there
Oh, cause she would whisper to me, oh she'd tell me
Move with me, move with me
Move with me, move with me darlin', don't be shy,  ohh don't be shy
I'm gonna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha
Mess witcha, mess witcha mind
Well, now I love me
Oh, I love a black woman
I love me, Oh, I love me a black woman
Oh, I love a black woman
Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord, I do
Oh Lord, I do
I love the way she moves
I love that girl, love, love, love, love, love, love a black woman
I love, lo-lo-love that girl, more than sweet shampoo
Lord, I love a black womanEmbed
