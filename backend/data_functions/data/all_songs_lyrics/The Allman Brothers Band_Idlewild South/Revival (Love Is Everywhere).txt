Revival (Love Is Everywhere) Lyrics
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you hear it
The song is in the air
We're in a revolution
Don't you know we're right
Everyone is singing
There'll be no one to fight

People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhere
People can you feel it
Love is everywhereEmbed
