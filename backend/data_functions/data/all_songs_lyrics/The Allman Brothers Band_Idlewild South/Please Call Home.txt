Please Call Home Lyrics
Take one last look before you leave
'Cause oh somehow it means so much to me
And if you ever need me, you know where I'll be
So please call home if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

I guess I saw it coming day by day
But oh, I could not stand the failure
Before you leave, there's just one thing I must say
Please call home if you change your mind
Oh, I don't mind

And I know, you're used to running
Oh you're lost baby, and I ain't funning
But oh, when you call to me, well, I'll come running
Safe to your side again I'll confide in you

So go on, I won't say no more
My heart ain't in it, but I'll hold the door
But just remember, what I said before
Please call home if you change your mind
Please call home if you change your mind
Oh yeah, call home if you change your mind
Call home if you change your mind
Oh ooh
Please call home if you change your mindEmbed
