Hoochie Coochie Man Lyrics
Gypsy woman told my mama while 'fore I was born
Got a boy child comin' mama, he'll be a bad one, now
I'll make all you little girls turn your heads around
Then I'm gonna take you little girls
Gonna take you right on down with me yeah
Oh, you just wait and see
I'll be your hoochie coochie man
I'll set you free

On the seventh hour of the seventh day
On the seventh month, seven doctors they say
I've got lots of good luck, you know they all agree
But now if ya, if you're lookin' for trouble babe
You better not mess with me, hey
'Cause you know I'll getcha one by one
Ain't no fun
I'm that old hoochie coochie man
I'm a bad son of a gun


Got a Johnny Conqueroo and got some mojo too
We got a black cat born, we're gonna slip it to you
Hey, move over people just as fast as you can
Said I know you're waitin' for me 'cause I'm the hoochie coochie man
I'm gonna get you, one by one
I got set on that old hoochie coochie man
And I'm yo' son of a gun

Now the gypsy woman told mama, oh 'while 'fore I was born
She said you know he's comin' mama and he'll be a bad, very bad one
Make all the ladies, turn their heads around, you said
I can just see all those women, chasin' him all down
I'm your hoochie coochie man
Everybody knows itEmbed
