There Used To Be A Ballpark LyricsAnd there used to be a ballpark where the field was warm and green
And the people played their crazy game with a joy I'd never seen
And the air was such a wonder from the hot dogs and the beer
Yes, there used a ballpark right here
And there used to be rock candy and a great big Fourth of July
With the fireworks exploding all across the summer sky
And the people watched in wonder, how they'd laugh and how they'd cheer
And there used to be a ballpark, right here
Now the children try to find it and they can't believe their eyes
'cause the old team just isn't playing and the new team hardly tries
And the sky has got so cloudy when it used to be so clear
And the summer went so quickly this year
Yes, there used to be a ballpark, right hereEmbed
