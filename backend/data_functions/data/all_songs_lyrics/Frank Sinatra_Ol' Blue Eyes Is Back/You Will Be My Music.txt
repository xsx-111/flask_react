You Will Be My Music LyricsWriter(s): Raposo
When all the songs are out of tune
And all the rhythms ring so untrue
When I don't find the words to say
The thoughts I bring to you
When I hear lonely singers
Who are just as lost as me
Making noise, not melody
You will be my music
You will be my song
You will be my music
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong
I'll never find the song to tell me
All the things I need to say
And I'm afraid as time goes by
That someday soon you'll go away
And I'll be lost and trying
For songs I'll never sing
Wanting you is ev'rything
You will be my music
You will be my song
You will be my music
I can't wait any longer if I'm wrong
I can't wait any longer for my songEmbed
