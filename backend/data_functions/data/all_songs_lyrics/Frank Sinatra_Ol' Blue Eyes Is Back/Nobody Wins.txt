Nobody Wins LyricsAnymore it doesn't matter who's right or wrong
We've been injurin' each other much too long
And it's too late to try to save what might have been
It's over; nobody wins
Make believin' in forever is just a lie
And it seems a little sadder each time we try
'Cause it's a shame to make the same mistake again and again
It's over; nobody wins
We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The lovin' was easy; it's the livin' that's hard
For there's no need to stay to see the way it ends
It's over; nobody wins
We've gone too far, too long, too far apart
The lovin' was easy; it's the livin' that's hard
For there's no need to stay to see the way that it ends
It's over; nobody wins
It's over; nobody winsEmbed
