95 North LyricsAfter the first time we kissed
I drove for an hour in the wrong direction
Frozen in the winter wind
Where nothing could ever begin
I saw you
You were shining like a brand new sun
Shining starlight
For me
For you and me, my love
Pass a junkyard on the left
Time to catch my breath
Almost to the out-of-state line
Oh, it'll be better
This time, this timeEmbed
