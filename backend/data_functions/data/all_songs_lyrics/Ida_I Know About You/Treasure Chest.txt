Treasure Chest LyricsIts not yours but you took it away
Great ideas waiting there for someone
To get into and carry them away
Stealing is easy
If you're good then no one sees you
Sees you do it
The victim's always busy
In another part of town
And i guess i just can't see
How you can sleep
When you go to sleep
I can't say
Cause you're hidden from me now
Accountable to no one
You made a killing
In your borrowed bargain clothes
When you took off running
It seemed just like you never even noticed what you'd doneEmbed
