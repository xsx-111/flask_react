Back Burner LyricsThis doesn't have to end
But it should
We used to help each other out
Now it doesn't feel good
So go back to your room
And hide with your cellophane
All twisted up in two
Like Caliban you've seen it all
Without language to use
The phonecalls stopped
The letters, too
Maybe we passed on the street
Pretended we never knew
It might be worth the effort
But we don't have the time
Or the will to intrude
Sooner or later you have to choose
Between one set of lies and another
It's nothing new
But like it or not
There's part of me in you
I don't know if I'll ever see you again
And there's one thing I'll never understand
It's like the words that we said
Rolled over to play dead
And we kissed them goodbye
And never questioned whyEmbed
