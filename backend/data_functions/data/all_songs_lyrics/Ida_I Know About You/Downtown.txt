Downtown LyricsSummer snapped in half and half flippin' coffee creamers
Twenty times, that's a good sign, like a four-leaf clover
Downtown was filled with the sounds of the full and the part time losers
And when we stepped up to the bar, you asked for a cigarette and the years just melted away right then
And I saw all the ways that we've changed and the decisions that we made
And I wasn't hurt or afraid
Some skin holds night in
Some gifts go unrequited
I dreamed I was holding my breath
Go down again till I'm breathing in water and breaking like the day, getting in your wayEmbed
