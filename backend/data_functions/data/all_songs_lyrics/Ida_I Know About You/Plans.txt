Plans LyricsWhy do I fell like I'm almost old
I didn't want to ever let you down
Once we could talk about anything
You started moving out
Out of my reach
And I never felt so alone like that before
And I waited for you to call
And tell me to be strong
But you got so cold
Or bold enough to turn to my tuning face
And everytime you would look at me that way
I couldn't speak
I couldn't say anything
I watch the leaves change in the fall
I didn't notice this before
You walked away when I wanted you then
To come and take me out
Maybe we could try again
Cause there were still things tha I wanted to say
But I was so young
I was too afraid that nothing could be savedEmbed
