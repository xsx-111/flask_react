Tellings LyricsDid time takes it toll
Did it cost too much?
Did it cost all the sweetness
That, was the best time you ever had
It slipped so swift from the palm of your hand
The time's when you stood tall
Crawling with a backwards glance so strong
That you can't believe it at all
You thought that you lost such a solid love;
The best friend you ever had
But the world is upside down
Too many moments you could not keep
The places that saw you speak
You don't know how to see this through
What did you miss?
In the telling of all this
And how could you guess
That it would ever be like this?Embed
