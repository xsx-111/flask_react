Little Things LyricsTake some time out to remember
What you kept and gave away
When you came into my life
Did you stop
To think twice
Little things pile up and turn into bigger things
And i want you to notice (this)
And i want you to try
Don't cut me off
Don't cut it out
Don't give away
What you can live without
Don't let it sit
Just spit it out
Don't hide yourself
Where no one can find you
Don't hesitate
Just let me know
Don't keep it all to yourself
I'll try to understand you
Don't hesitate
Just let me know
Don't keep it all to yourself
I'll try to understand
I'll try to understandEmbed
