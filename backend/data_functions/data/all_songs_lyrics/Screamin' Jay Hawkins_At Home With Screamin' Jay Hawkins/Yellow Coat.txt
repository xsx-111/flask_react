Yellow Coat LyricsA forty gallon hat
And some polka-dot shoes
Tomato pickin' onion juice
To drive away my blues
A bright red leather suit
A trip in a motorboat
And the strike I caused on the waterfront
When I fell outta my yellow coat
Hey now, stick with it
Aw baby don't quit it
You know you're bound to git it
Yes sir, made outta goat skin, foreskin
And layin' out in milk and gin
The people quit the scene
Like the devil was loose
The clouds turned green
And let down lemon juice
What walks on two feet
And looks like a goat?
That crazy Screamin' Jay
In a bright yellow coat
Hey now, stick with it
Baby, baby don'tcha quit it
Aw you're bound to git it
Yes sir, made outta goat skin, foreskin
And layin' out in milk and gin
I took a plane out midwest
To see my Uncle Joe
We ran into some real bad weather
Ice, rain and snow
Fifty million bulldogs
Twenty mountain goats
All gathered 'round at sundown
To see my yellow coat
Hey now, stick with it
No, no, no, no don'tcha dare quit it
Hey, you're bound to git it
Made outta goat skin, foreskin
And layin' out in milk and ginEmbed
