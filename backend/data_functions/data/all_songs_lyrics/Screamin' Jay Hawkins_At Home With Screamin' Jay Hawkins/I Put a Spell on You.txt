I Put a Spell on You Lyrics
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine
Stop the things you dell)
Watch out
I ain't lyin', yeah
I can't stand
No runnin' around
I can't stand
I can't stand No put me down

I put a spell on you
Because you're mine (oh yeah)


Stop the things you do
Watch out, Watch out
I ain't lyin'
I love you
I love you
I love you, yeah...
I don't care if you don't want me
I'm yours right now
I put a spell on you
Because you're mine5Embed
