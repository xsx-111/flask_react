Person To Person LyricsCome on home!
Don't write, I don't need no letter
Don't even telephone
I want your person to person
Bring your big fine foxy self on home!
Don't send me no message
You know that I'm all alone
I want your person to person
Bring your big fine foxy self on home!
Ain't no use in telephone me
I can't love no telephone
All the time you telephone
You could be comin' home
Ain't no use sendin' no letter
I can't hold no paper tight
Ain't no use sendin' no message
If you can't talk to me at night
Ain't no use sendin' yo' brother
You know I ain't gonna talk to no one else
Ain't no use sendin' your mother
You're just gonna have to come on home yourself
Little girl, I have somethin' I want
Since you been gone
I want your person to person
Bring your big fine foxy great-googly-moogly-oh-look-at-that self on home!Embed
