I Love Paris LyricsEvery time I look down on this timeless town
Whether blue or gray be the sky
Whether loud be her cheers or where soft be her tears
More and more do I realise
I love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
Ooh, I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why, why, do I love Paris?
Because my love is near
How about Germany? Germany?
Achtung! (German-sounding scatting)
Like Chinese?
Ah, Chinese! (Chinese-sounding scatting)
How about Africa? Africa!
Asum-maumau-kissum Santy Claus!
And Paris? Paris!
Oui, oui, asu Monsieur, ha ha!
I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why, oh, why, do I love Paris
Because my love is near
Because my love is nearEmbed
