Give Me Back My Boots and Saddle LyricsTake me back to my boots and saddle
Whoa-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ah-ooh
Let me see that gen'ral store
Let me ride that range once more
Gimme my boots and saddle
Let me ramble along the prairie
Whoa-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ah-ooh
Ropin' steers on old Bar-X
With my buddies, Slim and Tex
Oh, gimme my boots and saddle
Got a hankerin' to be with a banjo on my knee
Strummin' a pretty western tune
There's a gal in Cherokee
And she's waitin' there for me
Waitin' 'neath a Texas moon
Take me back to my boots and saddle
Whoa-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ooh
Let me greet each blazin' morn
On the ranch where I was born
Oh, gimme my boots and saddle
Whoa-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-oohEmbed
