Orange Colored Sky LyricsI was walkin' along
Minding my business
When out of the orange-colored sky...
WHAM! BAM! ALAKAZZAM!
Wonderful you came by
I was hummin' a tune
Drinkin' in sunshine
When out of that orange-colored sky...
WHAM! BAM! ALAKAZZAM!
I got a look at you
One look and I yelled "Help me!"
Watch out for flyin' glass
Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went into a spin
And I started to shout
"I've been hit... this is it... THIS IS IT!"
I was walkin' along
Minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye...
WHAM! BAM! ALAKAZZAM!
Outta the orange-colored sky
Look out below!
One look and I yelled "Help Me!"
Watch out for flyin' glass
Cause the ceiling fell in
And the bottom fell out
I went into a spin
And I started to shout
"I've been hit... I've been hit... THIS IS IT!"
I was walkin' along
Minding my business
When love came and hit me in the eye...
WHAM! BAM! ALAKAZZAM!
Outta the orange-colored sky
FLASH! BAM! ALAKAZZAM!
Wonderful you came by!Embed
