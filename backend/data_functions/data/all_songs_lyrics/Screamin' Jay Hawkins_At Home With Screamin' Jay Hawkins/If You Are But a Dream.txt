If You Are But a Dream LyricsIf you are but a dream
I hope I never waken
It's more than I could bear
To find that I'm forsaken
If you're a fantasy
Then I'm content to be
In love with lovely you
And pray my dream comes true
I long to kiss you
But I would not dare
I'm so a-fraid that
You may vanish in the air
So darling
If our romance would break up
I hope I never wake up
If you are but a dreamEmbed
