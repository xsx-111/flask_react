Bad Feeling LyricsYour face in the mirror
Is only getting clearer
When I close my eyes
Every single day and every night
Uuh uuh
No arm around my shoulder
Only getting colder
Trying to remember
If you were even real

I don't remember
I've got a bad feeling, bad feeling
A bad bad feeling, bad feeling
It's not going away, going away
It's not going away
Uuh uuh
Waiting for a letter
I know will never get here
Trying to forget him
That everything went wrong

I don't remember
I've got a bad feeling, bad feeling
A bad bad feeling, bad feeling
It's not going away, going away
It's not going away
I've got a bad feeling, bad feeling
A bad bad feeling, bad feeling
And it's not going away, going away
It's not going away
