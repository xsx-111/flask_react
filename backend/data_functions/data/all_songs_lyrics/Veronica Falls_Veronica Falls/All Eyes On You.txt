All Eyes On You LyricsAll eyes on you
( All eyes on you , when i stepped in the club
My head goes round & round & round
I see you gettin' naughty 
I see you wanna party so tell me if you are down ) X 2
All eyes on you , when i stepped in the club 
With the way you move can't get enough 
(Heart beat ) fast that i can't catch up 
Yes i'm down , but you lift me up 
Don't be shy girl come get close 
Once I hold you I won't let go 
We gon' hit that dance floor 
We gon' sip that patron 
The way you move that body 
The way you get so naughty
You gettin' outta control ( girl u gettin' outta control )
I'm lookin' for somebody 
You're just not anybody 
You must be outta this world
(girl you're outta this world)
( All eyes on you , when i stepped in the club
My head goes round & round & round
I see you gettin' naughty 
I see you wanna party so tell me if you are down ) X 2
Tell me if you're down girl
And if you're down then I,m down for you 
To rock ya' body all the way to the floor
From your head to your toes
Show you thing's u don't know
The way you move body 
The way you get so naughty
I wanna lose control
Im lookin' for somebody 
You just not any body 
Girl You outta this world
Tell me if you're down girl
And if you're down then Im down for you 
To rock ya' body all the way to the floor
From your head to your toes
Show you thing's u don't know
The way you move body 
The way you get so naughty
I wanna lose control
Im lookin' for somebody 
You just not any body 
Girl You outta this world
( All eyes on you , when i stepped in the club
My head goes round & round & round
I see you gettin' naughty 
I see you wanna party so tell me if you are down ) X 3Embed
