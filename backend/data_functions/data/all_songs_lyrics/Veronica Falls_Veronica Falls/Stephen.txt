Stephen LyricsStephen, king of everything
Stephen, you think of everything
Carry me to the front of the queue
I'll go anywhere if anywhere's with you
Oh Stephen, king of everything
Stephen, please don't say anything
Stephen, take off your wedding ring
People may say that you've lost your way
I'll stand by you forever and a day
Oh Stephen, king of everything
Stephen
Anywhere with you is no-goEmbed
