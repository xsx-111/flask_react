Misery LyricsMisery, taking over me
Misery, my old friend
Come with me, I see misery
Stay with me 'til the end
It's never going to be easy
We're on different sides
Take the path that could reach me in the dead of the night
Misery, got a hold of me
Misery, my old friend
Come with me, I see misery
Cover me 'til the end
It's never going to be easy
We're on different sides
Take the path that could reach me in the dead of the night
Misery, got a hold of me
Misery, my old friend
Misery, got a hold of me
Misery, 'til the end
Come with meEmbed
