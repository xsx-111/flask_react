Found Love In A Graveyard LyricsOoh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
I get on my bike and I ride and I ride and I'll never be found again
Skin like paper holding a vapour clinging to a dream I had
Clinging to a dream so true, falling for a ghost like you
Clinging to a dream so true, falling for a ghost like you
Found love in a graveyard (though she had departed)
Found love in a graveyard (I'm brokenhearted)
Found love in a graveyard (dearly departed)
Found love in a graveyard
I'm brokenhearted dearly departed
Dearly departed I'm brokenhearted
She was my ghost I know she needed me the most
But we're not alone, we were living in her funeral home
She was my ghost I know she needed me the most
But we're not alone, we were living in her funeral home
Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
Found love in a graveyard (though she had departed)
Found love in a graveyard (I'm brokenhearted)
Found love in a graveyard (dearly departed)
Found love in a graveyard
I'm brokenhearted dearly departed
Dearly departed I'm brokenhearted
She was my ghost (she was ghost)
She is my unholy adventure (she was ghost)
She was my ghost (she was ghost)
She is my unholy adventure (she was ghost)
Dearly departed I'm brokenhearted
Dearly departed I'm brokenheartedEmbed
