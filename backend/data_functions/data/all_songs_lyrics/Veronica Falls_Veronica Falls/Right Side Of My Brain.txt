Right Side Of My Brain LyricsRight side of my brain that's a lie
Fading away there is a beacon but it's the wrong one
Right side of my brain has a car
Driving away there's a race that'll never be won
Take your hands, take your hands off me
Right side of my brain that's a lie
Fading away there is a beacon but it's the wrong one
Take your hand, take your hands

Turn, turn away, the time turns to grey
The day turns away, the sun never shines
Take your hands, take your hands
Take your hands, take your hands off meEmbed
