Veronica Falls LyricsDarkest day you'll ever see
Brightest light will shine for me
When Veronica falls
When Veronica falls
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Crest of a wave
Death of a day
They will never know the truth
They will never know
Oo-oo-oo
They knew what she knew
I know they do it too
When Veronica falls
Crest of a wave
Death of a day
They will never know the truth
Oo-oo-oo
Crest of a wave
Death of a day
They will never know
They will never know
They will never know
They will never know the truthEmbed
