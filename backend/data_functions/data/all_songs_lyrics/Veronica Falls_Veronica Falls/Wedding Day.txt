Wedding Day LyricsSo sorry I missed your wedding day
I didn't know just what to say
Except you don't look at her like you're looking at me
She'll never know that's the way it will be
So sorry I missed your wedding day
There's nothing left for me to say
Except you don't look at her like you're looking at me
She'll never know that's the way it will be
You don't love her like you love me
You don't love her like you love me
You don't love her like you love me
You don't love her like you love me
You don't love her like you love me
She'll never know that's the way it will beEmbed
