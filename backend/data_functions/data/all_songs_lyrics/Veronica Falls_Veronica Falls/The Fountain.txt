The Fountain LyricsOooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh
On a distant hillside I watched our love die
I lost my baby to the winter
And I couldn't bear to hold you near
When everything I fear is haunting me
Darling dear I'm not here
Baby doll
Don't take me back to the fountain (don't take me back)
There's nothing left there for you (there's nothing left for you)
Just take your flowers and leave them at the fountain
And watch the fountain bloom
Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh
Oooh Oooh Oooh
I found you in an empty room
I let you go
How could I know
To hold you near
When everything I fear is haunting me
Darling dear I'm not here anymore
Don't take me back to the fountain (don't take me back)
There's nothing left for me and you (there's nothing left for you)
Just take your flowers and leave them at the fountain
Just take your flowers and watch me walk away
We'll walk away today
Just take your flowers and leave them at the fountain
Just take your flowers and watch me wilt away
Just take your flowers and watch me wilt away
We'll wilt away today
