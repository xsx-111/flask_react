Come On Over LyricsHey, come on over
Crimson and clover
I’ll touch your shoulder
Until it’s over
All forever
Come on over
Come on over
Hey!
Hey, it’s getting colder
Come on over
Until you’re sober
Until we’re over
All forever
Come on over
Come on over
Don’t you know?
Don’t you know?
Don’t you know?
Don’t you know?
Don’t you know?, I don’t know
Don’t you know?, I don’t know
Don’t you know?, I don’t know
Don’t you know?, I don’t know
Woo-ooo-oh
Woo-ooo-oh
Woo-ooo-oh
Woo-ooo-oh
Hey, it’s getting colder
Come on over
Come on over
Hey, crimson and clover
Come on over
Come on over
(Slower)
Hey, it’s getting colder
Come on over
Come on over
Hey crimson and clover
Come on over
Come on overEmbed
