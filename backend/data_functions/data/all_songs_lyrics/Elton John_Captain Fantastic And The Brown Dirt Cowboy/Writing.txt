Writing Lyrics
Is there anything left?
Maybe steak and eggs
Waking up to washing up
Making up your bed
Lazy days
My razor blade
Could use a better edge
It's enough to make you laugh
Relax in a nice cool bath
Inspiration for navigation
Of our new found craft
I know you
And you know me
It's always half and half

And we were, oh, oh, so, you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow?
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear
We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it through

And we were, oh, oh, so, you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow?
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear

We could stretch our legs if we'd half a mind
But don't disturb us if you hear us trying
To instigate the structure of another line or two
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it through
'Cause writing's lighting up
And I like life enough
To see it throughEmbed
