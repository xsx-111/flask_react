Tower of Babel Lyrics
Snow, cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters tracking down the hours

But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die?

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no

Junk, angel
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription for a brand new heart attack
But where were all your shoulders when we cried?
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied?
