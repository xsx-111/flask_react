The Wild Frontier LyricsHere I am
I'm in a gaseous haze
Ten lanes and tall boys
Going both ways
El Dorado riding on the fringe
Aztec princes take revenge (take revenge)
This ain't my style, this ain't my home
I'm going where it's safe to roam
Take me all the way back
To the wild frontier
Well I'm counting the miles
Seeing her smile in the wild frontier
Electric sun
Electric hair
Leather skin
Leather underwear
She said hey
You know I'm getting in the biz
Come on over
I'll show you where some action is
This ain't my style, this ain't my home
I'm going where it's safe to roam
Take me all the way back
To the wild frontier (Oh...oh!)
Well I'm counting the miles
Seeing her smile in the wild....
Take me all the way back
To the wild frontier (Oh...oh!)
Well I'm counting the miles
Seeing her smile in the wild frontier
Hey!
Oooh! Oh-ho!
In the wild frontier!
In the wild frontier!Embed
