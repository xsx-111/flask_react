On the Western Skyline Lyrics
About this time of evening, out by the bay
They turn the road lights on the bridge
Well, a diesel rolls in silhouette, eastbound
Lovers glad the sun has set

I'm staring into twilight
Wishing I could find someone tonight

I know she's out there somewhere
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer
On the western skyline

The rooftops sag on Second Street
Bachelor's quarters
Too much fun, not enough dough
Well, the kite's still hanging on the wire
Waiting on the wind
Too many dreams and not enough hope

Voices on my radio
Telling me where I should go
I know she's out there somewhere (Somewhere)
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer (Say a prayer)
On the western skyline, hey


They'll set up on the bandstand
When the sailors hear the whistle blow
Underneath the streetlight
Violence in the afterglow

Give me a shiny Cadillac, and close your eyes
Past that city limits sign
Well, he's got the admiral's daughter
He's got her in the back
Trying to cross her battle line

As I'm staring into twilight
Wishing I could be with her tonight
Whoa, oh
I know she's out there somewhere (Somewhere)
On the western skyline
Lonely women say a prayer (Say a prayer)
On the western skyline (Ah, whoa-oh)

I know she's out there somewhere
On the western skylineEmbed
