The Long Race LyricsIt's a hazy winter's day
And I'm staring out on the southland
In the twilight distance on the bay
My mind sees you running through the marshland
All of these years I've been waiting for you
Through high tides and the low tides too
But if I stop now how could I ever be with you? (Woah)
It's a long, long race
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long, long race (yeah)
If I try I will surely win it
One day, one night with you
There's a village on the lower eastern shore
Where the watermen's boats are anchored
And they work so hard all day long
Showing me what you want to go after
All of these years I've been pushing so hard
Through high tides and the low tides too
But if I stop now how could I know what I could do? (Woah)
It's a long, long race
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long, long race (Yes)
If I try I will surely win it
One day, one night with you
All of these years I've been pushing so hard
Through high tides and the low tides too
But if I stop now how could I know what I could do? (Oh)
It's a long, long race
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long, long race (yeah)
If I try I will surely win it
It's a long, long race (yes)
If I try I will surely finish
It's a long, long race (yeah)
If I try I will surely win it
One day, one night with youEmbed
