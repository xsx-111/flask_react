Down the Road Tonight Lyrics
There's a place
A local roadside shack
A poor man's Paris with parking in the back
There's a girl there
She knows how to unwind
She don't talk much but she knows just how to act

I said, "Don't tell me she don't love me
The money's just a mere formality"
Hey, yeah

Every day, every night
Something's going on, something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Yeah, any place, any time when I'm fading
My love lies waiting
Down the road tonight

When I was younger
All the older boys
Would drive me way out past the county fair
They'd laugh and point out
This roadside trailer
And say something wild's going on over there
They said, What they're doing don't mean nothing to you now
But someday it'll mean everything"
Yeah, yeah

Every day, every night
Something's going on, something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Yeah, any place, any time when I'm fading
My love lies waiting
Down the road tonight

Hey, yeah
Whoa-ho-oh
Hey, yeah

There were movies in the parlor
They were dealing one-eyed jacks
And when I said I loved her
She said, "Just keep 'em coming back"

Every day, every night
Something's going on, something's going on
Down the road over yonder
Yeah, any place, any time when I'm fading
Oh, my love lies waiting
Down the road tonight
Yeah, my love light is waiting
Down the road, down the road tonight
Hey, yeah
Every day, every night
Down the road tonight
Any day, any time, it's alrightEmbed
