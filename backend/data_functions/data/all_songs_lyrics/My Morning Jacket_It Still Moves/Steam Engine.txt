Steam Engine Lyrics
So, I do believe
None of this is physical
At least not to me
So, I do believe
That anywhere it goes
It's always with me

It's not the dream
That makes you weak
It's not the night
That makes you sleep
But it's a voice
And it's a choice
To call you out or stay at home

So, I do believe
None of this is physical
At least not for me
So, I do believe
That anywhere it goes
It's always with me

It's not the beast
It's not the sheets
So soft and warm
All over me
But, it's the touch
You need so much
To move around
On this green earth
Take your money and your drugs
Take your money and your drugs
To anyone who wondered
What old Jesus meant to me
Take him out to go diving
In Red Patoka Sea
The brain melts in the twilight
With the boar and moving trees
Your skin looks good in moonlight
And god damn, those shaky knees
The fact that my heart's beating
Is all the proof you need3Embed
