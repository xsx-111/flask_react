Dancefloors Lyrics
Daybreak, nightfall, long as I believe
There ain't nothing glowing
Like this skin you're showing
And the keys you gave to me
Night jails, pool halls, some things are everywhere
So for the past I'm digging a grave so big
It will swallow up the sea

Oh, I know that it's easy
There's no trouble waiting for me
Oh, I know that it's easy
There's no trouble waiting for me

Dance floors, headlights, in my blood there's gasoline
For an urban boy on a dirty tour
I never felt so clean
Loaded questions in an automatic world
Well, you just won't be seeing the things you need
As if you thought you would

Oh I know, it's never easy
When there's trouble waiting there for me
Oh I know, it's never easy
When there's trouble waiting for me4Embed
