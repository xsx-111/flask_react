Mahgeetah Lyrics
Sitting here with me and mine
All wrapped up in a bottle of wine
Little we can do
We gonna see it through somehow

So, now are you ready to go, my lady?
I been waiting on the boat here
I been waiting so long
Whoa

Bang, bang goes the night
All wrapped up in the firelight
Don't "rock bottom"
Just listen, just slow down

So, now are you ready to go, my lady?
I been waiting on the boat here
I been waiting so long
Whoa

"Can he see me?
Does he feel me?
Does he know me at all?
Does it shiver?
Always deliver?
Does it know me at all?"
So, now are you ready to go, my lady?
I been waiting on the boat here
I been waiting so long
Whoa
Mahgeetah, Mahgeetah
Mahgeetah, Mahgeetah
Mahgeetah, MahgeetahEmbed
