Golden Lyrics
Watching a stretch of road
Miles of light explode
Drifting off a thing
I’d never done before
Watching a crowd roll in
Out go the lights it begins
A feeling in my bones
I've never felt before

People always told me
That bars are dark and lonely
And talk is often cheap and filled with air
Sure sometimes they thrill me
But nothing could ever chill me
Like the way they make the time just disappear

Feeling you here again
Hot on my skin again
Feeling good a thing
I’ve never known before
What does it mean to feel
Millions of dreams come real?
A feeling in my soul
I’d never felt before

And you, you always told me
No matter how long it holds me
If it falls apart
Or makes us millionaires
We'll be right here forever
Go through this thing together
And on heaven’s golden shore
We’ll lay our heads3Embed
