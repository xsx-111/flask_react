Easy Morning Rebel Lyrics
Well, the easy morning rebel, well, he has come
Come down from heaven, all bathed in sun
He'll take to flying, he'll take to the road
As long as he's moving to get their blood

He'll be the water, you'll be the wine
Sent down from heaven in this earthly disguise

Well, the evening rebel, his heart is stone
This earthly body, just a temporary home
A dream of moving moves on through night
And he sure looks good when he moves in the light

He'll be the water, you'll be the wine
Sent down from heaven in this earthly disguise

Black-hearted ruler, I only knew
That loving moment I had with you2Embed
