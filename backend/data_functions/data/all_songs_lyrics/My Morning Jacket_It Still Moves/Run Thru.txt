Run Thru Lyrics
Oh shit run, oh shit run
Oh shit run through the ghetto
They will hear you
Morning bell tolls at home
Rings loud back where I come from
Calls me back
Often times, oh I would hope and pray
She calls me back
Then faith came my way
 
Oh shit run, oh, oh
It's what appears to me, it's what appears to me
It's what appears to me, it's what appears to me
It's what appears to me, aah1Embed
