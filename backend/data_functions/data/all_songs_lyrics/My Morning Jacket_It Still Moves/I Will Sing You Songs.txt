I Will Sing You Songs Lyrics
I will sing to you of greater things
Money, gold, and diamond rings
Just don't make it last any longer than it has to

Stories of the greater years
Fill your heart and soul with tears
Just don't make it last any longer than it has to

I will sing to you of greater things
Money, gold, and diamond rings
Just don't make it last any longer than it has to

Stories of the greater years
What's in here won't disappear
Just don't make it last any longer than it has to2Embed
