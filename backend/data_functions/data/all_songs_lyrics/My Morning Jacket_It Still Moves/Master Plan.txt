Master Plan Lyrics
I've got a master plan, babe
I been workin' on it from the start
Pluggin' in all of the numbers, watchin' it on all of the charts
Just 'cause it starts off slow, babe
Doesn't mean it don't have a heart
You'll be walkin' 'round showin' off someday
And it'll take you right back to the start

It's everything that you want, babe
It's everything that you need
Soft and warm all the time, make you want it over and over
Strong on the horizon
But ends up bein' really so sweet... oh so sweet

Sometimes I wanna lay down, babe
Sometimes I wanna stand up and fight
Sometimes it runs its course in a day
Sometimes it goes for night after night
Know that it will start off strong, babe
And it will end up weak in the end
Just like the heart you break of a love, babe
Just like the hand you take of a friend
