Rollin Back Lyrics
Just in the nick of time you got me while I was sitting here
Time, I don't think I waste it, it just seems to disappear
Sipping the wine you got me while eyes were rolling back
Long hours and hard hard things just bring heart attacks

Oh, oh, oh, you had me, wrapped up in your mystery
When the light vanished from on high
Oh I'll never say I knew you, but my heart can't wait
To meet you on the other side

When I think about the story one thing seems pretty clear
The warm things you left behind they still want you here
But only in time you find that all things come back around
And just like the frown, we'll turn them upside down
