Just One Thing Lyrics
Baby, there's just one thing
One thing that does it, does it for me
Baby, we'll find a way
We'll go out, out for a day

And I want it so bad
It's the first thing I see when I wake
So bad
It's the first thing I see when I wake

Baby, there's just one thing
One thing that does it, does it for me
Baby, we'll find a way
We'll go out, out for a day

And I want it so bad
It's the first thing I see when I wake
So bad
It's the first thing I see when I wake1Embed
