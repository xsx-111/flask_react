One Big Holiday Lyrics
Waking up feeling
Good and limber
When the telephone it ring
Was a bad man from
California
Telling of a stone he'd bring
I'd bring

And of
Better days
From this town
We'd escape
If we holler loud
And make our way
We'd all live
One big holiday

So we listened and
Up the river
And recorded all the sounds
Was some shaking and some
Record playing
All the leather kids were loud4Embed
