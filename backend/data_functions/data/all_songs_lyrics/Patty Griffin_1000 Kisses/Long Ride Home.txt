Long Ride Home LyricsLong black limousine
Shiniest car I've ever seen
The back seat is nice and clean
She rides as quiet as a dream
Someone dug a hole six long feet in the ground
I said goodbye to you and I threw my roses down
Ain't nothing left at all in the end of being proud
With me riding in this car and you flying through them clouds
I've had some time to think about it
And watch the sun sink like a stone
I've had some time to think about you
On the long ride home
One day I took your tiny hand
Put your finger in the wedding band
Your daddy gave a piece of land
We made ourselves the best of plans
Forty years go by with someone laying in your bed
Forty years of things you say you wish you'd never said
How hard would it have been to say some kinder words instead?
I wonder as I stare up at the sky turning red
I've had some time to think about it
And watch the sun sink like a stone
I've had some time to think about you
On the long ride home
Headlights searching down the driveway
The house is dark as it can be
I go inside and all is silent
And seems as empty as the inside of me
I've had some time to think about it
And watch the sun sink like a stone
I've had some time to think about you
On the long
On the long
Oh the long
On the long ride homeEmbed
