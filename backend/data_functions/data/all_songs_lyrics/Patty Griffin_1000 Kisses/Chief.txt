Chief LyricsChief had been out of the army
For fifteen years or more
He was still marching up and down that street
Just like he was a walking to war
They called him Chief 'cause he was Indian
It was a name they said behind his back
In the summer he'd march without any shoes
Till the soles of his feet turned black
Till the soles of his feet turned black
His hands wouldn't work the machinery
‘Cause his brain told them what to say
It's a hell of a life but it's somebody's life
Up and down the street all day
Honey, I've been put through the paces
Running like a dog on a track
The wheels keep it going as fast as you get there
But you don't ever get to go back
I don't really know what I'm doing
Just watching myself in some play
And the actress looks like she wants to go home
And lie in a bed all day
Yeah, lie in a big bed all day
Her hands wouldn't work the machinery
‘Cause her brain tells them what to say
It's a hell of a life but it's somebody's life
Up and down the street all day
But I wish that you could see me
When I'm flying in my dreams
The way I laugh there way up high
The way I look when I fly
The way I laugh, the way I fly
Chief got out of the army
Jesus went to live with the poor
I'm still marching up and down that street
I don't know what I'm doing that for
I don't know what I'm doing that for
I don't know what I'm doing that forEmbed
