Daddy Lyrics
Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, won't you come and play?
Daddy, do you not care?
Is there nothing that you wanna say?

I know
You're hurting too
But I need you, I do
Daddy, if you're out there
Daddy, all I want to say

You're so far away
Oh, you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
I'm okay

Daddy, are you out there?
Daddy, why'd you run away?
Daddy, are you okay?
Look, Dad, we got the same hair
And Daddy, it's my birthday
And all I wanna say
Is you're so far away
Oh, and you're so far away
That's okay, it's okay
It's okay

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh) You're so far away

Won't you come and won't you stay?
Please stay, oh, please stay
Won't you come and won't you stay?
One day, just one day14Embed
