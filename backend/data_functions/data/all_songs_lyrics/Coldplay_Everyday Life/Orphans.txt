Orphans Lyrics
I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom boom kah, buba de kah

Rosaleem of the Damascene
Yes, she had eyes like the moon
Would have been on the silver screen
But for the missile monsoon

She went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Indigo up in heaven today
(Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
She say

I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again
Baba would go where the flowers grow
Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

But he went (Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Tulips the colour of honey today
(It's true, true, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Bombs going boom-ba-ba-boom
He say

Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and be young again (Yeah)

Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
Cherubim, Seraphim soon
Come sailing us home by the light of the moon

Oh, I want to know when I can go
Back and get drunk with my friends
I want to know when I can go
Back and feel home again
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
I guess we'll be raised on our own then
Woo-woo, woo-woo, ooh-ooh-ooh
'Cause I want to be with you 'til the world ends
I want to be with you 'til the whole world ends

Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
Boom boom kah, buba de kah
