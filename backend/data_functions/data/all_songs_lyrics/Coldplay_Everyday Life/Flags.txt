Flags Lyrics
The talk among the skeletons this morning
(Aside from all the medicine and health)
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?
There were those that wished they'd spun upon the jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be

"To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free, and like everyone else
There will be no flags to own me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself"

Julie, telephoning by a ouija
"Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live?"

And the Holy Roman Army
Said, "Your heart beats like everyone else"
But you don't need no flags to tell you who you are, so say
"I just want to be myself''
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

There's an aura that surrounds thee
There's a different kind of wealth
And I don't need flags to know you're really something
And I just love you for yourself
Oh, I just love you for yourself

La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la5Embed
