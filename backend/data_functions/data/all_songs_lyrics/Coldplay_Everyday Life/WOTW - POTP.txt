WOTW / POTP Lyrics
In a world gone wrong
I shall be strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people
I will not want
My faith is strong
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Our world tonight
Get it right
Holding on to the steeple
Our world tonight
I'm off in light
Wonder of the world, power of the people

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh2Embed
