Shake Well Before Opening LyricsFunky!
Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!
Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!
Rub-a-dub-dub waste the doorman at a club
Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough!
Rub-a-dub-dub waste the doorman at a club
Shake well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Pleasure, nourishment
A smile of some encouragement
But no, you get it
No you twist
When you're wrapped up to tight and you eat
You're always teasing!
Teasing, teasing, teasing...
Teasing, teasing, teasing...
Rub-a-dub-dub waste the doorman at a club
Shake well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Nailed your own head to the dartboard
You used a Rolex to roll up your keks
You nailed your own head to the dartboard
You used a Rolex to roll up your keks
You rag and bone man
When you're on your own man
We're rag and bone man
We make your own man
Well you eat and you drink
All the chemicals in the world
Make you seek
Bleak
Shake well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Rub-a-dub-dub waste the doorman at a club
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Shake it well before opening
Shake it well before opening
Shake it well before opening
Serve it out or not
Shake well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot
Shake it well before opening
Serve it chilled or hot...Embed
