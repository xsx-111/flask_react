In The Name Of The Father LyricsIt's coming from the side!
And it's coming from the back!
People!
Multitudes of people!
Walking up the hills!
Go forward!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of your father and your holy ghost
I don't do what you do
And you don't do what I do
But you should do
You
Oh, you've got your voodoo
But you've got no clue
You know me easy bongo poo-poo for me
Well because I'm no learned
Well I get away with murder
Going boldly where no man's been before
Ere we go, ere we go
Once ag-ain
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
Neil Armstrong
Astronaut
He had balls bigger than King Kong!
Fay Wray!
First big suit on the moon
And he starts to play golf!
Hole-in-one!

Here we go, 'ere we go
Once ag-ain
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!

In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
I have the holy spirit in me!
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost
In the name of the father and the holy ghost...1Embed
