Little Bob LyricsBoom!
Bang!
Boom!
Bang!
What's that on the pavement in front of me?
I don't remember letting someone in for tea
Cardiovascular!
Muscles to muscular!
The great smell of Brut
Coming on after you!
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
We!
Removes stains without powder
Free!
It just zooms all around you
Cardiovascular
Born in a power cut
Freedom in a bed
Three in a supersud!
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...

Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
It gets louder and louder and...
Bang!
It gets right out of order and...
Boom!
Bang!
Boom!
Bang!
Boom!
Bang!
Boom!
Bang!
Boom!
Bang!
It doesn't happen like that
It doesn't happen like that
It doesn't happen like that
It doesn't happen like that
Speaking words of wisdom
It doesn't happen like that
Splash splash splash

I believe everything I read...Embed
