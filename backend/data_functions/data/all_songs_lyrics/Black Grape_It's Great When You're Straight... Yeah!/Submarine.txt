Submarine LyricsYou took the same road
As some sly jeweller
Where you wouldn't get two bob
For everything in the window
Did some bad business
With a spook called Sherlock
Who smoked steroids
And he got me in a headlock
And the boy was so proud
Of the crocodile on his sock
Someone had to tell him
It comes from planet Reebok
Oooo, honey you're a fool to cry, fool to cry
Oooo, it's cool to lie, cool to lie
You paid the debt today, oh boy
One thousand parcels in the coal bunker destroyed
You've got a noise today Sherlock
He did handstands and he backflipped a lot
He was so proud
Of the crocodile on his sock
Someone had to tell him
It comes from planet Reebok
Oooo, you're a fool to cry, fool to cry
Oooo, it's cool to lie, cool to lie
He was so proud
Of the crocodile on his sock
Someone had to tell him
It comes from planet Reebok
Oooo, honey you're a fool to cry, fool to cry
Oooo, it's cool to lie, cool to lie
(Oooo, you're a fool to cry, fool to cry)
(Oooo, it's cool to lie, cool to lie)...Embed
