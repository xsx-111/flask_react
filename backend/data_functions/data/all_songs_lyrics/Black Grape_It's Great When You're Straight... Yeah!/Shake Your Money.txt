Shake Your Money LyricsShake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money maker
The return of this is good
We'll buzz round for the sample
We're in the neighbourhood
Shake your money maker
Take it straight out of my face
Your a bleeding motherfucker now aren't you?
Go and bleed in a different place!
Everybody used to be a boxer
Everybody any boxer double
A million years old
And still in trouble
Put down your fists, and hit him with the shovel
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money maker
Into little airtight bags
We need to score a kit-kat
We just pulled an 8 hour blag
Everybody wants to get busy
Counting money makes me fucking dizzy
A million years old
And still in trouble
Put down your fists, and hit him with the shovel
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Shake your money, shake shake your money
Gotta bleed in a different place
Ooooooo you're a bleeding motherfucker now aren't you?
You're a bleeding motherfucker now aren't you boy?
You're a bleeding motherfucker now aren't you?
You're a bleeding motherfucker now aren't you?
Ooooo, fuckin' your a fool to cry
Uh-ooooo, fuckin' your a fool to cry
Easy, easy, easy Slow down!
Ya fucking cunt!Embed
