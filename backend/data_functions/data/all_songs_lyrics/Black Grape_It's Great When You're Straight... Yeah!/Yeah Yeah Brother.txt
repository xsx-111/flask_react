Yeah Yeah Brother LyricsYou sit at my table
Eat and drink like you were
My brother
Brother
I would never, ever in this world
Believe you were a backstabber
Slash-slashing
You eat in front of my face
And even when my back is turned
In despite of your crime
I will pay you no mind
Just leave you to die
Send me a wreath
It's over
You looked in my eyes
They said that you were my soul-mate
Best friend
When you leave things too long
She gets long gone
And its too late
Late
I told you pure lies
And left you to cry
Open the trunk
For the pineapple chunk
And I'm long gone lady
Lady long gone
It's frothy, man
Turn your car
It's over
You were the wise and wonderful
Extremely beautiful
Chick from out of nowhere
You were the wise and wonderful
Extremely beauftiful
Chick from out of nothing
One look in my face
And even when my back is turned
In despite of your crimes
We pay you no mind
Just leave you to burn
Lie down(?)
Send me a wreath
Send me two
Because I wuv you, wuv you, wuv you(?)
It's cool
It's cool
Turn your car
Send me a wreath
Send me a wreath
Send me two!Embed
