Velvet Waltz LyricsIf there's a word for you
It doesn't mean anything
I've got some words for you
They don't offer anything
You cold called everybody
But you haven't sold a thing
A bad idea gone funny
A pinch felt in a dream
You thought of everything
But some things can't be thought
You thought of everything
But one thing you forgot
Is you're wrong
And you better not be angry
And you better not be sad
You better just enjoy the luxury of sympathy
If that's a luxury you have
And you know no private bad
You know that that's the meaning of you're done
In a world that's not so bad
In a world time was killing in the sun
In a world that's not so bad
In a world time was killing in the sun
In the sun
In the sun
You took all that moment and kicked it in the sun
Now it's gone because you left it in the sun
Was a brave idea, didn't mean no harm
Now it's burnt because you left it in the sun
Was a grave mistake
But how could you have known
The temperature, the distance of the sun1Embed
