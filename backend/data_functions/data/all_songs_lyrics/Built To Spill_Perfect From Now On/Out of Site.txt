Out of Site LyricsRaised un-right
So uptight
But why blame you?
You wouldn't be if you could choose
Most of the time, it's out of site
It hit me today
Who gave who the right?
Who took mine away?
What a sight, what a sound
What a way to bring people down
What a way to bring me down
I know that you'll get yours when you get empty
It's so close
I'm sure that you would rather do that than be
In your clothes
You must have waited a long time
Bet you were disappointed
I waited longer than that
Just goes to prove
Proving's illogical
But sometimes necessary
Proving's illogical
But it's a cinch
But why blame you?
You wouldn't be if you could choose
Most of the time, it's out of site
It hit me today
Who gave who the right?
Who took mine away?
What a sight, what a sound
What a way to bring people down
What a way to bring me down
It goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on1Embed
