Kicked It in the Sun Lyrics
Back-washed thoughts
And you made me talk
No, you made me listen
There's a feeling
From Ada to Irene
There's something, there's nothing
You haven't seen
Tiny TV, on at 3
So serene
No place to be
Alone
So come on over, yeah
Let's sit down a little while
Some wine
You will find the same things

The same things, the same things
The same things, the same things

By the time you read this
You kicked it in the sun
It was all that you could do
How could you refuse?
You kicked it in the sun
It was all you had to do
And you kicked it in the sun
It was all you had to do
How could you refuse?
And you kicked it in the sun
It was wrong and it was rude
And you kicked it in the sun
It was wrong and it was rude
How could you refuse?
And you kicked it in the sun

It's alright now
I'm getting over, getting mine
It's alright now
I'm getting over, getting mine

He seemed so unashamed of how he operated
Corresponds to the facts that you want
Despite his expectations, he turned out mediocre
His master plan was so-so
We're special in other ways
Ways our mothers appreciate
That net does not make me feel safe
All those holes make me nervous
He woke up late that morning
Went to the window and saw
The sun had stopped its shining
So, so
We're special in other ways
Ways our mothers appreciate
We're special in other ways
Ways our mothers appreciate
We're special
We're specialEmbed
