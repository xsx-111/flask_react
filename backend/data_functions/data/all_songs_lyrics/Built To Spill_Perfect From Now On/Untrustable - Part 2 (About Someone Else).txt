Untrustable / Part 2 (About Someone Else) LyricsUntrustable

You can't trust anyone
'Cause you're untrustable
How can you trust someone you know can't trust you?
You won't help anyone
'Cause you're unusable
No one can tie you down, no, you're nobody's fool

And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And God is whoever you're performing for
And God is whoever you perform for

You don't like anything
'Cause you're unlikable
All because you're not interested in you anymore
It's so unthinkable
'Cause you don't think of it
How many ideas can fit in your reality?

And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And I'd love to see it but it's something you just feel
And I'd like to feel it but it just isn't real
And God is whoever you're performing for
And God is whoever you perform for
Part 2 (About Someone Else)

I know you
Feel the things you see, you know they're true
What are you gonna do?
Why can't you
Empathize with Jesus' point of view?
What are you gonna do?
When you feel the darkness shining through
What are you gonna do?

Why can't you
Move yourself like other people do?
What are you gonna do?
I know you
Wouldn't be the way you feel if you could choose
What are you gonna do?
When you feel the darkness shining through
What are you gonna do?2Embed
