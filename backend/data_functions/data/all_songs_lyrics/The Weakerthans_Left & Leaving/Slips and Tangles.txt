Slips and Tangles LyricsNeon lights and slinking purple skies
Squeeze out soft regrets from all our lies
As I greet another door that opens in
To that place where we repeatedly begin
I'm tangled up in try
Slipping on I wonder why
I face
Affection, not embrace
Another urban wasteland thick with fears
Icy lights that shine like frozen television tears
Or dying embers of another day
Please tell me what it is I want to say
I'm tangled up in try
Slipping on I wonder why
I face
Affection, not embrace
Affectionate embraceEmbed
