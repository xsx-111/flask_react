My Favourite Chords LyricsThey're tearing up streets again, they're building a new hotel
The mayor's out killing kids to keep taxes down
And me and my anger sit folding a paper bird
Letting the curtains turn to beating wings
Wish I had a socket-set to dismantle this morning
And just one pair of clean socks and a photo of you
When you get off work tonight, meet me at the construction site
And we'll write some notes to tape to the heavy machines
Like "We hope they treat you well, hope you don't work too hard
We hope you get to be happy sometimes"
Bring your swiss-army knife and a bottle of something
And I'll bring some spray paint and a new deck of cards
Hey, I found the safest place to keep all our tenderness
To keep all those bad ideas, keep all our hope
It's here in the smallest bones, the feet and the inner ear
It's such an enormous thing to walk and to listen
And I'd like to fall asleep to the beat of you breathing
In a room near a truck stop on a highway somewhere
Well you are a radio, you are an open door
I am a faulty string of blue Christmas lights
You swim through frequencies, you let that stranger in
As I'm blinking off and on and off again
And we've got a lot of time, or maybe we don't
But I'd like to think so, so let me pretend
These are my favourite chords, I know you like them too
When I get a new guitar, you could have this one
And sing me a lullaby, sing me the alphabet
Sing me a story I haven't heard yetEmbed
