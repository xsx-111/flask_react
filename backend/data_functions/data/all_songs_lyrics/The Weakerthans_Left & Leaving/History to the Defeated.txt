History to the Defeated Lyrics
There's blood in the sink and he's plunging his wrists in
A hangover halo is washing away
Mechanic-school dropout stares into the mirror
Stands up in his derelict daydreams
Always too tall, always walked around wearing
A smile that was never quite sure of itself
Planning a future of failures inflicted
In phone calls from strip clubs and bail bonds

There's a light left on
There's a pace to our direction
There's a movie still
Of a heart I'd like to mention

Don't give me that look, I looked harder than most did
Let details like sharp nails punch holes in my shoes
Soft-traced to frown as I put the receiver down
Where do I go for a pardon?

There's a light left on
There's a pace to our direction
There's a movie still
Of a heart I'd like to mention
We're listing what's left:
A signed Slayer t-shirt
A car up on blocks in his mother's backyard1Embed
