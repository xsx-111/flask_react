I Will Not Apologize Lyrics
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

I'm so sick cause I'm infected but, but I don't need a medic
Need a liquid anesthetic, let me show you how I get it
I don't got it but I bet it, I don't worry, I don't sweat it
You can bitch, you can dead it, you can take it there like FedEx
Nothing sweet, diabetic, big dog, can't pet it
Pack an L then I wet it, then I fill it 'til it's pregnant
(Take the high back) Face it, everybody got a favorite
I embrace it like I date it but my grandma think I chase it
(Like oh yeah) I told her that her baby moving slower
Cause the world is on his shoulders then I woke up out that coma
(And got right back) At it with a little black 'matic
Lay you down, Craftmatic, then I'm gone, black magic
(To the hideout) You don't wanna gamble with the devil
Especially when them chewy blueys got me on another level
Cause my teacher think I'm slow but my momma think I'm special
But even she know I'm coming back like an echo
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

For the statements I'm about to make, I will not apologize
Niggas talk a lot of shit, really need to stop the lies
Jewels rented, cars rented, homie that ain't authentic
Acting tough on TV, but to me you seem a little timid
Don't blame the nigga, blame America, it's all business
Acting like a monkey is the only way to sell tickets
Shit, I can dig it, niggas gossip silly digits
White kids buy it, it's a riot when we talking about pimping
Or sipping on Olde English brew or whatever they think we do
Spraying double Uzis cause you know they think we live in zoos
The problem is with this, everyone seems to be real confused
The niggas on the streets to the old people that watch the news
And watch BET, and the crazy shit they see
They associate with you and do the same shit to me
When you look at me, you see just a nigga from the projects
But can't understand this nigga's mindset, but still
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize

Yo, a revolution's what it's smelling like, it ain't gon' be televised
Governments is hellified, taking cake and selling pies
I ain't got a crust or crumb, to get some I'd be well obliged
Murder is commodified, felon for the second time
Never was I into chasing trouble I was followed by
Facing trouble with no alibi, had to swallow pride
Vilified, victimized, penalized, criticized
Ran into some people that's surprised I was still alive
Look into my daughter's eyes, wonder how can I provide
Got to get from A to B but how can I afford to drive?
Messed around, tried to get a job and wasn't qualified
Had to see a pal of mine, got to get the lightning rod
Now I'm in a black Impala looking for the dollar sign
Palms get to itching, man I gotta get the calamine
'Fore I fall behind, guess the grind will be my 9 to 5
I will not be conquered by, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This is for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
I will not apologize, I will not apologize
This for all of my peoples who understand and truly recognize
Some won't get it and for that, I won't apologize1Embed
