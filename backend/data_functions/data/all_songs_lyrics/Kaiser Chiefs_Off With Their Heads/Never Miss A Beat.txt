Never Miss A Beat Lyrics
What did you learn today?
I learnt nothing
What did you do today?
I did nothing
What did you learn at school?
I didn't go
Why didn't you go to school?
I don't know

It's cool to know nothing
It's cool to know nothing

Televisions on the blink
There's nothing on it
I really want a really big coat
With words on it
What do you want for tea?
I want crisps
Why don't you join the team?
I just did

It's cool to know nothing
It's cool to know nothing
Take a look, take a look
Take a look at the kids on the street
No, they never miss a beat
No, they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No, they never miss a beat
No, they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Here comes the referee
With lights flashing
Best bit of the day
Now that's living
Why don't you run away?
Are you kidding?
What is the golden rule?
You say nothing

It's cool to know nothing
It's cool to know nothing
Take a look, take a look
Take a look at the kids on the street
No, they never miss a beat
No, they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No, they never miss a beat
No, they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat

Take a look, take a look
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat, beat, beat, beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat1Embed
