Tomato in the Rain LyricsLike a tomato in the rain
I've got that feeling again
Like a grey hound in a race
I've got a rabbit to chase
Roland and me
Know what's going down
We got the remedy
For what's going around
Like a beetle on its back
I've got to get back on track
Or a police man on the take
Weighted down in a lake
If the wheel comes off your cart
Hammer in a nail or two
Before it falls apart
Keep adding more nails and glue
Yes I do!
I know about you
Shall I come home?
Yes I do!
I know about you
Shall I come home?
I've got that feeling again
I've got that feeling again
Roland rat and me
Know what's going down
We got our memories
It all comes back around
Yes I do!
I know about you
Shall I come home?
Yes I do!
I know about you
Shall I come home?
Home...
Home...
