Addicted to Drugs LyricsWoahhhh
Yeahhhhh
Woahhhh
Getting married in the morning
It's hardly peaches and cream
We haven't got a lot in common
Except the daily routine
Nothing on the television
Just the dust on the screen
So, come on let's get together
Why don't we join a team?
You might as well face it you're addicted to drugs
You might as well face it you're addicted…
You might as well face it you're addicted to drugs
You might as well face it you're addicted…
Woahhhh
Yeahhhhh
Woahhhh
The greatest poet of the sixth form
Turned out to be a fraud
Man you got a lot of buddies
How do you remember them all?
You might as well face it you're addicted to drugs
You might as well face it you're addicted…
You might as well face it you're addicted to drugs
You might as well face it you're addicted…
You might as well face it you're addicted to drugs
You might as well face it you're addicted…
You might as well face it you're addicted to drugs
You might as well face it you're addicted…
WoahhhhhhhEmbed
