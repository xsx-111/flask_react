Like It Too Much LyricsIn nights of old, they lie in the roads
Off with their heads, and always lead opinion polls
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with a ringside seat
In uniforms, of green and gold
Like crocodiles they march in files of unison
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with a ringside seat
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free
I like it too much, I like it too much
I like it too much, I like it too much
Coz you are, descended from animals
And you are constructed of chemicals
The one thing you can't have, you like too much
You look but you cannot touch
Like dominoes, one only goes
They all will fall, sail the ship, rock the boat
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, with a ringside seat
Going in and out of, another state of, try not to be obvious, you get the first one free
I like it too much I like it too much
I like you it much I like it too much
Coz you are, descended from animals
And you are constructed of chemicals
The one thing you can't have, you like too much
You look but you cannot touch
I like it all too much
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
Coz you are, descended from animals
And you are constructed of chemicals
The one thing you can't have, you like too much
You look but you cannot touch
I like it all too muchEmbed
