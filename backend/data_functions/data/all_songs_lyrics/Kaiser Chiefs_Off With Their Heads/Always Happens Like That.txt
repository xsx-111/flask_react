Always Happens Like That LyricsYeah we plugged it in
And we turned it on
And we made it up
As we went along
And it always happens like that
And it always happens like that
So we made a film
Starring you and me
Just hanging around
Turned out to be a smash
And it always happens like that
And it always happens like that
You can do what you like
But you can't do that
You can say what you want
But you can't say that
You can go anywhere
But you can't go there
That looks like a letter that I don't want to open
Aaah, aaah, aaah
And we broke into
The municipal pool
And we turned it in
To a madrigal
And it always happens like that
And it always happens like that
You can do what you like
But you can't do that
You can say what you want
But you can't say that
You can go anywhere
But you can't go there
That looks like a letter that I don't want to open
That looks like a letter that I don't want to open
And we made a vow
To the holy cow
And we set it up
Just to knock it down
And it always happens like that
And it always happens like that
And it will always happen like that
And it will always happen like that
And I always do it like that
And I always do it like thatEmbed
