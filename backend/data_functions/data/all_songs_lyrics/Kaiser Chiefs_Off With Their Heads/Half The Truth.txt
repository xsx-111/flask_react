Half The Truth Lyrics
Girl and boy, everything in full swing
Heads or tails, doesn't make a difference
Beneath the glamour there was always gonna be
Amateur dramatics, a lot of bad behavior
I would see glasses on the table
One, two, three, only you and me
Wearing nothing in the lap of luxury
Sipping slowly, not a leg to stand on

Take my money
Waste of paper
Leave the table
Bad behaviour

I got my spies, swift to every consulate
To be my eyes and tell me what I never see
'Cause a ghost don't fear a lover
Nothing teeth blank, ah get ready for the credit clubber
Secret mole, getting it together
With a big fat bowl of alphabet spaghetti
Watch the birdie looking through the mirror
Polly wanna cracker, that's not what I heard

 (x2)
And I will not lie to you
But I definitely only gave you half the truth
And I will not lie to you

Gentlemen turn off your recorders
I can hear them buzzing from inside of your tracksuits
Got to get to California
Where this woman is threatening to sue me
Get right back, back to the beginning
Where we start off single and everything in full swing
Everyone around you wearing big gold hats, come on
Playing the piano now

 (x2)

Listen, I won't lie so baby don't cry
The way I'm feeling right now, I'm feeling so high
I can't tell you to choose, baby you know why
'Cause everybody talks about me, I'm a known guy
I'll tell you half the truth, at least I told you half
But then all the rest of it, I'll tell you if you only ask
'Cause I'm a gold digger and I should know better
And I will not lie to you
But I definitely only gave you half the truth
And I will not lie to you
I will not lie to you
I will not lie to you
I will not lie to you1Embed
