Sooner or Later LyricsJust when you thought it was safe to go
Back in the party on your own
It's like the night of the living dead
With beer in hand and lampshade on head
Fast forward two weeks
Someone's coming up your street
Fast forward two weeks
What is that is that a rat a tat tat tat
Sooner or later there will be a knock at the door now you
Won't know what you're doin' or what you're doin' it for
And then you say to yourself
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere
I was definitely there with you that night
When you looked like you had seen a ghost
I remember because you turned off the lights
And we hid In a pile of coats
Now fast forward two weeks
Someone coming up you're street
Fast forward two weeks
What was that was that a rat a tat tat tat
Sooner or later there'll be a knock at the door but you
Won't know what your doin' or what you're doin' it for
Then you say to yourself
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere oh
Activated the security light as he came up the garden path
We all waited and tried to be quiet
And we suddenly heard that rat a tat tat tat
Sooner or later there'll be a knock at the door but
You won't know what your doin' or what you're doin' it for
Then you say to yourself
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere
That guy is everywhere

Count me out
Count me out
Count me out
