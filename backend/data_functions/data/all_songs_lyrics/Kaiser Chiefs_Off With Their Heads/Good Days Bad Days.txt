Good Days Bad Days LyricsFollow the underdog
Hold on his collar tight
This city loves a scrap
One day it's gonna fight
Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from having a good day
On a bad day
There's good days and bad days
Making a night of it
Breaking the barriers
Drowning the sorrows
Upset the regulars
Sticks and stones and animal bones
Can't stop me from getting away with
Good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days
Oh, hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Oh, hey, hey
(Breaking the barriers)
Hey, hey
(Making a night of it)
Hey, hey
(Getting away with it)
Hey, hey
(Good days and bad days)

Sticks and stones and animal bones
Sticks and stones and animal bones
There's good days and bad days
There's good days and bad days
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(Family business)
Hey, hey
(He's getting away with it)
Hey, hey
(Family business)
Hey, hey
(He's getting away with it)
Hey, hey
(Family business)
Hey, hey
(He's getting away with it)
If you had a different attitude
Instead of take and take and take
You have missed an opportunity
And that's a really big mistake
If you had a different attitude
You'd still have good days and bad days
Hey, hey, hey1Embed
