You Want History LyricsYesterday you lay awake on your bed
And worked out you'd done everything that you said
That you'd do before you got to this age
The lord of the bored and a slave to the beige
It's a mystery
It's a mystery
You want some history
It's a mystery
So last night you got up and out of this room
The ceiling is peeling and covered in gloom
But jaguar shoes is a place you can stare
A procession of lessons in what not to wear
It's a mystery
It's a mystery
You want history
It's a mystery
Today as you shake off the drunken debris
All that is left is the vague memory
Of down in the grout of a night on the tiles
It's hard to remember but totally worthwhile
It's a mystery
It's a mystery
You want some history
It's a mystery
It's a waste of money you have to admit
If it's a waste of money you have to have it
It's a waste of brains but hard to resist
If you wanted mystery you've blown it
It's a waste of money you have to admit
If it's a waste of money you have to have it
It's a waste of brain cells hard to resist
If you wanted history you missed it
If the girls start moving the boys will start moving
If the girls start moving the boys will join in
If the girls start moving the boys will start moving
If the girls start moving the boys will join in
If the girls start moving the boys will start moving
If the girls start moving the boys will join in
If the girls start moving the boys will start moving
If the girls start moving the boys will join in
Oh oh oh-oh-oh oh oh ohEmbed
