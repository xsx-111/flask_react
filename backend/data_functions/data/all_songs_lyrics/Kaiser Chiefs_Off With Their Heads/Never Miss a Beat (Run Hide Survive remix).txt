Never Miss a Beat (Run Hide Survive remix) LyricsWhat did you learn today
I learned nothing
What did you do today
I did nothing
What did you learn at school
I didn't go-o
Why didn't you go to school
I don't know
It's cool, to know nothing
It's cool, to know nothing
Television's on the blink
There's nothing on it
I really wanna really big coat
With words on it
What do you want for tea
I want crisps
Why don't you join the team
I just didn't
It's cool, to know nothing
It's cool, to know nothing
Take a look, take a look
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat beat, beat beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a, never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Here comes the referee
The light's flashin'
Best bit of the day
Now that's living
Why don't you run away
Are you kidding
What is the golden rule
You say nothing
It's cool, to know nothing
It's cool, to know nothing
Take a look, take a look
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a beat beat, beat beat
Take a look at the kids on the street
No they never miss a beat
No they never miss a beat
Never miss a beat
Never miss a, never miss a beat
Never miss a beatEmbed
