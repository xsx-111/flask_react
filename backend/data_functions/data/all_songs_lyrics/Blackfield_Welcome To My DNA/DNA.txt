DNA LyricsDNA
Welcome to my DNA
Stupidly, you want to stay
With my DNA
DNA
You cannot fix what you get
Things that I try to forget
In my DNA
Can you forgive me
For things that I've said?
Things that I've done?
Go now, and never come back
DNA
We've all got expiring dates
Trust me, there's no get away
From my DNA
DNA
Wires of sadness and pain
Always remaining the same
My DNA
Disarmed by the music
There's bombs in my head
You'll always get burned
Go now, and never come back
My deadly venom
Soon I'll be dead
Go now, my love
Go now, and never come backEmbed
