On The Plane LyricsStanding in the corridor, it's just another day
You never were the kind of boy who ran outside to play
You're passing through the kitchen behind your mother's back
While she says "your father's on the plane"
The rain against the windows, you're waiting on the stairs
You double check the driveway for someone standing there
You calculate the chances of presents on your bed tonight
Daddy's on his way
Daddy's on the plane
Soon you'll meet again
Daddy's on the plane
That's what mother said
While you were waiting
Nothing ever happens in your neighbourhood
You'd like to run so far away if you only could
It seems that all the people have nothing much to say anyway
Daddy's on his way
Daddy's on the plane
Soon you'll meet again
Daddy's on the plane
That's what mother said
While you were waitingEmbed
