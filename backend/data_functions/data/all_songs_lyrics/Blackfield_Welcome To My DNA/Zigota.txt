Zigota LyricsDon't you fight, don't you fight
When your death is calling for a ride
Close your eyes, close your eyes
You won't suffer there above the clouds
Don't you know there's only one way out?
And it comes when it comes when it's time
For shedding some tears
Forget in a minute why the reason they cry
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black, soon it will turn to black
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black, soon it will turn to black
Soon you'll find, soon you'll find
Today is just the future of the past
Don't you cry, don't you cry
You are just an accident of stars
Don't you know there's only one way out?
And it comes when it comes when it's time
For shedding some tears
Forget in a minute why the reason they cry
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black, soon it will turn to black
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will turn to black, soon it will turn to black
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will burn to black, soon it will burn to black
One direction with no turning back
Soon it will burn to black, soon it will burn to black
One direction with no turning back
One direction with no turning back
Don't you fight, don't you fight
When your death is calling for a rideEmbed
