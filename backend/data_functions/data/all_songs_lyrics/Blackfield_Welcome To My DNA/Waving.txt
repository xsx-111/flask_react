Waving LyricsTurn up the noise
Let's see if you can maintain your poise
Edge out the door
And feel it if you swim back to the shore
I do believe
I'm clinging to the warm breeze in the trees
I wave and I turn off the light
Your dress may be torn but you wear it well
All this and more may be in your spell
Four letter word but it isn't real
All this speed inside you
A sneer on the edge of your sanity
Your bludgeon the sound like it's unappealing
Pouring your scorn on all pride and joy
All this fear inside youEmbed
