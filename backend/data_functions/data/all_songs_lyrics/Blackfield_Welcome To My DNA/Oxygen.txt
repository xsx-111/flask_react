Oxygen LyricsSo far away, we lost the way
There's no oxygen left on our planet
Empty words break on our lips
There's no oxygen left on our planet
Everyone sleeping with their guns
Someone's going to die
So much noise, we're a bunch of boys
We were born to lie
I feel alive just when I cry
There's no oxygen left on our planet
Things we've said and then regret
There's no oxygen left on our planet
Everyone sleeping with their guns
Someone's going to die
So much noise, we're a bunch of boys
We were born to lie, everyone
Everyone sleeping with their guns
Someone's going to die
So far away, we lost the way
There's no oxygen left on our planetEmbed
