Glass House LyricsGoodbye old friend, my paranoid
We'll meet again some day
Life is running out
I guess I had enough, I need to go now
I used to live in a house of glass
Where no-one comes or goes
Watching life outside
I used to stand behind the door
And hope the wind won't blow
And mess my fears around
It took me so long to find out where they're hiding
Music like rain over my deepest feelings
On your faking landEmbed
