Rising Of The Tide LyricsAny day can be the last day in your life
So make it an unforgettable time
Another sleepless night, and anxiety attacks
The doctor said you need some rest
But you're always on the run, tracing after a place to hide
You were born to your mum's shaking hands
The wolves are out tonight, and they're looking for a fight
As they run at the speed of light
It seems you're home again
Don't forget to breathe, while time is running out
On the clock tower, the window sky
Any day can be the last day in your life
So make it an unforgettable time
Around me blinking lights form a giant neon sign
You were born in the wrong wrong year
Your soul is freezing ice, but still they're asking for a slice
You had to feed those monster hearts
When you're home again
You feel you had enough, it's like the rising of the tide
You're a shadow just passing by
The wolves are out tonight and they're looking for a fight
And they run at the speed of light
It seems you're home againEmbed
