Far Away LyricsWherever I stay, there's a feeling I'm so far away
I got no home town
I never put roots down
I bet you feel safe keeping your life in a cage
While I take my chances
But it always collapses
I really don't know what it needs
To put my smile on
And turn the light on
It always seems I'm falling down
They think I'm crazy
They think I'm crazy
There's a child in me still hiding behind the old tree
But aren't we all hiding?
'Til the moment we're dying
Now maybe I'm free, but freedom just means that's I'm lost
It feels like I'm driving
Without ever arriving
I really don't know what it needs
To put my smile on
And turn the light on
It always seems I'm falling down
They think I'm crazy
They think I'm crazy
Wherever I stay, there's a feeling I'm so far away
I got no home town
I used to run so fastEmbed
