Dissolving With The Night LyricsSoon I'll disappear into the deepest space
I won't leave a trace
I can count on one hand all my glorious days
And cry out all the rest
What an unforgettable past
From my first day to the last
I was in panic there
Watching mountains collapse
Dreams turn to dust
We're dissolving with the night
All the stupid bitches on their dime a day
Soon they'll fade away
Should I wear the purple dress, that's all she cares about
What a silly life she has
All these people who smile
Never cry
But it's fine with me
With their feet on the ground
Blinded by the sun
Never asking more from life
Soon I'll disappear into the deepest space
I won't leave a traceEmbed
