Bamboo Bones Lyrics
Don't let them break you
Don't let them tell you who you are
Doesn't matter where you come from
You'll always have a floor to sleep on

And you have your bamboo bones, nervous energy
Blind ambition, skin of your teeth
Push back, push back, push back
With every word and every breath

What God doesn't give to you
You've got to go and get for yourself
What God doesn't give to you
You've got to go and get for yourself
I'm embarrassed to admit it, I've got no grip
I'm leading with my jaw
Can you see it from a distance, does it look ridiculous?
I guess that's just what I have to live with

Still I have a mind to think, knees to break
You standing beside me
I'm going to push back, push back, push back
With every word and every breath
What God doesn't give to you
You've got to go and get for yourself
What God doesn't give to you
You've got to go and get for yourself

What God doesn't give to you
What God doesn't give to you
What God doesn't give to you
What God doesn't give to you
What God doesn't give to you
You've got to go and get for yourself
For yourselfEmbed
