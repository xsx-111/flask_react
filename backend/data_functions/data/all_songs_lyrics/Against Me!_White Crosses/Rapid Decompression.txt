Rapid Decompression Lyrics
How much is too much?
I'm tired of predicting to lose
But before you point your finger
Before you cast your stones, take a look at yourself
How can you expect from someone what you won't do yourself?

There's no bottom to your reality
Your desperation is utter and complete
What you can't love about yourself
You have to steal from someone else and what you can't steal
What you can't steal, you have to deny

Rapid decompression, rapid decompression
Rapid decompression, rapid decompression
Rapid decompression, rapid decompression
Sometimes it feels
Sometimes it feels like your whole world's coming to an end

Coming to an end
Coming to an endEmbed
