Spanish Moss Lyrics
You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologize
Apologize

It could be a good life
It could be such a very good life
We could find a place for just me and you
Need some place to stay safe
Need some place to stay safe and warm
Why don't we deserve the same?

You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologize
You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologize

Look into the Spanish moss
Let your mind conjure up old ghosts
Ride your bike through lost Florida streets
Everything we've said and done
Can be so easily forgotten
You can always change who you are
You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologize
You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologize

I caught a glimpse of this life
It could be such a very good life
We could find a place for just me and you
But it's not yours to keep
Yeah, the truth will tear your heart out
In a world run by gangsters
You're stuck standing in a bread line
Stuck standing in a breadline
Stuck sanding

You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologize
You just need to find some place to get away
You can forget your name and there's no need to apologizeEmbed
