Ache with Me Lyrics
I've walked down high streets, looking through windows
I've been lost in crowds of strangers
Searched record shops and cosmetic aisles
Phonebooks, want ads, bus stops, and libraries

Newspaper headlines, mannequin faces
Television stations, billboard advertisements
Your voice echoes in the back of my mind
I see your face when I close my eyes

Do you share the same sense of defeat?
Have you realized all the things you'll never be?
Ideals turn to resentment, open minds close up with cynicism
I've got no judgment for you, come on and ache with me

Through barrooms, caf√©s, jail cells and court rooms
Theaters, restaurants, graveyards and churches
I've spent every dollar that I've ever earned
I'll bleed my heart out, I'll give every word

I've asked preachers, doctors and lawyers
Socialites, pariahs, mothers and fathers
You may not find all that you're after
In the end, I hope it doesn't matter
Do you share the same sense of defeat?
Have you realized all the things you'll never be?
Ideals turn to resentment, open minds close up with cynicism
I've got no judgment for you, come on and ache with me

Do you share the same sense of defeat?
Have you realized all the things you'll never be?
I've got no judgement for you, come on and ache with me2Embed
