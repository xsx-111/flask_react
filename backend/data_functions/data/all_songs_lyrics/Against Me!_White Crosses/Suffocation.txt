Suffocation Lyrics
We were young heartbreakers estranged from our wealthy parents
Doing key bumps in a handicap bathroom
Stoned, complacent, ambivalent
Mass communicating with shared subconscious

Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
The western world

Homosexual sons of unfulfilled fathers
Divorced from reality, free and young
We were bashing our brains out on a kitchen cabinet
It was a televised crucifixion

Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
The western world
In the western world
In the western world

We were star-crossed, we were destitute
Our words spoke mass destruction
We watched the sun rise in the morning
Daughters in arm, we all are orphans

Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
Suffocation, modern life in the western world
The western world
The western world

The western world
(In the western world, in the western world)
The western world
(In the western world, in the western world)
The western world
(In the western world, in the western world)
(In the western world, in the western world)
The western worldEmbed
