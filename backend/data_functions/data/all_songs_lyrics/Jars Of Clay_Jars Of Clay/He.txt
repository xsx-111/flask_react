He LyricsDon't try to reach me, I'm already dead
The pain when it grips me, for things that I've done
Well, I try to make you proud
But for crying out loud
Just give me a chance to hide away
Exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over?
Fearful tears are running down
The pain you've laid, don't speak a sound
Don't take my heart away from me
And they think I fell down again
Daddy, don't you love me
Then why do you hit me
And Momma don't you love me
Then why do you hurt me
Well, I try to make you proud
But for crying out loud
Just give me a chance to hide away
Exhaustion takes over, will this someday be over?
Fearful tears are running down
The pain you've laid, don't speak a sound
Don't take my heart away from me
And they think I fell down again
Fearful tears are running down
The pain you've laid, don't speak a sound
Don't take my heart away from me
And they think I fell down
A teardrop falls from up in the heavens
Drowning the sorrow of angels on high
For the least of the helpless, the hopeless, the loveless
Your Jesus, His children, He holds in His arms
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds you
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds you
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds you
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds you
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds you
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds you
He loves you, He sees you
He knows you, protects you
He needs you, He holds youEmbed
