Like a Child LyricsDear God, surround me as I speak
The bridges that I walk across are weak
The frustrations fill the void
That I can't solely bear
Dear God, don't let me fall apart
You've held me close to you
But I have turned away and searched
For answers I can't understand
They say that I can move the mountains
And send them falling to the sea
They say that I can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With Faith Like a Child
Sometimes, when I feel miles away
And my eyes can't see your face
Well, I wonder if I've grown
To lose the recklessness
I walked in light of you
They say that I can move the mountains
And send them crashing to the sea
They say that I can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With Faith Like a Child
They say that I can move the mountains
And send them crashing to the sea
They say that I can walk on water
If I would follow and believe
With Faith Like a Child
They say that love can heal the broken
They say that hope can make you see
They say that faith can find a Savior
If you would follow and believe
With Faith Like a ChildEmbed
