Art in Me LyricsImages on the sidewalk speak of dream's descent
Washed away by storms to graves of cynical lament
Dirty canvases to call my own
Protest limericks carved by the old pay phone
In your picture book I'm trying hard to see
Turning endless pages of this tragedy
Sculpting every move you compose a symphony
You plead to everyone, "See the art in me"
"See the art in me"
"See the art in me"
Broken stained-glass windows, the fragments ramble on
Tales of broken souls, an eternity's been won
As critics scorn the thoughts and works of mortal man
My eyes are drawn to you in awe once again
In your picture book I'm trying hard to see
Turning endless pages of this tragedy
Sculpting every move you compose a symphony
You plead to everyone, "See the art in me" (See the art in me)
"See the art in me" (See the art in me)
"See the art in me"
In your picture book I'm trying hard to see (trying hard to see)
Turning endless pages of this tragedy
Sculpting every move you compose a symphony
And you plead to everyone, "See the art in me" (See the art in me)
"See the art in me" (See the art in me)
"See the art in me" (See the art in me)
"See the art in me"Embed
