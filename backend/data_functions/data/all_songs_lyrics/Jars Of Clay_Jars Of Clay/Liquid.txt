Liquid LyricsArms nailed down, Are you telling me something?
Eyes turned out, Are you looking for someone?

This is the one thing, The one thing that I know
Blood-stained brow, Are you dying for nothing?
Flesh and blood, Is it so elemental?

Blood-stained brow, He wasn't broken for nothing
Arms nailed down, He didn't die for nothing
