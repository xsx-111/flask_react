Boy On a String LyricsThe marionette has your number
Pulling your arms and legs 'til you can't stand on your own
Dragging your conscience on the stage and your heart gets rearranged
And you cannot tell your mentor from your Maker
Look at the crowds bleeding with laughter
Over the way you entertain at beck and call
They don't see behind the lights or the painted backgrounds
They just like to see you fall
And you don't really mind
And you're just wasting time
And you don't feel anything
You're a boy on a string
I feel the sadness like Gepetto
Watching the life that he created run away
Seeing the puppeteer's intrusion and holding the remains
Of puppets that had rotted away
One day the curtain will not open (will not open)
And all of the crowds will go away (crowds will go away)
Sometimes those strings will choke you
But until that day
No, you won't really mind
And you're just wasting time
And you don't feel anything
You're a boy on a string
Just a boy, just a boy, just a boy...
And you don't really mind
And you're just wasting time
And you don't feel anything
You're a boy on a string
'Cause you don't really mind
And you're just wasting time
You don't feel anything
You're a boy on a string
Just a boy on a stringEmbed
