Blind LyricsCynical, it's just your way
You play the doubting Thomas
Feel the scars and wipe the stains
So you fight, and retreat
And talk yourself out of believing
In any peace that you can't see
Blind words you call
Blind words will fall
You're logical, you can't find
Any reason to believe in love, you are blind
Crucify, and deny
Pass the blame and burn the mission
Till dust remains and wash your hands
Blind words you call
Blind words will fall
Blind words you call
Blind words will fallEmbed
