Sinking LyricsIt's not my problem anymore
You see it never really was
So you can stop caring as you call it
And I'll be fine right here
You see that I can play a pretty convincing role
So I don't need you, I don't think I need you
But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing
You can't hear what I'm not saying
And I can hold out long enough
Treading water I keep from sinking
'Cause I'm not one for reaching
You see that I can play a pretty convincing role
So I don't need you, I don't think I need you
But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing
Deny myself, deny my heart
Deny your hand, deny your help
And you offer me eternity
But why should I buy that?
You see that I can play a pretty convincing role
So I don't need you, I don't think I need you
But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healing
But you see through my forever lies
And you are not believing
And I see in your forever eyes
That you are forever healingEmbed
