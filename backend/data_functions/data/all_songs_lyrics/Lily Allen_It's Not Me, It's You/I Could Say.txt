I Could Say Lyrics
I could say that I'll always be here for you
But that would be a lie and quite a pointless thing to do
I could say that I'll always have feelings for you
But I've got a life ahead of me and I'm only 22

Since you've gone, I've lost that chip on my shoulder
Since you've gone, I feel like I've gotten older
Now you're gone, it's as if the whole wide world is my stage
Now you're gone, it's like I've been let out of my cage

You always made it clear that you hated my friends
You made me feel so guilty when I was running 'round with them
And everything was always about being cool
And now I've come to realize there's nothing cool about you at all

Since you've gone, I've lost that chip on my shoulder
Since you've gone, I feel like I've gotten older
Now you're gone, it's as if the whole wide world is my stage
Now you're gone, it's like I've been let out of my cage

Since you've gone, I've lost that chip on my shoulder
Since you've gone, I feel like I've gotten older
Now you're gone, it's as if the whole wide world is my stage
Now you're gone, it's like I've been let out of my cage2Embed
