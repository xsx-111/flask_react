Never Gonna Happen Lyrics
I don't wanna hurt you 'cause I don't think it's a virtue
But you and I have come to our end
Believe me when I tell you that I never wanna see you again
And please can you stop calling 'cause it's getting really boring
And I've told you I don't wanna be friends
Believe me when I tell you that I never wanna see you again

How on earth could I be any more obvious? (Obvious)
It never really did and now it's never going to happen with the two of us
I don't understand what it is that you're chasing after (Chasing after)
But it makes me really sad to hear you sound so desperate
It just makes it harder

I can see how it's confusing, it could be considered using
When I call you up straight out of the blue (Out of the blue)
But I don't understand what else a girl in my position's to do (To do)
Now I know you feel betrayed, but it's been weeks since I got laid
This doesn't mean that I don't think you're a fool
But I don't understand what else a girl in my position's to do

How on earth could I be any more obvious? (Obvious)
It never really did and now it's never going to happen with the two of us
I don't understand what it is that you're chasing after (Chasing after)
But it makes me really sad to hear you sound so desperate
It just makes it harder
I know it's rather ugly 'cause I know that you still love me
And this isn't any kind of excuse
I don't love you, I don't love you

How on earth could I be any more obvious? (Obvious)
It never really did and now it's never going to happen with the two of us
I don't understand what it is that you're chasing after (Chasing after)
But it makes me really sad to hear you sound so desperate
It just makes it harderEmbed
