Him Lyrics
Would you please take me away from this place?
I cannot bear to see the look upon your faces
And if there is some kind of God do you think he's pleased?
When he looks down on us, I wonder what he sees
Do you think he'd think the things we do are a waste of time?
Maybe he'd think that we are getting on just fine
Do you think he's skint or financially secure?
And come election time, I wonder who he'd vote for

Ever since he can remember
People have died in his good name
Long before that September
Long before hijacking planes
He's lost the will, he can't decide
He doesn't know who's right or wrong
But there's one thing that he's sure of
This has been going on too long

Do you think he'd drive in his car without insurance?
Now is he interesting, or do you think he'd bore us?
Do you think his favorite type of human is Caucasian?
Do you reckon he's ever been done for tax evasion?
Do you think he's any good at remembering people's names?
Do you think he's ever taken smack or cocaine?
I don't imagine he's ever been suicidal
His favourite band is Creedence Clearwater Revival
Ever since he can remember
People have died in his good name
Long before that September
Long before hijacking planes
He's lost the will, he can't decide
He doesn't know who's right or wrong
But there's one thing that he's sure of
This has been going on too long


Ever since he can remember
People have died in his good name
Long before that September
Long before hijacking planes
He's lost the will, he can't decide
He doesn't know who's right or wrong
But there's one thing that he's sure of
This has been going on too long4Embed
