Victoria Falls LyricsI don't know where I am
Who's that boy you're leaning on
(Victoria ceases to care)
You're not the only one
(Virginia creeps through the air)
Summer evening, summer sun
(Virago will publish her diaries when she's dead)
To the world
(Unlocking the dreams in her head)
And the world is blind
(Unstable, unhinged and unfed)
She'll wed the summertime
(Unable to answer the questions of her life)
I don't believe you (I don't believe)
I don't really need to (I don't need Victoria)
I won't let Victoria fall
When the night has come and gone
(His ghostly perfection remains)
Melting in the morning sun
(His pale saint complexion unchanged)
Lovers go and lovers come
(And some stay for longer but never long enough)
His shadow lingers on
(Victoria ceases to care)
His shadow fades like a pop song
(Virginia creeps through her hair)
Death to the supernatural one
(Virago will publish the story of her life)
Queen of the South
I don't believe you (I don't believe)
I don't really need to (I don't need Victoria)
I won't let Victoria fall
I don't defend you
(I don't defend you)
I don't recommend you but
(I don't recommend Victoria)
I won't let Victoria fall away
