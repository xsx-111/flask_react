I Was Born Yesterday Lyrics
I, I was born yesterday
And I believe all that you say
I have no choice, I must obey
You
Is this the first or the second day
Of the rest of my life, well hey
Why should I care either way
If what you say
Is true

Saturday morning, the 18th of December
I cannot remember the last time that I saw
Such a young ballerina in love with the loveless
In tune with a tuneless
Old upright piano
Standing en pointe
Going through each position with gentle precision
She measures each movement
Her classical features and elegant waistline
Are going to waste while she pleases her parents

I, I was born yesterday
And I believe all that you say
I have no choice, I must obey
You
(But I have a question)
Is this the first or the second day
Of the rest of my life, well hey
Why should I care either way
If what you say
Is true
What if they died on the road to Rathmines?
Where a dog in two minds times his run to perfection
An orphan at last, she'd be sick in the loo-bowl
Then go the funeral and cry by the graveside
Then she would sleep with the first man she sees
And she'd catch some disease which she'd give to her doctor
And she'd cook her own breakfast and she'd cook his as well
And they'd both get on swell even though he was married

You are a part of me
I am a part of you
Why should I let you walk
All over me
All over meEmbed
