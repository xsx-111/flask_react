Lucy LyricsI travelled among unknown men
In lands beyond the sea;
Nor, England did I know till then
What love I bore to thee
'Tis past, that melancholy dream!
Nor will I quit thy shore
A second time; for still I seem
To love thee more and more
Among thy mountains did I feel
The joy of my desire;
And she I cherished turned her wheel
Beside an English fire
Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed
The bowers where Lucy played;
And thine too is the last green field
That Lucy's eyes surveyed
She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove
A Maid whom there were none to praise
And very few to love:
A violet by a mossy stone
Half hidden from the eye
-Fair as a star, when only one
Is shining in the sky
She lived unknown, and few could know
When Lucy ceased to be;
But she is in her grave and, oh
The difference to me
A slumber did my spirit seal;
I had no human fears;
She seemed a thing that could not feel
The touch of earthly years
No motion has she now, no force;
She neither hears nor sees;
Rolled around in earth's diurnal course
With rocks, and stones, and treesEmbed
