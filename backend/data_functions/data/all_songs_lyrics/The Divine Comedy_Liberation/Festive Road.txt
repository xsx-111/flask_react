Festive Road LyricsAn ordinary day down on Festive Road
The children will play and never will know
That when Mr Benn of No. 52
Walks in through that door
Peculiar events will ensue
The shopkeeper peers through spectacles round
As Benn wanders in and shuts out the town
The shopkeeper wears his customary grin
'Cause he knows when they go to try on his clothes
Each fantasy chosen begins...Embed
