Europop Lyrics
Hello
What would you like to know?
And what would you like to hear?
What if I just disappear inside myself?
Hello
What would you like to know?
And who would you like to see?
Who would you like me to be if not myself?

And the Europop, pop
Makes me dizzy
And I just can't stop, stop
Till it's finished
And I don't know what, what
You find funny about the Europop
And the love of money

Hello
Where is it cool to go?
When is it cool to leave?
What is it cool to breathe inside myself?
Hello
Don't tell me what I already know
Don't show me what I've already seen
Don't take me where I've already been inside myself
And the Europop, pop
Makes me dizzy
And I just can't stop, stop
Till it's finished
And I don't know what, what
You find funny about the Europop
And the love of money

Financial gain
Is a very pleasant thing
The transitory pleasure that it brings
Counts for nothing

So
What is there left to know?
What is there left to say?
Nothing

(Frère Jacques, Frère Jacques)
And the Europop, pop
Makes me dizzy
And I just can't stop, stop
Till it's finished
And I don't know what, what
You find funny about the Europop
And the love of money
And I thank God that you're aware
Oh thank God that you're aware
Of the earth and of the air
And of the girls making like they don't care
But they are blessed
And you are cursed
With the conscience of a universe
Of the mind and of the soul
And reduction science digging itself a hole
And I thank God that you're aware
And thank your God you're all aware
It's taken time but I think you'll find
That everything is all rightEmbed
