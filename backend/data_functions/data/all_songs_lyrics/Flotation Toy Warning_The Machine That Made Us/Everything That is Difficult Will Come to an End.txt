Everything That is Difficult Will Come to an End LyricsI don't have much time, none of us really do
So I'm fucked if I'll be spending it with you
You're making history my friend, that said
Your histrionics drive me round the bend
You have to take what the slipstream sends
When your salad days have reached an end
You're changing my mind
Come take me out where the wild things grow
And teach me all that I ought to know
You're changing my mind
Come fish me out of the idiot soup
And all the fun of your other loops
You're changing my mind
I wrote this letter to myself
Well you know me, I like to help
It justifies the harm we do
Wrapped up in pretty songs for you
I'm sorry that I woke you up
But you're trussed up here like Lilliput
You know I had to join a queue
Just to dry these jokes on you
I kept you how I saw you last
And you're smiling in that photograph
I know we buried "ought to do"
But mother has more games for you
The open door was just a test
I'm glad you failed it like the best
What passes for a view round here
Has a curious taste of understeer
Come fish me out of the idiot soup
And all the fun of your other loops
You're changing my mind
Yes, I could have called you more
Well, okay I never called at all
These parts of me so sharp and curved
Have ways I cannot shape to words
You shelter in their soft skin glow
Drink in its warmth, then let it go
The mine you need just isn't here
You sat and watched him disappear
At times I would have bombed the past
My cartoon worlds, they always cast
You as punch-drunk, me as slow
Both patsy to the undertow
Oh let him go, he won't get far
He dribbles words, I drive the car
It gets us where we need to be
With disappointing frequency
Are we still running, is this thing on?
He'll catch it when you're sure the moment's gone
When you think we're only chasing unicorns
He'll have it in the walk between two rooms
Oh let him go, he won't get far
He dribbles words, I drive the car
We drag him where he needs to be
With disappointing frequencyEmbed
