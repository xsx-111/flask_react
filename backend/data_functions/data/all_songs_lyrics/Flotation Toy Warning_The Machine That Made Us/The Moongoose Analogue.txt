The Moongoose Analogue LyricsI was on the way to Mandalay
Couldn't care less for your problems
These things you care about don't bother me
I was on the way to Mandalay
Couldn't care less about your problems
These things you care about don't bother me
And the heart of it is all that I can bear
These things don't write themselves
Take it from me
There will be no 'forever'
There will be, no 'til the end of time'
Not much, but, that much
Is clear to me
There will be no 'forever'
There will be no 'til the end of time'
Not much, but, that much
Is clear to me
I was on the way to Mandalay
Couldn't care less for your problems
These things you care about don't bother me
I was on the way to Mandalay
Couldn't care less about your problems
These things you care about don't bother me
Every part of it, I try to write it down
These things they come in cells
Taken from me
There will be no 'forever'
There will be no 'til the end of time'
Not much, but, that much
Is clear to me
There will be no 'forever'
There will be, no 'til the end of time'
Just words, but, a last cut
Then you set me free
I was on the way to Mandalay
Couldn't care less about your problems
These things you care about don't bother me
And the heart of it is all that I can bear
These things don't write themselves
Take it from me
Friends may come and friends may go
But I know you'll be back for more
(I was always on your side)
Friends may come and friends may go
But I know you'll be back for moreEmbed
