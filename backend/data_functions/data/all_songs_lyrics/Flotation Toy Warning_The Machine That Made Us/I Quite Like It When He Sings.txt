I Quite Like It When He Sings LyricsI'm calling for volunteers to climb the mountain
Must have experience of the war
Must be able to write in the journals that I keep
Much better than those who went before
Must have experience of the good times
So we understand just what the bad times are for
Must be armed with fear and firm convictions
Unless your conviction is you're not entirely sure
I will dedicate a sea to my contradictions
After all the empty years they've washed ashore
But what of the overflow?
Warm roads that my debris closed
Scripts late of mothballed shows
Stray hopes left with no way home
I, who must detain them all
When days scrape, I can hear them call
You, as you'd dress for her
The sweet scent that would lead you there
Soft lines only she could know
As you shine in her afterglow
I, who would hold everything
Hold me, I am your broken king
Let go, and I fear the height
That's why I must climb at nightEmbed
