A Season Underground Lyrics
It came on Tuesday
When harmonic dreams had meaning
By Wednesday night
The sense had crept away
I always see you
As a young man, as I read them
I wrote that down so
Some part of you remained

I keep his words
And I eat them
When I need them
They fill the space when I have nothing left to say
I have no shape
These scribblings that surround me
Secure the 'heads
Though the frame shrinks by the day

And so I wrote
Sat on stone steps
In the harbour
Not fully grown
Though it seems like yesterday
In the beginning there was hope
And all the world was mine
A fluttering palace of flax and rope
And all the world was mine
In the beginning the figurehead spoke
And all the world was mine
A chart with a line scribed bold, unbroken
And all the world was mine
In the beginning you helmed the role
And all the world was mine
In the beginning there was hope
And all the world was my design

I keep his words
And I eat them
When I need them
They fill the space - what a stupid thing to say

All my dreams are loving angels
Coming here in such disguiseEmbed
