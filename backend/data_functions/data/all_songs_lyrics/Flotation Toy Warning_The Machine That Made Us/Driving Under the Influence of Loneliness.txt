Driving Under the Influence of Loneliness LyricsDrive, drive for miles, to a place where you feel safe
Step down from the car, you're leaving, you won't be travelling no more
Take off your hat, put your clothes on the floor beside of that
You're leaving, you won't be needing, to dress for dinner no moreEmbed
