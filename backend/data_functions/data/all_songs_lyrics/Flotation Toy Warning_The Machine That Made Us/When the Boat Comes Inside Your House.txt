When the Boat Comes Inside Your House LyricsIn my mind I was a star
Heaped in praise for my art
But I wasn't, not at all
My mother loved me
But not much more
In my mind I was a star
Heaped in praise for my art
But I wasn't, not at all
My mother loved me
But not much more
I made a mark upon the wall
Just to prove I was that tall
But on the inside
I'm four foot three
Because the wall won't
Won't come with me
As a child I dreamed of travelling to Mars
But getting lonely needn't take you so far from home
Reading kids' encyclopaedias - it's where I stole all of my best ideas
My friend
In my mind I was a star
Heaped in praise for my art
But I wasn't, not at all
My mother loved me
But not much more
There was a man, I read today
Who once claimed he'd saved the day
But when he looked back
It was plain to see - the day was too sad for him to keep
The painful days don't stay here with me
They're just a flash like a drive through museum, my friend
They're tangled days when I think of them
But if you asked I'd do it all again, my friend
They're tangled days when I think of them
But if you asked I'd do it all again, my friendEmbed
