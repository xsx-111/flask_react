King of Foxgloves Lyrics
I came here today to tell you
It's the end of your world as you know it
I will leave here tomorrow alone
I do not need you, anymore

Oh, do not smile at me
I will not fall for such things
I cannot pretend I still love you
Any more than I can pretend I can fly
Now the fears I had have gone
I'll be on my way

Hold me
Fold me
Tell me all you want to do
Touch me
Mould me
I am the only one for you
Twist me
Roll me
You know my love is made for you

That's my glass from which you are drinking
And my bed on which you stubbornly lied
Last night was just a farewell performance
Now we're closing, I'm calling time
Oh, do not smile at me
I will not fall for such things
I cannot pretend I still love you
Nobody sells that kind of disguise
Now the love I had has gone
I'll be on my way

Hold me
Fold me
Tell me all you want to do
Touch me
Mould me
I am the only one for you
Twist me
Roll me
You know my love is made for youEmbed
