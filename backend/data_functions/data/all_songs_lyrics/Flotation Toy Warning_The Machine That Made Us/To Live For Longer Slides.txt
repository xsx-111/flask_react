To Live For Longer Slides LyricsThe art of failure really has no school
There is no handbook on how to be a fool
If it makes any difference to you
I trembled here before you
Always hoped if I listened to you, we’d chase the dark away
I wrote it all in a book of songs
That no one ever sings
I'm sorry I left you nothing more
I was never one for things
Hours
There were hours
So many hours
When I just don’t know where I was
There were better versions of me
I miss them now they’re gone
They had to break
It was my mistake to think they’d always carry on
And when the trembled beast’s upon me
And most of me is gone
I hope you find a way that heals
So you, alone, can carry on
I know it’s raining
But did you have to build an ark?
You go easy now, that’s how religions start
But who will you listen to when the trembled beast comes calling?
Will the ones that I listened to cradle you the same?
I wrote it all in a book of songs
That no one ever sings
I'm sorry I left you nothing more
I was never one for things
Hours
There were hours
So many hours
When I just don’t know where I was
There were better versions of me
I miss them now they’re gone
They had to break
It was my mistake to think they’d always carry on
I stand and point and I distract you
I do it just for fun
But I do the same just to shift the blame
When I can’t control what’s going on
When I get tired a loop within me
Clicks and switches on
And what it says is where I am for days
I see no good in anyone
Can you still see the love that’s hidden
When I slide and cut you down?
'Cause that’s the me I swore I’d never be
The saddest form of hand me down
I try to hide the thirst within me
The damage that it brings
Sometimes I need the way it heals
So I don’t feel a single thing
And when the trembled beast’s upon me
And most of me is gone
I hope you find a way that heals
So you, alone, can carry onEmbed
