Due to Adverse Weather Conditions All of My Heroes Have Surrendered LyricsMake your way to the basement
Say hi to the queen
She's grateful for your sacrifice
But it won't be how it seems
Her love is stashed away in tins
Her teeth are chipped but clean
Since the revolution came
That's just the way it's been
Every day she begs the truth
And every day I lie
On maps I chart where thousands march
Though we number 25
See the trees and see their branches
Burning bright with palace stanchions
I will not tell lies to you
I would love her here today
Sometimes when her eyelids fall
I don't know what to say
The queen is here crowned in complaisance
An empty throne astride
I close my eyes and it's here in me
And ornate frieze and glaze break down
Into my heart
Break down into my heart
And all the freezing days break down into my heart beneath the ground
I conceal you here but you are far from free or safe and sound
All the days break down into my heart
You're hiding nothing here to warm my heart
For I am not the same man now
Who once mistook your mess for a work of art
That only he could read somehow
I feel less lonely when we're apart
But I am not the same man now
Who once mistook your mess for a work of art
That only he could read somehow
Warm and warm and warm my heart
For I am not the same man now
Make your way to the basement
Say hi to the queen
If she feigns an interest
Don't dwell on where she's been
See the trees with blackened branches
Defy the night with palace stanchions
I cannot tell lies to you
I would love her here today
The queen stands brooding in the basement
A hunger in her eyes
The weight of every move she makes
Will help your world capsize
I close my eyes and she's here in me
And ornate frieze and glaze break down
Into my heart
All the missing days break down into my heart beneath the ground
I am concealed in here with you but dare not move or make a sound
All the days break down into my heart
All the days break down into my heart
You're hiding nothing here to warm my heart
For I am not the same man now
Who once mistook your mess for a work of art
That only he could read somehow
I feel less lonely when we're apart
But I am not the same man now
Who once mistook your mess for a work of art
That only he could read somehow
Warm and warm and warm my heart
For I am not the same man now
Summer come and warm my heart
For I am not the same man nowEmbed
