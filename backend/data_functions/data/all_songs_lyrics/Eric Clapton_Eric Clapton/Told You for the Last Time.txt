Told You for the Last Time Lyrics
Well, I've told you for the last time
Told you for the last time
I'm going to turn on my love light
Let it shine one more time
Let it shine, shine, shine for the last time

There's going to be a big change made, and I'm going to make it
This time I'm going to lay it on the line
I got a lot to give when you're woman enough to take it, oh yeah


I sure want to love you baby, baby if you'd only let me
You only pick me up just to put me down
I finally let my mind make a decision, oh yeah
I'm got to start my wheels spinning
Let them turn one more time
Let them turn, oh yeah, for the last time
