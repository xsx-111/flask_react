Blues Power Lyrics
Bet you didn't think I knew how to rock and roll
Oh, I got the boogie-woogie right down in my very soul
There's no need for me to be a wallflower
Because now I'm living on blues power

I knew all the time but now I'm going to let you know
I'm going to keep on rocking, no matter if it's fast or slow
I'm not going to stop until the twenty-fifth hour
Because now I'm living on blues power


Talking to you, now, the boogie's going to pull me through
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah, keep on
Keeping it on, keep on, keep on
Keeping it on, keep on, keeping it onEmbed
