Let It Rain Lyrics
The rain is falling through the mist
Of sorrow that surrounded me
The sun could never thaw away
The bliss that lays around me

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Her life was like a desert flower
Burning in the sun
Until I found the way to love
It's harder said than done

Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain

Now I know the secret
There is nothing that I lack
If I give my love to you
You'll surely give it back
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Let it rain, let it rain
Let your love rain down on me
Let it rain, let it rain
Let it rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain
Rain, rain, rain, rainEmbed
