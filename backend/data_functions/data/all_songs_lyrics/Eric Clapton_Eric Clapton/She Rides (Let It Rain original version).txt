She Rides (Let It Rain original version) LyricsPretty as a rainy day
Never stop thinking about her
She laughs at everything I say
But I couldnâ€™t live a day without her
And she rides
And she rides
And she rides like a real beginner
And she rides
And she rides
And she ri-id-es
The pleasure and the pain we share
Only makes my love grow stronger
I take her with me everywhere
I love her for my life and longer
And she rides
And she rides
And she rides like a real beginner
And she rides
And she rides
And she ri-id-es
Showed me how to see with my heart
What is invisible to my eyes
You think that you could tear us apart
And you tried to take the stars from the sky
And she rides
And she rides
And she rides like a real beginner
And she rides
And she rides
And she ri-id-es
And she rides
And she rides
And she rides like a real beginner
And she rides
And she rides
And she ri-id-esEmbed
