Lonesome and a Long Way from Home Lyrics
Out on an open highway
Such a lovely day but something's wrong
Something, something's got to be wrong, oh oh
(Something surely wrong)
I just left home this morning
This old road keeps rolling on and on
Rollind, rolling on and on
(Rolling, rolling on and on)

Won't somebody help me?
(Somebody help me)
Somebody help me
(Somebody help me)
Somebody help me
(Somebody help me)

I've never been so lonesome and a long way from home
(Never been so lonesome)
Never been lonesome an' a long way
(Never been so lonesome)
(Never been so lonesome)
I've never been lonesome an' a long way from home
(Never been so lonely)
(Never been so lonesome)
(Never been so lonely)
Yeah, something's wrong
Something, something's surely wrong
Rolling on and on
Rolling, rolling on and on



(Never never never)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonely
(I've never been so lonely)
Never been so lonesome
Never been so lonelyEmbed
