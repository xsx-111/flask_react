I Miss My Baby Lyrics
I miss my baby
I miss my baby

Take a mournful light, no one to love and a broken heart
Seems like the whole world has got me down, I'm falling a part
I could find a thousand places to go
But everybody is gone, oh baby
My pockets full of telephone numbers and no telephone home

Oh, it's been this way (Been this way)
Since you been gone away, Lord (Gone away)
No it's (No it's), no way (No way)
And know baby
I miss my baby
I miss my baby

If you see her, you can't miss her
She's got everything, yes, you do now
Love was tough, thinkin' how we gave up
But what mother nature brings, yes, she do
A heart pure as gold to match your eyes that shines like fire, ah baby
She makes, she make the lover
She's my heart's desire, yes, you are
Oh, it's been this way (Been this way)
Since you been gone away (Gone away)
No, no, it's (No it's), no way (No way)
And know baby
Lord knows I miss my baby (Oh yeah)
I miss my baby (Help me somebody)


Oh, it's been this way (Been this way)
Since my love's been gone away (Gone away)
No it's (No it's), no, no way (No way)
And know baby (Baby)
That I miss my baby (Oh yeah)
I miss my baby (Help me somebody)
(I miss my baby)Embed
