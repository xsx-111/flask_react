Whole Lot of BS Lyrics
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 

Clap for me, polyunsaturated
M.F.P. 
It turns you on in twelve ways
None can set you free

It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 

Cyclamates, formaldehyde
Vitamin D.D.T. 
One swipe, a clean wipe
None can set you free

It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
Phosphates, enzymes
All the while, they're eating it
Brush your teeth with rat poison
Clean your mind with Cheer

It's a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 

Phosphates, enzymes
I'm the one that is
Brush your teeth with rat poison
Clean your mind with Cheer
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. 
It's just a lot of B.S. 
A whole lot of B.S. Embed
