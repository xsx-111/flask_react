Back in Our Minds Lyrics
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again

We don't fight no more
We done closed that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
When we're supposed to be brothers
Livin' in this world we all live in

We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again
We are back in our minds again

We don't fight no more
We done closed that door
This time for sure
We can't stand no more
Fussin' and a-cussin' each other
We're supposed to be brothers
Livin' in this world we all live in
Back in our minds againEmbed
