Luna LyricsTricked into some fodder about this oasis
This conversation of new beginning
Having enlightening talks over common interests
Chained together to push onto the celebrated platform
Chained together or chained forever
Chained together to push onto the celebrated platform tonight
I've boarded myself inside
I've refused to exit
There is no ocean for me
There is no glamour
Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt
I gaze at it from the oven of my home
I've boarded myself inside
I've refused to exit
There is no ocean for me
There is no glamour
Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt
Only the mirage of water ascending from the asphalt
I gaze at it from the oven of my home
Confined to a house that never remains clean
To a bed where the ill never get well
I cough ceaselessly into the night
The remainder of my humanity is drifting spit through the cold
Sitting quietly in scorching
Reimagined suburbia
Suburbia
Sitting quietly in scorching
Reimagined suburbia
Suburbia
Sitting quietly in scorching
Reimagined suburbia
Suburbia
Suburbia
Reimagined suburbia6Embed
