Baby Blue LyricsI woke in a sweat from a desirous fever
In the pocket of yesteryear where faults have fallen to some
I begged not to carry the corpse
To not be a queer fish in unforgiving hearts
Unforgiving you
To not be buried in native clay and preserved for cynicism
I wish to be a pauper in kind eyes
To feel the gravel beneath my knees
To wake in a home
To feel the gravel beneath my knees
God had sent me into
Space where I could not escape
God had sent my calamity into
A deep space from which not even in dreams
Could I ever imagine my escape
