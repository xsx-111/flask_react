Gifts for the Earth LyricsI imagine the gracious
Benevolent, rich ritual of Death
Grave and porcelain
With baby blue lips and pale pink eyes
Descending toward me
The gracious ritual
Grave and porcelain
Descending toward me
Her glowing hands cradled
At my head and knees
Submerging me into waves of icy seas
I imagine
I imagine the end
I imagine
I imagine the end
I imagine the gracious
Benevolent, rich ritual of Death
Grave and porcelain
With baby blue lips and pale pink eyes
Descending
Her glowing hands cradled
At my head and knees
Submerging me into waves of icy seas
I imagine
I imagine the end
I imagine
I imagine the end
In the dark
Further downward so that I can rest
Cocooned by the heat of the ocean floor
In the dark
Ocean floor
In the dark
My flesh to disintegrate into consumption
My flesh to disintegrate into consumption
For the earth
For the earth
For the earth
For the earth3Embed
