Brought to the Water LyricsWhere has my passion gone?
Has it been carried off
By some lonely driver in a line of fluorescent light?
Has it been blurred together
In ribboned patterns on the night?
Lines of a red light
Blurred together in ribboned patterns
Lines of a red light
Blurred together in ribboned patterns
No!
Light, light
Along the stretch of some unnamed plane
We began again
I saw in your face that
Weâ€™re the same when we began again
Along the stretch of some unnamed plane
I saw in your face
When we began again
A multiverse of fuchsia and violet
A multiverse of fuchsia and violet
Surrenders to blackness
Surrenders to blackness
My world closes its eyes to
Sex and laughter
My world closes its eyes to
Sex and laughter
My world closes its eyes to
Sex and laughter
My world closes its eyes to
Sex and laughter8Embed
