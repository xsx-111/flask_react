Back Then Lyrics
Remember when they didn’t know of me
Now these niggas want to roll with me
Give me some and all the benefits
Won’t stop until a nigga rich
Remember when they didn’t know of me
Now these niggas want to roll with me
Give me some and all the benefits
Won’t stop until a nigga rich

Yup that’s me
Yup I’m him
Remember when a nigga was like 5’3
Now a couple inches more than 5’10
Catch me the Uber in the backseat
Like it was like way way back then
Your boy can’t even get some groceries
Niggas like, “Hey hey that’s him”
Killing it since like ’95
Remember when I had a 9-5
Now they freak out from a high five
Got my feet out when I drive by
I mean got my threes out when I drive by
Had my feet up now it’s my time
I mean, got my cheese up now it’s my time
Got my green up now it’s my time
Remember when they didn’t know of me
Now these niggas want to roll with me
Give me some and all the benefits
Won’t stop until a nigga rich
Remember when they didn’t know of me
Now these niggas want to roll with me
Give me some and all the benefits
Won’t stop until a nigga rich

Big head, ego needs to be deflated
Nine times out of ten I’m inebriated
But ya’ll know been known that, why did I even state it?
The way we carry ourselves you think we made it
Had to switch the sound on you fool
But we still haven’t track 14 on The Cool
Don’t understand most of ya’ll logic these days
Just playing yourself like Louis C.K
Like my belt is Louis but my boxers C.K
But my rents been overdue for like three days
If I say it I’m going to do it
Ya’ll suckers ain’t never showing up so truant
I don’t speak bullshit but ya’ll so fluent
I’m no role model don’t follow my influence
Best believe they hype and buy into this
Las Fuegas is the fam can’t buy into this
Remember when they didn’t know of me
Now these niggas want to roll with me
Give me some and all the benefits
Won’t stop until a nigga rich
Remember when they didn’t know of me
Now these niggas want to roll with me
Give me some and all the benefits
Won’t stop until a nigga rich

Back then, back then
Back then, back then
Back then, back then, Back then, back then
Back then, back then
Back thenEmbed
