Girl with the Gold Wrist Lyrics
Come on, get going with your bad self
Ain’t no money too long for your bad self
I’ve been waiting too long for your bad self
Come and get, next song with your bad self
Come on, get going with your bad self
Ain’t no money too long for your bad self
I’ve been waiting too long for your bad self
Come and get, next song with your bad self

Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist

Damn, what you doing?
I’ve been floating, I’ve been coasting, I’ve been moving
I’ve been thinking like damn what you doing?
No for real like later what you doing?
Go ahead and get jiggy if you want to
You can go ahead and spend fifty if you want to
I ain’t ever spent fifty but I want to
But I had the city like wow with the whole crew
And I’m draped in A.A. but that’s old news
Had these niggas like, “Hey look at those shoes”
Got these niggas like, “Ritchie what you going to do?”
But you know I’m going to floss like I’m suppose to
But she hopped out the car, and it’s a Rolls too
And she had the sugar daddy, what a cold dude
Had the long fingernail with the gold tooth
Now I'm thinking like “Damn, Ritchie what you going to do?”
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist

She about to have a good time at this party
She ain’t hurting nobody but her body
Girl don’t do drugs, unless it's with me
Now its kicked in your heart feels like a stampede
Got Dee in the cut he’s sipping that MD
She say we the best, yes indeed
Got your nose on the drip but your wrist on bling
Numb to the world and you can’t feel a thing
I know you quit for a minute now you back at it
Got you out here moving like a crack addict
I ain’t mad though we all got our bad habits
You got a big ass I love to look back at it
You a smooth criminal with your bad self
Partied so hard I ain’t mad at your bad health
Ya, dirty dancing by your bad self
Think I’ll help baby in the corner with my dad self
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist

Come on, get going with your bad self
Ain’t no money too long for your bad self
I’ve been waiting too long for your bad self
Come and get, next song with your bad self
Come on, get going with your bad self
Ain’t no money too long for your bad self
I’ve been waiting too long for your bad self
Come and get, next song with your bad self

Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
Girl with the gold wrist
