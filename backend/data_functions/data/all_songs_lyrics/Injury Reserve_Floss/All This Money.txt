All This Money Lyrics
I said, make them say

Oh my god! (Hey!)
I ain't done shit, all my life (Hey!)
I'm about to spend four, 'bout five (Hey!)
I'm about to spend all this money
Oh my god! (Hey!)
I ain't done shit, all my life (Hey!)
I'm about to spend four, 'bout five (Hey!)
I'm about to spend all this money

Yeah, I'm about to break a whole check, yeah
In my 'Melo jersey, no gold, no beck, yeah
I ain't got much but I'll make a nigga fresh, yeah
We the indie Puffy spend the budget on the set, yeah
Yeah, spend it all on the video, riding in the slingshot
Downtown pretty though, tell me when to go
Just bumpin' on the radio
Tell me when you're going to the mall
I'm trying to spend it, bro

Yeah, guess they right
Never should've gave niggas money
Got fat 'cause there used to be nothing in my tummy
Got my foot up in the door and all my niggas coming
And Parker so smart that he got y'all all dummy
Was pretty bad before, now I'm just reckless
Apple Ciroc for dinner, lunch and breakfast
You know how it goes, if you got it, better spend it
And if you ain't got it, I suggest you go and get it
Oh my god! (Hey!)
I ain't done shit, all my life (Hey!)
I'm about to spend four, 'bout five (Hey!)
I'm about to spend all this money
Oh my god! (Hey!)
I ain't done shit, all my life (Hey!)
I'm about to spend four, 'bout five (Hey!)
I'm about to spend all this money

Yeah, pretty motherfucker, better go and smile for the camera
Might stash a little, I ain't going out like Hammer
Can't spare to save my life but getting money from my Grandma
The boy so charming, I get it from my grammar
Now I ain't got a lot, but it's more than a little bit
Same old Groggs, I ain't out here getting ignorant
But I'd be lying though if I said I'm not belligerent
I guess that's just the life when you're out here killing shit

Yeah, yeah, I'm out here killing shit, massacre, killing shit
Maybe not a little bit, okay, not even a little bit
You get it? Yeah? A little bit, okay, I'm sounding ignorant
Spent my last 50 cents out my fucking piggy bank
They ain't got no veggies shit on the dollar menu man
Now a nigga hungry but my 'fit is on Pootie Tang
Yep, unruly man, 'fit is on Pootie Tang
Graduated from Cooley man nigga gone do his thing
(I'm nice as fuck!)
Oh my god! (Hey!)
I ain't done shit, all my life (Hey!)
I'm about to spend four, 'bout five (Hey!)
I'm about to spend all this money
Oh my god! (Hey!)
I ain't done shit, all my life (Hey!)
I'm about to spend four, 'bout five (Hey!)
I'm about to spend all this money

Ay man, let me tell you something man
I don't care if you only got
$27 dollars in your paycheck
Go ahead, take your ass to H&M or Zara
Or something get you a couple of shirts
Just don't get one of them motherfuckers
With the zippers on the side
I don't even know who's idea it was to put a zipper on the side
Like what... what you 'gon?
I don't even know what the fuck I'm saying4Embed
