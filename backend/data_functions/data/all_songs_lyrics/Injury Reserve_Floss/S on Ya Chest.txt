S on Ya Chest Lyrics
Yeah, Vic said he want that blue collar rap
Man how I’m suppose to bring blue collar back
I guess Groggs is Phonte, and I am early Ye
'Cause I ain’t Big Pooh man that nigga kinda lame, yo
Had that nappy headed nigga on they payroll
Had a S on his chest since the Muppets
I can’t wait until I can get to stunting
Get a Tesla and take it to West Coast Customs, it’s nothing
Me and my niggas get it jumping
They askin for a brotha at the door like Lauren London, in Frontin’
We been on, we been on something
They just hella mad 'cause the kid been buzzing
What you know about a young nigga like this
What you know about a young neighbor like this
I did the second one for the white kids
'Cause I know you wanna say it, but that ain’t right kid
This that Aquemini plus a Pisces
This that fuck you come and fight me
To your boss 'cause he just thinks you’re a nice kid
And could care less if your future was the brightest

Ya what you know about a young nigga like this
What you know about a young neighbor like this
I did the second one for the white kids
'Cause I know you want to say it, but that ain’t right kid
What you know about a young nigga like this
What you know about a young neighbor like this
I did the second one for the white kids
'Cause I know you want to say it, but that ain’t right kid
Ya, with a S on my chest, yo
Ya I’m the best I’m the best
I’ve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If you’re going and going going
No test for rest, ya
Ya, and they like how I roll
Remember when a nigga was 5’9 with corn rolls
Now I need mink suits for the whole show
We need Groggs in all pink or all gold
Yah it’s time to floss
All these other dudes they ain’t down at all
Ever since a Motorola, I’ve been down to ball
I’ve been, I’ve been going no time to fall, I said
Ya, with a s on my chest, yo
Ya I’m the best I’m the best
I’ve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If you’re going and going going
No test for the rest, ya

Ready to tour the world I’m done with this local shit
If you got crazy bars then we the loco-est
Stay with an A’s fitted like Coco Crisp
Ya I’m athletic even though I’m kind of husky
I got that bay game I still pull the girlies trust me
Fuck you, I’m a lady killer
Word to Green, Al or CeeLo
I’m just a common man out here trying to do it for the people
Looking at these rappers I don’t see too many equals
Stay drinking liquor 'cause it got me feeling good
Even though this nine-to-five got me mad stressed
Got me smoking more blacks than the hood
But really it’s nothing to me
No time for losses, all we do is see W’s, you like ‘What’s a W, B?”
Since we’re talking about Dubs we’re the best in the west
Here to save the game with this S on my chest
Ya, with a s on my chest, yo
Ya I'm the best I'm the best
I’ve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If you’re going and going going
No test for rest, ya
Ya, and they like how I roll
Remember when a nigga was 5’9 with corn rolls
Now I need mink suits for the whole show
We need Groggs in all pink or all gold
Yah it’s time to floss
All these other dudes they ain’t down at all
Ever since a Motorola, I’ve been down to ball
I’ve been, I’ve been going no time to fall, I said
Ya, with a s on my chest, yo
Ya I’m the best I’m the best
I’ve been going and going going
No rest for the best
If you’re going and going going
No test for the rest, ya

Remember mama said you need to go ahead
And say it with a yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I need a vest just in case the pigs sprayin' at it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit we all need a vest just in case they sprayin' at it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But real niggas multiply, yup that’s the sayin, ain’t it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Riding around and the windows tinted
Yeah we’re breaking necks in the whip we spinnin'
Shit I’d break a neck in a Honda Civic
I be breaking necks dancing on Thanksgiving
This one makes me wish I never cut it (Hey)
Had the naturals like my dad I’m stunting
In the backseat swang-
Remember mama said you need to go ahead
And say it with a yeah, yeah, yeah
Now I need a vest just in case the pigs spraying at it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit we all need a vest just in case they spraying at it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But real niggas multiply, yup that’s the saying ain’t it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Riding around and the windows tinted
Yeah we’re breaking necks in the whip we spinning
Shit I’d break a neck in a Honda Civic
I be breaking necks dancing on Thanksgiving
This one makes me wish I never cut it
Had the naturals like my dad I’m stuntin'
In the backseat swinging banging jumping
And the white girls like “Can I touch it?”5Embed
