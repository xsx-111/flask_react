Damn, oh shit, yeah
Ain’t nobody really fuck with your shit, yeah
You ain’t really, really made no hits, yeah
Me? Shit, I made “Oh Shit!!!,” yeah
They created your ass with a plan, bro
From clothes to the pics to the fans, yo
See they love what you make, not what you stand for
Got they black Pinocchio with the round nose
Post him up in the mall for a fucking photo
Don’t let him team up, make that nigga solo
Ask the the hood what they think: “Man, that nigga so-so”
We don’t care who your daddy, like that nigga JoJo
They going to do what it take to make some fucking mo' dough
New trends, new ends, revenue get slo-mo
Ain’t nobody really care about that nigga no more
Let him go, drop him off, make that nigga go

Ah! We made it
Ah! Ah! Ah! We made it

So you want to be a rap star?
You think lyrics and dope beats will really get you that far?
Shit, I wish that’s all that it took
It’s way more than a catchy ass hook
Don’t know the right people, you ain’t getting no looks
If it was that easy, we’d be getting more looks
Then you got these dudes that thinking they Rambo
But truthful ya’ll just looking like sambo’s
Would you dance for a dollar? “Yeah, yeah, yeah”
Might as well be a stripper then, uh
Sell your soul for a buck? “Yeah, yeah, yeah”
Well, damn, go get it then
Man, this music shit so demandin'
Not even on and lost so many damn friends
All this lack of sleep and hella planning
If you think you got what it takes, then put your hands in like
Eeny meeny miney moe, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch a rapper at his show, yeah, yeah, yeah
Couple dollars let him blow, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who’s up next? I don’t know, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eeny meeny miney moe, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch a rapper at his show, yeah, yeah, yeah
Couple dollars let him blow, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who’s up next? I don’t know, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eeny meeny miney moe, yeah, yeah, yeah
Catch a rapper at his show, yeah, yeah, yeah
Couple dollars let him blow, yeah, yeah, yeah
Who’s up next? I don’t know, yeah, yeah, yeah
Eeny meeny miney moe, yeah, yeah, yeah
