All Quiet on the West Side Lyrics
West side, west side
East side, east side
Left right, left right
Let everybody know we getting down tonight
We getting down tonight
We getting down tonight
Let everybody know we getting down tonight

Yo check it, let everybody know
We need niggas from all sides on go
Someone hit the eses on the west coast
And the niggas from the south the be tipping on 44’s
They be singing Friday on a Friday
But please don’t play my song nigga this ain’t my day
We can have a party and do it five ways
We can put the PA by the fireplace
Ask your boy if he wants to DJ
I’m trying to hear some “Hey Ya,” Andre 3k
I’m trying to hear some Estelle, “American Boy”
The neighbors better not complain about no damn noise
And if the cops come scream “Fuck five-o”
Okay one more time nigga “Fuck five-o”
Just make sure nobody opens the front door
I don’t care if they put the lights through the window
We ain’t coming together for no answers
The only thing we agree on is fuck cancer
Someone play that Thugger, that “Fuck Cancer”
Shout out to my mom, nigga, fuck cancer
And to the white kids: please don’t say it
And my nigga with the strap: please don’t spray it
Matter a fact, nigga please don’t bring it
And if you know the words nigga please go sing it
West side, west side
East side, east side
West side, west side
East side, east side
West side, west side
East side, east side
Left right, left right
Let everybody know we getting down tonight3Embed
