Stay Lyrics
Stay and help me to end the day
And if you don’t mind
We’ll break a bottle of wine
Stick around and maybe we’ll put one down
'Cause I wanna find what lies behind those eyes

Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

I rise, looking through my morning eyes
Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain and try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you good-bye

Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue
Turned to gray

Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold5Embed
