Intro (Stress (The Extinction Agenda)) Lyrics
"So confused, I'm so confused"
"So confused, I'm so confused"
"So confused, I'm so confused"
"So confused, I'm so confused"
"So confused, I'm so confused"
"So confused, I'm so confused"
"So confused, I'm so confused"

I'm so confused! I don't know what to do
I think I'm going insane! My brain
Is on the brink of destruction, I’m looking for some 
Victims to stick 'em up and shake 'em down
If my friends could see me now—they’d wonder “Why? What? Who?"
—and "How?” I’m living underneath, amongst the homeless;
The outcast bastards of the barren wasteland (Wasteland)
For days and days, I fast, fighting
Over scraps and rats, trapped in a society
Of the living dead (For ten—)

The tiger inside of me screams (Ahhhhh!)
My claws touchin' the mic for keeps, st-ress!
Keeping me up when the shitty city sleeps—a Southsider
Quick to peep undercovers in Chevrolet high-beams
Duo-teams love harassin' Po in the streets, I'm for forty
PJs, New York—no pork—uh-uh, freaks in New Orleans
See me get bagged by some ol' Uncle Tom-DT
In Louisiana streets, disrespecting my origin (Ohhhhahhh!)
Now, it’s my turn (I'm so confused!), I'm—coming
—back, so, fuck you!
Fuck you racist cabs, store-owners, waitresses, construction-workers (All of you)
Southern police-phonies, secret agents, racist bus-drivers
I’m driving and I’m striving—Huh!
And Organized is on again!
