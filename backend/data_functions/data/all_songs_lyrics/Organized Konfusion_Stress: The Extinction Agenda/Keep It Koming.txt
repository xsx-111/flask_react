Keep It Koming LyricsSpark that L!

We keep it coming
We keep it coming, huh
We keep it coming (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming, uhh
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming
We keep it coming
We keep it coming, huh
We keep it coming (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming (come on)

I be flipping the scripts, ripping through hoods coming equipped
Lifts out of my lyrics, sippin' forties in a whip
Organized, rise, raise up the level, surprise!
Niggas watch Prince, open your eyes when I deliver
Give a honey dip a wink, thick chocolate bitch
Switch up the pace, kick me the digits later you can taste
The bass thumps for months, entrapped in the lab
With mad blunts, creating formulas that you can grab
I escape the clutches of wackness, I'm like a mattress
Lay it down for the South Side, Sounds of Blackness
Uh, ohhh, I keep it coming stunning, you're running
Through states to make pace
Gunning you down with the drumming that rakes
In the dough, oh, my God, times are hard so I gotta flow
Spark up the L, I excel over the stress
Crushing the competition that I stomp from East to West
Rest assured we will deliver the goods to the hoods
For the youth, this is proof we should
Well... organize, got the bomb hard to stay calm
Forming like Voltron and then attacking at dawn
We keep it coming
We keep it coming, here it comes
We keep it coming, here it comes (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming, here it comes
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming
We keep it coming, huh
We keep it coming, here it comes
We keep it coming, here it comes (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming, here it comes
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming

When I'm fed up, I hold my head instead of me teasing
Yo ooh ooh child, things are gonna get easier
In my mind and in my soul
I can take control of a beat whenever I roll
Stroll up the block, 40-dog cocked back
In my knapsack is a Uzi-wop, black what's up!
Spreading like malaria, but much scarier
Migrating in the whole tri-state area
Without a doubt, my niggas never go out
They rock, braids and fades and baldies
And blow up and blew out throughout
The entire night I'm peepin' you and
Your entire crew out (what's that all about?!)
I suppose I be steppin' to hoes when I'm masking overconfidence
'Cause I know my new shit is gonna go platinum, I'm after them
Light skin ones inside of a Maxima on a passenger side
This is what I'm asking her
Hey baby, you look so good
Why you driving through our neighborhood?
If raps I wrote were cookies, I bet you'd bite a chip
Rookie fetch a product, 'cause it took a long time to ignite
A fucking style from the end, back to the beginning
Niggas is winning, Prince, niggas is winning
Keep the fat drumming running up your back
Black, with stacks of facts for the tracks
That you can react to
We keep it coming
We keep it coming, here it comes
We keep it coming, here it comes (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming, here it comes
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming

We be the bread and butter making breaking crown facts around
Back cracking gunner sound heart starts to stutter
When the bass pounds butter... like this
Rumbling CD crispy, no hiss

Rush you like Russell, make you flip like Nipsey
Wilson, make it to Poughkeepsie with maybe one
Organized take the favor, rated is my tip
To keep my peers motivated with funk, only we rip, see?
For years tears shed it but never let it
Mislead a nigga figure that I'd be runnin' dogs, you know

We keep it coming
We keep it coming
We keep it coming (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming
We keep it coming
We keep it coming
We keep it coming (Spark that L!)
We keep it coming
And when it's time to Organize
We stick together through the times
With the attitude like Miles
We keep it coming, nigga
Yeah, uhh
Check it out
Extreme phat, with the Pharoahe Monch cheeba cheeba
Mr. Prince Po will flow...1Embed
