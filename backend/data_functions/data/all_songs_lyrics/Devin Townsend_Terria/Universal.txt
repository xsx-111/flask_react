Universal LyricsI know all that I know
STEP INTO THE UNIVERSAL GROOVE
And I owe all that I owe
TENDING TO THE UNIVERSAL YOU
How am I ever supposed to carry on?
Oh yeah!
I know all that I know
STEP INTO THE UNIVERSAL GROOVE
And I owe all that I owe
TENDING TO THE UNIVERSAL...
How am I ever supposed to carry on?
So come on, let me hear you say "Hey!"
So come on, let me hear you say "Surrah!"
So come on, let me hear you say "Waste!"
So come on, let me show you that's all the motherf*ck that I know!
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back home...
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back home...
WOAH! WOAH!
WOAH! WOAH!
WOAH! WOAH!
WOAH! WOAH!
So come on, let me hear you say "Hey!"
So come on, let me hear you say "Surrah!"
So come on, let me hear you say "Waste!"
So come on, let me show you that's all the motherf*ck that I know!
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back home...
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back home...
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back (the Universe)
Find our way back home...Embed
