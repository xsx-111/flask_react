Deep Peace LyricsIt's alright to cry
It's alright to lean on everyone
It's alright to lie in the bed you've made for everyone
If you ever need someone
If you ever heed someone
If you ever need me, babe, I will be there
It's alright to die
It's alright to bleed on everyone
It's alright this time
It's all life, you learn from everyone
With every single time you go
And every single line you blow
Anytime you need me man, I won't be there

It's all going away now
All going away now
Going, going, gone
Going, going, gone
It's alright to cry
It's alright to feed on everyone
It's alright to hide
In your cozy bed from everyone
So if you ever need it man
Get inside and be it man
Anytime you call
Call
