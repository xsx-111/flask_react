Mountain LyricsNerves on fire, nothing is a sneaker...Everything is catastrophe
That bump in your armpit is Cancer
That bump was turbulence
I guess it starts again
There is no reason for nostalgia
Everything is still happening
There is no reason for memory
The step, a choice
I wish everything could have worked out the way you wanted it to
It's so tragic...so beautiful...
When everything is so hollow
Think of going home
You are so beautiful to me
You are so beautiful to me
So far, I've logged so many hours
With medications and the dog
...You are so beautiful to me
So far, I've lost so many hours
...Two medications and a dog
IT'S JUST ANOTHER MOUNTAIN!
...JUST ANOTHER MOUNTAIN!
...just another weaknessEmbed
