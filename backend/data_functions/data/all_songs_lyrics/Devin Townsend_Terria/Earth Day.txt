Earth Day LyricsEat your beets
Recycle, recycle
Don't eat your beets
Recycle, recycle
Babe, you better not ever think
Straight into the drink
Get out of my mind
Cause I may not be the one to say
'Is there no other way we could do this another day?'
I saw God
She said 'If you don't believe me, guaranteed you'll never leave me'
On my way and out of your time
But I didn't even know if it was true or just a result of chemicals
Shut up and think of something more important to say
Sometimes I think that in every straight there's a gay
Something or nothing a whole either way it's a way
It's a way, It's a way, it's a way, it's a way
It's a way, It's a way, It's a way, It's a way
Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day
It's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way
Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day
It's a way, It's a way, It's a way, It's a way
It's your birthday
It's on Earth Day
Like a child you're born again
Little child you're bored again
It's your worst fucking day
It's on Earth Day
Little lies to cover up
Please make your mind up
Eat your beets
Recycle, recycle
Don't eat your beets
Recycle, recycle
(Man overboard) I'm so far away
(Man overboard) But fuck it
I really don't care
Fuck
Listen to me
Just shut the fuck up
Peace, love, joy
Hate, hell, war
Peace, love, joy
Hate, hell, war
Hate, love, love
Love, hate, love
Hate, destruction
If you don't believe me, guaranteed you'll never leave me
On my way and out of you
So just shut your face and take a seat
Cause after all, you're just talking meat
And music?
Well, it's just entertainment folks
Sometimes I think that I really have something more to say
Sometimes I think that in every straight there's a gay
Forgive me for saying it blows either way, it's a way
It's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way
Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day
It's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way
Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day, Earth Day
It's a way, it's a way, it's a way, it's a way
It's your birthday
It's on Earth Day
Like a child you're born again
Little child you're cold again
It's your worst fucking day
It's on Earth Day
Little child your time is up
Please turn the heat up
You need your beets
You recycle, recycle
Don't eat your beets
Recycle, recycle
Don't eat your beets
You recycle, recycle
Man overboard
Man overboard
Man overboard1Embed
