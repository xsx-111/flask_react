The Fluke LyricsI am a Fluke in the world
I haven't spoken a single word
I'll have to wade through the bullshit
Baby just to find my own vision of pearl
I am a fluke in your world
And even though it's a bit absurd
I've been living in a dreamworld man
And I hope you'll enjoy what I've heard
Can't you see through me?
Can't you hear through me?
Just a moment in time...
FREAK!!! ...FLUKE!!!
....writing and eating and shitting and sleeping in rain or in shine masturbate till i'm blind in the cause and effect of the one troubled segment of time and the place and the look on your face and I write and I eat and I shit and I sleep yes I eat leafy greens nearly three times a week and I'm not unafraid but no longer afraid of you anymore....
Down and under I've felt the toll
You can't hurt me any more
I'm not afraid of you anymore!
Can't you see through me?
Can't you hear through me?
