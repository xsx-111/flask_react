Stagnant LyricsSummer's here, the sunlight greets the day
The winters gone, there's no more rain today...
And if I could, I'm sure that I would take your pain away
So ain't it funny how, after trying to find my way home
I'm in the middle now and I won't get lost again
Cause in the winter time, when everything is grey
And in the summer time, into the month of May
I get a feeling that it's all so temporary
And that's the feeling that can take my blues away
Tired of the way that I'm feeling everyday
And I feel it in my head...woo-hoo-hoo...
Tired of the way that I'm feeling everyday
And I feel it in my head now, my head now
It's beautiful, the way it's meant to be... beautiful, but it 'don't do shit' for me...
So peel away a little skin and choke upon the bone
And ain't it funny how, after trying to find my way home
I'm in the middle now, and I won't get lost again
But you don't know, how or when it's gonna go
You don't knowEmbed
