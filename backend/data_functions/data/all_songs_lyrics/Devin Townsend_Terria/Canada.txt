Canada LyricsThe road
It's home
At least for now, the river's low
Wake me, please wake me
It's cold and warm on the prairie freeway
All the time I needed your approval to be me
All that time spent waiting for the jury duty...
More than ever I needed Mora
More than Mora means...
Be whatever you must be to get by
(Get by, get by, get by, get by) It's oil, It's wheat, It's soil, It's meat
It's beef!
The road, it's home, the mountain high, river low...
Wake me, please wake me
When it's my turn to drive
Only the lonely (and maybe John Denver) know the Canadian freewayEmbed
