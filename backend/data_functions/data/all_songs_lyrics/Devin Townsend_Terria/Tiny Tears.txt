Tiny Tears LyricsBaby baby, don't you cry
Wipe away that tear from your eye
Sailing on a sea of blue
In my dreams there's a place for me and you
Baby babe don't say a word
In this life you get all that you deserve
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I can't believe I'm just an ordinary guy
When all is said and done
It's all only won by one
And now I'm 29 years old
And I'm a million miles away
Hey babe, don't treat it like it's a fucking luxury
Baby babe don't say a word
In this life you get all that you deserve
I'm sorry that I made you cry
I can't believe I'm just an ordinary guy
I can't believe I made you cry
I can't believe that made you cry
I can't believe this makes you cry
I see you
I need you
I leave you behind
I've learned my lesson
O.K I'm bored nowEmbed
