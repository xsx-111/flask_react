Senseless Lyrics
I watched the words drip from you
And pour from your mouth like a sieve
I'll end like I did begin
Jump rope the stars in a game

But you were there too, we spit from the Moon
And found their heads down below
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all

Sad inconsistencies you see
You find yourself lonely but right next to me

Well, I was there too just as lonely as you
We found their heads down below
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of it at all

So what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do, what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do, what's this young man to do?
And when the summer ends, yeah, I'll be there hidin'
And when the sun rises, yeah, I'll stay warm forever

Many have come before, many have been
Where will we be, when will it end?
Many have come before, many have been
Where will we be?


You were there too, we spit from the Moon
And found their heads down below
I can't make no sense of this
I can't make no sense of this at all

So, what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do, what's this young man to do?
What's this young man to do, what's this young man to do?

And when the summer ends, yeah, I'll be there hidin'
And when the sun rises, yeah, I'll stay warm forever
And when the summer ends, yeah, I'll be there hidin'
And when the sun rises, yeah, I'll stay warm forever
And when the summer ends, yeah, I'll stay warmEmbed
