You Carried Us (Share With Me The Sun) Lyrics
Share with me the sun, you forget sometime it's ours
Can't you see you're not the only one?
The doors all lead outside feel it soak into your mind
Can't you see you're not the only one?
As you slipped on down the length of my tongue
Did you taste the salt that I become?

You carried us all down from the stars
And up from the sea, where everybody knew
All you see and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind

Share with me the sun, we'll forget all that is ours
You forget me and all the things that you see
The times already came with the news
It was the word that took your brain

You carried us all down from the stars
And up from the sea, where everybody knew
All you see and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind
There's nothing I can say or do
There is nothing I can say or do
And there's no light for me to see
And there is no light for me to see
So there was nothing left of you

You, you carried us all down from the stars
And up from the sea, and we all knew you

You carried us all down from the stars
And up from the sea, where everybody knew
All you see and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind, and we all knew you
All you see and all you hear is all you need
And all you be is what you create
And it's in your mind

There's nothing I can say or do
There is nothing I can say or do
And there's no light for me to see
And there is no light for me to see
So there was nothing left of you
There was nothing left of you2Embed
