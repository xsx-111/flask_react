Everything You See (Kids Count Hallelujahs) Lyrics
Everything you see
Everything you see
Can be measured, weighed, or gauged
Like the ones who will keep you company
(All of the things that you'll ever be)
(All of the things that you'll ever be)

When all the kids count hallelujahs
We're seven miles high climbin' up laser beams
Like the electric seams
All the kids are the rubber souls
The kids are just fine, kids are just fine
Kids are just fine

There's nothing you can do
Nothing to know that you always knew
So we'll all live on, and just celebrate the end
With all of the things that have come to pass
(All of the things that have come to pass)
(All of the things that have come to pass)

When all the kids count hallelujahs
We're seven miles high climbin' up laser beams
Like the electric seams
All the kids are the rubber souls
The kids are just fine, kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
All the castles they command
They'll come sink their teeth in
While the waves are crashing down
We'll just sink our toes in

When all the kids count hallelujahs
We're seven miles high climbin' up laser beams
Like the electric seams
All the kids are the rubber souls
The kids are just fine, kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
The kids are just fine, kids are just fine
Kids are just fine
The kids are just fine, kids are just fine
Kids are just fine1Embed
