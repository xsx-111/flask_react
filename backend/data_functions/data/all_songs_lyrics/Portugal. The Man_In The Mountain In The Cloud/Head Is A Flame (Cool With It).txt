Head Is A Flame (Cool With It) Lyrics
I was born without a name, a soldier for
The streets, they say, "This kid's on a mission
Runnin' high on fame of the guillotine
No roots to find, and no one to miss him"

My head is like a flame

Well, we all get strange and we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older in this day and age
But we deal with it

My heart's shaking with a fire burning deep inside
Still, the politicians, they never listen
But money was a sound I didn't care to hear
Of which the politicians, they only listen

My head was like a flame
And my eyes were red

Well, we all get strange and we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older in this day and age
But we deal with it
My head was like a flame, it was burnin' up
Burnin' up, it was burnin' up
My head was like a flame, it was burnin' up
Burnin' up, it was burnin' up


I became a child of the universe
Reborn into this galactic prism

My head was like a flame
And my eyes, my eyes were red

Well, we all get strange and we know it
But we're cool with it
And we all get a little bit older in this day and age
But we deal with it

My head was like a flame, it was burnin' up
Burnin' up, it was burnin' up
My head was like a flame, it was burnin' up
Burnin' up, it was burnin' up
My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
My head was like a flame
Head was like a flameEmbed
