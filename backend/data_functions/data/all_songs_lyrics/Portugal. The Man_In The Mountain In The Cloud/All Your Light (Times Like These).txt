All Your Light (Times Like These) Lyrics
I'm just a shadow of a bigger man
Glowin' brighter with each year I am
I was standin' on a mountain
Just looking down (On you, on you)
It's like my daddy said
"You gotta use your head
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)"
Yeah, no one said that I aim to please

All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait, though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait, for my time to come
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)

As a boy, I had it figured out
There are things that you can't live without
But money, it's sad but true, would surely top that list
And your rules (Your rules), your rules, well they would not be missed
And I became
Whole again
'Cause no one said, no one said, no one said
There'd be times like these
I said all your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait, though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait, for my time to come

(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
Well, no one said there'd be times like these

I was licking flames when I broke your reins
Still, no one said, no one said, no one said it'd be suicide

All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait, though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait, for my time to come
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
No one said there'd be times like these


All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait, though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait, for my time to come
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
(My body won't work for nobody but me, son)
I won't wait, though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait, for my time to come
All your light can't save me
All your light, all your light can't save me
I won't wait, though my time may come
I can't wait, I can't wait, for my time to come12Embed
