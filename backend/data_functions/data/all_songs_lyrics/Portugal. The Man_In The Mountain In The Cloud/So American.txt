So American Lyrics
If pain was a color to paint on you
Your heart would be the color blue
Be a gradient from there until your body met your hair
Which remained a silver hue
You are the one they call Jesus Christ
Who didn't know no rock n' roll
Just a mission an' a gun to paint rainbows in Vietnam
An' a heart that always told you

There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
So, who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?

They said, every one of you will never try to lend a hand
When the policemen don't understand
Boys, all you boys, you think it's so American
Girls, all you girls, yeah, you're so American

He may not be born of this land
But he was born of this world
He was born of all the mothers an' the colors of our brothers
An' the love that was taught to
You by the one they call Jesus Christ
Who may not know no rock n' roll
An' there may not be a Heaven or a place of which to send you
But you know in the end
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
There's a madness in us all
So, who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?
Who broke the rules?

They said, every one of you will never try to lend a hand
When the policemen don't understand
Boys, all you boys, you think it's so American
Girls, all you girls, yeah, you're so American

There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first an' took them all
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first an' took them all

Man, oh man, you think it's so American
Man, oh man, yeah, you're so American
Man, oh man, you think it's so American
Man, oh man, yeah, you're so American
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first an' took them all
There's two eyes for every one of us
But somebody got there first an' took them all10Embed
