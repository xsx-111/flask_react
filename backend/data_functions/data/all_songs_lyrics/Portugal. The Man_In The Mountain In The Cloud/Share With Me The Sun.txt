Share With Me The Sun Lyrics
Share with me the sun
You forget sometimes it's yours
Can't you see, you're not the only one?
The doors all lead outside
Feel it soak into your mind
Can't you see, you're not the only one?

Well, my head, it gets so tired
No need to cry, no need to fight it
Throw your money in the Gulf of Mexico
In the end, in the end, it all will glow
It's just, the time it takes me so, oh, oh

Share with me the sun
You forget sometimes it's yours
Can't you see, you're not the only one?
The doors all lead outside
Feel it soak into your mind
Can't you see, you're not the only one?

I know these hands may work away
Don't mean I find no time for play
I feel the shape of things to come
In the end, in the end, it's why we run
From the east, to the west, as we become one
Share with me the sun
You forget sometimes it's yours
Can't you see, you're not the only one?
The doors all lead outside
Feel it soak into your mind
Can't you see, you're not the only one?

In the end, time may take me
In the end, time will take you too
In the end, time may take me
In the end, time will take you too
In the end, time may take me
In the end2Embed
