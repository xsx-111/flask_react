Once Was One Lyrics
Of all of us he had to know, he'd never grow
He'd never climb, he'd never love like the love I know
When I was two, and he was ten, they carried me
Through holograms, they twisted into cosmic seas

Once was born in light like you
Once was one but now am two
When I was born of love like you
When you were ten, and I was two

There were two monkeys talking, sounding like little dogs
They were barking and bitching about what was wrong
In the world, we were just spacemen taking a ride
Gorilla's in his human suit, reciting his lines, singing

We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off

If gathering is all we need to change the wind
For anything to die, it needs first to begin
Once was born in light like you
Once was one but now am two
When I was born of love like you
When you were ten, and I was two

There were two monkeys talking, sounding like little dogs
They were barking and bitching about what was wrong
In the world, we were just spacemen taking a ride
Gorilla's in his human suit, reciting his lines, singing

We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off
In time

Saw your future's not burning so bright
But if we live too long, there's love like mine

We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off

There were two monkeys talking, sounding like little dogs
They were barking and bitching about what was wrong
In the world, we were just spacemen taking a ride
Gorilla's in his human suit, reciting his lines, singing

We all, we all, we all turn on
We all, we all, we all turn off
In time

If human breed hate, love, and lies would be traits of mine
But I was of the future, past, and present time

Once was born in light like you
Once was one but now am two
When I was born of love like you
When you were ten, and I was two5Embed
