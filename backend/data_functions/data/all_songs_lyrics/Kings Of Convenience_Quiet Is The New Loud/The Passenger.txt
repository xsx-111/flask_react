The Passenger LyricsI didn't know you were there until you said "hello"
You had been watching me for I don't know how long
I hit my head against the lamp, as by surprise, I stood up
"Don't be afraid," you said, "It's only me, the door wasn't locked"
The voice I'd heard in the hall was hard to recognize
But now we know he's on board wearing our disguise
If only you and I could trust each other through this
Then together we could work out who the enemy isEmbed
