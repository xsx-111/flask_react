Parallel Lines LyricsWhat's the immaterial substance that envelopes two?
That one perceives as hunger and the other as food
I awake in tangled covers to a sash of snow
You dream in a cartoon garden I could never know
Innocent imitation of how it would be
If when the music entered, you did not retreat
In my imagination, you are cast in gold
Your image, a compensation for me to hold
Parallel lines move so fast toward the same point
Infinity is as near as it is far
Parallel lines move so fast toward the same point
Infinity is as near as it is far1Embed
