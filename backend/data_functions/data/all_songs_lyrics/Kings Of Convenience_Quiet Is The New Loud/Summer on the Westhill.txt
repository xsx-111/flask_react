Summer on the Westhill LyricsFrom my seat I see the fields move by
Colours strong, it's been a long, long time
It's the first time I see summer on the Westhill
I lean back and let my eyes just go
Floating now where they want to float
They seem to take to the horizon
Now I know there is a world beyond
The small place I was coming from
I feel at home here in the middle of nowhere
I will never know the names
Of these places that I travel through to reach the coastline
I've been told I will be there in time
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing below
Please ocean cloud
Let there be no storm on the crossing belowEmbed
