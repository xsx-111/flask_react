Once Around the Block LyricsYou quiver like a candle on fire
I'm putting you out
Maybe tonight we could be the last shout
'Cause I'm fascinated by your style
Your beauty will last for a while
You're feeling instead of being
The more that I live on the inside
Nothing to give
I'm infatuated by your moves
I've got to search hard for your clues
Trying to outrun your fears
You're running to lose
Heart on your sleeve
Your sole in your shoes
Take a left
A sharp left
And another left
Meet me on the corner
We'll start againEmbed
