Winning a Battle, Losing the War LyricsEven though I'll never need her
Even though she's only giving me pain
I'll be on my knees to feed her
Spend a day to make her smile again
Even though I'll never need her
Even though she's only giving me pain
As the world is soft around her
Leaving me with nothing to disdain
Even though I'm not her minder
Even though she doesn't want me around
I am on my feet to find her
To make sure that she is safe and sound
Even though I'm not her minder
Even though she doesn't want me around
I am on my feet to find her
To make sure that she is safe from harm
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new
Everything is new
Everything is new
Everything is new
The sun sets on the war
The day breaks and everything is new1Embed
