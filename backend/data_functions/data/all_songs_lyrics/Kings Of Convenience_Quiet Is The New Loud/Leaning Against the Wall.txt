Leaning Against the Wall LyricsYour eyes are cold
I know you'll tell me all
Not to fall
I lean against the wall
I'm on the floor
Not listening anymore
I should have known
The things to which you're prone
(You cross your arms
And tell no lies
A thousand thoughts run
Through my mind
A thousand words that I don't need
I never thought you could do this)
I should have known
The things to which you're prone
(You cross your arms
And tell no lies
A thousand thoughts run
Through my mind
A thousand words that I don't need
I never thought you could do this)
Your eyes are cold
I know you'll tell me all
Not to fall
I lean against the wallEmbed
