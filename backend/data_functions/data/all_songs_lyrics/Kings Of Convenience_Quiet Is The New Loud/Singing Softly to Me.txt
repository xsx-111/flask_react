Singing Softly to Me Lyrics
Things seem so much better when
They're not part of your close surroundings
Like words in a letter sent amplified by the distance
Possibilities and sweeter dreams
Sights and sounds calling from far away
Calling from far away

I didn't know you then, now did I, girl?
I couldn't hear you singing softly to me
I didn't know you then, now did I, girl?
I didn't see the brave girl so near me
I didn't know you then, now did I, girl?
I couldn't hear you sing softly to me
Sing softly to me

I wanted a mystery that couldn't be solved
I wanted a puzzle with pieces missing
I wanted a story that couldn't be told
Only the fishing part of fishing

I didn't know you then, now did I, girl?
I couldn't hear you sing softly to me
I didn't know you then, now did I, girl?
I didn't see the brave girl so near me
I didn't know you then, now did I, girl?
I couldn't hear you sing softly to me
Sing softly to me
And now I find
It was you all the time
In love again, love again
It's too late now
I'm in love again, love again
It's too late now
I'm in love again, love again
It's too late now
I'm in love again, love again
It's too late now
I'm in love again, love again
It's too late now
I'm in love again, love again
It's too late now2Embed
