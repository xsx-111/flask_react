Envoy LyricsIf it comes back to me, I'll let you know
Or why don't you call back to see tomorrow
I hope I can be the hand that you need
It sounded like a really good solution at the time
I've been giving a lots of thoughts, I was so pleased
You were so sad last time we spoke it seemed
When I stop thinking about it, it will come back to meEmbed
