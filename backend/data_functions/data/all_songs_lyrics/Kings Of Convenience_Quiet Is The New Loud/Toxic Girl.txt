Toxic Girl LyricsIn the sky, the birds are pulling rain
In your life, the curse has got a name
Makes you lie awake all through the night
That's why
She's intoxicated by herself
Every day, she's seen with someone else
And every night, she kisses someone new
Never you
You're waiting in the shadows for a chance
Because you believe at heart that if you can
Show to her what love is all about
She'll change
She'll talk to you with no one else around
But only if you're able to entertain her
The moment conversation stops, she's gone
Again
She's gonna be the heart that if you can
She'll change the heart if you can
But the moment conversation stops, she's gone
