Get Back (LOVE Version) Lyrics

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
​​
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo

Go home
Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belongedEmbed
