The Fool on the Hill (LOVE Version) Lyrics

Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
{Instrumental bridge}

And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do)
Round and round and round and round and round

And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

Ooh (Round and round and round)
Ooh (Round and round and round)Embed
