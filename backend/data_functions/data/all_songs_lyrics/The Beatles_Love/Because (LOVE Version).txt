Because (LOVE Version) Lyrics
Ah, because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round

Ah, because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
{Chorus}
Ah, love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

Ahh-ah-ah-ahhhhEmbed
