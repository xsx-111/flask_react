Door to Hell LyricsOn behalf of the unnamed soldiers
Dies for their country in some far-away place
Some returned expecting glory
Baby killers got spit upon their face
With napalm, we're villains
We're burning the children to death, obsessed
Put there by liars, the money messiahs, decay, obey
Shoot, kill, good will, God is on our side
Don't ask your task, do what you must do
Your door to Hell, Hell, your door to Hell
Open season for the fascists
To test their toys out on this frail human race
Some burned the flag
And denied them
While others marched off to save a nation's face
Hiding in the trenches
Their lungs filled with stenches of death, obsessed
Most who enlisted no longer existed
Slain in vain
Shoot, kill, good will, Christian soldiers march
Don't ask your task, do as you're told
Your door to Hell, Hell, your door to HellEmbed
