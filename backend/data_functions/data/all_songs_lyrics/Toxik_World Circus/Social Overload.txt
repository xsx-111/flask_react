Social Overload LyricsWe are searching for the answer
To our prayers
The endless road ahead
Is from our errors
Overbearing powers strengthening
Atomic fear of what tomorrow brings
Burning down with fire
Meltdown of the soul
Threat of termination
Social Overload
Hopes and questions
Running through our mind
But it's a case
Of blind leading blind
Money rules the hearts
Of men we fear
And still the people do not hear
Burning down with fire
Meltdown of the soul
Threat of termination
Social Overload
Burn! Burn!
Burn! Burn!
Young men of valor
March away
Heads of state have
Called their name today
One by one they fell
And there they died
In the name of money
Hate and lies
Burning down with fire
Meltdown of the soul
Threat of termination
Social Overload
Overload
Burning down with fire
Meltdown of the soul
Threat of termination
Social Overload
Burn! Burn!
Burn!
Burn! Burn!Embed
