Haunted Earth LyricsThey are here to take away
The visions of our future
With their words of empty praise, of peace
Politicians butcher
You know your mind is bending
With your stare so blind
You're here to do their bidding, to kill
All that's left behind
We must always live
For our earth
Haunted Earth
We shall never be
The same again
Haunted Earth
Turn your cheek and they will smite you
At their lords command
From the book of forgotten prophets, you sin
Sinners will be damned
Machines of death will reap the slayer's harvest
The body count is high
Ten thousand souls are lost forever, in Hell
Where no one dies
The dogs of war are howling at you
Can't you see the signs?
The art of war is an ancient syndrome, of death
For all mankind
They raise the curtain of the act violence
They take their final bow
Twisting bows of propaganda, they speak
As if they're proud
PROUD!Embed
