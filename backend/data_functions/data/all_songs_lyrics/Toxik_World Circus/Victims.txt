Victims LyricsFaces Of Death, 1, 2 and 3
Murder and violence on film
Perverted acts that infest the world
Is this really God's will?
Madman and butchers running the land
With a cross on their chest
And the good book in hand
Pointing a finger at those who oppose
Quieting the facts and truths undisclosed
Hatred, all of that is different
Victims, of the ones that you trust
Ignorance, controlling your actions
Victims
Watch the TV, and you'll see the news
The ends that our world is coming to
Falsified glory, delusions of grandeur
A true patriot kills at will
Madmen and sadists make their demands
With a cross on their chest
And the good book in hand
Dogs in high places deliver a curse, by splitting their
Atoms, destroying the earthEmbed
