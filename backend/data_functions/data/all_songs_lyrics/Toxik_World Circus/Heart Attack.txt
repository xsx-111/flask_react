Heart Attack LyricsHe is no more
Than he would seem to be
No more, no less
Tell me what's left to see
He lives for the night
Where he can scream and yell
But when there is light
His life turns to hell
Work goes so slow
And his boss is hard
Tell me now, boy
Who do you think you are?
You daydream all day
Waste my money and time
Snap out of it quick
This is where I draw the line
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Heart attack
Heart attack, stopped in your tracks
Heart attack
Heart attack quick cardiac
Heart attack
Heart attack, stopped in your tracks
Heart attack
Oh yeah!
His mind is strong
It won't get him down
Look in his eyes
And he sees the clown
No strings attached
So he makes his way
Enough is too much
He can't stand another day
Heart, heart, heart, heart
Heart attack
Heart attack, stopped in your tracks
Heart attack
Heart attack quick cardiac
Heart attack
Heart attack, stopped in your tracks
Heart attack
Woah, yeah!

Heart, heart, heart, heart
Heart attack
Heart attack, stopped in your tracks
Heart attack
Heart attack quick cardiac
Heart attack
Heart attack, stopped in your tracksEmbed
