Pain and Misery LyricsOne day you'll wake up
And life will have no meaning
Except that feeling in your veins
Another blast another line
You'd hardly do it
Your lungs are craving
That cocaine
Well, all your friends
Will sit and watch you do it
And when it's time they'll do the same
You taste the smoke
It's the evil that's inside you
You know the winner of the game
Oh no, can't you feel the pain?
Can you feel the misery?
Well, time goes on
And you feel your body slipping
There's no control, you're a slave
You breathe in deep
And be sure your hearts still pumping
You ain't ready for the grave
One more time
And you promise the you will quit
But today's just not the day
Everyday you give that
Same old sermon
Still you crack your life away
Today they found you
In your room, your eyes were empty
A stem of a glass clutched in your hand
Your heart had stopped
And your life had left you
