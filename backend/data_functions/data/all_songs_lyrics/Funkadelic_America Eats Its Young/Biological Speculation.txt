Biological Speculation Lyrics
We're just a biological speculation
Sittin' here, vibratin'
And we don't know what we're vibratin' about
And the animal instinct in me
Makes me wanna defend me
It makes me want to live when it's time to die
Y'all see my point?

I don't mean to come on strong but I am concerned
I believe in god
Though I know that law and order must prevail
Oh, if and when the laws of man
Is not just, equal and fair
Then the laws of nature will come and do her thing
Oh, she does not think
She just rectifies
She comes and balances the book
Y'all see my point?
Y'all see my point?


Some of you, you might not be aware
That some of us don't eat
Some of you don't even care
Oh, if and when the system
Creates hunger and hate
Then the laws of nature will come and do her thing
Oh, yes, oh
She does not think
She works by instinct
Survival is her thing
Do y'all see my point?
Y'all see my point?Embed
