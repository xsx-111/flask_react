Philmore LyricsStick it
Stick it
Stick it!
Stick it
Let me talk to you for awhile
Love me my way, you're in style
And got some spinnin' on your mind
Your lovin', taste my wine, yeah
Feel it, feel it
Listen to this
Tell all your friends and anyone too
That they'll be there pretty soon
Philmore baby
That's all you need
Philmore is gonna be guaranteed
Sometimes it smells, you know?
Feel it
Stick it
Stick it!
Stick it, stick it, stick it!
Chicken...
Everybody's got a problem
And you don't even give a damn
Up on you, like I said
Everybody's got a problem
But you don't even give a damn
Everybody's got a problem
But you don't even give a damn (mm, ha!)
Everybody's got problems
But you don't even care
You don't care and you don't care, yeah
Everybody's got a problem (everyone's got problems, y'all)
But you don't care and you don't care
Everybody's got problems
But you don't even give a damn
Do what you want to do
Everybody's got problems
But you don't even give a damn
Everybody's got problems (stop and stare, beware)
But you don't even give a damn
Everybody's got problems (Stick it stick it) (Good god)
But you don't even give a damn (Philmore sometime)
