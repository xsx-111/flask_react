Wake Up Lyrics
You got to wake up
You're in the presence of your future
Wake up, see what you're doing in our sleep
You got to wake up
You're in the presence of your future
Wake up, from the mistakes of the past

From time to time we come alive
But not for very long
See what shape the world is in
And wonder what went wrong
Never dreaming, not for a second
That sleeping is the cause
We make solutions in our sleep
It's dangerous for us all

You got to wake up
You're in the presence of your future
Wake up, see what you're doing in our sleep
You got to wake up
You're in the presence of your future
Wake up, from the mistakes of the past
In our sleep, we live it up
Just to wake up and find our dead
Change our hair and hairstyles too
But have the same empty heads
Brothers and sisters I'm telling you
Now's all the time for us
This is what we've got to do
And we can have the lives we'd love?

Wake up
You got to wake up

You got to wake up
You're in the presence of your future
Wake up, see what you're doing in our sleep
You got to wake up
You're in the presence of your future
Wake up, from the mistakes of the past

In our sleep, we change our way
We change our suit of clothes
We change our church, we change our god
But have the same funky soul
Never dreaming, not for a second
Sleeping is the cause
We make solutions in our sleep
And it's dangerous for us all
Wake up
You got to wake upEmbed
