I Call My Baby Pussycat Lyrics
Ahh, ahh

I call my baby pussy
P-U-S-S-Y

I'm the tomcat and you're my lil' ol' pussy
And I'm just sittin' here, lickin' my paws
I'm the tomcat and you're my lil' ol' pussy
Why don't you scratch me on my back with your claws?
Your eyes may shine, your teeth may grit
But none of my pussy you're sure gonna get
Put your foot on the rock
Oh, Good god!
I don't know but I've been told, that a dog's a man's best friend
Wild and warm is my pussy, my pussy is where it's at



Uninvited into my brain, her body creeps at will
Making love unto my thoughts that my purple mind can feel
Pussycat, Pussycat is her name, I'm telling you no lie
Pussycat, Pussycat is her name, ask me again and I'll tell you why
