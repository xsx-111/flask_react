That Was My Girl LyricsThat was my girl
If the girl displayed a smile
That always drove the fellas wild
That was my girl (that was my girl)
If your composure sort of slips
The moment that you saw her lips
That was my girl (that was my girl)
Unlike a deck of cards where there's four of a kind
There's only one of her and she's all mine
If the sight of her brightens your world
Then it had to be nobody (had to be nobody)
It had to be no one (had to be no one)
It just had to be none other (had to be none other)
My girl (my girl)
Knowing just how i reacted when to her I was attracted
That was my girl (That was my girl)
She captured every busy eye as she went casually strolling by
That was my girl (That was my girl)
As rare as a mink with yellow fur
You'll find one of them before you find one of her
She's the only kind like her in the world
Talkin' bout nobody (talkin' bout nobody)
Said I'm speakin' of no one (speakin' of no one)
I'm just rappin' 'bout nobody (rappin' 'bout nobody)
But my girl (my girl)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Talkin' 'bout my girl (whoo-hoo-hoo)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Talkin' 'bout my girl
If beautiful &
That was not your imagination
That was my girl (that was my girl)
You want the girl, no need to try
Forget the girl, I'll tell you why
That was my girl (that was my girl)
As rare as a mink with yellow fur (whooo!)
You'll find one of them before you find one of her
She's the only kind like her in the world (wooo)
Talkin' 'bout nobody (talkin' 'bout nobody)
Said I'm speakin' of no one (speakin' of no one)
I'm just rappin' 'bout nobody (rappin' 'bout nobody)
But my girl (my girl)
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Talkin' 'bout my girl
Whoo-hooo-hooo my girl
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Talkin' 'bout my girl
Woo-hooo my girlEmbed
