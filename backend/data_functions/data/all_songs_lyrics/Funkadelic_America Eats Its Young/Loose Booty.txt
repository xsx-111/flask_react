Loose Booty LyricsLoose booty (x8)
Eeny meeny miney moe
Catch a junkie by the toe
If he holler let him go
If he don't, do the loose booty
Loose booty
Skin it back and monkey it
Loose booty
Junkie twist
Loose booty
Nunsense!
Loose booty
Jack and Jill went up a hill
To get a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown
And Jill went into a nod
And did the loose booty
Loose booty
Skin it back and monkey it
Loose booty
Junkie twist
Loose booty
Nunsense!
Loose booty
(hitt it!)
? Willie went out on the block
To cop
She he got there, the pusher was gone
Cause he had a jones of his own
He did the loose booty
Loose booty
Skin it back and monkey it
Loose booty
Junkie twist
Loose booty
Nunsense!
Loose booty
Loose butt
(x16)
Little Jack Horner
Sittin' in a corner
Snortin' his New York dope
Pulled back a snort
Went into a nod
Wow, was he a dope
Loose booty
He did the loose booty
Junkie twist
Nunsense
Skin it back and monkey it
Loose booty
Loose butt
(x22)
