Taffy Lyrics
Taffy's spun, wild horses run
And the walls are filled with molasses
You said I looked real pretty by the frozen Mississippi
The future felt fantastic
Lottery, I stole a Christmas tree
You stood watch in the hotel hall
It lit up our room like a waning moon
Of melting plastic

Just a couple hours (Hours)
We’ll have superpowers
I wanna get lost
Over that bridge to La Crosse

Relic guitars, throwing dice on the bar
Your ranting, I couldn't stand it
I cut the apple in two, it just wouldn't do
Baby, you’re so romantic
Endless talk, you're not getting off
I could not leave it alone
I wanted to please you, my dress was see-through
As I looked through your phone
I am such a coward
How could you send her flowers?
I wanna get lost
But there's a bridge to La Crosse, oh oh

In a Chinese robe, I spun the globe
And my finger landed back home
If you're not willing, then I'm not giving you
My heart of gold
Nudie pics, I do not regret it
I knew that you were gone
I did so freely, I wanted you to see me
Off that throne you put me on

Just a couple hours
We'll have superpowers
I'm gonna get lost
Over that bridge from La Crosse1Embed
