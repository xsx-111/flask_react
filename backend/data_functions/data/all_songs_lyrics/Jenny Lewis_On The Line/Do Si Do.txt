Do Si Do Lyrics
Turn up the stereo
Till everything rattles, ooh
Life is a disco, a mambo
Put on your day glow

Do-si-do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do-si-do

Open the window
Get back in the saddle (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
This ain't no ghetto, Joe
You're on the payroll

Do-si-do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Rock and roll
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do-si-do

Let the grown man cry
It's suicide, my, oh my
Powerful minds
And suicide, my, oh my
You ain't no pharaoh, Flo
Get back on your Paxil, oh

Do-si-do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You're a pro
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Do-si-do

Make the grown man cry
It's suicide, my, oh my
Powerful minds
And suicide, my, oh my
Powerful minds
And suicide, my, oh my

Turn up the stereo
Till everything rattles (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Life is a disco, Rambo
Put on your day glow

Do-si-do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Rock and rollEmbed
