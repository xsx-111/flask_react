Rabbit Hole Lyrics
I'm not gonna go down the rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you again
I'm not gonna go down the rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you again

Bad habits will be broken
Boy, I have kicked a few
And seven days off the dope and
I'll be as good as new

I'm not gonna go down the rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you again

It was a sexual kind of connection
With spiritual undertones
But boy, you had me second guessing
The Beatles and the Rolling Stones

I'm not gonna go down the rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you again
I'm not gonna go down the rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you again
I'm not gonna go down the rabbit hole
With you, with you, with you again

I am gonna go down the rabbit hole
Without you, without youEmbed
