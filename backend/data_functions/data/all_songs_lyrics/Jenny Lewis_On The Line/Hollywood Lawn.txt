Hollywood Lawn Lyrics
On a Hollywood lawn today
Slip and slide, watching the kids play
You know that I love you, babe
Dozin' off watchin' the channels change

I been searching for the heart to tell you somethin'
I could get down on my knees
I've had it with you trippers and drama queens
If I click my ruby slippers like Don Quixote
I'm long lost like Rockefeller drifting off to sea

On a Hollywood lawn today
Suckin' back some Beaujolais
Rememberin' better days
Lookin' up at the chem-trail haze

If you keep dreamin', keep dreamin', alright
If you keep dreamin', keep sleepin' through the night
'Cause your demons got reason to fight
And you keep dreamin', yeah, yeah

Rollin' down a Kingston highway
Eureka moment come my way
You know that I love you, babe
I just cannot stay
I been searching for the heart to tell you somethin'
I could get down on my knees
I've had it with you trippers and drama queens
If I click my ruby slippers, would you forgive me?
I'm long lost like Rockefeller drifting off to sea
And you keep dreamin', keep dreamin', alright
If you keep dreamin', keep sleepin' through the night
'Cause your demons got reason to fight
And you keep dreamin', yeah, yeah

And your demons got reason to fight
And your demons got reason to fight
And your demons got reason to fight
And you keep dreamin', yeah, yeahEmbed
