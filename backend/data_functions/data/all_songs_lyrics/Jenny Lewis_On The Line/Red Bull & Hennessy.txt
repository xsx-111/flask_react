Red Bull & Hennessy Lyrics
I'm about to get wicked
You got me lyin' on my back
Hallelu
All will be forgiven
But why you gotta act like that?
Make me beg for you?

I'm wired on Red Bull and Hennessy
Higher than you
I'm on fire, c'mon and get next to me
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with you

What's the matter with me?
I can see it in your eyes
After all we've been through (Through, through)
Oh, don't you wanna kiss me? (Kiss me, kiss me)
Don't you wanna even try
And devour the moon?

I'm wired on Red Bull and Hennessy
Higher than you
I'm on fire, c'mon and get next to me
I wanna ride with you
We had it all, right from the start
Never going back in with your heart, heart, heart
And we had it all, it's fallen apart
Never gettin' back again without that spark

I'm wired on Red Bull and Hennessy
Higher than you
I'm on fire, c'mon and get next to me
I wanna ride with you
I wanna ride with youEmbed
