Wasted Youth Lyrics
Sister, we're slidin' down a bong
I can't tell you what I think you're doing wrong
Stop your cryin', our daddy's gone
Do you remember when he used to sing us that little song?

I wasted my youth on a poppy
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, just for fun
I wasted my youth on a poppy
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, just because

Why you lyin'? The bourbon's gone
Mercury hasn't been in retrograde for that long, oh no
Stop your hiding, drop that bomb
Do you remember when I used to sing you this little song?

I wasted my youth on a poppy
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, just for fun
I wasted my youth on a poppy
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, just because
And everybody knows it's a tightrope
The cookie crumbles into dust
And everybody knows we're in trouble
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, candy crush
Just 'cause you're young
Don't mean nothing, don't mean nothing
We are here and we're gon'
Do something, while your heart is thumping

I wasted my youth on a poppy
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, just because
I wasted my youth on a poppy
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, just for fun
And everybody knows it's a tightrope
The cookie crumbles into dust
And everybody knows we're in trouble
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo, candy crush

Wasted my youth
Wasted youth
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo
Wasted youth
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo
Wasted you
Doo-doo, doo-doo, dooEmbed
