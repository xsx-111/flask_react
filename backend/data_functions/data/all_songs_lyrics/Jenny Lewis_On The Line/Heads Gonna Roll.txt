Heads Gonna Roll Lyrics
Since I haven't talked to you, I
Dream about your baby blues and
Wonder why you stopped getting high
Even though we were just friends
I think of us as bookends
And I'm gonna love you 'til I die

And you think you're going to Heaven
And that I am going to Hell
And that I'm gonna keep on dancing
'Til I hear that ringing bell

Heads gonna roll, baby
Everybody's gotta pay that toll and maybe
After all is said and done, we'll all be skulls
Heads gonna roll

Took a little trip up North
In a borrowed convertible red Porsche
With a narcoleptic poet from Duluth
And we disagreed about everything
From Elliott Smith to Grenadine
He fell asleep and I put up the roof
And he took me to a graveyard
I thought he'd kill me there
And he kissed me on the corner
While the nuns of Harlem stared

Oh, heads gonna roll, baby
Everybody's gotta pay that toll and maybe
After all is said and done, we'll all be skulls
Heads gonna roll

Smoking Marlboro cigarettes
Almost makes me forget about
Riding on a private jet with you
I hope the sycophants in Marrakesh
Make you feel your very best
Anonymity must make you blue

And you think I'm going to Heaven
And that you are going to Hell
With your back to the medina
As if you were in jail
Oh, heads gonna roll, baby
Everybody's gotta pay that toll and maybe
After all is said and done, we'll all be skulls
Heads gonna roll
Heads gonna roll, ladies
We're gonna drink until they close and maybe
A little bit of hooking up is good for the soul
Heads gonna roll1Embed
