Dogwood Lyrics
The dogwood's in bloom
Take off your shoes
You cannot choose your family, oh
There's nothing we can do
But screw
And booze and amphetamines, oh

In the springtime, in a little house
I was determined to work it out
Oh, in the springtime, in a little house
The neighbors heard us scream and shout

And somewhere a screw got loose along the way
And your manners have gone away
And I believe that there will come a day
I believe that you will chase me away

So that you can prove
Love is not enough for you
There's nothing I can do
'Cause I fell in love with you
In the springtime, in a little house
I was determined to work it out
Oh, in the springtime, in a little house
I never told you I had my doubts

Somewhere a screw got loose along the way
And our manners have gone away
And I believe that there will come a day
I believe that you will chase me away

So that you can prove
Love is not enough for you
You thought I was your muse
But all along it was you

And the dogwood's in bloom
There's nothing we can do
But screw, ohEmbed
