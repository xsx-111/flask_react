Little White Dove Lyrics
One, two, a-one, two, three, four

Was it a dream?
Under the holy cross in the valley below
A mother and child, emergency
Behind a yellow curtain on the second floor
All the guardian angels at the door
With their long white coats and their stethoscopes

In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove
I'm the heroin
In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove, yeah
In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove, yeah

Was it a dream?
When you called me kitten and her majesty
I'm your blood, I want more
The water from my eyes fell to the floor
In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove, yeah
I'm the heroin
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah

Hungry eyes watching over you
Petty crimes are the family jewels
We're living our lives and it's happening
Over and over again (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

Was it a dream?
Under the holy cross in the valley below
A mother and child, eternity
Under a cool white sheet, here we go

In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove, yeah
I'm the heroin
In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove, yeah
I'm the heroin
In the middle of love
I'm a little white dove
In the middle of love
I'm the little white dove
In the middle of love
In the middle of loveEmbed
