On the Line Lyrics
It used to be Bobby forever
We were together day and night
He left me for an Eastside girl
Called Caroline, oh

Before you let her under your sweater tonight
Listen to my heart beating
Listen to my heart beating
Listen to my heart beating
On the line (On the line)
On the line

Whenever things get complicated
You run away to Mexico
Boy, you got me infuriated
I'm never gonna let you go

It used to be Bobby forever
We were together day and night
He left me for a super-fan
Called Caroline, oh
Before you let her under your sweater tonight
Listen to my heart beating
Listen to my heart beating
Listen to my heart beating
On the line (On the line)
On the line

Whenever things get complicated
You run away to Mexico
Boy, you got me infuriated
I’m never gonna let you go

You're not the only one with a crowd
You're not the only one who gets down
You’re not the only one on the town tonight
You used to be

Before you let her under your sweater tonight
Listen to my heart beating
Listen to my heart beating
Listen to my heart beating
On the line (On the line)
On the line (On the line)
On the line (On the line)
On the lineEmbed
