Party Clown Lyrics
I met the devil down in Austin
He gave me a Fuji apple
I took a bite and went out of my head
I was a girl in a black Corvette
Getting head in the shadows
I was a Beatle floating in a bottle of red

I was a party clown
Party clown

I took a weightless bath
'Til my own laugh gave me the creeps
I watched a scorpion crawl across my feet
It’s been a while, but we communicate psychically
Now you're at my door, trick or treat

My party clown
Party clown
I'm a party clown
Party clown

And why can’t you be my puzzle piece, baby?
And now that you've cracked me open wide to see
That I was living my life in stencil
But the rainbow was inside of me
Party clown
Party clown
I'm a party clown
Party clown

Can you be my puzzle piece, baby?
When I cry like Meryl Streep?
And when I crack my head wide open
I want my baby next to me

My party clown
Party clown
I'm a party clown
Party clown
Party clownEmbed
