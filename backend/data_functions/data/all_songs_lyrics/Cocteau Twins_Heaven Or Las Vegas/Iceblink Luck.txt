Iceblink Luck Lyrics
I’m seeming to be lit, alive
I’m happy again, calmer, calm in time
Suppose the daughter of yourself will
Be the same, but you’re a match

You're the match of cherry coal
That will burn this whole madhouse down
You’ll not throw open like the worn-out safe
More like a love that's a bottle of exquisite stuff, best

You yourself and your father
Don’t know so, but in your own ways
You're really both bonesetters
Thank you for mending me, baby

You're the match of cherry coal
That will burn this whole madhouse down
You’ll not throw open like the worn-out safe
You would seem more like being from that same bottle
Of exquisite stuff is
You are the match of cherry coal that will burn
This whole madhouse down on the floor
Open like the worn-out safe
You yourself and your father
Don’t know so, but in your own ways
You’re really both bonesetters
Thank you for mending me, babyEmbed
