Fotzepolitic Lyrics
My dreams
Are alone and sick and must be addressed
They’re a young girl’s dreams
True, some do, that is true
Like the barely-lit stars
But I was just cute

Like the scary hairs on our singing hoof
Like the scary hairs on our singing hooves
They cough

A family fool, fool it’s you
I can spoon him inside me
You’ll accept my feint
A Kalends start, but I feel strung up
When bound, we all need to grow
And I’m empty-headed

See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
Or will you?
My dreams
Are alone and sick and must be addressed
They’re a young girl’s dreams

See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you, will you?
Or will you?

See and saw
Bounce me back to you
See and saw
Bounce me back to you
See and saw
Bounce me back to you
Will you?
See and saw
Bounce me back to you
See and saw
Bounce me back to you
See and saw
Bounce me back to you
Will you?1Embed
