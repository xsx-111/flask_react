Fifty-Fifty Clown Lyrics
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh
Oh, and you're a long shadow
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh
Oh, and you're a long shadow
I felt rewarded on being so ugly, eh

Smile and face your wife angry
His life don't despise what's in eyes
He skips so as the seasons
To come as a breeze has
Again, ahead

We'll rust, our nose dust
Ephemeral with peace and, oh its true
He can't comfort the brain
He was calm as he was
Again, ahead

And is this safe flowing, love, soul and light
Motions all in motion emotions all
Good morning love with someone I call in light
Motions all in motion emotions all
And is this safe flowing, love, soul and light
Motions all in motion emotions all5Embed
