Pitch the Baby Lyrics
It don’t have to be that full for you
Only up to the waist-deep end
Pitch the baby
Sleeping don’t know you’re
Waking up as we see her sun
Hear the language
Come kiss your baby
Only hope to not bust somethin’
Here I want to grow and keep her warm
Man there must be somethin’ left still

I only want to love you
I only want to love you

It don’t have to be that full for you
Only up to the waist-deep end
Pitch the baby
Sleeping don’t know you’re
Waking up as we see her sun
Hear the language
Come kiss your baby
Only hope to not bust somethin’
Here I want to grow and keep her warm
Man there must be somethin’ left still
I only want to love you

It still has to be too true for me
I only want to love you
It still has to be too safe for me
I only want to love you

I wander through the streets
Thinking I’ll fill their hearts with some sugar
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby
I wander through the streets
Thinking I’ll fill their hearts with some sugar
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby
I wander through the streets
Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar
(I only want to love you)
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, baby
I wander through the streets
Thinking I'll fill their hearts with some sugar
(I only want to love you)
And everything is sweet
Everybody says you favor me, babyEmbed
