Cherry-Coloured Funk Lyrics
Bills and aches and blues
And poor little everything else
But still more unstable, eyes of glass
Not get pissed off through my burned lips
As good news

Still being cried on (On and on)
Laughed at from behind
“Don’t fall behind, miss”
From first time to this

Bills and aches and blues
And bills and aches and blues
Bills and aches and blues
And poor little everything else
But still more unstable, eyes of glass
Not get pissed off through my burned lips
As good news

You hang the hearts black
And dull as the night (Oh, hearts in love)
You hanged your past and start
Being as you in ecstasy
(Still being cried and laughed at before)
Should I be sewn and hugged?
I can by not saying
(Still being cried and laughed at)
(From light to blue)

And should I be hugged and tugged down through
This tiger's masque?
And should I be sung and unbroken by not saying
Your mind not saying

You hang the heart black
And dull as the night
(Still being cried and laughed at)
(From blue eyed you)
Hang love and start (For you)
Being as you in ecstasy
(Still being cried and laughed at)
(From blue eyed you)
Should I risk all this, burned? (For you)
I’ll just have to trust
(Still being cried and laughed at)
(From blue eyed you)
Hugged and tugged down through (For you)
This tiger’s masque I’ve made8Embed
