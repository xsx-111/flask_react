Heaven or Las Vegas Lyrics
Pull him away
Too jealous so with me
Go back for new
For new things there

Singing on a famous street
I want to love, I've all the wrong glory
Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas?
Whichever's more brighter than the sun is to me

He's a hustler
Some role he'll never make suit
Hang on to this
To stay and stay, and then fail
Pull him away
Too jealous so with me
Go back for new
For new things there

Singing on a famous street
I want to love, I've all the wrong glory
Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas? (Heaven or Las Vegas)
Whichever's more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul (Heaven or Las Vegas)
It's like any good playing card
Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas (Heaven or Las Vegas)
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me
Carnival's a bluster loud
I'm dizzy so I go under the Big Dipper
Confetti for a carnival
Confetti for a wedding

Singing on a famous street
I want to love, I've all the wrong glory
Am I just in Heaven or Las Vegas? (Heaven or Las Vegas)
Whichever's more brighter than the sun is to me
Reaching this itch in my soul (Heaven or Las Vegas)
It's like any good playing card
Must be why I'm thinking of Las Vegas (Heaven or Las Vegas)
Why it's more brighter than the sun is to me

Maybe then you will swear
This is hardly personal
I suspect I'm singing to a tune
And still you find the beat, I'll sing it to you soon11Embed
