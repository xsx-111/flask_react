Frou-Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires Lyrics
All broken and lost
Has got enemies
How the righteous speak
They warn all may lose
Close in to stay apart
A fire drinks ignitions
They turn infant's breath, my
Milk in drafts to baby

And day from night take all

All broken and lost
I've got enemies
How the righteous speak
They warn all may lose
Small features to have voice
A fire drinks ignitions
They turn infant's breath, my
Milk in drafts to baby

And day from night take all
Bad thoughts and soothe
All he was
Knows you
Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)
Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)
Limelight's not the music, plain as this can be so (Pull tight)
All that I found, I have to go back, now I need to choose (Tighter)
(Susan, let's go together in the morning)
Rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled round
Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)
Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)
Limelight's not the music, as plain as it can be so (Pull tight)
All that I found, I have to go back, now I need to choose (Tighter)
(Susan, let's go together in the morning)
Rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled round
(Pull)
(Tighter)
(Pull tight)
(Tighter)

Now vanity gone
Whose servants desert me
I've mostly been pressed
Now live down impression
Lead weight that seemed hopeless
The yoke that was young kids
I'm noosing the snares, I
Hung nets just to find you
All broken and lost
I've got enemies
How the righteous speak
They warn all may lose
Close in to stay apart
A fire drinks ignitions
They turn infant's breath, like
Milk in drafts to baby

And day, yeah, from night take all
That I took, come sleep
All he made
Loves you
And day, open the air and
Your eyes, because doll
He made
Those stars I lost just to find you

Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)
Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)
Limelight's not the music, as plain as it can be so (Pull tight)
All that I found, I have to go back, now I need to choose (Tighter)
(Susan, let's go together in the morning)
Rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled round
Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Pull)
Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)
Limelight's not the music, as plain as it can be so (Pull tight)
All that I found, I have to go back, now I need to choose (Tighter)
(Susan, let's go together in the morning)
Rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled round
Singed, but I pulled her out of my blazening (Now)
Eyes not in the usual deep silence of cherry-coloured (Tighter)
Limelight's not the music, as plain as it can be so (Pull tight)
All that I found, I have to go back, now I need to choose (Tighter)
(Susan, let's go together in the morning)
Rounder, pulled rounder
Pulled rounder, pulled rounder3Embed
