I Wear Your Ring Lyrics
You don't feel dammed between the sunrise and sunset
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Race them or run on the turf
You could be raising money with your mama
You might be showing you're round and dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone

Men are so nice (Reflection nous)
He pleases me fine
Men are so useful
Is a girl (So useful)
Reflection me
Men are so nice
Beautiful stars
Reflection nous (Reflection nous)

You don't feel dammed between the sunrise and sunset (You don't feel)
You're damned well panicky, I know the rainy days
Race them or run on the turf
You could be raising money with your momma (You could be)
You might be showing you're round and dressed up with kid
Take a toast to that, imbibe, you're alone
Men are so nice (Reflection nous)
He pleases me fine
Men are so useful
Is a girl (So useful)
Reflection me
Men are so nice
Beautiful stars
Reflection nous (Reflection nous)

“Beautiful” has got no weight as a means of love
One sounds, engulf the storm
And they had allure
They’re handsome dressed, and then dies reason
In the reign of sex, blown more than it’s pleased to be
He's a beauty, reflection nous
“Beautiful” has got no weight as a means of love (men are so nice)
One sounds, engulf the storm
(He pleases me fine)
(Fine and fine and fine and fine)
And they had allure
(Fine and fine and fine and fine, fine)
They’re handsome dressed, and then dies reason
(He pleases me fine)
(Fine and fine and fine and fine)
In the reign of sex, blown more than it’s pleased to be
(Fine and fine and fine and fine, fine)
He's a beauty, reflection nous
(Fine and fine and fine and fine)
(Fine and fine and fine and fine, fine)
“Beautiful” has got no weight as a means of love
One sounds, engulf the storm2Embed
