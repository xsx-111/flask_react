Road, River and Rail Lyrics
Really far away
Though those choices can't be told
Naked and caught on the Île de la Cité
Oh holy pew is of eleventh century
Full of shade and a fearless decay
Formed into an angel
From some flower
Fabulous and dreamery
Laying on the crown of influence

From out of the Bayeux
See him with hair pulled
Little pants suit and no waist
Through Paris, Brixton
From out of the Bayeux

My destiny
Seventeen my mind was seized
Into the fold when you weren't feeling hated then
No boiling thirst
It was a focus of adjectives
Road, river and rail
So unblemished and natural
As mother's daughter
Today she'll follow road, river and rail
So unblemished and natural
As mother's daughter
Today she'll follow road, river and rail
So unblemished and natural
As mother's daughter
Today she'll follow road, river and rail2Embed
