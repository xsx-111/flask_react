Wolf in the Breast Lyrics
Under my shirt
Half to a muscling
The tale I've writ on
Each arm's length long

It's my belief
Puzzles are tricking me
I lend it out to borrow
Am I to find
My baby's cries

Laughing on our bed
Pretending us newly wed
Especially when
Our angel unleashed that head

It's my belief
Puzzles are tricking me
I lend it out to borrow
Am I to find
My baby's cries
Laughing on my bed
Pretending us newly wed
Especially when
Our angel unleashed that head
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel, I feel perpetual

True blue and real
I feel, I feel
True blue and real

And I feel all of it
Pretending us newly wed
Especially when
Our angel unleashed that head
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
I feel perpetual
True and real1Embed
