Salad Days Lyrics
As I’m getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die
Missing Hippie Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long

Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign
Salad days are gone, missing Hippie Jon
Remember the days just to tell ‘em so long

Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year32Embed
