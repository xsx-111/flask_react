Brother Lyrics
Shit

You’re no better off
Living your life
Than dreaming at night
This much is true
But it’s still up to you
To take my advice

To take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go
Go home, go home
Go home, go home

You’re better off dead
When your mind’s been set
From nine until five
How could it be true
Well, it’s happened to you
So take my advice
And take it slowly, brother
Let it go now, brother
Take it slowly, brother
Let it go
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Go home, go home
Go home, go home11Embed
