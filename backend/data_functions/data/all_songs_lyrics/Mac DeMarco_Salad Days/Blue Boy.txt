Blue Boy Lyrics
Blue Boy, worried 'bout the world's eyes
Worried, every time the sun shines
Worried 'bout his haircut
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy

Blue Boy, older than the world knows
Honey, that's the way that life goes
No use acting so tough
Calm down, sweetheart, grow up

Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
Blue Boy
