Treat Her Better Lyrics
Hey, man
Heard you were your brother's keeper
That can't be
Judgin' by the way you treat her

Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now

Hey, man
Who's been keepin' brother?
Hey, man, how old is your mother?

Oh no, you've done it again
No use when you already know how it ends

Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now
Treat her better, boy
If havin' her at your side's something you enjoy
If havin' her in your life's really so important to you now15Embed
