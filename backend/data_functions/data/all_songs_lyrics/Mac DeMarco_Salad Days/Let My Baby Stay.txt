Let My Baby Stay Lyrics
I was made to love her
Been working at it
Half of my life
I’ve been an addict

And she’s been good to me
Far as I can tell she’s happy
Livin’ with her Macky

So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay

And where would I be
Feeling lonely
Separated from my one and only

And what’s there left to say
Far as I can tell that day
Could be on its way
So please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
Please don’t take my love away
Let my baby stay
Let my baby stay
