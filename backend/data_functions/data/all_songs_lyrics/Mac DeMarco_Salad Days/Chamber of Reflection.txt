Chamber of Reflection Lyrics

Spend some time away
Getting ready for the day you're born again
Spend some time alone
Understand that soon you'll run with better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone

No use looking out
Itâ€™s within that brings that lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You'll be clear, among the better men
Alone again

Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
Alone
Alone again
Alone again
Alone again
