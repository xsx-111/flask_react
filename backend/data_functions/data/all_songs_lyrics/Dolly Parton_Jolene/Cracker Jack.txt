Cracker Jack Lyrics
Once I had a little dog
I called him Cracker Jack
He had a spot around one eye
That looked just like a patch
His legs were way too long
And he was awkward as could be
He wasn't much to look at
But he looked alright to me
I found him by the river bank
Just wandering about
He was cold and hungry
And his ribs were sticking out
I snapped my fingers, whistled
When he came, I picked him up
I was just a kid
And Cracker Jack was just a pup
I took him home and fed him
'Til he couldn't eat no more
I took him to my room
And put a blanket on the floor
After that beside my bed
Is where he'd always sleep
Each night in my prayers
I'd pray the lord his soul to keep
Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
Everything a kid could want
I had in Cracker Jack

Cracker Jack would run to meet me
After school each day
He'd jump and wag his tail
And look at me as if to say
"I love you and I've missed you
And I'm glad you're home again"
I knew just how he felt
'Cause me and Cracker Jack was friends
Through the woods and fields
We would often roam about
And when we got in trouble
We would help each other out
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run
We had a lot in common
And we had a lot of fun
He was always with me
When I was growing up
We shared each other's good times
And we shared each other's love
He only lives in memories now
But often I think back
To the days of childhood
The days of Cracker Jack

Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more than that
A playmate, a companion
He was love and understanding
That was Cracker Jack
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack
But he was more then that
Everything a kid could want
I had in Cracker JackEmbed
