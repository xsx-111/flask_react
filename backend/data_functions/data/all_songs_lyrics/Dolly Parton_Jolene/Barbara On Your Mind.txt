Barbara On Your Mind Lyrics
Last night you called me Barbara
As you laid fast asleep
And although I'm not Barbara
You wanted me to be
You whispered words I hadn't heard
In such a long, long time
Last night you said "I love you"
With Barbara on your mind

With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until daylight
And though you think that I don't know
I'm really not that blind
You look at me and I can see
Barbara on your mind

And sometimes I find traces of her kisses on your skin
And strands of chestnut hair
That say you've been with her again
Little traces of her that it breaks my heart to find
You look at me and I can see
Barbara on your mind
With Barbara on your mind
You held me in your arms so tight
And lying there so close to you
I cried until daylight
And though you haven't left yet
I know you will in time
Last night you said "I love you"
With Barbara on your mind
Last night you called me "darling"
With Barbara on your mindEmbed
