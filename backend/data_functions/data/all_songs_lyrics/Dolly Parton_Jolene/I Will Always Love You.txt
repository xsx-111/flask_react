I Will Always Love You Lyrics
If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you each step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

Bittersweet memories
That's all I'm taking with me
Goodbye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not what you need

But I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you6Embed
