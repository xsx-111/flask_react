Highlight of My Life Lyrics
Darling, you're the highlight of my life
You're the one that makes it all worthwhile
You're the one that taught me how to smile
Darling, you're the highlight of my life

You're a part of every dream I dream
You're my love, my life, my everything
I'll never love another, how could I?
When, darling, you're the highlight of my life

Darling, you're the highlight of my life
You're the one that makes it all worthwhile
You're the one that taught me how to smile
Darling, you're the highlight of my life

You're the one I always think about
And you're the one I couldn't live without
And you have always been my guiding light
Darling, you're the highlight of my life

Darling, you're the highlight of my life
You're the one that makes it all worth while
You're the one that taught me how to smile
Darling, you're the highlight of my life
Darling, you're the highlight of my lifeEmbed
