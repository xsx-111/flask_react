Hey
Get a little peek, the picture gets clearer
Time well spent, brings you nearer my love
I like to do that
Starting to dream
Yeah a glossy 8x10
She had such gorgeous hair
I always miss my kisses there
But lately I just sing
I pretend
Oh, I Oh, I
Whoa-oo whoa-oo whoa-oo whoa-ho-ho-ho oh, I
Oh, I Oh, I
Whoa-oo whoa-oo whoa-oo whoa-ho-ho-ho oh, I

Reminds me of the time on the love we spent
Making love after dark
Heyyyy
And I'm
Everything remains the same thanks to
Down memory lane
Oh, I Oh, I
Whoa-oo whoa-oo whoa-oo whoa-ho-ho-ho oh, I

The picture gets clearer
Time well spent, brings you nearer my love

Give a little bit
The picture gets clearer
Time well spent, brings you nearer my love
