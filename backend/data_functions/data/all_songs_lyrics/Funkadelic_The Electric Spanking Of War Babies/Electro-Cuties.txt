Electro-Cuties LyricsYowwwwww--hii!
I'm overloaded
Just blowin' a fuse
Got myself some energy
And I've got to use it
Surgin' through the socket
That, that's it
Electromagnetism
Electromagnetic child
And I'm in my electric vibratory by day
All we do is shout????
Got my finger in the socket
The live wire shocked it to me
Girl, I'm all charged up
(x4)
Cutie, electro-cutie
(shock-it-to-me) (x3)
(x2)
Got my finger in the socket
The live wire shocked it to me
I'm overloaded
To do is shout?
Cutie (shock-shock-shock-shock-it-to-me)
Electro-cutie (shock-shock-shock-shock-it-to-me)
(x8)
And I'm all wired up
You got to get a hot foot???
Give me hot feet???
Cutie, electro-cutie (givin' me hot feet)
Cutie, electro-cutie
(shock-it-to-me) (x3)
Cutie, electro-cutie
?
Got my finger in the socket
The live wire shocked it to me
Is shout?
Yeah!
Oohh, ooh
Is shout?
Who's that writing on ????
Stay right here
I'll be right back
You can't short-circuit
When kilowatt's shocking to you
(x4)
Electomagnetism
Electromagnetic child
I'm in my vibratory by day
Leaving you with shocks
This old man
He played one
He be AC/DC all night long
With a short-circuit kilowatt ? fuse
This old man he sees the news
And I'm all charged up
Said I'm all charged up
Said I'm all charged up
I'm all charged up
I'm all charged
Cuties, electro-cuties (x2)
(shock-shock-shock-shock-it-to-me) (x8)
Cuties, electro-cuties
I'm all charged up
Shoot the ?
Give them hot feet
(x2)
This old man
He played one
He be AC/DC all night long
With a short-circuit kilowatt ? fuse
This old man he sees the news
I'm all charged up
And I'm all charged upEmbed
