Oh these ?
As is (that's that?)
It's a funk attack
If you got the front, uh
Then I've got your back, baba
Roll
Uncle jack
?
Hey
Put it where the shock on
?
Put it on the one
Ah
On the one, on the one, on the one
On the one
You keep holding me back
Put it where you know it belong
Just a silly millimeter longer
Funk gets stronger
Funky power
By the hour
Funk will sit and sit and never go sour
Funky power
Funk gets stronger
As it goes longer
Just a silly millimeter longer
Funk gets stronger
Funky power
By the hour
Funk will sit and sit and never go sour
Funky power
You keep holding me back
Put it where you know it belong
You keep holding it back
You got to put it where you know it belong
You keep holding it back, jack
Put it where it belong
You keep holding it back
Put it where you know it belong
Roll call, she boogie
Check us out
(x4)
She like to ball, she boogie
Check, check us out
She like to ball, she boogie
Check us out
Funk gets stronger
As it goes longer
Just a silly millimeter longer
Funk gets stronger
Funky power
By the hour
Funk will sit and sit and never go sour
Funky power
You keep holding me back
Put it where you know it belong
You keep holding me back
Put it where it belong
You keep holding me back, jack
Put it where it belong
You keep holding me back
Put it where you know it belong
Roll call, she boogie
Check us out
(x4)
She like to ball, we boogie
Check us out
(x4)
You keep holding me back
Put it where you know it belong
Funk gets stronger (x2)
As it goes longer
You keep holding me back
Put it where it belong, yeah
Put it where it belong
Put it where you know it belong
You keep holding me back
Put it where you know it belong
Funk gets stronger
As it goes longer
Just a silly millimeter longer
Funk gets stronger
