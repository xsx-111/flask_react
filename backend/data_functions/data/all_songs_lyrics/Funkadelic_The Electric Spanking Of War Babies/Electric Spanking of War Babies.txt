Electric Spanking of War Babies Lyrics{spoken}
Hi there (hi, are you talking to me? What is that?)
You probably don't remember me, right? (no, I don't remember you)
Ah-ha, but I remember you (what's that? I don't???)
You probably won't believe this, but, uh
I, at the early age of seventeen
Was adopted by aliens hahahah (hahahaha)
Was adopted by aliens hahahah (hahahaha, oh god)
That's right, I said aliens (ahh)
They have long since programmed me
To return with this message
{sung}
When you learn to dance
You won't forget it
Ooh, if you learn to dance
You won't forget it
When you learn to dance
You won't forget it
(x2)
You can walk a mile in my shoes
But you can't dance a step in my feet
(x2)
You stand a chance
You can dance, ooh-ooh
(x2)
It's shocking to find (sock it to the circuit)
That your mind (sock it to the circuit)
And your behind (sock it to the circuit)
Gets a spanking in time
Sock it to the circuit
Dead it in addition???
We compute a perfect funk
You can walk a mile in my shoes
But you can't dance a step in my feet
(x2)
It's a bummer to find
That your mind
And your behind
Gets exploded in time
The electric spanking of war babies (x4)
Oh it's shocking to find
That your mind
And your behind (electric)
Will get a spanking in due time (spanking of war babies)
You've seen the bomb (electric)
Vietnam (spanking of)
LSD (war babies)
You've seen the ?
You've seen DNA
Watch them go to the moon
Live on TV
Sock it to the circuit
We compute a perfect funk
Digital???
We compute a perfect funk
You can dance, ooh-ooh
It's shocking to find
That your mind
Like your behind
Gets a spanking in time (spanking in time)
Sock it to the circuit
You've seen the bomb
Vietnam
LSD
You've seen the ?
You've seen DNA
Watch them go to the moon
Live on TV
Electric spanking of war babies
Sock it to the circuit
Dead it in addition???
We compute a perfect funk
Electric spanking of war babies (x3)
We compute a funky funk
We compute a perfect funk
Electric spanking of war babies (x7)1Embed
