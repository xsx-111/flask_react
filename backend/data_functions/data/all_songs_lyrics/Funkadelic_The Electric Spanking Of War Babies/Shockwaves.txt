Shockwaves LyricsWhooaa, I know
Hey, mon
The third world is on the one
Right on the downbeat
Sending out shockwaves throughout the world
Hey, mon
Sending out shockwaves throughout the world
And if I could feel the thrill
A little bit of this (hey)
A little bit of that
Rock and roll will never die (just a little bit)
(Whooo-oohhh-ohhh) I see my feet covered with snow
I want to take my shoes off
And to Jamaica I'll go
Hey, mon
Have you seen the way people get out of trouble?
They just groove
On the one
Everybody is down on the one, two
(x2)
Mmm, hey just one more time for a little bit
(Whooo-oohhh-ohhh) Politicians are struggling
They're wondering what to do
Meanwhile, on Belle Isle
P.Funk is getting off for you!
I'm from the first world (you see)
I like to groove (I'm from the first world)
Don't won't no problems (don't need no problems)
Set up that groove
I'm from the first world
Sending out shockwaves
Whooa-hahhaaa, hey!
Hey, mon
Why you April Fool me, mon?
The Third World is right on the one
Right there on the downbeat
Hey, mon
I'd rather go dancing
Than have a meeting about your problems
On the one, right there, on the downbeat
Sending out shockwaves
Throughout the world
(x2)
Look at my shoes
They're full of holes
Nobody cares, nobody but my toes
Sing!
I'm a-from the first world
I like to groove (I don't need no problems)
Don't want no problems
Set up that groove
I'm a-from a the first world
Sending out, sending out
Shockwaves, shockwaves, shockwaves, shockwaves
Whooaaa, I know
Hey, mon
The Third World is on the one
Right on the downbeat
Sending out shockwaves
Throughout the world
(x2)
Buh-doo-doo doo-doop
Buh-doo-doo doo-doo
Buh-doo-doo doo-doop
Buh dah dah dah doo-doop
Whooa-ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
You see
I'm from the first world
I like to groove
Don't want no problems
Set up that groove
You see
I'm from the first world (I told you I'm from the first world)
Sending out shockwaves
And as the world turns
I like to groove and move you see
I'm from the first world
I like to groove
Don't want no problems (on these days of our lives)
Set up that groove
I'm from the first world
Doing that tonight, JR
You see, if we was in Dallas, you see
He'd say, I'd like to groove
Don't need no problems
And general hospital
I'm from the first world
Sending out shockwavesEmbed
