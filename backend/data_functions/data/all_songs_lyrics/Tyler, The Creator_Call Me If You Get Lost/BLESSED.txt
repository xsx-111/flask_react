BLESSED Lyrics
Niggas is blessed
I'ma put a bike track and the zipline at the other-other crib
Golf Wang's doin' amazing, might open up another store
​le FLEUR* is goin' insane, smell good, nail polish
Converse, Gucci
Camp Flog Gnaw one of the best festivals
I'm healthy, my skin glowin', my friends healthy
I'm fuckin' who, what, when, where, haha
Karen and Alex Moss 'bout to drop off some new pieces
I'm out here scorin' commercials, movies soon
We writin' shows, man, life is fucking beautiful
I done fell in love and th-th-thе—
The only flaw is my fuckin' hair won't grow
It's been like two years and this shit likе two inches
Come get lost with me, man, come, come, come see the world
When you, when you really get out there, call me, I'll be there
And I don't take jets like that, I'm scared to go broke, so
I don't take none of this shit for granted
It's opulence, baby9Embed
