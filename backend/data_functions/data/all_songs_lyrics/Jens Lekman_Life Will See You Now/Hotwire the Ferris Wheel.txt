Hotwire the Ferris Wheel Lyrics
There's a carnival in town
Walking your dog past the old fairground
From inside we hear screaming and laughter
From roller coasters and merry-go-rounds

Lately you've been a wreck
Life called, it wanted its dreams back
I'm here if you want to chat
Or just keep my mouth shut
If you prefer that

The lonely cry of a seagull (You say)
I say, "Let's do something illegal
Let's get ourselves in trouble
Let's just live a little"

So when the moon rolled in over the buildings like bowling pins
We climbed over the wired fences
You dropped one of your contact lenses
Past the point of slumbering seals
Up the hill to the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheel

From up here I can see all the way to the royal palace
Where did you develop those hot-wiring talents?
I say, "My brother was an electrician
But when he was younger he had other ambitions"

I say, "If you're gonna write a song about this then please don't make it a sad song"
You say, "If you're gonna write a song about this then please don't make it a sad song"
I say, "If you're gonna write a song about this then please don't make it a sad song"
I say, "Okay, if I'm gonna write a song about this I promise I won't make it a sad song"
You'll go like this: woo!

Hot-wire the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheel

Hot-wire the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheel
Hot-wire the Ferris wheelEmbed
