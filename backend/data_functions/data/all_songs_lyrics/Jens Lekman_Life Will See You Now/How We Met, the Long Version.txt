How We Met, the Long Version LyricsNothing became something
Turned itself inside out
Subatomic particles became atoms, became stars, became galaxies
The earth's crust became solidified
The planets became perfectly aligned
Jupiter blinked with its little red eye
Oxygen replaced methane
A party started in the ocean
Trilobites and crustaceans
A Cambrian explosion
A conga line headed up on land
Out of the water and into the frying pan
A layer of iridium paved the way
For furry mammals with big, beautiful brains
The Congo River divided the chimpanzees
The peaceful bonobos from the ones like you and me
As soon we stood up, picked an apple from a tree
Someone pointed a finger, said, "That apple belongs to me."
And people fought and loved and died
And everywhere babies opened their eyes
And had their hearts broken, laughed, and cried
Watched the planets slowly collide
And one day I asked if I could borrow your bass guitar
Not that I needed one
But I didn't know where to start
One magic night in an empty backyard
You grabbed my arm and kissed me quick
Under a heaven full of stars
And that's the story of how we met
The long version
And you can call it fate or chance
But we made it happen
We made it happen, we made it happenEmbed
