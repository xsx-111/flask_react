Our First Fight LyricsWe just had our first fight
Unresolved, we head back out into the night
Putting my face back on as we drive
Not a word is spoken, not a blink of an eye
And in my head my thoughts go nuts
Maybe I should have kept my mouth shut
Maybe our love was hanging by a thread
Shouldn't have showed you how I really felt
At the restaurant with your friends (At the restaurant with your friends)
(At the restaurant with your friends)
Another discussion about some TV show that never ends
No, I haven't seen Season Three
God, I wish that you would just look at me
Then I feel your hand under the table
And you smile the smile that only you smile
I feel your hand under the table
And you smile the smile that only you smile
And you mouth out "I love you"
The way a parent spells out ice cream:
"I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U," like there's kids in the room, woo hoo
"I-L-O-V-E-Y-O-U," like there's kids in the room, hoo hoo hoo hooEmbed
