In The Morning LyricsI can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can't stop myself from falling
Falling back again
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
Dark like the shady corners
Inside a violin
Hot like to burn my lips
I know I can't win
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
I tried to quit you, but I'm too weak
Waking up without you, I can hardly speak at all
My girlfriend tried to help me
Get you off my mind
She tried a little tea and sympathy
To get me to unwind
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
Funny how my favorite shirt
Smells more like you than me
Bitter traces left behind
In stains that no one can see
In the morning
Baby, in the afternoon
You're gonna put me in an early grave
I know I'm your slave whenever you call
I can't stop myself from calling
Calling out your name
I can stop myself from falling
Falling back again
Falling back again
Falling back again
Falling back again
Falling back again
In the morning (Falling back again)
Falling back again
Baby, in the afternoon (Falling back again)
Falling back again
In the morning1Embed
