The Long Way Home LyricsWell, I stumbled in the darkness
I'm lost and alone
Though I said I'd go before us
And show the way back home
Is there a light up ahead?
I can't hold on very long
Forgive me, pretty baby
But I always take the long way home
Money's just something you throw
Off the back of a train
I got a head full of lightning
And a hat full of rain
And I know that I said
I'd never do it again
Oh and I love you, sweet baby
But I always take the long way home
I put food on the table
And a roof overhead
But I'd trade it all tomorrow
For the highway instead
Watch your back, if I should tell you
Love's the only thing I've ever known
One thing for sure, sweet baby
I always take the long way home
You know I love you, baby
More than the whole wide world
I'm your woman
You know you are my pearl
So let's go out past the party lights
Where we can finally be alone
Come with me
And we can take the long way home
Come with me
Together we can take the long way home
Come with me
Together we can take the long way homeEmbed
