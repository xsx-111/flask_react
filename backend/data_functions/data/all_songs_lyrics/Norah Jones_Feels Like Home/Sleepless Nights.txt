Sleepless Nights LyricsThrough the sleepless nights, I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh these sleepless nights will break my heart in two
Somehow through the days, I don't give in
I hide the tears that wait within
Oh but then through sleepless nights, I cry again
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I need you
I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh let it be, please let it be
Oh my love, please end these sleepless nights for me
Why did you go?
Why did you go?
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
I need you
I keep hoping you'll come back to me
Oh let it be, please let it be
Oh my love, please end these sleepless nights for me
Oh my love, please end these sleepless nights for meEmbed
