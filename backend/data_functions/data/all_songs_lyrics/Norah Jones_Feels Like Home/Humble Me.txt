Humble Me LyricsWent out on a limb, gone too far
I broke down at the side of the road
Stranded at the outskirts and the sun's creepin' up
Baby's in the backseat, still fast asleep
Dreaming of better days
I don't wanna call you, but you're all I have to turn to
What do you say when it's all gone away?
Baby, I didn't mean to hurt you
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when you want it to
You humble me, Lord
You humble me, Lord
I'm on my knees empty
You humble me, Lord
You humble me, Lord
So please, please, please forgive me
Baby Theresa, she's got your eyes
I see you all the time
When she asks about her daddy
I never know what to say
Heard you kicked the bottle
And you helped build a church
You carry an honest wage
Is it true you have somebody keeping you company?
What do you say when it's all gone away?
Baby, I didn't mean to hurt you
Truth spoke in whispers will tear you apart
No matter how hard you resist it
It never rains when you want it to
You humble me, Lord
You humble me, Lord
I'm on my knees empty
You humble me, Lord
You humble me, Lord
So please, please forgive me
You humble meEmbed
