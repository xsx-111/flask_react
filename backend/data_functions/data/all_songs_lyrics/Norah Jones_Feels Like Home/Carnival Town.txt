Carnival Town Lyrics
Round and round, carousel
Has got you under its spell
Moving so fast, but going nowhere

Up and down, ferris wheel
Tell me how does it feel
To be so high, lookin' down here

Is it lonely?
Lonely
Lonely

Did the clown make you smile?
He was only your fool for a while
And now he's gone back home
And left you wandering there

Is it lonely?
Lonely
LonelyEmbed
