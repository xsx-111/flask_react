Toes LyricsThe current is strong from what I've heard
It'll whisk you down the stream
But I never seem to have the time
So my toes just touch the water
My toes just touch the water
Daydreamed on the bank again
I was swimming with the fish
And I thought this time that it may be true
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
Walked a mile just to find the edge
Some place low enough to step right in
Now I'm here and I can't begin to move
Walked a mile just to find the edge
Some place low enough to step right in
Now I'm here and I can't begin to move
The spoiled sun up over there
It always has to have its way
And I know that the river's there to shelter me
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the water
My toes just touched the waterEmbed
