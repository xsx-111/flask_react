Those Sweet Words LyricsWhat did you say?
I know I saw you singin'
But my ears won't stop ringin'
Long enough to hear those sweet words
What did you say?
End of the day
The hour hand has spun
But before the night is done
I just have to hear those sweet words
Spoken like a melody
All your love is a lost balloon
Rising up through the afternoon
Till it could fit on the head of a pin
Come on in, did you have a hard time sleeping?
'Cause the heavy moon was keepin' me awake
And all I know is I'm just glad to see you again
See my love like a lost balloon
Rising up through the afternoon
And then you appeared
What did you say?
I know what you were singing
But my ears won't stop ringing
Long enough to hear those sweet words
And your simple melody
I just have to hear those sweet words
Spoken like a melody
I just wanna hear those sweet wordsEmbed
