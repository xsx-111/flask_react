The Prettiest Thing LyricsThe prettiest thing I ever did see
Was lightning from the top of a cloud
Moving through the dark
A million miles an hour with somewhere to be
So why does it seem like a picture
That's hangin' up on someone else's wall?
Lately I just haven't been myself at all
It's heavy on my mind
And I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
I still know
That the prettiest thing I ever did see
Was dusty as the handle on the door
Rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor
It looks like home to me
Now I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
Thinkin' of the prettiest thing
Dreamin'
