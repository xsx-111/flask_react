Boxcar Lyrics
"You're not punk and I'm telling everyone."
Save your breath, I never was one
You don't know what I'm all about
Like killing cops and reading Kerouac

My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones who used to call me friend
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out when you were passing out your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk? What's the score?

Got a friend, her name is Boxcar
Cigarettes and beer in El Sob
Her hair was blue, now it's green
I like her mind, she hates the scene

My enemies are all too familiar
They're the ones who used to call me friend
I'm coloring outside your guidelines
I was passing out when you were passing out your rules
One, two, three, four
Who's punk? What's the score?
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone
You're on your own
You're all alone1Embed
