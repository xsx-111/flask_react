Outpatient Lyrics
A little voice that's not quite your own
"Count backwards from ten."
Yellow jelly shot hard in vein
I want to talk to you again
"This is Jennings, your anesthetist."
"We think we'll go in through the mouth."
Watch the lights go from head to toe
Doped up and coasting down the hall

Now I'm talking through my pen
Do you read me?
Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding again?
Now I'm talking through my pen
Do you read me?
Am I bleeding?
Suddenly hear so clearly again

Wake up screaming so far from home
Incontinent off continent
The tears are warm
The body's numb
"Get your coat, your ride is here."
Now I'm talking through my pen
Do you read me?
Am I bleeding?
Suddenly hear so clearly again
Now I'm talking through my pen
Do you read me?
Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding again?Embed
