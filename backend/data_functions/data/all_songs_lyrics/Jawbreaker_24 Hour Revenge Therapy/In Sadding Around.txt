In Sadding Around Lyrics
Sleeping off the last five years takes another five
Recovery in lieu of being here right now
When I throw myself at your feet
You know it's to be walked on
We're breaking up every single night

If I had a choice don't you think I'd make it?
I lost my voice, I hope I didn't break it
Little demons by my bed whisper secrets
The kind you never hear

I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
You with a view so unlike my own
I'm trying on your eyes
So I let go, fall to the ground
It's a long way down again

Petty cons keep peeling back my ears
We make plans
Collaborate and give to you my better half
Until now just dead weight, a prisoner of doubt
In a cell, we kiss and tell all our keepsakes
I dip my toe in this cold, cold life
I want to dive but I can't find your feet
You with a view so unlike my own
I'm trying on your eyes
So I let go, fall to the ground
It's a long way down again

Sore, hit the floor
Got my first glimpse of the sky
The stars were on your side
Who would've thunk the thirteenth fell on Friday?
I say hello and it's goodbye againEmbed
