Jinx Removing Lyrics
Talked out and now I'm feeling crowded
All the errands in the world won't save us now
Rained in and I won't come unclouded
There's a stillness in the air
I pray for sound

We're too smart to watch TV
We're too dumb to make believe
This is all we want from life
And I'm too dumb to talk to you
You're so quick to listen to me
I'm saying nothing you don't know
Nothing you don't know

Walked out and I won't be rerouted
If I don't go outside today, I never will
Too old not to get excited
About rain and roads, Egyptian ruins
Our first kiss

We're too smart to watch TV
We're too dumb to make believe
This is all we want from life
And I'm too dumb to talk to you
You're so quick to listen to me
I'm saying nothing you don't know
I love you more than I ever loved anyone before, or anyone to come
Someone said your name
I thought of you alone
I was just the same twenty blocks away

Blew twelve and kissed the thirteenth finger
"Rabbit, rabbit" on the first
I hold my breath
Did tricks, I hoped you wouldn't notice
A superstitious hyperrealist
I'll make you mine

We're too smart to watch TV
We're too dumb to make believe
This is all we want from life
And I'm too dumb to talk to you
You're so quick to listen to me
I'm saying nothing you don't know

I love you more than I ever loved anyone before, or anyone to come
Someone said your name
I thought of you alone
I was just the same twenty blocks awayEmbed
