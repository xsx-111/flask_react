The Boat Dreams from the Hill Lyrics
Boat on a hill, never going to sea
Anchored to a fixer upper's dream
This boat is beat, never gonna be a boat now
Thirsty, sees the sea from high on the ice plant

He keeps patching it and painting
Thinking about his pension plan
But the boat is out to pasture
Seems it never had a chance

I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
Begin again

Boat remembers the carpenter's sure hand
Missing fishy flutter on its rudder
Sold at an auction, on a dolly ever since
Sometimes rainy days drop boyish wonder
He keeps patching it and painting
Thinking about his pension plan
But the boat is out to pasture
Seems it never had a chance

I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
I wanna be a boat
I wanna learn to swim
Then I'll learn to float
Then begin again
Begin again2Embed
