Ashtray Monument LyricsFree, alone
The predawn white light's coming on
Bottle on the nightstand
I count disasters on my free hands now
Run for cover there's a big one coming
You'll be lucky if you're at ground zero
No one said that this life was easy
Did that no one ever live a life this hard?
It gets hard, the bills are scattered in the yard
Ashtray monument
A life spent waiting in cement comes down
Run for cover there's a big one coming
You'll be lucky if it's got you number
No one said that this life was easy
Did that no one ever live a life this hard?
It gets hard, the bills are scattered in the yard
After all, it's not that bad
I still have pictures, I look back
At all the things that we once did
You said "I love you" I guess you did
Remember our life?
I did the dishes while you read out loud
Best friends, strangers now
Were our kids all we could call common ground?
After all, it's not that bad
I still have pictures, I look back
At all the things that we once did
You said "I love you" I guess you did1Embed
