Indictment Lyrics
I just wrote the dumbest song
It's gonna be a sing along
All our friends will clap and sing
Our enemies will laugh and be pointing

It won't bother me
What the thoughtless are thinking
I am more concerned with what we're drinking

They'll laugh about it at the warehouse
Saying I'm so lame
It wrote itself
You can keep the blame

It'll be a happy song
Not unlike some other ones
While everyone's depressed and broke
I get high off your sick jokes
(Ha ha ha)

They're colossal
They're tousling
All the worried hair
Stay up there
So crazy, it just might work
Then we'll quit our jobs
We could be the next group that you rob

There are times for being dumb
This must be one of them
I'd like to know what's so wrong with a stupid, happy song?

It says many things in its nothingness
It gives me space to think, I guess
To think less and less

Moving units and tracking charts
Will they ever learn?
It isn't who you know, it's who you burn

It means nothing
Selling kids to other kids
If you think we changed our tune, I hope we did2Embed
