Ache Lyrics
I believe in desperate acts
The kind that make you look stupid
(Look like a fool)
Just keep reinventing myself
It's move or die
(I change my form)
These days, the people I love are spread so far apart
(All out of reach)
It's a thin sheet across the face
(Cover me now)

That's pretty old
That's pretty old
"I never felt like this before."
I say that every hour
"I never felt like this before."
I say that every hour

It's never going to be like it could have been
Now it's just this room
(Window looks back)
You're a big part of it but I don't care
(You take the lead)
And can you really see me now like I made me?
(Made me anew)
Just like anyone at all
(Safer alone)
That's pretty old
That's pretty old
"I never felt like this before."
I say that every hour
"I never felt like this before."
I say that every hour

So right, so wrong
Another winter's coming on
You win, you lose
It's the same old news
(Some things go wrong so often)
Pick up the phone and punch your code
Somewhere, sometime, let me make you mine

Lean your head on mine like you used to
(Used to your lean)
I don't mind if you're faking it
(Make it seem real)
I'm not asking the questions
I'm not demanding the answers now
(Take what you give)
Right or wrong, just take me, lead me on
I'm going
(I'm giving up)
I'm going
So right, so wrong
Another winter's coming on
You win, you lose
It's the same old news
(These things go wrong so often)
Pick up the phone and punch your code
Somewhere, sometime, let me make you mineEmbed
