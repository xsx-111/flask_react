Sympathy for the Strawberry LyricsLet me introduce you
(Feel the wind so...)
Since you saw my shadow self
Living underneath you
(Over here)
She can't resist a tickle out
(I'm a girl scout
Searching for the new stuff)
Did I mention that it melts away
(All gone)
She puts a sign out
(I want a)
Out of order
(I want a building that stays)
Makes you strongly disobey
Guiding you away
(I promised you)
Chiding you away
So quick to hide when I turn around
She will rise just to embarass me
She likes to dance when it's dark inside
Just a flashlight there, for a guide
Try to catch me if you can
It's free and wild, watch where you stand
Below the net, desire it grows and grows
Like a strawberry not a rose
Prickly patch don't you stand on me
Squishing down in the mud
(In the mud)
Aah!
In your eyeEmbed
