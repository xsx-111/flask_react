Radical Adults  Lick Godhead Style Lyrics
Send the moon through the skylight
Bells together outrageously
Noiseball, flirtatious example
Bless her soul to further degree
Theater goddess, film destroyer
New York girls are sure to enjoy her
Fuzzy peach, teenage computer
A shocking figure in the eye of the universe

I am dead by the beauty of strangers
In horror my eye-head transforms them
Into smiling beatific roommates
From dust to dust they create rock and roll
Here comes something: you are Lou Reed
Transformer cracked by the backyard stream
Killer tunes, bubblegum disaster
Radical adults lick godhead styleEmbed
