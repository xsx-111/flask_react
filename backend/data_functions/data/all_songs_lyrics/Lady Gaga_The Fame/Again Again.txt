Again Again Lyrics
You gotta a lot, a lot of nerve
Comin' here when I'm still with him
And I can't have you
It isn't fair
Born March of '86
My birthday's comin', and if I had one wish
Yeah, you'd be it

When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

He never really saw me or waited
When we were hookin' up, yeah, he'd a never... last
Last week when I was sad
You said that you knew my eyes changed from kinda green to kinda blue, hey!
When you're 'round, I lose myself inside your mouth
You've got brown eyes like no one else
Baby, make it to me...

Again and again
Again, again, again, again
Never stop
Again and again
Again, again, a-a-again, again
Never stop, oh

They tell me
If I leave him, baby, would you be there?
'Cause maybe, you could be m-m-mine all the t-t-time2Embed
