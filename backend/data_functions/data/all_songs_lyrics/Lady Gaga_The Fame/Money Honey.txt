Money Honey Lyrics
That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy? I...

Damn, I love the Jag, the jet, and the mansion
Oh, yeah
And I enjoy the gifts and trips to the islands
Oh, yeah

It's good to live expensive, you know it, but
My knees get weak, intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy? I...
Damn, I'd love a boat by the beach on the West Coast
Oh, yeah
And I'd enjoy some fine champagne while my girls toast
Oh, yeah

It's good to live expensive, you know it, but
My knees get weak, intensive

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

You know I 'preciate the finer things
But it's not what makes me happiest, baby (I can do without it, babe)
Your tender loving's more than I can handle
Never burn out this candle, baby, baby
K-k-k-k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey

When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
When you give me k-kisses
That's money, honey
When I'm your lover and your mistress
That's money, honey
When you touch me, it's so delicious
That's money, honey
Baby, when you tear me to pieces
That's money, honey
That's M-O-N-E-why so sexy? I...2Embed
