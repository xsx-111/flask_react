Boys Boys Boys Lyrics
Hey there, sugar baby, saw you twice at the pop show
You taste just like glitter mixed with rock 'n' roll
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Know you think you're special when we dance real crazy
Glam-ophonic, electronic, disco, baby
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot

Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)

Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh

Baby is a bad boy with some retro sneakers
Let's go see The Killers and make out in the bleachers
I like you a lot, lot, think you're really hot, hot
Let's go to the party, heard our buddy's the DJ
Don't forget my lipstick, I left it in your ashtray
I like you a lot, lot, all we want is hot, hot
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)

I'm not loose, I like to party, let's get lost in your Ferrari
Not psychotic or dramatic, I like boys and that is that, it's
Love it when you call me legs, in the morning buy me eggs
Watch your heart when we're together, boys like you love me forever

Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh-whoa-oh
Oh, whoa-oh, uh, uh

Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)
Boys, boys, boys (We like boys in cars)
Boys, boys, boys (Buy us drinks in bars)
Boys, boys, boys with hairspray and denim
And boys, boys, boys (We love them, we love them!)5Embed
