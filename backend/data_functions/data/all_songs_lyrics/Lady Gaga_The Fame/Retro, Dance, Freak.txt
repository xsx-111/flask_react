Retro, Dance, Freak Lyrics
Hello, everybody
Get a ride to the West Side, kiss the girl with her tongue tied
Hello, everybody
Work it out 'cause you don't care, shutdown like software
Hello, everybody
Take a sip for the hip-hop if you look for the rest stop

We are just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux-disco scene

Retro, dance, freak (Retro, retro, dance)
Singin' retro dance beats (Retro, retro, freak)
Retro, dance, freak
Undercover, the girl needs a lover

What's up, everybody?
Take a ride on an airplane, take a bath in champagne
What's up, everybody?
Watch the girls all curtsy for the paparazzi
Let's go everybody
It's time that we rotate, 'cause it's gettin' real late
We are just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux-disco scene

Retro, dance, freak (Retro, retro, dance)
Singin' retro dance beats (Retro, retro, freak)
Retro, dance, freak
Undercover, the girl needs a lover
Retro, dance, freak (Retro, retro, dance)
Singin' retro dance beats (Retro, retro, freak)
Retro, dance, freak
Undercover, the girl needs a lover

Retro, dance, freak
Singin' retro dance beats
Retro, dance, freak
Undercover, oh, the girl, she needs a lover

We are just physical creatures of the underworld
She is the queen of the faux-disco scene

Retro, dance, freak (Retro, retro, dance)
Singin' retro dance beats (Retro, retro, freak)
Retro, dance, freak
Undercover, the girl needs a lover
Retro, dance, freak (Retro, retro, dance)
Singin' retro dance beats (Retro, retro, freak)
Retro, dance, freak5Embed
