Beautiful, Dirty, Rich Lyrics
Beautiful, dirty, dirty rich
Rich, dirty, dirty
Beautiful, dirty rich

Dirty, dirty rich
Dirty, dirty rich, beautiful
Beautiful and dirty
Dirty rich
Rich, dirty

We got a redlight
Pornographic dance fight
Systematic, honey
But we got no money
Our hair is perfect while we're all getting shit-wrecked
It's automatic, honey
But we got no money

Daddy, I'm so sorry
I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party
Like to p-p-party, yeah
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (dirty, dirty rich, dirty, dirty rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (beautiful and dirty, dirty rich, rich, bang, bang)

We live a cute life
Sound-fanatic
Pants tighter than plastic, honey
But we got no money
We do the dance right
We have got it made like
Ice cream topped with honey
But we got no money

Daddy, I'm so sorry
I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah
We just like to party
Like to p-p-party, yeah

Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (dirty, dirty rich, dirty, dirty rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (beautiful and dirty, dirty rich, rich, bang, bang)
Uh, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Beautiful
Dirty rich
Uh, bang, bang, bang
Bang, bang, bang
Beautiful
Dirty rich

Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (dirty, dirty rich, dirty, dirty rich, beautiful)
Bang, bang
We're beautiful and dirty rich (beautiful and dirty, dirty rich, rich, bang, bang)

Bang bang
(Dirty, dirty rich, dirty, dirty rich, beautiful)
Bang bang
(Beautiful and dirty, dirty rich, rich, bang, bang)4Embed
