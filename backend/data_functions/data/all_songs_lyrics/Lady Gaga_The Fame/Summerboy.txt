Summerboy Lyrics
One, two, three

Nowhere, yeah, we’re goin' nowhere fast
Maybe this time, I’ll be yours, you’ll be mine
C-c-c-crazy (Crazy), get your ass in my bed
Baby, you’ll be just my summer boyfriend (Summerboy)

Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top’s comin' o-o-off
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
I’ve got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after all
Ooh!

Sometimes you might start a fight
But I’m happy pretending we're alright
Sunglasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah, while checking out other guys (Summerboy)

Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top’s coming o-o-off
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
I’ve got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after all
Ooh!
Hey there, Summerboy, let’s go for a drive
Take me for a ride, never gonna close our eyes
Hey there, Summerboy, I’m a busy girl
Don’t got too much time, hurry up before I change my mind
Hey there, Summerboy, I’m taking off my heels
Let’s go for a run, have a little summer fu-u-un
Have a little summer fu-u-un
(Summerboy)

Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top’s poppin' o-o-off
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
You've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after
Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I've got my summer-summerboy
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up and I’m not around
I've got my summer-summerboy
And we’ll still have the summer after all
Ooh! Uh, huh
I've got my
Yes, I've got my
I've got my summer-summer boy
Ooh!6Embed
