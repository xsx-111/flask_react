Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) Lyrics
Cherry cherry, boom boom
Gaga

Boy, we've had a real good time
And I wish you the best on your way, eh-eh
I didn't mean to hurt you
I never thought we'd fall out of place, eh-eh, hey

I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, hey

Not that I don't care about you
Just that things got so compliqu√©es, eh-eh
I met somebody cute and funny
Got each other and that's money, eh, eh-eh, hey
I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
I wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, hey

Eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh-eh, eh-eh, hey, yeah
I had something that I love long, long
But my friends keepa' tellin' me that something's wrong
Then I met someone

And eh, there's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh
There's nothing else I can say
Eh-eh, eh-eh
Wish he never looked at me that way
Eh-eh, hey-eh-ey (Ooh, yeah)
There's nothing else I can say (Eh-eh)
Eh-eh (Eh-eh), eh-eh (Eh-eh)
I wish he never looked at me that way (Eh-eh)
Eh-eh (Eh-eh), eh-eh (Eh-eh)
There's nothing else I can say (Eh-eh)
Eh-eh (Eh-eh), eh-eh (Eh-eh)
Cherry cherry, boom boom
Eh-eh, hey
Oh yeah, all I can say is "eh-eh"4Embed
