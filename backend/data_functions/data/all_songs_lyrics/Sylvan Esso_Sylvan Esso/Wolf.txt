Wolf Lyrics
The modern wolf
He's kinder
But see him weep
It's a reminder
Don't wear no suit
We're talking t-shirts
See how he glides
Makes women shiver
Ah-woo
Ah-woo
He ain't no Jack
His voice is smoother
Been bending notes
Just like his father
Ah-woo
Ah-woo
But no birds or beast does he eat
He only wants the tenderest meat
And oh the sounds he makes them speak
Under all different patterns of sheets
Colors blind
Oh dopamine
And she looked so good when they were last seen
Ah-woo
Ah-woo
The modern wolf
The modern wolf
Drippin' in all the lives he took
He'll go on home
Try to wash them off
But when he shaves he hears them call
Ah-woo
