H.S.K.T. Lyrics

I've got a television
It's filling me with home
I've got a television
It's filling me with home
Wherever I end up
Wherever I roam
Hey, I've got a television
It filling me with home

I’ve got a phone it beeps
Lets me know I’m not alone
I’ve got a phone it beeps
Lets me know I’m not alone
Wherever I end up
I sleep like a stone, yeah
I got a phone it beeps
Lets me know I’m not alone

My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They're running everywhere in fancy clothes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My Head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They take me where I want to go
Bright
Young
Kinda hurt
Don’t you wanna get some?
Esso
Bright
Young
Hurt
Don’t you wanna get some?

My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They're running everywhere in fancy clothes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My Head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They take me where I need to go
And all around the party
We stand in circles numb
Yeah, all around the party
We stand in circles numb
Who can I find here
Who knows where I come from?
Oh, all around the party
We stand in circles numb

I had a thread before
Now I don’t know where it's gone
I had a thread before
Now I don’t know where it's gone
Oh how did I get here?
What did I say when I was young?
I had a thread before
Now I don’t know where it's gone

I've got a television
It's filling me with home
I've got a television
It's filling me with home
Wherever I end up
Wherever I roam
Hey, I've got a television
It's filling me with home
Bright
Young
Kinda hurt
Don’t you wanna get some?
Esso
Bright
Young
Hurt
Don’t you wanna get some?
(Wanna get, wanna get, wanna get...)

My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They're running everywhere in fancy clothes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They take me where I need to go
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They're running everywhere in fancy clothes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My head my shoulders
Knees and toes
My Head my shoulders
Knees and toes
They take me where I need to go5Embed
