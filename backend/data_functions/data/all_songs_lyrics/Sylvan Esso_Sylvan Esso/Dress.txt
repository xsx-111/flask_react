Dress Lyrics
We come to grips with our wrists
We come to sound with our mouths
We sing of what we think we know
Mother, father, skin and flowers
And we move just like the bird
Moving amidst the other birds
And we move just like the fish
Running away from larger
And I know I'm protecting the light I'm lacking
But oh you look like a morning star
Just see who we are
And I know you're protecting the light you're lacking
But oh you look like a morning star
Just see who we are

You look good in the west
See how you clap those hands
You look good in the south
See how you use your mouth
You look good in the east
All elbows and knees
Do the honey dipper
Do the silent shifter
Oh don't you know you want to
See that moon rise in the rear view
Just like you had wanted it to
Temperature drops
The hot tar it cools
The radio, the radio calling to you
Right out loud
She said it
Right out loud
They meant it
Sing that song like I know you can
Work your jaw like a blind man
Call that call like you own the land
Throw up your hands
Make demands

You look good in the west
See how you clap those hands
You look good in the south
See how you use your mouth
You look good in the east
All elbows and knees
Do the honey dipper
Do the silent shifter
You look good in the north
Whip your hair back and forth
You look good in the east
Don't hold the wall
Move your feet
You look good in the south
Make your makers proud
You look good in the west
You look good in a dress
I feel, I feel
I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel
I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel
I feel like a morning star
I feel, I feel
So, we can alive
We come to grips with our wrists
We come to sound with our mouths
We come to grips with our wrists
We come to sound with our mouths6Embed
