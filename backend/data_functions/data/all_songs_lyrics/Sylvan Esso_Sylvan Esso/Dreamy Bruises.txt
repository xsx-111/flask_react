Dreamy Bruises Lyrics
Ohio small road
Colored lights in the night
Find some hand to hold
Let the car coast with no lights
Oh e oh e oh the kids move so slow
Moon in the window
And no girls on the floor
Oh e oh e oh the kids move so slow
The dudes are wrapped around each other
Drinking up the sweat as water
Oh e oh e oh kids move so slow
Jump across the river
Gotta know where to go
Oh e oh e oh kids move so slow
Lift the smallest one up higher
Dreamy bruises welcome lovers
And they say, I want you
To see all the ways I can move
To see how my skin's so smooth
See how my blood runs blue
Pull at the hand that moves you
Taste the heartbeat
Don't fight
Let your limbs flail and move
Like you’re a wild thing
Doing right
And how can we question
What we know feels right?
Black eyes turn to marigolds
In the morning light
Oh e oh e oh the kids move so slow
Shaking all over like some dogs at the pool
Oh e oh e oh the kids move so slow
They’re kicking all the records over
Acting like they’ve heard New Order
Oh e oh e oh the kids move so slow
Down in the basement where the sun don’t show
Oh e oh e oh the kids move so slow
Lift the tallest one up higher
Dreamy bruises welcome lovers
And they say, I want you to bend me back in two
To make me sing your tune
To make those muscles move
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)
Fill me like the song do (oh e oh e oh)6Embed
