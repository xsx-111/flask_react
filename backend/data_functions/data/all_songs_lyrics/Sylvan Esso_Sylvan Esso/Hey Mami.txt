Hey Mami Lyrics
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking so fast
Oh our lady she don't know how she’s growing
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking like a babe, hey
Her image it lasts and I know
She floats along as she goes
She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound
Moving her body all around town
Hey, hey mami, hey, hey mami
I know what you want, I know what you want, I know what you want
Sooner or later the dudes at bodegas will hold their lips and own their shit
Comin' to terms on a chivalry tip
But our hero, she don't know the gravity she holds
As she pulls on the eyeballs of all the kids standing tall
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
Hey mami, I know what you want, mami
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walking so fast
Oh our lady she don’t know how she's growing
She walking so fast, she walking so fast, she walk like a babe, hey
Look at that ass and I know
She floats along as she goes
She owns the eyes as she flies right through the sound
Moving her body all around town
Hey, hey mami, hey, hey mami
I know what you want, I know what you want, I know what you want
Sooner or later the dudes at bodegas will hold their lips and own this shit
Comin' to terms on a chivalry tip
But our hero, she don't know the gravity she holds
As she pulls on the eyeballs of all the kids standing tall23Embed
