Uncatena Lyrics

I'm washing
With all my friends
In the kitchen
Drying dishes
Turning twisting
Until we can run out
Going swimming
I feel you behind me
Ringing bowls right next to my ear
Tone was so clear
So that we all could hear
When the water washed around us salty
Holding us dear

Did you ever say it?
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No, no, no, no

Skinny skinny skinny man
With a whale to hold his hand
Oh to trade the places fast
To be swallowed
Let it last
Let it last
Let it last
Let it last
I'm swimming with all my
Slippery beginnings
White linen, sheet twisting
Limbs clenched so hard
Mouth so insistent

Did you ever say it ?
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No, no
Oh no

“All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time”
All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time
All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time
All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time5Embed
