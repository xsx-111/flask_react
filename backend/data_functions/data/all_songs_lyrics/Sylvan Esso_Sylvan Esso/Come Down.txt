Come Down Lyrics
Hey Mama won’t you come down?
Hey Mama won’t you come down?
To the river to wade
To bathe
Hey Mama won’t you come down?
Hey Mama won’t you come down?
To the river to wade
To bathe
Oh wash my hair
Like you’ve washed my hair
For years and years
I’m going away
Oh wash my hair
Like you’ve washed my hair
For years and years
I’m going away
There’s a man I know
I think he loves me so
Finally
I’m going away
So Mama won't you come down?
Hey Mama won't you come down?
To the river to wade
To batheEmbed
