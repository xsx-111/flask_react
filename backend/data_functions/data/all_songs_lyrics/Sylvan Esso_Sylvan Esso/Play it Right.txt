Play it Right Lyrics
When the sounds
Come together so close to my face
It's no wonder we wonder what's taking place
Oh, we feel like an animal in the night
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right

Oh, if my ears were as big as the ocean I could hear
All of your devotion
I would be
More than a small human with her head
Pressed against your mouth in motion
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
And we will move
Just like we're in a movie
We will speak
So warm and smoothly
We are like the people we came from
Oh we are
Dancing and advancing to the light
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
Play it right
