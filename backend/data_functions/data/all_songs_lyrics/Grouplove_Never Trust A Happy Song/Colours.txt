Colours Lyrics
I am a man, man, man, man up, up in the air
And I run around, 'round, 'round, 'round this town, town
And act like I don't care
So when you see me flying by the planet's moon
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know I'm just like you

Huh, ha
Huh, ha
Huh, ha
Huh, ha

So I pull the switch, the switch, the switch inside my head
And I see black, black, green, and brown
Brown, brown, brown and blue, yellow violets, red
And suddenly a light appears inside my brain
And I think of my ways, I think of my days
And know that I have changed

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands
So mistress, mistress have you been up to the roof?
He shot himself, self, there's blood on the wall
'Cause he couldn't face the truth
Oh, knock that down, leave the ground and find some space
And tell your friends, friends, you'll be back again, â€“gain
Before it's too late

It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad


Whoa
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
It really ain't that bad
It's the colors you have
No need to be sad
You've still got your hands

So I am a man, man, man, man up, up in the air
And I float around, 'round, 'round, 'round this town, town
And know I shouldn't care
So when you see us there, there out in the open road
You don't need to explain if everything's changed
Just know that you don't know
We call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
We can't call it at all
Yeah, we call it life
Oh yeah, that's what we call it
When you can't call it at all
Yeah, we call it
Oh
That's right, we call it
Oh
We do it for love, sweet love13Embed
