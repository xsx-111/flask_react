Lovely Cup LyricsYou're such a lovely cup
Why don't cha fill me up
All these reasons too hard to explain
So I'll drink you up my dear
We got it all right here
Here is now and now is where I wanna be
Allora si (sha la la, sha la la) you belong to me 
And I had to get away from this here masquerade
Comes a time when a man loses his mind
It's such a mystery my my philosophy
What to do when we do have some time
Allora si (sha la la, sha la la) you belong to me
Allora so, never let you go 
Oh hey yeah, hey yeah
Oh hey yeah, hey yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, ohh
Yeah yeah yeah, ohh
You're such a lovely cup (You're such a lovely cup)
Why don't you fill me up (Why don't cha fill me up)
You're such a lovely cup (You're such a lovely cup)
Why don't cha fill me up (Why don't cha, why don't cha)
You're such a lovely cup (Why don't cha, why don't cha)
Why don't cha fill me up (Why don't cha, why don't cha)
You're such a lovely cup (Why don't cha, why don't cha)
Why don't cha fill me up
You're such a lovely cup 
Why don't cha fill me up 
You're such a lovely cup
Why don't you fill me up
Oh hey yeah, hey yeah
Oh hey yeah, hey yeah3Embed
