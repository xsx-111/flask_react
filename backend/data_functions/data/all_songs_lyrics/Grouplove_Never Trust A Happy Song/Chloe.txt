Chloe LyricsDim the lights, dim the lights, dim the lights, low
You can come and join me, sit around the piano
You can light the fire, open up the window
You can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling
Call my name, call my name, call my name out
You can find the key and I can find the way out
Honestly, tell me, tell me what you like
I can sit awake from midnight to daylight
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling

Chloe, I don't need a reason
Well, I'm bound by the sweet condition
Chloe, we don't need permission
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do
Dim the lights, dim the lights, dim the lights, low
You can come and join me, sit around the piano
You can light the fire, open up the window
You can make a choice by seeing where the wind blows
You can watch me sleeping and I can watch you dreaming
You can change the channel and I can change the feeling
Chloe, I don't need a reason
Well, I'm bound by the sweet condition
Chloe, we don't need permission
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do
You can find me in a web outside
I'm waiting here to be untied
We can fly through the sky tonight
You can have everything
Let me say one more time:
Chloe, I don't need a reason
Well, I'm bound by the sweet condition
Chloe, we don't need permission
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do
We can go where we wanna go
Say what we wanna say, and
Do what we wanna do3Embed
