Love Will Save Your Soul LyricsWalkin' down the street now you so bold (so bold)
Seen your mom and dad and they're so cold (so cold)
Love will save your soul (your soul)
Of feelin' so alone and growing old
Climb on up them stairs man you got sold
Lost my train of thought and now I'm told
That love will save your soul
Of feelin' so alone and growing old
Love (ha) love (ha) love
Oh yeah love (ha) love (ha) love
Got a sneaking sense your hunt's for gold
Teachers crackin' rules and now parole
But love will save your soul
Of feelin' so alone and growing old
Love (ha) love (ha) love
Oh yeah love (ha) love (ha) love (oh!)
Love will always save your soul (your soul)
Love will always save your soul (your soul)
Love will save your soul
Love will save your soul
Love will always save your so-oh-ul
Oh Love will always save your so-oh-ul
Oh Love will save your soul
Oh love will save your soul
Love will always save your so-oh-ul
Oh Love will always save your so-oh-ul
Oh Love will save your soul
Love will save your soul3Embed
