Cruel and Beautiful World Lyrics
Go ahead and close the door
I'll stand outside in the rain
A little bird just told me so
It's time to start over again
So I'll man up and take this boat
Far away from these shores
And I'll reach behind an enemy line
And find my curable cure

'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
And I got my girl
And if it seems like we're falling behind
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind

I buried a treasure far off near the desert
I'm trying to find my way there
It's been too long since I've been myself
And my eyes can't see anymore
But there's a song inside this heart of mine
And I'd like to sing it to you
'Cause there's an earthquake shaking inside my country
Now what am I gonna do?
'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world
And I got my girl
And if it seems like we're falling behind
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mind
Hey
'Cause it's a cruel and beautiful world (Cruel and beautiful world)
And I got my girl (He's got his girl)
And if it seems like we're falling behind (Seems like we're falling behind)
Or just slipping on top from the mouths of our mindEmbed
