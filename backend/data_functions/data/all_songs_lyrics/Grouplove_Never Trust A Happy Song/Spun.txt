Spun Lyrics
I want it rag-tag life in a bag
I've been sleeping in a bus mistrust singing lalalala (ooh)
I got the feeling I was nickel and dimed
That was probably in line for the semiconscious state of mind (ooh)
Rush, rush, rush for the gold dust scattered too much
I'm sippin cocktails, fish scales, falling for love
I'm falling for love

Reason reason reason, is goneâ€¦.Don't go!

Spun (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Don't go (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Yeah reason, reason, reason is gone! (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
I'm spun (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)

I want it rag-tag love in a bag
Volume five, drip dry, Lo-Fi, singing lalalala
Rush, rush, rush down in the sound
It's your ride, top side, high tide
Free falling below
I'm falling for love
Reason reason reason is gone... so long!

Spun (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
I'm gone (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
Yeah reason, reason, reason is gone (are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
I'm spun
(Are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)
(Are you lost son, are you, are you lost son?)

HA, HA, HA! SPUN Oooohh ohhhh ooohEmbed
