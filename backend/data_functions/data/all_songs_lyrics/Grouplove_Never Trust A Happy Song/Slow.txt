Slow Lyrics (3x)
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
But it’s you who brought me here
You, through all these years
 (2x)
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
But it’s you who brought me here
It’s you and all your cheers
You who brings a fear
You, through all these years
 (4x)
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
Time moves slow
Time moves slow5Embed
