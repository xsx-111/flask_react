Naked Kids LyricsCruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
And we're rolling up to sand
Take your shoes off, man
We are skinny dipping underneath the sea
And it's a chicken fight clan
Throw your dukes up, "wham!"
We are splashing in the water to the beat
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
(WeeeoooowhooOOOooooOOO)
Crossing sandy dunes
Hot day, mid-June
Naked kids, running wild, and free
It's summer time fun, relax and stay young
You could be home, with Oprah Winfrey
The water feels nice, dive deep down under
The ships, and treasures make reef
Just one of those days, had a blue, perfect wave
Come out, and join. You'll see
We are lying in the sun, when we're done find a towel
Now we're thinking of where we're gonna eat
Back corner table, order lobsters and Black Label
Raise your glasses, here's to living out our dreams
(Uuuuuhhhhhhnnnn)
Cruising down the highway with my friends, top down
And we're all on our way to the beach
And everyone keeps laughing at those cars we are passing
As we're sucking down that funny, funny weed
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah1Embed
