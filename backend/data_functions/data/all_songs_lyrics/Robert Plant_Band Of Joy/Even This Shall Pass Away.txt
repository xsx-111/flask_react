Even This Shall Pass Away LyricsOnce in Persia reigned a king
Who upon his signet ring
Graved a maxim true and wise
Which, if held before his eyes
Gave him counsel at a glance
Fit for every change and chance
Solemn words, and these are they
"Even this shall pass away."
Trains of camels through the sand
Brought him gems from Samarcand
Fleets of galleys through the sea
Brought him pearls to rival these
But he counted not his gain
Treasures of the mine or main
"What is wealth?" the king would say
"Even this shall pass away."
In the revel of his court
At the zenith of his sport
When the palms of all his guests
Burned with clapping at his jest
Amid his figs and wine, he cried
"O loving friends of mine;
Pleasures come, but not to stay
'Even this shall pass away."
Towering up above the square
Way up high into the air
Rose his statue, carved in stone
All disguised, unknown
Gazing at his sculptured name
Asked himself, "What is fame?
Fame is but a slow decay
And even this shall pass away."
Sick and tired and frail, finished being old
Stood in line outside the Gates of Gold
Speaking with his dying breath
"Life is done, so what is Death?"
Then in answer to the king
I felt a sunbeam on his ring
Blinding light will fade to gray
'Cause even this shall pass away
Even this shall pass away
Even this shall pass
Even this shall pass away
Away
