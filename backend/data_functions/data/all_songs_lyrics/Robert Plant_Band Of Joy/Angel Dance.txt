Angel Dance Lyrics
Good night, sleep tight
The big bright sun has gone away
Done gone away
Goodbye, don't cry
Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
We can run and play

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning calls, uh
Little angel dance
Little angel dance

Big night, bright lights
Time now to lay them all to rest
Put 'em all to rest
Bad guys, mean eyes
All gone away to where they belong
Let's just sing our song

And they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't you go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall
Let them cry till the morning calls, ah
Little angel dance
Hey, little angel dance, oh yeah
Little angel dance
Good night, sleep tight
The big bright sun has gone away
Done gone away
Goodbye, don't cry
Tomorrow will bring us a brand new day
We can run and play

Ah, and they'll laugh up and down the hall
Don't go shout when you hear them fall
Let them fly right across the wall, oh
Let them cry till the morning calls, uh
Little angel dance
Little angel dance
Little angel dance
Come on, come on and dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
