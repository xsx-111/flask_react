Central Two-O-Nine LyricsWaiting on the long, black train
Blues fell down like showers of rain
Let me hear that whistle blow
Take me back to my baby's door
Just call up Central 209
Get my baby on the line
Bring me my pony, my black mare
Find my rider in the world somewhere, well well
Fold my arms, I walk away
Troubled more everyday
Woman crazy, 'round and 'round
Dig my soul deep in the ground
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ahEmbed
