The Only Sound That Matters LyricsWhy are my words running together
I thought you'd anchor me down
Oh, forget all that, let's get out
Tonight it's you and me
Looking for the only sound that matters
Sometimes you're so misleading
Sometimes you just feel right
Put me to sleep so easily or keep me out all night
Looking for the only sound that matters
Is there one in here
Looking for the only sound that matters
And it's drawn to you like a compass
That's leading you on like a back light too
It's your protection
It's leaving it on
Waiting for your return the only sound that matters
Oh, put me to sleep so easily or keep me out all night
Looking for the only sound that matters
Was it what you thought
Just looking for the only sound that mattersEmbed
