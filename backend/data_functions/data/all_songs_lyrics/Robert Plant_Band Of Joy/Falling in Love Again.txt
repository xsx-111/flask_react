Falling in Love Again LyricsI'm falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
It might break my heart
It might even tear it apart
But I'm falling in love again, oh
I'm thinking of no one but you every day
I'm thinking of no one but you every day
I think of you all the time
Oh, darling please be mine
Yes, I'm falling in love again
Oh, this is what love will do for you
It will make you cry sometimes
Oh, it will make you walk and don't know where you're going
It will make my heart feel like burnin'
And I don't know for certain
Just why it's happening this way
I promised myself yesterday
I'm falling in love again, yeah
I hope you don't break my heart no more
I hope you don't break my heart
Say you love me all the time
Oh darling, please be mine
And I'm falling in love again
Yes, I'm falling in love again
Falling in love again
I'm falling in love again
Falling in love again, ohEmbed
