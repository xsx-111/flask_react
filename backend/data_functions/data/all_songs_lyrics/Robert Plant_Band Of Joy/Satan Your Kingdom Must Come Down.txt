Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down LyricsSatan, your kingdom must come down
Satan, your kingdom must come down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Satan, your kingdom must come down
I'm gonna pray till they tear your kingdom down
Pray till they tear your kingdom down
I heard the voice of Jesus say
Satan, your kingdom must come down
Satan, your kingdom must come down
Satan, your kingdom must come down
I heard the voice of Jesus Christ
Satan, your kingdom must come downEmbed
