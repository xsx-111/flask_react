House of Cards Lyrics
Oh, the rain is falling
And the wild wind roars
It'll shake your windows
And it will rattle your doors

Oh, blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

They're washing the streets (blow blow down)
With the blood of your kind (blow blow down)
Ah, just look over your shoulder (blow blow down)
They are right behind (blow blow down)

Oh, blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards

And the birds are wheeling
Up above your head
And your days are numbered
And you're as good as dead
This is a very fine house
Of great renown
But it's cracked and it's shaking
Oh, it comes tumbling, tumbling, tumbling down

Oh, blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Blow down this house of cards
Oh, blow down this house of cards
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
