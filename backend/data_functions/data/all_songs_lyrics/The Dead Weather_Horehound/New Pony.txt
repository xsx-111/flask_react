New Pony Lyrics
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer (How much longer)
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer (How much how much, how much longer)
She broke her leg and needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it hurted her

Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X (How much longer)
Sometimes I wonder what's going on with Miss X(How much how much, how much longer)
She's got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the girl's gonna do to me next


Everybody say you're using voodoo, your feet walk by themselves
Everybody say you're using voodoo, I've seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh, baby, that god you're praying to is gonna give you back what you're wishing on someone else

Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
Come over here pony, I wanna climb up one time on you
Well, you're so nasty and you're so bad - I say I love you, I do

How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much
How much, how much1Embed
