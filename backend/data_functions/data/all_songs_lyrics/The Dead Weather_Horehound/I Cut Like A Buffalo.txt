I Cut Like A Buffalo Lyrics
Yeah, you know I look like a woman but I
Cut like a buffalo
Stand up like a tower, tall
Then I fall just like a domino

Yes, well, you can do me if you want to, hey
Do whatever makes you happy
You should try to take it easy on me
'Cause I don't know how to take it

You're a prick with a pin woman, yeah

Wake me up when you're broke
Only if it's broken
You know I treat you like a joke but you
Can't tell when I'm jokin'

Yeah, you cut a record on my throat, yeah
But the record's not broken
Cut a record on my throat, yeah
But the record's not broken
Is that you chokin'
Is that you chokin'?
Is that you chokin'
Hey! Or are you just jokin'?

Yeah, you know I look like a woman but I
Cut like a buffalo

Wake me up when it's broke
Just like a woman
Cut a record on my throat then you
Break me wide open

Is that you chokin' with me?
Hehe, yeah

You can hit me if you have to
Whatever makes you happy
But don't take it easy on me
I'll never take it easy
Yeah, you know I look like a woman but I
Cut like a buffalo
Stand up tall like a tower, then I
Fall like a domino

You're a prick with a pin, woman
Push it into my skin girl
I'm a prick when I sin and I
Know I can't win

Yeah, I look like a woman and I
Cut like a buffaloEmbed
