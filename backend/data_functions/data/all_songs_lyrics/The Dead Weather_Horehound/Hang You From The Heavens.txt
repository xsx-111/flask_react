Hang You From The Heavens Lyrics
I never know how to treat you
You think I love you but it ain't true
I'm walking away now
One step forward and back two

I like to grab you by the hair
And hang you up from the heavens

I don't know how to let you go
Or if i should keep you
I don't know how to let you know
I really don't got a reason

I like to grab you by the hair
And drag you to the devil

I never know why I push you
Trash you just to confuse you
I make a hole just to see how
See through clean I can cut you
I like to grab you by the hair
And hang you up from the heavens


I like to grab you by the hair
And sell you up to the devil

I never know what mood you be
Be mine, be kind, but be cruel to me
I'm walking away now
One step forward and back three

I never know what I'm gonna to do
I say I'm leaving but it ain't true
I got a lot I could do to you, yeah
Nothing you can do to stop it

I want to grab you by the hair
I want to grab you by the hair
I want to grab you by the hair
And hang you up from the heavens1Embed
