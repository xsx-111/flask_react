So Far From Your Weapon Lyrics
There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And the place you were born
There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And you want to go home

I tried to give you whiskey but it never do work
(I tried to give you whiskey but it never do work)
Suddenly, you're beggin' me to do so much worse
(Suddenly, you're beggin me to do so much worse)
But I knew it from the get go the bullet was cursed
(But I knew it from the get go the bullet was cursed)
Ever since I had you every little thing hurts
(Ever since I had you every little thing hurts)

You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?
You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

You dream of seeing fire in them hills
But you better wipe that smile from your lips
Which of us will be the one to go?
(Which of us will be the one to go?)
He who hits the road's the one who lives
(He who hits the road's the one who lives)
You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?
You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?

There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And the place you were born
There's a bullet in my pocket burning a hole
You're so far from your weapon
And you want to go home

You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?
You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?
You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?
You wanna get up? Let go? I say no
You wanna get up? Let go?2Embed
