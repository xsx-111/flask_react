Rocking Horse Lyrics
I drank some dirty water, shook evil hands
I've done some bad things and they get easier to do
And then I wrote a nasty letter and I sent it to the Lord
I said don't you dare come and bother me no more
Oh-oh, oh oh oh

I had a good friend I could only destroy
And lovers I loved less than anybody could afford
Yes but this old rocking horse just nods his head
And he's gonna rock back and forth the way that he always did
Oh-oh, oh oh oh

Baby don't you bother tasting the water
And baby don't you bother coming closer to me
When you see my eyes they're half the size
And I'm not able to look at you
No, no
Oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh-oh, oh oh oh1Embed
