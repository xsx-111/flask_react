Will There Be Enough Water? Lyrics
Will there be enough water when my ship comes in?
Water when my ship comes in?
Will there be water when my ship comes in?

And when I set sail will there be enough wind?
And when I set sail will there be enough wind?
And when I set sail will there be enough wind?
Cool water,  oh cool wind

Just because you caught me, does that make it a sin?
Yeah, just because you caught me, does that make it a sin?
Cool water and the cool wind

Enough water when my ship comes in?
Be enough water when my ship comes in?
Oh when I set sail will there be enough wind? Yeah
Oh cool water, yeah, and a cool wind
Just because you caught me, does it make it a sin?
Just because you caught me, does that make it a sin?1Embed
