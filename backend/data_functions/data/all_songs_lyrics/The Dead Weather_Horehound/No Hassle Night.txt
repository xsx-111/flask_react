No Hassle Night Lyrics
I'm looking for a place to go
Where the sun goes down and stays down
I'm looking for a place to go
Where I can lay low, die slow

My baby, she's uptight
Her face is frozen in daylight
My darlin' she's a drifter
Nothing out there seems to fit her

I'm looking for a no hassle night
I've become her and it hurts my mouth
I'm looking for a no hassle night
I've become her and it hurts my mind
I'm looking for a no hassle night

My baby, she's a burglar
Nothing I know can deter her
I'm looking for a place to go
Were the sun goes down, I can lie low2Embed
