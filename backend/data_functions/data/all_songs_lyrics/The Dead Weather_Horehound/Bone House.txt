Bone House Lyrics
I build a house for your bones
I build a house, I build a home
I build a house for your bones
I build a house, I build a home

I wrote a song, go on and listen
That's all you'll hear when I go missing
I wrote a song, go on and listen
That's all you'll hear when I go missing

Always get
Always get the things I want

I make a nest for your hair
I lay you down, I lay you there
I build a ship, I sink or sail
At every tooth and every nail

Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want

I put your heart in a vault
That's how I get the things I want
I put your heart in a vault
That's how I get the things I want

I lay a road for your mind
So your mind can go go go go
I lay a road for your mind
So your mind can go go go go

Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want
Always get the things I want

I build a house, I build a home
I build a house for your bones
I build a house for your bones
I build a house, I build a home2Embed
