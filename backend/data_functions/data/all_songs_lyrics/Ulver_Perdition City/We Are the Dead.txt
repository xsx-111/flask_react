We Are the Dead LyricsGhosts presence, ghost music in the radio at night
When you can't sleep, in the line of shadows
Around the glowing red eye
Voices that talk and talk towards nothing
So that nothing's hollow role shall not slide
In on the scene in the solitary theater
And the voices laugh loud, so the candles flicker
And go out, without noticing how dark it becomes
And he who records the voices of the spirits
Of the dead. On the tape filled with buzz and
Cosmic noise you can hear their remote voices
Form German words; they say: Wir sind die Toten
Which is true, whoever they might be
The total inaccessibility of silence, it shines in the
Wallmirror when you've left, and disappears
When you return. No silence in death's silenceEmbed
