Dead City Centres LyricsYou're taking a ride to the underworld
Where death lurks in dark corners
And trouble is never far away
Wild gangs rule by fear and prey on the weak
Lone killers haunt the highways
And dark forces move through the shadows
In this lowlife realm of freaks and psychos
Only the tough or the streetwise survive
And you might be big, but to stay big
You've got to keep moving, stay sharp and hit first
Enter a deadly future where no prisoners are taken
And the killing never stops
Enter the underworldEmbed
