Do I Still Figure in Your Life? LyricsHey there, what'cha gonna do now
You made yourself some new friends, knocking around
But all those wild people
You know they make me nervous
When the things you said cut me like a knife
Do I still figure in your life
Hey hey hey
Do I still figure in your life
Hey there, well I hardly even know your face
It's got a brand new look about it
That's hard to trace
The way you look
The way you're smiling, yeah
To think I once took you for my wife
Do I still figure in your life
Hey hey hey
Do I still figure in your life
Hey there, well I hardly even know your face
It's got a brand new look about it
That's hard to trace
The tender way you look
The way you're smiling
To think I once took you for my wife
Do I still figure in your life
Hey hey hey
Do I still figure in your lifeEmbed
