Sandpaper Cadillac LyricsRiding along in a sandpaper Cadillac
Somebody's strikin' a match on the back
Brimstone lines marring the body so fair
Brimstone lines marring the body so fair
Slowly, my mind and dream change into woe, now
My car is dead and gone, Lord
And I just can't carry on
Changing, my thoughts become so clear to me
My car wants to be free, I know
And it's calling out to me, yeah
Walking along with a gold-plated pussycat
Somebody's pouring blood on its back
Paint that has pierced all the pores in his hide
Paint that has pierced all the pores in his hide
Slowly, my mind and dream change into woe, now
My cat is all alone, I know it
And it hasn't got a bone
Changing, my thoughts become so clear to me
My cat begins to sleep
And it's sleeping 'round with me
Don't you know I need that thing so bad
My car and my cat are going bad
And I need everything I can, Lady
Aaaaa! Oh, no no, this can't be the same, no
They're gonna meet me once again, yeah
They're gonna meet me once again, LordEmbed
