Many Rivers to Cross LyricsMany rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I'm lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of Dover
Many rivers to cross
And it's only my will that keeps me alive
I've been ripped, washed up for years
And I merely survive because of my pride
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My women left me but she wouldn't say why
Guess I'll just break right down and cry
Many rivers to cross
But just where to begin
I'm playing for time
There've been times I find myself
Thinking of committing some terrible crime
Still this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's such a drag to be on your own
My girl left me but she wouldn't say why
Guess I'll just break right down and cry
Many rivers to cross
But I can't seem to find my way over
Wandering I am lost
As I travel along the white cliffs of DoverEmbed
