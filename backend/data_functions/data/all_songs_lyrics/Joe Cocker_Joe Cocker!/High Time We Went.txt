High Time We Went LyricsWell, it's five o'clock in the morning
Feel just like the end of a mule
Somebody's been yawning
Trying to break out the rules
Yes, it's high time we went
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went there?
Ain't it high time we went?
Well, it's four o'clock in the morning
Somebody's shouting the news
Nobody's been yawning
Preachers all around for the blues
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Three o'clock and I'm dreaming
Somebody's shouting the way
Nobody can see me
Trying to find a brand new day
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Two o'clock and I'm rolling
Everywhere I look is the same
Somebody's been calling
Trying to put the blame on my name
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
It's one o'clock and I'm falling
Falling for the same old game
Somebody's been shouting
Let me be by the stage
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Well, it's twelve o'clock and I got there
Didn't think I'd make it in time
Somebody's been shouting
"Don't forget the lemon and lime"
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?
Ain't it high time we went?Embed
