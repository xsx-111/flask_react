Something LyricsThere's something in the way she moves
That attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how
There's something in the way she smiles
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the way she smiles for me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, no I don't know
Just stick around and let it show
I don't know, oh I don't know
There's something in the way she moves
That attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, no I don't know
Just stick around and let it show
I don't know, oh I don't know
There's something in the way she smiles
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the way she smiles for me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in howEmbed
