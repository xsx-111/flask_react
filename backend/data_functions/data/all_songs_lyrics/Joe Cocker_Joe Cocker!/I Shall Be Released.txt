I Shall Be Released LyricsThey say evrything can be replaced
Yet evry distance is not near
So I remember evry face
Of evry man who put me here
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
They say evry man needs protection
They say evry man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be releasedEmbed
