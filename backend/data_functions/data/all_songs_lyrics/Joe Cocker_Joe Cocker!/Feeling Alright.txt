Feeling Alright LyricsSeems I've got to have a change of scene
Every night I have the strangest dream
Imprisoned by the way I could have been
Left here on my own or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and took the key
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself, no
Yes, sir
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself, no
Boy, you sure took me for one big ride
And even now I sit and I wonder why
That when I think of you
I stop myself from crying
I just can't waste my time
I must get down
Got to stop believing in all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die, hey
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself, yeah
Oh no
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good, little girl
Mmhmm
Don't you get too lost in all I say
Yeah, but at the time you know I really felt that way
But that was then and now you know it's today
I can't get safe so I guess I'm here to stay
Till someone comes along and takes my place
With a different name and a different face
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself, yeah
Feeling alright
Hey, I'm not feeling that good myself
Oh, you feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling that good myselfEmbed
