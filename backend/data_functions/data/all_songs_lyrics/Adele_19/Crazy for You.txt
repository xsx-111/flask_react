Crazy for You Lyrics
Found myself today singin' out loud your name
You said I'm crazy, if I am, I'm crazy for you
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head and
Turn me into a crumblin' fool

Tell me to run and I'll race
If you want me to stop I'll freeze
And if you want me gone, I'll leave
Just hold me closer, baby
And make me crazy for you
Crazy for you

Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away
But the more I do
The crazier I turn into
Pacing floors and opening doors
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me, boy
Because I'm too crazy for you
Crazy for you8Embed
