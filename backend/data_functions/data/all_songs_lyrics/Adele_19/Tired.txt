Tired Lyrics
Hold my hand
While you cut me down
It'd only just begun
But now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments
With your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle
Watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes
You were smiling in the spotlight
Dancing with the night
The night fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired

Where'd you go
When you stay behind
I looked up and inside down
And outside only to find
A double taking, punching hard
And laughing at my smile
I get closer
You obviously prefer her
I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Hey, I'm tired

I should have known

Never mind
Said your open arms
I couldn't help believe
It tricked me back into them

Even though I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy, I'm tired6Embed
