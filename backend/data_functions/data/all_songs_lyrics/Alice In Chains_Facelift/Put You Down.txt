Put You Down Lyrics
Heartbreaker, feeling alright
Body over mind, it's slower
Reduction is addictive too
Personality overview

I can see what the cost will be
You know, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
I can see what it all means to me
Honey, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
Can't put you down

Hard drinker, feeling uptight
Your maker, mine, it's slower
Reduction is addictive too
Personality overview

I can see what the cost will be
You know, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
I can see what it all means to me
Honey, I don't need you
I just can't put you down
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down
Put you down, down, down, gonna put you down, down

Everything you buy is for the jingle
Every time you lie it's all the same
Ooh, if you need a rhyme to kill the singer
Shoot me dead before I may be through1Embed
