We Die Young Lyrics
Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way

Watch where you spit
I'd advise you wait until it's over
Then you got hit
And you should've known better

And we die young
Faster we run

Down, down, down you're rolling
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

And we die young
Faster we run

Scary's on the wall
Scary's on his way
Another alley trip
Bullets seek the place to bend you over
Then you got hit
And you should've known better
Faster we run
And we die young3Embed
