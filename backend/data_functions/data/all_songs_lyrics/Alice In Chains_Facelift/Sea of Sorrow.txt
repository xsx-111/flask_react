Sea of Sorrow Lyrics
Mind of destructive taste
I choose to stroll amongst the waste
That was your heart lost in the dark
Call off the chase
Walls of thought, strong and high
As my castle crumbles with time
I think of you, oh, yes I do
Such a crime

You opened fire and your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow
You, I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

Lines cut across my face
Why you laugh at my disgrace, I'll never know
How far to go to reach that place
You opened fire and your mark was true
You opened fire
Aim my smiling skull at you
You opened fire

I live tomorrow
You, I'll not follow
As you wallow
In a sea of sorrow

I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow
I live tomorrow, you do not follow
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow6Embed
