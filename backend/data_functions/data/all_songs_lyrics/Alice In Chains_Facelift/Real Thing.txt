Real Thing Lyrics
I messed around as a little boy
I grew up, made the blade my new toy
Friends said "boy, with what you screwing around?"
I said "don't concern yourselves and just give me another blast"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more
Even if you say just one more
I won't leave you alone, ooh

I grew up, went into rehab
You know the doctors never did me no good
They said, "Son, you're gonna be a new man"
I said, "Thank you very much and can I borrow fifty bucks?"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more
Even if you say just one more
I won't leave you alone, ooh
Because I'm going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line straight to nowhere
Going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line straight to nowhere

I messed around as a little boy
I grew up, made the blade my new toy
Friends said, "Boy, with what you fuckin' around?"
I said, "Oh my God, and here we go again"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Under the hill, with just a few notches on my belt
Take it away, don't want no more, no more
Even if you say just one more
I won't leave you alone, ooh

Because I'm going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line straight to nowhere
I'm going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line
Going down the steps on a white line straight to nowhere
Follow me down
