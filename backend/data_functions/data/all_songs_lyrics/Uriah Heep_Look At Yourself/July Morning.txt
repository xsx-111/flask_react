July Morning Lyrics
There I was on a July morning
Looking for love
With the strength of a new day dawning
And the beautiful sun
At the sound of the first bird singing
I was leaving for home
With the storm and the night behind me
And the road of my own

With the day, came the resolution
I'll be looking for you
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la

I was looking for love in the strangest places
There wasn't a stone that I left unturned
Must have tried more than a thousand faces
But not one was aware of the fire that burned

In my heart, in my mind, in my soul
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
In my heart, in my mind, in my soul
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La-la-la
La, la, la, la

There I was on a July morning
I was looking for love
With the strength of a new day dawning
And the beautiful sun
At the sound of the first bird singing
I was leaving for home
With the storm and the night behind me, yeah
And the road of my own

With the day, came the resolution
I'll be looking for you
La-la-la, la
La-la-la, la
La-la-laEmbed
