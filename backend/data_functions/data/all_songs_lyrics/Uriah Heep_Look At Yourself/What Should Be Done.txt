What Should Be Done Lyrics
So you think you've found a way of living
That prevents you losin' any sleep?
Well my friend, take this that I'm giving
It's your piece of mind you ought to keep

You'll run into trouble, for sure
By living behind a locked door
Mmm

Will you run the risk of being taunted
By doin' what you wanna do?
Or do you prefer to have your whole life haunted
By the ones who choose to care for you?

Where are their motives, my friend?
Take care you're still there at the end
Watch out for winter, it'll bite you with cold
Black spirits tryin' hard to bribe you with gold
Yeah

Would you steal a nickel from a blind man?
Well right now, do believe you would
It's not the thought of you doin' it that hurts me
It's the mind behind it that's no good
If this is your way, I don't want to know
There's only so far I can go
I won't go no further, not for you or anyone
I have my own ideas of what should be done

Yeah
What should be done?
What should be done?
Oh-paa
Oh-paa
Oh-paa
What should be done?
I wanna hearEmbed
