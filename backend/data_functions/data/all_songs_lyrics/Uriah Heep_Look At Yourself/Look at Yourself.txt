Look at Yourself Lyrics
I see you runnin'
Don't know what you're running from
Nobody's comin'
What'd you do that was so wrong?

Look back and turn back
Look at yourself
Don't be afraid, just
Look at yourself

If you need assistance
Or if all you need is love
There's no point in hiding
Tell me what you're frightened of

You've got a friend, just
Look at yourself
Don't be afraid, just
Look at yourself

Look back and turn back
Look at yourself
Don't be afraid, just
Look at yourselfEmbed
