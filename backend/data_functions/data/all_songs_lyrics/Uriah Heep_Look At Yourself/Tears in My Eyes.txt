Tears in My Eyes Lyrics
I found no one could keep us
From sharing the rest of our lives
A-like a fool I believed you were true
And you had no disguise

There's a clear blue sky outside
And the summer is fine
But with tears in my eyes
I'm no longer pretending you're mine
Oh-oh

It's the same weary story
Of a woman abusing her man
So I have to forget you
Though I'm not even sure if I can

There's a clear blue sky outside
And the summer is fine
But with tears in my eyes
I'm no longer pretending you're mine
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
(Repeated 9 times)
Watch out!
It's the same weary story
Of a woman abusing her man
So I have to forget you
Though I'm not even sure if I can

There's a clear blue sky outside
And the summer is fine
But with tears in my eyes
I'm no longer pretending you're mine

No woman yeahEmbed
