Shadows of Grief LyricsOh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You're looking at me like I must be mad
But I've been through all this before
You'll kick and kick until I'm down
So don't think I'm comin' past my door
Oh no

You think that love is such a pain
So the more it hurts, the more you laugh
Just take it and shake it, up and down
Till you think you've had enough
But you won't get enough of my love
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, ah
If you want to carry on in the same old way
Treating everyone like a piece of dirt
Just take it and break it and throw it away
There won't be anyone left to hurt, oh

North, south, east and west
Wherever you go, you'll find the same
And the only way you'll ever learn
Just realize that you're to blame
Ah, Oh
OhEmbed
