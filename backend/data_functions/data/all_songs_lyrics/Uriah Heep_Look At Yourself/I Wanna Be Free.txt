I Wanna Be Free Lyrics
As I wake up every day
With no new songs to play
Feelin' like I ought to
Pack my bag and run
My imagination flies
To some other sunny skies
Where I felt so good
And everything was done

And my time was my own
And my heart felt so free
Come on!

I don't mind a little rain
But it doesn't seem the same
When the clouds shut out your
Beauty from my eyes
There's a storm inside my head
And I know it doesn't lead
To a clearer day when nobody will cry

I can't stand here alone
And I need to be free
Free
So bring fire and bring steel
For you know the way I feel
Bring a silver horse to carry me away
I'm no stranger, I'm a friend
And my pain will never end
Till the world will let us
Live our lives as one

And our time is our own
And our hearts can be free

I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free yeah, yeah
I wanna be free, yeah
I wanna be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free, yeah, yeah
I gotta be free
I wanna be free
I wanna be free, yeahEmbed
