Love Machine Lyrics
Lovely little lady, you've got me on the run
You're a love machine and you say that I'm your gun
But I don't care, cause I've got to know
Woah-oh

You said you were a loser, the kind that came up rusted
So I had to try hard to satisfy your thirst
But I don't care, cause I've got to know

The only time she's happy is when the bullets fly, yeah
And she'll make you feel you're better than any other guy
And I don't care, cause I've got to know

Lovely little lady, you've got me on the run, yeah
You're a love machine and I'm trying to be your gun
But I don't care, cause I've got to knowEmbed
