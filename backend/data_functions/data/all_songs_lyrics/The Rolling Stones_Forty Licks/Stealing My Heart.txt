Stealing My Heart Lyrics
Well luck is expensive and freedom comes cheap
When love's on the menu, I don't drink so deep
Well I was just out there to have me some fun
But it's easier said than done
Mmm... Weâ€™re standing so far apart
We had a string of false starts
I can't seem to stop it now
It grows and it grows and it grows

Stealing my heart, stealing my heart, stealing my heart
Yeah

My cards are on the table, you can look up my sleeves
You say you're honest but love is for thieves
Well I was just out there, chaste as a nun
But it's easier said than done
Yeah, like a shot in the dark
You shoot me right out the park
I can't seem to stop it
It grows and it grows and it grows

Well you've got no money and I've got no charm
While you're in a panic, I stay so calm
Well I was just out there to have me some fun
But it's easier said than done
Yes, yeah, I thought I was sharp
Yeah, you were a walk in the park
I thought you were dinner, but you were the shark
