You Got Me Rocking Lyrics
I was a butcher, cutting up meat
My hands were bloody, I'm dying on my feet
I was a surgeon 'til I start to shake
I was a-falling, but you put on the brakes

Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now

I was a pitcher, down in a slump
I was a fighter, taken for a sucker punch
I'm feeling bad, guess I lost my spring
I was the boxer who can't get in the ring

Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, there ain't no stopping me
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Alright, ooh yeah
I was a hooker, losing her looks
I was a writer, can't write another book
I was all dried up, dying to get wet
I was a tycoon, drowning in debt

I said, hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, there ain't no stopping me
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Said, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now
Hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, you got me rocking now

That's alright
Come on, come on
Yeah, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Stop, don't stop it
Don't, don't stop it, oh
Yeah, babeEmbed
