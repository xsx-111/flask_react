Keys to Your Love Lyrics
The keys to your love
I've got the keys to your love

No matter where I go babe, no matter what I do
I spend my whole life honey, just thinking of  you
Yeah it doesn't seem to matter, who's right and who's wrong
I want to tell you how I feel now, in the words of this song
Want to baby put a spell on you
There isn't anything that you’re going to do
 
I've got the keys to your love
I've got the secret of your heart
No matter where you go baby
We're not too far apart

Now try to lock me out, I can always get in
I've got every permutation, every code and every pin, huh
I'm so crazy about you, yeah that's the word on the street
Yeah I bet you heard all about it from the people you meet
You know baby, I put a spell on you
Can't take it off now, there isn't anything you can do
I've got the keys to your love
I play the keys of your heart
It’ll sound so sweet baby
Won't stop once it starts

You’re all that I've got
Without you, baby, my life's kind of short
I look for your face
Because no one else could fill this space

Watch out baby, I put a spell on you
You can't resist it, just I’ll hoodoo you
