Garden of Earthly Delights Lyrics
Kid, stay and snip your cord off, talk and let your mind loose
Can't all think like Chekov but you'll be okay
Kid, is this your first time here? Some can't stand the beauty
So they cut off one ear but you'll be okay

Welcome to the garden of earthly delights
Welcome to a billion Arabian nights
This is your life and you do what you want to do
This is your life and you spend it all, this is your life
And you do what you want to do, just don't hurt nobody
And the big reward's here in the garden of earthly delights

Kid, pick up with another, some will even drop you
But hearts are built like rubber, so you'll be alright
Kid, swallow but believe us, you won't die of boredom
Should you have to leave us, it'll be alright

Welcome to the garden of earthly delights
Welcome to a billion Arabian nights
This is your life and you be what you want to be
This is your life and you try it all, this is your life
And you be what you want to be, just don't hurt nobody
'Less of course they ask you in the garden of earthly delights
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights
Welcome to a billion Arabian nights
This is your life and you do what you want to do
This is your life and you spend it all, this is your life
And you do what you want to do, just don't hurt nobody

Welcome to the garden of earthly delights
Welcome to a billion Arabian nights
Welcome to the garden of earthly delights
Welcome to a billion Arabian nights
This is your life and you be what you want to be
This is your life and you try it all, this is your life
And you be what you want to be, just don't hurt nobody
'Less of course they ask you in the garden of earthly delightsEmbed
