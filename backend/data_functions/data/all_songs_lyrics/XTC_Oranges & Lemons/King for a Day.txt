King for a Day Lyrics
Everyone's creeping up to the money God
Putting tongues where they didn't ought to be
On stepping stones of human hearts and souls
Into the land of 'Nothing for free'

Well, the way that we're living
Is all take and no giving
There's nothing to believe in
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way
To be king for a day

Everyone's licking up to the new king pin
Trying to get a way up with the smile
Sing for your supper boy and jump to a finger click
Ain't my way of living in style

'Cause the ladder gets longer
And ambition gets stronger
I can't satisfy the hunger
That bad old moon has got you in its sway
To be king for a day, king for a day
You're only here once, so you got to get it right
No time to fuss and fight
'Cause life don't mean much
If measured out with someone else's plight

'Cause the way that we're living
Is all take and no giving
There's nothing much to believe in
The loudest mouth will hail the new found way
To be king for a day
King for a day
King for a day
King for a dayEmbed
