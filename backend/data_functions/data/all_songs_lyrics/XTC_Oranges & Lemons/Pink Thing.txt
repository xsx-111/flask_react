Pink Thing LyricsAnytime you rise, I'm here and I'm crazy for you pink thing
You make me want to laugh, you make me want to cry
When I stroke your head I feel a hundred heartbeats high
Ooh, pink thing
I want to take you out and show you 'round the world
Pink thing it'll be okay
If I could only wake you from your slumber curled
Pink thing what would straight folks say?
That man isn't fit to enter heaven
That man is a sinner, ever burning in disgrace
Pink thing, spit in my face, I'd love you for it
Anytime you call, I'll fall, into madness for you pink thing
You make me want to live, you make me want to die
And when I stroke your head I feel a hundred heartbeats high
Ooh, pink thing
I wanna take you out and show you to the girls
Pink thing they're a whole new tribe
If you could only see the way the way the gingham swirls
Pink thing it's a whole new vibe
That man isn't fit to be a father
That man is a sinner, fore they cast me down to die
Pink thing, spit in my eye, I'd love you for it, yes, I'd love you for it
Anytime you rise, I'm here, I'm crazy for you pink thing
You make me want to laugh, you make me want to cry
When I stroke your head I feel a hundred heartbeats high
Ooh, pink thing hundred heartbeats high
Ooh, pink thing hundred heartbeats high
I want to introduce you, take you to the brink thing
I want to introduce you, tell me what you think thing
I want to introduce you, make that missing link thing
Don't you think it's time you met some female pink thing?
You make me want to laugh, you make me want to cry
So why is it I'm happy when there's tears down in your eye?
Ooh, little pink thing, ooh little pink thing
The pink thing, pink thing tell me what you think thing
Ooh, here comes pink thing
You make me want to laugh, you make me want to cryEmbed
