Merely a Man Lyrics
Higher, I'm a king, yes, I'm a head of state
But I'm the kitchen boy who'll wash your dirty plate
I had no message and the message was
We're all Jesus, Buddha and the Wizard of Oz

I'm merely a man and I bring nothing but love for you
I'm merely a man and I want nothing that you can't do

And you know it's true that with logic
And love we'll be lifting humanity higher, higher

I'm all religious figures rolled into one
Gaddafy Duck propelled from Jimmy Swaggart's tommy gun
Don't promise rainbows with some golden pot
In fact what I can offer, I know you've already got

I'm merely a man and I bring nothing but love for you
I'm merely a man and I want nothing that you can't do

And you know it's true that with logic
And love we'll have power enough
To raise consciousness up
And for lifting humanity higher, higher
And you know it's true, we should chase superstition
And fear from our hearts if we're going to survive
And take levels of sanity higher, kick it up, higher

I'm merely a man and I bring nothing but love for you
I'm merely a man and I want nothing that you can't do
I'm merely a man and I bring nothing but love for you
I'm merely a man and I want nothing that you can't do

And you know it's true that with logic
And love we'll have power enough
To raise consciousness up
And for lifting humanity higherEmbed
