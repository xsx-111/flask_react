Poor Skeleton Steps Out LyricsPoor skeleton steps out, dressed up in bad blood
Bad brains, bad thoughts and others deeds
Poor skeleton no doubt, one of these days
You can cast aside your human, be free
When the cities run with blood and you drink our health in mud
All flesh be gone, save your dry and joyous shout
For the day poor skeleton steps out
Step out, step out, step out, step out
Poor skeleton steps out, sprung from his life sentence
Deep inside some muscle mask
Poor skeleton devout, propping up truck drivers
Filmstars, thieves or queens, your brave task
When technology is rust and you write your book in dust
All flesh be gone, can't buy tickets from a tout
For the day poor skeleton steps out
Step out, step out, step out, step out
Poor skeleton steps out, liberated from sex organs
And brown, black, white skin
Poor skeleton, you lout, don't you think
That we might like to have been asked to join in?
For good skeletons are we and we're dying to be free
All flesh be gone, I will scream or sulk and pout
Until my poor skeleton steps out
Step out, step out, step out, step out
Skeleton steps out, step out, step out, step out, step out
Skeleton steps out, watch out, here comes bony boy
Step out, step out, step out, step out
Skeleton steps out, look out, here comes bony boy
Step out, step out, step out, step out, now, step outEmbed
