One of the Millions LyricsI got so much to say
But I'm afraid it'll come out wrong
I'm not a king to the eighties thing
Where you look after number one
But I won't rock the boat
'Cause I'm scared what might happen
I won't rock the boat
'Cause I'm one of the millions
Who never seem to do anything
(He never seems to do anything)
I never seem to do anything
(He never seems to do anything)
And every time I get the urge
To strike out on my own
Insecurity wraps me up
It's cold outside the fold
So I won't rock the boat
'Cause I'm scared what might happen
I won't rock the boat
'Cause I'm the man who merely threatens
He's always saying what he's gonna do
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
I'm always saying what I'm gonna do
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
I'm running steady, oh so steady
So safe and sound, I could drown, I could drown
Hey!
I've had my fill of living in my cosy armchair land
But all my schemes come to an humiliating end
So I won't rock the boat
'Cause I'm scared what might happen
I won't rock the boat
'Cause I'm one of the millions
He's always saying what he's gonna do
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
I'm always saying what I'm gonna do
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
No I won't rock no boats
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
Kiss goodbye to my hopes
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
No I won't rock no boats
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
Life is easy when you're being kept afloat
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
(He's always saying what he's gonna do)
He won't rock no boats, hey
No I won't rock no boats
I'm so scared, well I'm scared
'Cause I won't rock no boats
Yeah, yeah I'm one of the millions
I'm one of those millions
No I won't rock no boatsEmbed
