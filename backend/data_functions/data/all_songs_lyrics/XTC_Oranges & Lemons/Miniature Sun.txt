Miniature Sun LyricsI'm 12 oclock, all daylight hours
I'll warm your bed, I'll grow your flowers
Like I'm a miniature sun
This ball ignited when she told me I was her only one
I'm not the same now
I'm not that plain little boy
I'm all aflame now
I'm king up here like a miniature sun
No life comes close, I'm rising higher
On holiday, on ball of fire
You made a miniature sun
There's no more shadows in this world
She says I'm her only one
I'm not the same now
I'm not that plain little boy
I'm all aflame now
I radiate like a miniature sun
Now everything looks right today
A billion watts of bright today
And I'm a blazing kite today
I think I'll float around her house
And tell her exactly how she makes me glow
But then the other man leaving merely doffs his hat
And I'm the last to know
Now everything looks wrong today
An out of tune sung song today
I've grown from big king kong today
Right down to miniature
Don't come too close, I'll burn your arm
I'll bleach your hair, dust bowl your farm
I'll blind your eyes, you blinded mine
I'll spin with rage, all summertime
You made a miniature sun
Just take a look up in the night sky, Im not the only one
I'm not the same now
I'm not that vain little boy that I was
I'm all to blame now
Look out below here I come
Man crashing down like a miniature sun
Man crashing down like a miniature sun
Man crashing down like a miniature sun
Man crashing down like a miniature sunEmbed
