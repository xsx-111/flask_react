Ringside Lyrics
Beat myself until I'm bloody
And I'll give you a ringside seat
Say that it's embarrassing
I'm sorry that you had to see me like that

So you could either watch me drown
Or try to save me while I drag you down
Wanna fix it, but I don't know how
It isn't fair to make you wait around
While all your friends are going out

So Jesus, can you help me now?
Trade me in for a briar crown
Is there anybody coming back for me?
If they ever were, they are not now

So what's there left to talk about?
I'm holding on just like a scratch-off ticket
How I dig my nails into your skin
Honey, I'm not stupid
I know no one wins this kind of thing
It's just another way to kill an hour
Wishing I was different
Nobody deserves a second chance
But, honey, I keep getting them
Like a scratch-off ticket
How you dig your nails into my skin
Honey, I'm not stupid
I know no one wins this kind of thing
It's just another way to kill an hour
Wishing I were different
Nobody deserves a second chance
But I keep giving them1Embed
