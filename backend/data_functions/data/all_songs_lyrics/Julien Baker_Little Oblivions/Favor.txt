Favor Lyrics
We took the forty down to
Visit the family, and I
Told you the only kin I knew
Was who I could see from the gurney
I used to think about myself
Like I was a talented liar
Turns out that all my friends were
Trying to do me a favor

I always wanna tell the truth
But it never seems like the right time
To be serious enough
I'm sorry I'm making myself cry

How long do I have until
I've spent up everyone's goodwill?


Sat on the hood, out all night
Trying to scrape together change
You pulled a moth out
From the grill of your truck
Saying it's a shame
How come it's so much еasier
With anything less than human
Letting yoursеlf be tender?
Well, you couldn't make me do it
It doesn't feel too bad, but it
Doesn't feel too good, either
Just like a nicotine patch, it
Hardly works, then it's over

Who put me
In your way to find?
And what right had you
Not to let me die?
Ooh, but did I even know
What I was asking for?
If I had my way
I'd have missed you more
Than you missed me
You missed me

You missed me
You missed me7Embed
