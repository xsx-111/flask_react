Ziptie Lyrics
Limping like a prodigal son
Someone got my head in the slums
Everything I do makes it worse
Human nature, call it a curse
Tired of collecting my scars
And stories at the parties and bars
Tryna find a reason to fight
Someone's got my head in a zip tie

Oh, good God
When you gonna call it off?
Climb down off of the cross
And change your mind?

Catch me on the enemy line
Hocking all the gold in my teeth
Oh, I was disappointed to find out how much
Everybody looks like me

Oh, good God
When you gonna call it off?
Climb down off of the cross
And change your mind?
Good God
When you gonna call it off?
Climb down off of the cross
And change your mind?Embed
