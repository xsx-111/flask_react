Bloodshot Lyrics
I can see myself inside your bloodshot eyes
Wondering if you can see yourself in mine
Or do you just see me?
And of me, what you want to see
Middle of the night, all I can see are stars
Pulled 'em from my eyes and your ex-lover's arms
Throw hook after hook and if I were you
After all that I did, I'd have done it to me, too

Isn't like I did it on purpose
I just forget the second I learned it
Everything I get, I deserve
You whisper to me
"Don't you like when it hurts?"
Oh-mm, mm-mm

Five days out from thе initial event
It's two kinds of pills to unclench my fists
It's too kind of you to say you can hеlp
But there's no one around who can save me from myself

Isn't like I do this on purpose
I just forget the second I've learned it
Looking for little oblivions
I'd do anything knowing you would forgive me, oh
There's no glory in love
Only the gore of our hearts
So let it come for my throat
Take me and tear me apart

Ooh, there's no glory in love
Only the gore of our hearts
Ooh, let it come for my throat
Take me and tear me apart

Drag me away in the dark
Take me and tear me apart1Embed
