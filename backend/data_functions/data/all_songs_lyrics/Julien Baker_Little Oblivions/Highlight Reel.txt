Highlight Reel Lyrics
Passed out in the back of a cab
Could you pull over? I think that I'm trapped
Caught underwater, I beat on the glass
Gnawing my arm at the shoulder
Would you help me get out?

Ooh, it's a highlight reel
Tell me how you feel

Pulling down a projector
Scratched in the back of my eyes
Hovering over, tangled in the power lines

Ooh, it's a highlight reel
Tell me how you feel

Tell me what snuffed out the wick in your eye
Pumping your chest to make sure you're alive
When it dies, you can tell me how much was a lie
I guess that's for me to decide
When it dies, you can tell me how much was a lie
Oh, I guess, oh, I guess, oh, I guess
That's for me to decide1Embed
