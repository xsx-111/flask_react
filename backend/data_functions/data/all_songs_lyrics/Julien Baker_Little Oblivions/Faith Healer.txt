Faith Healer Lyrics
Ooh, I miss it high, how it dulled the terror and the beauty
And now I see everything in startling intensity
Oh, what I wouldn't give if it would take away the sting a minute
Everything I love, I'd trade it in to feel it rush into my chest

The smoke alarm's been going off for weeks
No one showed up and half the time it isn't what you think of

Faith healer, come put your hands on me
A snake oil dealer
I'll believe you if you make me feel something
Oh, faith healer, come put your hands all over me
A snake oil dealer
I'll believe you if you make me feel something4Embed
