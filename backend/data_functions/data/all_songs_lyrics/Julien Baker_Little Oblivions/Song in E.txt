Song in E Lyrics
I wish that I drank
Because of you and not only because of me
And then I could blame something painful enough
Not to make me look any more weak

When you heard my name
You could be angry and have a good reason to be
And then when I sang
A horrible drunken parade of my worst thoughts
I'd say, "Give me no sympathy"
It's the mercy I can't take


Oh, I wish you'd come over
Not to stay, just to tell me that I
Was your biggest mistake to my face
And then leave me alone
In an еmpty apartment, face down in the carpеt
I wish you'd hurt me
It's the mercy I can't take1Embed
