Crying Wolf Lyrics
Day-one chip on your dresser
Get loaded at your house
I ask if you remember
You say, "I don't know what you're talking about"
Swallow the truth
Force the charcoal down my throat
Finally come to, maybe I'll have something to show
It's the first day of the new year
All the visitors went home
I found out what I thought was just a pretty trick of smoke
Couldn't stand the thought of having everything to lose
So I tied a knot

'Cause I'm not crying wolf
I'm out here looking for them
In the morning when I wake up
Naked in their den
I swear off all the things I thought that got me here
In the evening, I'll come back again


'Cause I'm not crying wolf
I'm out here looking for them
In the morning when I wake up
Naked in their den
Ooh, I'm out here looking for them
In the morning when I wake up
Naked in their den
And I swear off all the things I thought that got me here
In the evening, I'll come back again1Embed
