Repeat Lyrics
Ocean of strip malls
I help you swim across
To the other side
Of the truck stop light
When the drugs wear off
Will the love kick in?
Would you stay out long enough
To start again?


On and on and on, I chase your form across the bed
Leave it up to me
Until you come to turn it in
Say I miss you like a mantra
'Til I forget what it means
Doesn't matter what you tell me
I just need to hear you speak

All my greatest fears turn out to be the gift of prophecy
All my nightmares coming true
Come do my outline in the street
While every night I reenact thе same recurring dream
Now I'm stuck insidе a vision that repeats, repeats, repeats
Repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats
Repeats, repeats, repeats, repeats, repeatsEmbed
