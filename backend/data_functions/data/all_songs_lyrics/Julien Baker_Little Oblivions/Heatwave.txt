Heatwave Lyrics
Shell of an engine, unexplained
Burst to fire engulfed in flames
Breathing exhaust, a heatwave mirage
Nothing to lose till everything's really gone
It's worse than death that life compressed
To fill a page in the Sunday paper
I had the shuddering thought:
"This was gonna make me late for work"

Biting a chain, free like a lame
Oh, can you be healed?
Scratch my knees on the gravel
Say it's all part of the deal
Coverеd in scars a canyon deep
It's not like what I thought it'd be
The gruеsome beauty of your face in everyone I meet

I was on a long spiral down
Before I make it to the ground
I'll wrap Orion's belt around my neck
And kick the chair out
On a long spiral down
Before I make it to the ground
I'll wrap Orion's belt around my neck
And kick the chair out
And I'll kick the chair out
Kick the chair out3Embed
