At Night Lyrics
Sunk deep in the night, I sink in the night
Standing alone underneath the sky
I feel the chill of ice on my face
I watch the hours go by, the hours go by

You sleep, sleep in a safe bed
Curled and protected, protected from sight
Under a safe roof, deep in your house
Unaware of the changes at night
At night

I hear the darkness breathe
I sense the quiet despair
Listen to the silence at night
Someone has to be there
Someone has to be there

Someone must be thereEmbed
