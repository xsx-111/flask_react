Three LyricsEnough of that "stand up straight"
What nonsense
"No," I said, my face close to the ground, "I'll stay as I am."
"You really can annoy a person, I must say. Such a waste of time! Come on, put an end to it."
"The way you shout! In the quiet of the night!" I said
"Just as you like," he added
But wheeling suddenly around, he looked at me - I hadn't quite finished yet - and said: "What's this? You're all crooked! What on earth are you up to?"
"Quite right. You're very observant," said I, my head on the seam of his trousers, which was why I couldn't look up properly
I won't scream, I'll just stare at him as long as my eyes can stand it
"Well?" he said
"Well?" he said
"Well?" he saidEmbed
