M Lyrics
Hello image
Sing me a line from your favourite song
Twist and turn but you're trapped in the light
All the directions were wrong

You'll fall in love with somebody else tonight

Help yourself
But tell me the words before you fade away
You reveal all the secrets to remember the end
And escape someday

You'll fall in love with somebody else again tonight

Take a step
You move in time but it's always back
The reasons are clear, your face is drawn
And ready for the next attack7Embed
