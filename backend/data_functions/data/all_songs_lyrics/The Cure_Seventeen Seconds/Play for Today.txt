Play for Today Lyrics
It's not a case of doing what's right
It's just the way I feel that matters
Tell me I'm wrong, I don't really care
It's not a case of share and share alike
I take what I require
I don't understand, you say it's not fair

You expect me to act like a lover
Consider my moves and deserve the reward
To hold you in my arms and wait, and wait
And wait for something to happen

It's not a case of telling the truth
Some lines just fit the situation
You call me a liar, you would anyway
It's not a case of aiming to please
You know you're always crying
It's just your part in the play for today9Embed
