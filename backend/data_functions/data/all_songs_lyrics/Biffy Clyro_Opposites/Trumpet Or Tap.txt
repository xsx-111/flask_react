Trumpet Or Tap LyricsTime once moved so slowly
It moves much faster now
It moves much faster now
Find a new way to rise
Or we're in trouble now
Or we're in trouble now
Where are you at?
Is it trumpet or tap?
Are you glued to a wall
By this terrible snap?
You know where the sinners are
Life is much better when
You let it all go
If if could I'd start over again
Let's start again
With a shrug of our shoulders
Angels always start over again
With a rude little mess
They'll always be older
I will sing for three days
To prove what you mean to me
Prove what you mean to me
Lie to my little face
Hard not to turn away
Hard not to turn away
Clowns are madcap
Whores encourage the clap
Living life on the road
Got no need for a map
It seems we are bouncing
Cleanliness will kill us all
Dirt is much cleaner
If if could I'd start over again
Let's start again
With a shrug of our shoulders
Angels always start over again
With a rude little mess
They'll always be older
Than you and me
Prove what i mean to you
Show what i mean to you
Can't you just say it's true?
Can't you just say it's true?
Prove what i mean to you
Show what i mean to you
Can't you just say it's true?
Can't you just say it's true?Embed
