Woo Woo LyricsI sank down to the gutter and moaned
About all the people that had done me wrong
Pucker up here's a mouth and a half
You can't ignore it in the photograph
I want to change
I want to listen
My selfish ways
Have reached their limit
Are we alive
Or are we finished?
Let's move along
And not diminish
I removed all my fingers and toes
Don't want to hold anything too close
I slid down all the columns at hand
That's not as glam as you think it sounds
I want to change
I want to listen
My selfish ways
Have reached their limit
Are we alive
Or are we finished?
Let's move along
And not diminish
I will love you
For the rest of my life
Can you love me
'til the end of time?
I will love you
For the rest of my life
Can you love me
'til the end of time?
So we can
Start the journey home
We'll start the journey home
I want to change
I want to listen
My selfish ways
Have reached their limit
Are we alive
Or are we finished?
Let's move along
And not diminishEmbed
