Different People Lyrics
Baby when you hold me
I can feel so wrong
You're trying to console me
Your chance has long gone
So baby won't you take my hand?
So we can do what the others can
We are alive tonight, we are alive tonight

I am going home, forever and ever more
No I was never born, and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have gone

Different person, different argument
In my shadow, no more compliments
One more person, breaking the rules again
I'm still waiting, for someone else to join hands

Stand where the others stand
We're alive tonight
Land where the others land
We're alive tonight
I am going home, forever and ever more
No I was never born, and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have gone

Scintillating, and inspirational
Conversation, death to everyone
Little Purpose, little consequence
Too combative, to come to realize
Different person, different argument
In my shadow, no more compliments
One more person, breaking the rules again
I'm still waiting, for someone else to join hands

Stand where the others stand
We're alive tonight
Land where the others land
We're alive tonight

I am going home, forever and ever more
No I was never born, and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have gone
I am going home, forever and ever more
No I was never born, and there's no such thing as home
We used to stand so strong
That's why the others have goneEmbed
