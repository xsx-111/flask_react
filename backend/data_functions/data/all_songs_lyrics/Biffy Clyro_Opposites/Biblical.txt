Biblical Lyrics
Baby if you could would you go back to the start?
Take any fresh steps or watch it all fall apart again?

Play another song here, then you can leave
With your delicate wings, I used to weave
Maybe there's an undertow here
Or maybe this is stuck up in the air
I know how it looks but all that glitters ain't gold

You gave me magical, I gave you wonderful
Cut that invisible cord or I'll starve you
Of what's understandable
Let's make immeasurable moves to the left
Or the right
But not central cause

You gave me magical, I gave you wonderful
Cut that invisible cord or I'll starve you
Of what's understandable
Let's make immeasurable moves to the left
Or the right
But not central cause
You gave me magical
I gave you wonderful
Let's make this biblical
And hang from our invisible cords

Baby if you could would you go back to the start?
Take any fresh steps or watch it all fall apart again?
It could have been a wonderful year
Instead we might not make it to the end
Everybody cares, but nobody knows

You gave me magical, I gave you wonderful
Cut that invisible cord or I'll starve you
Of what's understandable
Let's make immeasurable moves to the left
Or the right
But not central cause

You gave me magical, I gave you wonderful
Cut that invisible cord or I'll starve you
Of what's understandable
Let's make immeasurable moves to the left
Or the right
But not central cause
You gave me magical
I gave you wonderful
Let's make this biblical
And hang from our invisible cords

You gave me magical
I gave you wonderful
Let's make this biblical
And hang from our invisible cords

Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby how can you walk away?
Baby if you could would you go back to the start?
Take any fresh steps or watch it all fall apart again?3Embed
