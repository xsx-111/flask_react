The Fog LyricsBaby come down to the bottom of the stair
There's a reflection I want you to see
Our history and loneliness has
Defeated our devices
Lady come down, it's time to stop and stare
There's a successor I want you to meet
His misery and loneliness has
Exceeded expectations
But still we fall down
Look at the stars they're getting younger
Look at your pain you're getting older
Not feeling right but always hoping for more
I'm gonna tumble to the centre of the square
There's a triangle I wanted to see
The fog has cast a shadow homeward
We're losing our direction
So forget the whole thing
Look at the stars they're getting younger
Look at your pain you're getting older
Not feeling right but always hoping for more1Embed
