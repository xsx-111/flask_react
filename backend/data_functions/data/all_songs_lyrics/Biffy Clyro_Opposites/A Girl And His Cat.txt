A Girl And His Cat LyricsI never had fun but I wouldn't say no
I guess that's my prerogative
I'll never give up and I'll never look down
That would be the end of it
Look at me now screaming up and down
With huge degrees of lethargy
Some may say that I'm lying down
That don't mean a fuck to me
I should remove you all
Nothing ventured nothing maimed
Hang on your suffering wall
To decompose and rearrange
Sit tight with you lonley rose
Beauty is the death of pain
Don't see it coming at all
So we control and we contain
This is what you wanted to be
This is what you wanted
This is your house this is not your home
I don't know if we're every gonna belong
You can build a house but not a home
It will always stand on shaky ground
I want to play dumb but I can't let go
Of my responsibilities
Why have one? You can take all ten
I bet that's not enough for you
I should remove you all
Nothing ventured nothing maimed
Hang on your suffering wall
To decompose and rearrange
This is what you wanted to be
This is what you wanted
This is your house this is not your home
I don't know if we're every gonna belong
You can build a house but not a home
It will always stand on shaky ground
We are looking for love
But you're baying for blood
We are looking for love
But you're baying for blood
This is what you wanted to be
This is what you wantedEmbed
