Skylight Lyrics
I don't know where we're going from here
But it's time to sing the saddest song
Looking alive with a broken mind
Why don't you ever take my side

We can dream of all
The mistakes that we've made
There's no reason
There's nothing left to take away

I now know where we're going from here
And it's time to sing a happy song
Feeling alive with a throbbing mind
You're never gonna break my stand

We can dream of all
The mistakes that we've made
There's no reason
We can't start at the end

We're users
But at least we use each other friend
We'll choose our
Path and face the consequence
Some say love
I say fight
I hope I'm not wrong
A restless soul
A wicked mind
I'd rather kiss the ground
Than kiss a starless skyEmbed
