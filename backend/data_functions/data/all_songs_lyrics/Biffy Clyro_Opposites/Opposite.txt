Opposite Lyrics
You are the loneliest person that I've ever known
We are joined at the surface but nowhere else

I look in the glass and stare at your strained, grey
Motionless face and ask
Underneath, is there a golden soul?

Take care of the ones that you love
Take care of the ones that you love

Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds?

Everyone is beginning to breathe as I break down
You are in love with a shadow that won't come back

Sooner or later, we all have to wake
And try forgetting everything
Underneath, there's a perfect sky
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds and feelings?
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds and feelings?

Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds and feelings?
Baby I'm leaving here
You need to be with somebody else
I can't stop bleeding here
Can you suture my wounds?2Embed
