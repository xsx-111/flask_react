Modern Magic Formula LyricsHey little man
Let me sing my song
Or I'm gonna freak out, freak out
Become a dominator
A violator
You can't give it all that it needs
You can't give it all that it needs
You can't give it all that it needs
You can't give it all that it needs
All we need is
A magic formula
A whole new backbone
It's what we're looking for
So you wanted to change the world
But I didn't believe you
That's why we'll say goodbye to the good old days son
I'm trying the best I can
But there's a white flag burning in the middle of my hand
I'm tired of being exposed
And I don't know how much more of this I can stand
Hey heaven's whore
Let me sing my song
And cranial freak out, freak out, freak out, freak out
You can't give it all that it needs
You can't give it all that it needs
You can't give it all that it needs
You can't give it all that it needs
All we need is
A magic formula
A whole new backbone
It's what we're looking for
So you wanted to change the world
But I didn't believe it
That's why we'll say goodbye to the good old days son
I'm trying the best I can
But theres a white flag burning in the middle of my hand
I'm tired of being exposed
And I don't know how much more of this I can stand
I'm trying the best I can
But there's a white flag burning in the middle of my hand
I'm tired of being exposed
And I don't know how much more of this I can standEmbed
