Accident Without Emergency Lyrics
The light leaves me terrified
I hate when the darkness dies
Don't you ever want to be brave?
It seems that we feel the same way

I would never leave you crawling
Even on the bathroom floor
It can be a lonely place
Have you ever been there before?
No need to run away
No need to run away
Once you feel love
You'll taste the pain
Sent from above
You can't complain

Can I raise my head this morning?
My mind's needing cauterised
I'm in the shallow end drowning
It's a soup of flies
Or am i on a wall?
Or am i on a wall?
Girl I should have told you
But I've never been brave
Standing side by side
We'll take this whole place

The light leaves me terrified
I hate when the darkness dies
Don't you ever want to be brave?
It seems that we feel the same way

If this is an accident
Then where's the hurt?
At least someone here
Should be covered in blood

Tell me how to recognise you
Now that you're compromised
My skin's covered in holes, can
You please take a look inside?
No need to hesitate
No need to hesitate
Girl I should have told you
But I've never been brave
Standing side by side
We'll take this whole place

The light leaves me terrified
I hate when the darkness dies
Don't you ever want to be brave?
It seems that we feel the same way
I'll take a good look at myself
It's you I want and no-one else
Don't you ever want to take sides?
I guess that's family suicide

If this is a concert
Then where's the crowd?
Let's sing it out
And sing it proudEmbed
