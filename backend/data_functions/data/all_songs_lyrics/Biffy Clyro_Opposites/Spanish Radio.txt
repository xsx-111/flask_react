Spanish Radio Lyrics
I'm going to walk
To the water's edge
Refuse to be cleansed
But struggle in
Your crown don't fit
So vacate the throne
And off with your head
I need a shoulder to cry on

I got a heart
I got a reason
To love you all
Every single person
It's not at all
Our conversation
I'm looking for
Total dislocation

I always wake
To the sound of your voice
And I am floating on
An ominous cloud
This dark land
Looming over the hill
Maintain a holy stance
And protect your children

I got a heart
I got a reason
To love you all
Every single person
It's not at all
Our conversation
I'm looking for
Total dislocation
I got a tree
It's time to cut it
To its knees
Don't want to rush it
We got to please
We have to glisten
As I remain
In splendid isolation

I got a heart
I got a reason
To love you all
Every single person
It's not at all
Our conversation
I'm looking for
Total dislocation
I got a tree
It's time to cut it
To its knees
Don't want to rush it
We got to please
We have to glisten
As I remain
In splendid isolation

Hey
You can be lost
At the same time
As being found
Hey
You can be lost
At the same time
As being found
Hey!
Hey!3Embed
