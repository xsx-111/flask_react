Picture A Knife Fight LyricsI wouldn't listen to her
She'll only break your heart
I'd rather listen to man, woman, but
Not whatever you are
We'll tip it over the edge
And watch it disappear
I'll paint a picture of you
Well my impression of what is inside
With your stolen eyes
I'm gonna stare at the sun
Until I burn them out
And then I'll picture a knife fight
We're gonna dig up the sky tonight
Bury the sun for the rest of our lives
Lay low and never lie
We're gonna stay here 'til we make it alright
I'm going to grip onto her
Tiny saxophone
Place an absurd mound of flesh
Down the tube
And whistle what's inside
I'll tie a ribbon to her
Because she's all i need
And then i whisper to her
I'd gladly live my whole life on my knees
With your stolen eyes
I'm gonna stare at the sun
Until I burn them out
And then I'll picture a knife fight
We're gonna dig up the sky tonight
Bury the sun for the rest of our lives
Lay low and never lie
We're gonna stay here 'til we make it alright
We're gonna dig up the sky tonight
Bury the sun for the rest of our lives
Lay low and never lie
We're gonna stay here 'til we make it alright
What's the use
If we're struggling on?
We've got to let this go
Before it sinks its claws
Deeper into our souls
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together and
What's the goal
If we're struggling on?
We've got to let this go
Before it sinks its claws
Deeper into our souls
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick together
We've got to stick togetherEmbed
