Black Tiles LyricsWatch the way they wait in line
Play this game with me in time
I see the way you look at me
Your eyes filled with cruelty
You don't have to confess
To sleeping in the lion's den
There is no end, no beginning
Are you my friend?
Black tiles in a line
Watch them fall serpentine
I see the snake in your eyes
Are you set to tell me lies?
Don't try to fight it, 'cause you won't, you won't
Let it go, it's not wrong
All we can hope for is a light
That shines on after we're gone
For all we know we're just here
For the length, the length of the song
I hope I know when it's done
When it's gone
No one knows what happens next
There's no answer and no guess
Don't look at me, I'm doing fine
I'm just not your kind
Look away, don't move too fast
Fall forward, jump back
There is no end, no beginning
The warrior is not a foe and not a friend
Don't try to fight it, 'cause you won't, you won't
Let go, it's not wrong
All we can hope for is a light
That shines on after we're gone
For all we know we're just here
For the length, the length of the song
I never know when it's done
When it's goneEmbed
