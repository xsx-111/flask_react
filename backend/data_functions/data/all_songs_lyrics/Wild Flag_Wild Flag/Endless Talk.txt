Endless Talk LyricsHey, you're a little bit ruthless
Claws out and wild
You wore me down to toothless
So gummy and mild
It's all we have so we talk all of the time
You wind me up and I go, go
Cover my eyes 'til your sneer looks like a smile
All bark, no bite, yeah I know, I know
You, you're a rusty little razor
With a past that gleamed
Always trying to cut me
On your dull machine
It's all we have so we talk all of the time
You wind me up and I go, go
Cover my eyes 'til your sneer looks like a smile
All bark, no bite, yeah I know, I know
Words, words your enemy
Teardrops are left
Can't speak, can't see
Filled with regret
It's all we have so we talk all of the time
You wind me up and I go
Cover my eyes 'til your sneer looks like a smile
All bark, no bite, yeah I know, I know
Oh, come on baby
I need a little more shine
How did our light get so low?Embed
