Racehorse LyricsI'm a racehorse, yeah I'm a racehorse
Put your money on me
Yeah I'm a racehorse, yeah I'm a racehorse
You put your money on me
You can't love no one, you don't love no one
You put your love on me
You can't love no one, you don't love no one
You put your love on me
We're in the money
We're in the money
I'm a racehorse, yeah I'm a racehorse
You put your money on me
I'm a racehorse, I'm a racehorse
You put your money on me
Where are you going?
And what do you own?
And what are you selling?
And who do you know?
What you don't know
What you don't know
What you don't know is me
We're in the money
We're in the money
Pony up, pony up
Pony up, pony up
Pony up, pony up
And ride and ride and ride and ride
Pony up, pony up
Pony up, pony up
Pony up, pony up
And ride and ride and ride
You bet wrong
You bet wrong
We're in the money
We're in the money
You can't love no one, you don't love no one, you can't love no one
You don't love no one, you put your love, your love on me
Come on and put your love, come here and put your love
Come here and put your love on me
Come here and put your love on me
Put your love, put your love on me
Put your love, put your love on me
Well, pony up
I'm a racehorse, I'm a racehorse
I'm a racehorse, I'm a racehorse
I'm a racehorse, I'm a racehorse
I'm a racehorse, I'm a racehorseEmbed
