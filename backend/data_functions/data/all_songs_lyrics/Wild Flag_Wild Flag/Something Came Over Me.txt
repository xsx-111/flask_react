Something Came Over Me LyricsSomething's coming over me
Got cabin fever, now I can't see
I feel hot; I feel cold
I'd tell you why, but I'm not that bold
There's a scratch on my cheek
I feel faint but never weak
When you're near, I'm seeing visions
They're just not so clear, oh, oh
But you're coming through in stereo
In stereo sound
Yeah, and summer's creeping up slowly
We're gonna let the good times, let the good times toll
Well, let me ask your advice:
If I fall once, will I fall twice?
Out of control
I wanna know
'Cause I want you here now
I want you here now
I want you here now
I want you here right now, oh, oh
'Cause you're coming through in stereo
In stereo sound
Yeah, summer's creeping up slowly
We're gonna let the good times, let the good times toll
Yeah, you were always headed down the wrong path
But you'll be back
You'll be back around
And summer's creeping up slowly
We're gonna let the good times, let the good times roll
Let 'em rollEmbed
