Romance LyricsHey, hey, can you feel it?
The way it sways you
The hum in your chest
You make my feet move
You turn my head loose
That's why I love you the best
Hey, you fill up the spaces
Those empty places
The corners and cracks
You kill my sickness
My only witness
You're all that I have
Hands down, we like, we like what we like
Hands down, we like, we love, we choose you
We got an eye, an eye for what's romance
We've got our eyes, our eyes trained on you
You watch us dance, we dance 'til we're dying
We dance to free ourselves from the room
We love the sound, the sound is what found us
Sound is the blood between me and you
Back when I had no story
Nothing to form me
You got under my skin
You were my maker
My re-creator
The reason to live
Can't stop the bleeding
Or this leaving, though I've tried
And when I return with those fresh burns
You're waiting inside
Hey, you've got me crawling
You've got me spinning
Shake, shimmy, shake
First, you wreck me
Then resurrect me
Too much
Hands down, we like, we like what we like
Hands down, we like, we love, we choose you
We got an eye, an eye for what's romance
We've got our eyes, our eyes trained on you
You watch us dance, we dance 'til we're dying
We dance to free ourselves from the room
We love the sound, the sound is what found us
Sound is the blood between me and you
Hands down, we like, we like what we like
Hands down, we like, we love, we choose you
We got an ear, an ear for what's romance
We've got our ears, our ears trained on you
You watch us sing, we sing 'til we're crying
We sing to free ourselves from the room
We love the sound, the sound is what found us
Sound is the love between me and you1Embed
