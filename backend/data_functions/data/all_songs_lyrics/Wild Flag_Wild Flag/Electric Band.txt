Electric Band LyricsWell all right, say my name
Say it again and I'll make it rain in your mind
You're uptight, satellite
Come meet me and we'll go for a ride in your mind
All we are is dust and air
Play the part of the dragon slayer
Dance all night or turn to sand
Come on and join our electric band
Call me anytime
I'll be waiting for you to come back from your mind
Go out every night
Don't leave me alone to swim to my own island
All we are is dust and air
Some are friends and some are strangers
While the wind is blowing in time
Come on and join our electric mind
Run if you can, here comes the electric band
Run if you can, we're following you...
Run if you can, here comes the electric band
Run if you can, we're following you...Embed
