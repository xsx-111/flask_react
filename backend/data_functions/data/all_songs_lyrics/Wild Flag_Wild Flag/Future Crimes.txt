Future Crimes LyricsPardon my life this time
I'll swear off future crimes
Lighten my soul and
I'll give up everything
The kick, the bite, the scream
Be tame and old and
I want to go back to front
I want to go front to back
I want to feel this again
Just like a heart attack
I want to make it pure
I want to make it good
And make it right
Pardon my life this time
'Cause I am so hardwired
To be alone and
You want to know everything
But you are just kidding
Don't want to know and
My blood flows out to in
My nerves are inside out
This voice is in my head
It's like a bark, a shout
But I can't turn it off
I can't turn it down
Or make it quiet
I wanna know
I wanna know
If you're gonna be a restless soul
Then you're gonna be so, so tired
If you're gonna keep me up all night
Then you better learn to love this fire
If you're gonna be a restless soul
Then you're gonna be so, so tired
If you're gonna give up on this fight
Then I'm gonna call you a liarEmbed
