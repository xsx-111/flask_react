Glass Tambourine LyricsListen to the music, to the music
Before it passes you by
If you don't lose it, you're gonna use it
The black lullaby
Did I ever tell you I was looking though you?
Cracked mirrors on the lawn
Still it's summer somewhere, summer somewhere
The crystal song
Of a glass tambourine
Don't shake it like you mean
A glass tambourine
Don't break it on the scene
Interstellar reverb in reverse
I need you today
Hit me with it sometime when you shine
Vibrational waves
Of a glass tambourine
Don't shake it like you mean
A glass tambourine
Don't break it on the scene
I thought the end of time was near
But now I can hear
I thought the end of time was near
But now I can hear
(Chorus x6)
Don't break it
Don't break itEmbed
