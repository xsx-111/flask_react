Boom LyricsOh, oh, move a little closer
Don't be afraid
If you want a pretty picture
You better look away, look away
1, 2, 3, 4
I like the way you move around the floor
I like the way you move around the room
Make things go boom
Make things go boom
5, 6, 7, 8
I like the way you make me stay up late
I like the way you make me understand
You take my hand
You're in command
Oh, oh, would you be an engine?
I'd like to see you climb
If you need help with your motor
Well, you can borrow mine, borrow mine
1, 2, 3, 4
I like the way you move around the floor
I like the way you move around the room
Make things go boom
Make things go boom
5, 6, 7, 8
I like the way you make me stay up late
I like the way you make me understand
You hold my hand
You take command
Well, it's getting so pathetic
I'm so restrained
I, I need it to be hectic
And rearranged, rearranged
1, 2, 3, 4
I like the way you move around the floor
I like the way you move around the room
Make things go boom
Make things go boom
We've got nothing left to loseEmbed
