Morning Glories LyricsWhen the morning glories wake up in the morning
Early in the morning, I'm gonna kiss your sweet lips goodnight
At the break of dawn I can hear mornin'
It's early in the morning, that's when we all slept tight
Just cock-a-doodle-do, hear the rooster crowing
Cock-a-doodle-do, say baby it's time to be goin'
When the morning glories wake up in the morning
Just before the dawnin', I'm gonna kiss your sweet lips goodnight (and make everything alright)
Well it's cock-a-doodle-do, hear the rooster crowing
Cock-a-doodle-do, say baby it's time to be goin'
When the morning glories wake up in the morning
Just before the dawnin', I'm gonna kiss you goodnight!Embed
