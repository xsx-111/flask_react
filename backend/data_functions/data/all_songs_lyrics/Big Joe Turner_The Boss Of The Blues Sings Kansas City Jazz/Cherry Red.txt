Cherry Red LyricsRun here pretty baby, set down on your daddy's knee
I want to tell ev'rybody, how you've been sending me
Now if that's your secret, you can keep it to yourself
'Cause if you tell me, I might tell somebody else
I ain't never loved and I hope I never will
Because a lovin' proposition, will get somebody killed
Now you can take me baby, put me in your big brass bed
You can rock me baby till my face turns cherry red
Lead me pretty baby, 'cause you know I can be led
Squeeze me pretty baby until my face turns cherry red
I ain't never loved and I hope I never will
Because a lovin' proposition, will get somebody killed
Lead me pretty baby, 'cause you know I can be led
Squeeze me pretty baby until my face turns cherry redEmbed
