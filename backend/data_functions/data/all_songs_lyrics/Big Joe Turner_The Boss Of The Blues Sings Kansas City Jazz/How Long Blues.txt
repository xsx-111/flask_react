How Long Blues LyricsHow long?
Baby, how long?
Has that evening train been gone?
How long?
Baby, how long?
Baby, how long?
I can see the green grass
Growin' way up on yonder hill
But I ain't seen the greenback
On the dollar bill
In so long
So long
Baby, so long
How long?
Baby, how long?
Must I keep my clothes in pawn?
How long?
How long?
Baby, how long?
Now if I could holler
I would scream like a mountain, Jack
I'd go way up on the mountain
And I'd call my baby back
But how long?
How long?
Baby, how long?
How long?
How long?
Oh, has that evening train been gone
So long
So long
Oh, so long

How long?
Baby, how long?
Cause I keep my clothes in pawn
How long?
How long?
Baby, how long?
Now I'm going up on a mountain
Scream like a mountain jack
I'm gonna holler so loud
I'm gonna call my baby back
How long?
How long?
Baby, how long?
Baby, how long?Embed
