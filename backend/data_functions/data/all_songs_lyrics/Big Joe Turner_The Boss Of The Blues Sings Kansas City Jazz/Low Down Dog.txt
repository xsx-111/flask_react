Low Down Dog LyricsWell, I ain't gonna be your low down dog no more
I ain't gonna be your low down dog no more
Yeah, you don't want me baby then down the road I'll go
Well, I worked hard baby and I brought you home my pay
Yes, I worked hard baby and I brought you home my pay
You certainly gonna miss me when I'm gone away
I said, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-wee
I said, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-wee
It's a low down shame the way you're mistreatin' me
Lonely yeah, and I ain't coming back to stay
Lonely yeah, and I ain't coming back to stay
It's your turn now, but it be mine some sweet day
That's why I ain't gonna be your low down dog anymore
I ain't gonna be your low down dog anymore
I gave up tradition, my mind's made up to go
Be your dog no more!Embed
