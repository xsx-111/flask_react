I Want A Little Girl LyricsI want a little girl, all my own
Must be the one, all alone
I want a little girl
To fall in love with me
I want a little girl, love her lot
I'll give her everything I’ve got
Yeah, let's heat and cook
Go on, she'll soon do a tea
No, I don’t care if she doesn't wear
I don't wear fancy clothes
I wouldn't even care if she doesn't wear
Now I'm 
I want a little girl
She may not look like 
Oh, she's a little girl
That will fall in love with me
No, I don't care if she don’t wave a hand
Doesn’t wear fancy clothes
I don't even care she don’t wear
Not that whole
I want a little girl, love or not
I want to give her everything I've got
Yes, a little girl to fall in love with meEmbed
