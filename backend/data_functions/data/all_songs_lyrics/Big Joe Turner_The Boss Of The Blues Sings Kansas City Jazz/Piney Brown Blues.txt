Piney Brown Blues LyricsWell I been to Kansas City
Girl and everything is really alright
Yes I been to Kansas City
Girl and everything is really alright
City boy jump and swing
Way into broad daylight
Yes I dreamed last night
I was standin' on 18th and Vine
Yes I dreamed last night
I was standin' on 18th and Vine
Just hangin' with my baby
I got  keep  cry
I wanna watch the babe
When a tear rolled down her cheek
Yes I wanna watch the baby
When a tear rolled down her cheek
I wanna hold her hand
Tell her that her your kind can't be beat
Well I went back to Kansas City
My little girl was gone
Yes I went back to Kansas City
My little girl was gone
Goodbye bye baby
I know you got yourself a better home
Last time I seen my baby
She was standin' on Hollywood and Vine
Yes the last time I seen my baby
She was standin' on Hollywood and Vine
She was sure cool, she wouldn't pay me no mind
Hollywood and VineEmbed
