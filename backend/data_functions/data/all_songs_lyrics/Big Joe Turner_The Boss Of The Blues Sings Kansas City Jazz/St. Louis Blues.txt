St. Louis Blues LyricsI hate to see the evening sun go down
I hate to see the evening sun go down
It makes me think I'm on my last go 'round
I'm feeling tomorrow like I feel today
I'm feeling tomorrow like I'm feeling today
Gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway
Saint Louis woman with her diamond ring
Oh they're laying around by her apron string
If it wasn't for the powder and the store-bought hair
That girl of mine wouldn't gone so far, far, yeah!
I got the Saint Louis blues, blue as I can be!
That gal got a heart like a rock down in the sea
Or else she wouldn't have gone so far from me, yeah!

Saint Louis woman with her diamond ring
Oh they're laying around by her apron string
If it wasn't for the powder and the store-bought hair
Now that girl of mine wouldn't gone so far, far, yeah!
I got the Saint Louis blues, blue as I can be!
Oh that girl got a heart like a rock down in the sea
Or else she wouldn't gone so far from me
Now let's say grandma loves ol' grandpa so
Oh  grandma loves ol' grandpa so
He can still do the boogie like he did forty years ago
 the blues  rabbit, runnin' for a solid mile
Well the blues  rabbit,  runnin' for a solid mile
Well the rabbit done go cry like a little baby child
Saint Louis blues!Embed
