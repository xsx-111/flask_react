I Guess I Should Go to Sleep Lyrics1,2,3, 2,2,3
I guess I should go to sleep
Too hard standin' on my own two feet
Been walkin' too long on a dead end street
I guess I should go to sleep
I guess I'll take off my shoes
Head upstairs and then watch the news
That's another way to lose these walkin' blues
I guess I'll take off my shoes
Well upstairs, upstaged, and upset
Keepin' quiet is gonna be my best bet yet
'Cause I ain't managed to say the right thing yet
Well I guess I should go back to bed
Guess I should go to sleep
It's too hard standin' on my own two feet
Been runnin' too long on an endless street
Well I guess I should go to sleep
Sleep
Sleep
