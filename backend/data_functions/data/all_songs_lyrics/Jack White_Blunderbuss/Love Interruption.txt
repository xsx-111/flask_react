Love Interruption LyricsI want love to
Roll me over slowly
Stick a knife inside me
And twist it all around
I want love to
Grab my fingers gently
Slam them in a doorway
Put my face into the ground
I want love to
Murder my own mother and
Take her off to somewhere
Like hell or up above
An' I want love to
Change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies
And show me how it's all my fault
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
Yeah, I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me anymore
I want love to
Walk right up and bite me
Grab a hold of me and fight me
Leave me dyin' on the ground
And I want love to
Split my mouth wide open and
Cover up my ears
And never let me hear a sound
I want love to
Forget that you offended me
Or how you have defended me
When everybody tore me down
Yeah, I want love to
Change my friends to enemies
Change my friends to enemies
Show me how it's all my fault
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me
Yeah, I won't let love disrupt, corrupt or interrupt me anymore10Embed
