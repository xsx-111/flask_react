On and On and On Lyrics
The sun and the moon never change
They just rearrange, the night and the new day
Gold exchanges for silver
And a light on a river gets carried away

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

I lift up my head and I wonder
Just who it is calming, callin' my name now
I trip on my way and I blunder
My head fallin' under a blanket of shame

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going
High and low may I go
But God only knows just where I am going
The people around me won't let me
Become what I need to, they want me the same
I look at myself and I want to
Just cover my eyes and give myself a new name

The stones in the sky never worry
They don't have to hurry, they move in their own way
But I have to choose what to do
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on

On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on
On and on, on and on4Embed
