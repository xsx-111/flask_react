Trash Tongue Talker LyricsI got no truck with your, woman
Always comin' over when I ain't home
You hand a buck to me baby
Tried your luck, you tried to get in my song
Oh well your mama was a bastard
Had your plastered face all over the scene
An' you got hassled by your daddy
Always pushin' tryin' to make you come clean
You broke your tongue talkin' trash
Now you're tryin' to bring your garbage to me
I got some words for your ass
You better find somebody else up the street
Two monkeys jumpin' on a bed
And one fell off and hit his head on the ground
The other monkey called a doctor
Said "Another body dead on the ground"
(Repeat 1st verse)
(Chorus x2)2Embed
