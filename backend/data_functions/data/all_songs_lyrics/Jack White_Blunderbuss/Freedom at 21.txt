Freedom at 21 Lyrics
(Yeah)
Cut off the bottoms of my feet, made me walk on salt
Take me down to the police, charge me with assault
Smile on her face, she does what she wants to me
That's right, and she don't care what kind of wounds she's inflicted on me
She don't care what color bruises that she's leavin' on me
'Cause she's got freedom in the 21st century
(Alright)

(Listen)
Two black gadgets in her hands, all she thinks about
No responsibility, no guilt or morals cloud her judgement
Smile on her face, she does what she damn well please
(Right)
And she don't care what kind of things people used to do
An' she don't care that what she does has an effect on you
She's got freedom in the 21st century


Cut off the bottoms of my feet (Cut off the bottoms of my feet)
Made me walk on salt (Made me walk on salt)
Take me down to the police (Take me down to the police)6Embed
