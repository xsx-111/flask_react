Sixteen Saltines LyricsShe's got stickers on her locker
And the boy's number's there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers then I lick my fingers
Well, every morning I deliver the news
Black hat, white shoes and I'm red all over
She's got a pink mailbox that she puts out front
Garbage in, garbage out; she's gettin' what she wants
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
If I get busy then I couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself, I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be gettin' through and touchin' you
Spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
Driftin' away when I'm talkin' and laughin' as we float
I hear her whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home
Force fed forced meds till I drop dead
You can't defeat her, when you meet her you'll get what I said
The Lord knows there's a method to her madness
But the Lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness
She doesn't know but when she's gone
I sit and drink her perfume
And I'm sure she's drinkin' too
But why, where, and what for, and whom?
And I'm solo rowin' on one side of the boat
Lookin' out, throwin' up, a lifesaver down my throat
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?7Embed
