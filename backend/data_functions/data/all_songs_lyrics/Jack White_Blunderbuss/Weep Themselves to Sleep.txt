Weep Themselves to Sleep Lyrics1,2,3,4
No one can blow the shows
Or throw the bones that break your nose like I can
But the men that fall so deep
In love they start to weep themselves to sleep can
And men who fight the world
And love the girl that try to hold their hands behind them
They won't be left behind
By time or any rules that try to bind them
Nobody knows just how it goes
To show that the villain will play the victim
The tame can't shake the reins of
Demonizin' brains that mean to kill them
And men who fight the world
And love the girl that try to hold their hands behind them
They won't be left behind
By time or any rules that try to bind them
And men who fight the world
And love the girl that try to hold their hands behind them
They won't be left behind
By time or any rules that try to bind them2Embed
