Hypocritical Kiss LyricsMy temper got the best of me
And when I said that I mean I know every single thing that I said was true
And I know that you're mad at me
But if you're thinkin' like that, I think you'll see that you're mad at you too
And I know the feelin's strong
Strong enough to forget about all that I've been through
And it sounds obscene, but
Loud words never bothered me like they do to you
You're the boy that talks but says nothin'
A big game to the ones that you think'll believe you, yeah
But you don't know how to read
The look on my face when it says, "Yeah, I've read that book too"
And who the hell's impressed by you?
I want names of the people that we know that are fallin' for this
You would sell your own mother out
And then betray your dead brother with another hypocritical kiss3Embed
