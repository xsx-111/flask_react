Take Me with You When You Go Lyrics(Chorus)
Take me with ya' when you go, girl
Take me anywhere you go
I've got nothin' keepin' me, here
Take me with you when you go
I got a feelin' my minds in the sky
And I can't catch a breath or a break like a guy
Who is strangled and beggin'
For help, not attention
And then, not to mention, the pain that is mine
And the thought of not knowin'
That what's goin' in my eyes
Or my hands could be robbin' without any knowledge
Or knowin' that helpin' yourself could be hurtin' or harmin' someone
(x2)
Take me with ya' when you go, girl
Take me anywhere you go
