Sweet Charity LyricsSave me, the heavens have opened
The storm is over, so let's start the parade
Raindrops will turn to laughter
Forever after in your technicolor heartbeat
And they say that it helps you forget everything
Sweet Charity
Sweet Charity
Drinking poison from a cup of gold
Your gift keeps on giving and giving
Perfect photographs of Everest days and postcard nights
Tearing through the paper walls of time
With sunset eyes
Telethons, Grand Canyon hearts
You numb your mind with gloves of white and turpentine
Even the bombs and scarecrows will sing
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sweet Charity
Sweet Charity
Save me, the heavens have opened
And I'm alone, sweet Charity
Save me, the heavens have opened
I'm coming home, sweet Charity
Save me, the asylums have opened
I'm coming home, sweet Charity
I'm home free
Sweet Charity
Sweet Charity
Sweet Charity
