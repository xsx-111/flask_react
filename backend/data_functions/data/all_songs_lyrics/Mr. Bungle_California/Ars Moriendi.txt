Ars Moriendi LyricsHe who hears in the vast silence
He who wafts on the red wind
"In extremis"
He who leaps across the precipice
He who steals pearls from the ashes
"Ride si sapis"
'Ave atque vale'
I shall rise again
Bardo of the flesh
So feast on me
All my bones are laughing
As you're dancing on my grave
'Ave atque vale'Embed
