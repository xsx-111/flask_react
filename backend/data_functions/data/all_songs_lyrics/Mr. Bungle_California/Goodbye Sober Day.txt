Goodbye Sober Day LyricsYour lips say one thing
But the drugs say another
How can I massage
This intergalactic ulcer?
Goodbye sober day
Hello milky way...
Pin my ear to the wisdom post
Hang me up and drain me dry
Mend my shipwrecked spirit
Lift the veil from my eyes
Goodbye sober day
The years grew wings and flew away
Ghosts of the past become barbarians
Of the future...
And I still pity you
Because what you said was true
Goodbye sober day
Hello milky way...
May your sun be blown out like a candle
May your sea burn like tar
May your sky be rolled up like a scroll
May your blue moon drip with blood
What would they say
If you went up in smoke?
If I dug you up
And made soup of your bones?
Goodbye sober dayEmbed
