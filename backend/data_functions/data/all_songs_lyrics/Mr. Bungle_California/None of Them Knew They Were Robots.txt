None of Them Knew They Were Robots LyricsMendel's machines replicate in the night
In the black iron prison of St. Augustine's light
He's paying the bills and they're doing him proud
They can float their burnt offerings on assembler clouds
With omega point in the sight
The new Franklins fly their kites
And the post modern empire is ended tonight
From history
The flood of counterfeits released
The black cloud
Reductionism and the beast
Automatons gather all the pieces
So the world may be increased
In simulation jubilation
For the deceased...
Spray-on clothes and diamond jaws
Wrinkles smoothed by nanoclaws
With my machines I can dispatch you
From this world without a trace
Our nostalgia ghosts are ready to take your place
Content-shifting shopping malls
Gasoline trees and walk-through walls
None of them knew
None of them knew
I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As I watch the dead rise up out of the earth
Try to hide from the lies as they all come true
Deus absconditus
Deus nullus deus
Deus nisi deus
I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As the fenris wolf slowly bites through his chain
Try to hide the myth as it becomes a man
None of them knew
None of them knew
They were robots
Deus absconditus
Deus nullus deus
Deus absconditus
Deus nisi deus
Buying an X or an O
In statecraft tic-tac-toe
Cat's game for Joe Blow
Post industrial bliss
A binary hug or kiss
Can be wrung from utility mist
They stole the great arcanum
The secret fire
Moloch found his gold
For the new empire
Once again
The necrophage becomes saint
Lindy hop around the truth
Jump back wolf pack attack
Swingin' up there in the noose
Slap back white shark attack
Lindy hop around the truth
Jump back wolf pack attack
Swingin' up there in the noose
Slap back white shark attack
Phased array diffraction nets
From full-wall paint-on TV sets
Migratory home sublets
And time shared diamond fiber sets
Recombinant logos keys
Bitic Qabalistic trees
Deus absconditus
Deus nullus deus
Deus nisi deus
I feel the grey goo boiling my blood
As leviathan and his bugs freeze the sea
Try to save the world by immolating myself
From history
The flood of counterfeits released
The black cloud
The resurrection of the deceased
Automatons gather all the pieces
So the world may be increased
In simulation jubilation
For the builders
Of the body of the beast1Embed
