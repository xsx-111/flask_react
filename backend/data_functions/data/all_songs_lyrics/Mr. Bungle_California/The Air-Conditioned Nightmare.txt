The Air-Conditioned Nightmare LyricsHey, inside of me today
There is no one
Only asteroids and empty space
A waste
Oh, oh, oh, oh, we-ooh
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Get me out of this air-conditioned nightmare
Rots your brain just like a catchy tune, you
You will hate life more than life hates you
Happiness is your illness in an air-conditioned nightmare
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Bap, bap, bap, bap
Get me out of this air-conditioner nightmare
Rots your brain, just like a catchy tune, you
You will hate life more than life hates you
Get me out of this air-conditioner nightmare
Walking on air
Up from the wheelchair
I'll find the suicide
That I deserve
Walking on sand
Forgotten where I am
But it's so comfortable
Here in the sun...
I only see rainbows
Now that the bandages are gone
Through my window, there
From the skyscrapers
Down to the submarines
Birds and fairies
Sanctuaries
Atop the rolling hills of Hell
These words are sledgehammers
Of truth
That pound the iron heart
Of sin
Bloody smiling
Vandalizing
My wet dream is drying up
Walkin' on air up from the wheelchair
I'll find the suicide, that I deserve
Walkin' on sand, forgotten where I am
But it's so comfortable, here in the sun
Where's my rainbow?
Where's my halo?
There's my halo!1Embed
