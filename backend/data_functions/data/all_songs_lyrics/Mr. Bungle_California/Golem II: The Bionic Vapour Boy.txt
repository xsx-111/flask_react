Golem II: The Bionic Vapour Boy LyricsGolem II: the self-perfecting
Lie-rejecting
Human mind correcting
Totem of the living
Self-organized, wrought from the clay
Totem of the living
Our king by night, our slave by the day
Giga-giga-gilgamesh
What do you know?
Watch the human life show
OK let's go
Oh my double
He can pop your bubble
That means trouble
Stronger than a lion
Golem II: the bionic vapour boy
Self-perfecting
World-inspecting
Lie-detecting
Our instructions
His induction
Big production

Beast of burden
Golem II: the self-perfecting
Lie-rejecting
Human mind correcting
Totem of the living
Self-organized, wrought from the clay
Totem of the living
Our king by night, our slave by the day
Giga-giga-gilgamesh
Spirit lifting
Master of shape-shifting
Seamless drifting
Shining spotlight
Screaming mobs and stage fright
You get it right
Building a new Zion
Golem II: the bionic vapour boy
War-directing
Mind-inspecting
Man-correcting
Our instructions
His induction
Big production
