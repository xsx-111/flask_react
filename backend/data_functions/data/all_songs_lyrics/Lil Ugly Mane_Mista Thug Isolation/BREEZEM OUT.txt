BREEZEM OUT Lyrics
I'm blowing trees to stop these devils from opressing my mental
Ugly Mane stay gatted up, armed to the dental
Luccini falling from the clouds and the rain is torrential
Hit the block fresh cut with the lines on the temple
All black leather in the whip is essential
Told your bitch fucking with ya is a waste of potential
Man she jumped in the shit like you ain't even exist
Now we swerving down the boulevard, flashing my wrist
Still serving fiends, got a stash in her tits
And the way she give head she a passionate bitch
Got that crack money dope flip trap money thread
He on the players' side he ain't taking nothing from me
Charge it to the game how a player survive
Got the Alpine bumping and we all the way live
Man that doja got me numb, yeah, I'm all the way high
And if a player says it's on, he can all the way die

If they hate the way you make your paper pull the top back and breeze 'em out killa, b-breeze 'em out
And if they clocking on your dollars in your work cock back and breeze 'em out killa, b-breeze 'em out
Haters always gonna be up in your face but that's a part of the chase so throw some fetti up and give 'em a taste
And breeze 'em out killa, breeze 'em out
Breeze 'em out killa, breeze 'em out

I got money on my mind but my mind in the gutter
That's why I'm flipping this work, I gets mine in the gutter
No rubberband credit, no Mastercard, Visa, Discover
Just lost in the game, another piece of the puzzle
I'm spitting butter y'all be garglin' margarine
Said "It's hard to be a artist when you caught up in the lawlessness"
Fuck 'em all, I'd rather fall to my death than be caught up in the harness
So I'm all up in this ghetto carnage trying to get beyond it
Go ahead and try, you ain't stopping my shine
Ugly Mane on that hustle, you ain't knocking my grind
It's me against the world like Pac in his prime
So I breeze 'em all out, what's poppin' tonight?
You like that Coach bag girl, you like that thang do ya?
You like my Boss swag, yeah you like my big jewelry
They be staring at us tryna make it do something
We just breeze 'em out, they ain't really want nothing
