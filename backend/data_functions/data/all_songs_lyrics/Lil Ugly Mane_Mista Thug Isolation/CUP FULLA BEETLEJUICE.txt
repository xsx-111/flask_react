CUP FULLA BEETLEJUICE Lyrics
I'm being goofy on a black Suzuki screaming "Free Boosie"
Shooting out the tires on cars while they moving
Headed to this bitch crib who said she will seduce me
If her booty is a clue, I know she gotta keep the coochie juicy
I'm a mack, bout to break this bitch back
If her man wanna yap I got the chopper in the 'lac
I'm omnipotent never worried I can make you vanish
Ain't a pussy on the block I can't manage left handed
Pump leave her wound so big you can't bandage
Sorry bitch I know I got the unfair advantage
Cup fulla beetlejuice, puffing on that loud
Ugly Mane back, playa how you like me now

I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
Guzzle it down! Ain't a killer on my level I be wearing the crown
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
You already know, it's hard to worry 'bout these suckers when you stacking up this dough
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
Guzzle it down! Ain't a killer on my level I be wearing the crown
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
You already know, it's hard to worry 'bout these suckers when you stacking up this dough

Player I'm the coldest, matter fact the boldest
I be in the future while you rappers on that old shit
Every time I spit these motherfuckers want to quote shit
But I don't write lyrics I write books full of potions
Put you underneath the Earth's surface
Thought I told you bitches that I sleep with these demons that I worship
Cause shit's deeper than the blood I'm submerged in
Black checkered floor with the red velvet curtain
Dope mind, cold chilling, money money making
If these dummies acting funny no trace, we erase them
Cup fulla beetlejuice, puffing on that loud
Ugly Mane back, player how you like me now
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
Guzzle it down! Ain't a killer on my level I be wearing the crown
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
You already know, it's hard to worry 'bout these suckers when you stacking up this dough
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
Guzzle it down! Ain't a killer on my level I be wearing the crown
I got a cup fulla beetlejuice
You already know, it's hard to worry 'bout these suckers when you stacking up this dough5Embed
