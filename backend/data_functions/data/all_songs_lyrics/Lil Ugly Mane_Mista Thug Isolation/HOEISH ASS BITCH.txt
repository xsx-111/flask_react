I be that no good pimp type, punch you in your windpipe
Old school devil shit, fuck it, ho, I been tight
Got my clique behind me, shawty
You can come and find me, shawty
I be on the block smoking doja 'till my eyes is blurry
Put me on the list with the pimps and the money-getters
If we in your hood, bet we've got the chrome with us
You got cajones being phony with them known killers
Dope dealing money from the floor to the ceiling, you feel me?
You be all up in my shine
And the word of verbal lies leave you your certain demise
I ain't got no time for you, just working for mine
So I'ma hide your body where nobody can find, you a bitch
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!

Bitch you a bitch, you always been a bitch
Boy you're looking mad when I'm fucking with your bitch
Ride on this bitch, got no love for this bitch
I'm pulling out my nine have him crying like a bitch
Ugly Mane never half-stepping, baby MAC-11
I got a whole lotta weapons
All up in the club with the gat, and the weed too
Bypass security, a player boutta squeeze through
Hoeish ass bitch, looking sloppy and ragged
And talking like he coming after me
I'll put some slugs in his body cavity
Don't get mad with me, murder's what it had to be
Talking all that reckless shit just is a tragedy

Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!
Hoeish ass— Bitch! Hoeish, hoeish ass— Bitch!3Embed
