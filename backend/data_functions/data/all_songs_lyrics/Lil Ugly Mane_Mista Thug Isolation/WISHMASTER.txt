WISHMASTER Lyrics
Yeah, don't you wish you could be me, bitch?

Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?

Turn me up some, 665 plus one
I'm entitled to my money like a trust fund
Come up off the dubs, let me touch one
Drops on every corner like the way the city bus runs
You know that I'mma act a fool again and lick shots in unison
With crews of hooligans until you're left with fewer friends
Catch me on the news, being interviewed, wearing your jewels
Saying "I saw it all, but I don't know who the shooter is"
I revel in the infamy, Count made the symphony
You can't fucks with it, then you really not a friend of me
Bullet hits your neck, travels all through your extremities
Make me feel sad, knowing murder not the remedy
But that's the way it be on the block
Braveheart, stay sharp before you run out of clock
Cause there's no halfsteppin', you're either in or you're not
And with the way the lips flap, you're either kin or the cops, bitch
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?

So what's the drill, kiddo, Ay yo, the black talon separates
The breeze like a whistle, shootin' flame out the Navi' window
Call the whip Zippo, Leave you crippled
We could do it in the park or after dark at the cribbo
Finesse invested, roll around in suits double-breasted
Whips foreign and domestic, bubble-butted shorty's big-chested
Blessed on the mic majestic
I keep it so filthy that the mic septic
We can throw hands, golden gloves, I got the marvelous molly-whop
The way I lick shots, I call it double-barrelled lollipops
Ugly blow spots just like a molotov
And I'mma stay rich 'til the fuckin' coffin drops
Ay yo, I walk around with mostly large rifles for survival
Cause "death walks hand-in-hand with struggle", Stokely Carmichael

Bitch, give me my mothafuckin' money, bitch!
Don't you wish you could be me, bitch?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Don't you wish you could be me?
Yeah, Mista Thug Isolation
Don't you wish you could be me punk? Ho?4Embed
