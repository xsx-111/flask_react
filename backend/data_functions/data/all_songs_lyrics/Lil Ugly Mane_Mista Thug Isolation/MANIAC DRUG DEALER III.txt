Hoeish ass bitch, keep runnin' that mouth
Got a couple dum-dums, put 'em right in your mouth
I don't ride with no sucker, I don't ride with no buster
When I smile, all you see is the diamonds in the cluster
I'ma pistol whip the bitch, I'ma put 'em in the trunk
Take the money out his pockets, take his ho out to lunch
Really, what's up? I be doin' it punk
Got me waiting outside of the club with the pump
Ready to dump, put you on slump
I know cats on your crew that all say you a chump
Fuck what you say, fuck what you claim
I be the killa they call Ugly Mane
Runnin' the game, swingin' them thangs
I'm already dead, I'ma make you the same, bitch

Fuck a conversation, bitch, murder's what I'm after
Catch you in the dark, one hand, I'ma grab ya
Blood everywhere, shit look like a disaster
I outlast and blast any punk-ass bastards
Closed casket, what you really wanna do?
I got a stack on your head, bitch, say it ain't true
I'ma call up my clique, I'ma put out a hit
I'm a maniac murderer, don't you forget
