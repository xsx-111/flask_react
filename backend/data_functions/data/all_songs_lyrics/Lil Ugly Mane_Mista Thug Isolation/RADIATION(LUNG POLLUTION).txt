Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt

Hoes is chilling, biting, smoking, drinking, thinking 'bout my past
Then my homies came thru, and asked, "Where the hell's the sack?"
Petey handed me a bowl of sour, so I took a couple drags
Then proceeded to go to the back and get hash up out the sack
"Take a little just to make it last"—that's Supa's motto
We fiendin' on these trees like we just won the lotto
Chiefin' for a reason, like we ain't gon' see tomorrow
Until we fall asleep and make some Zs like Zorro
Inhalin' vapors and feeling no sorrow, don't feel no pain
I feel bad for the people who have never kicked it with Mary Jane
She radiates all through my brain and enhances every thought I think
Even makes my food better, and I have more fun when I drink
Gimme a bag of that sticky-icky, I need an eighth for the sixty-sixty
Hippie shit, just like the '60s, except we fresh—them dudes was filthy
Ridin' forty-five in the fifty, I smoked these joints, now I'm spliffy
Damn, this bowl really got me lifted, I rap so tight, people say I'm gifted
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt

Puffin' on that paradise, that kush has got me paralyzed
Verified, I'm very high, whip so clean, it's sterilized
Terrorize yo block, you in my way? Why ain't ya moving?
Me and Supa Sortahuman rolled a quarter in a Cuban, now we groovin'
Feeling extra throwed, hot like wings of buffalos
Just to let you bustas know, them duffel bags got extra dough
Only fuck with sexy hoes, I swear I leave the rest alone
Underground, I'm lesser known, but in the hood they feel my testimony
Y'all ain't smoking on my level, y'all ain't fucking on my level
Y'all ain't dranking on my level, y'all ain't nothing on my level
These fools they needin' a lesson, they probably smokin' that resin
They talkin' all of that shit, I'll prolly pull out my weapon
That sour diesel be relievin' my stress, gettin me right
I swear it's hard not to just walk outside ready to fight
Lime green cannabis, color of Praying Mantises
No stems, no seeds, crystals like they amethyst
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Get high, get high, get high
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt
Smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt, smoke yo blunt3Embed
