LOOKIN 4 THA SUCKIN Lyrics
Looking for tha suckin'

Bitch I got ten thousand, multiply a hundred
Bitch theres a million fly womens in my dungeon
Catch me at the airport, flying out to London
Stackin up my paper you can tell that I am stunting

I'm getting neck from this dime ho, booty like a rhino
What's her name, hell if I know
'Bout to flip her over grab the jimmy out the glove box
Tell her shake it in the air then let her butt drop
Let her pussy pop, see what type of goods she got
She like it when I smack her booty when she on the top, thats how thugs rock
Bitch you ain't my lady you ain't nothing we just fucking
You was just the ho I picked when I was looking for tha sucking
