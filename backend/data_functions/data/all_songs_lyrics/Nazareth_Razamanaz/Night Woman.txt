Night Woman LyricsShe's a night woman of my dreams
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam
Silver stardust in her eyes
In the way she leaves her sighs
Last night I fell asleep
Thought I heard her voice begin to speak
My mind is in distress
On my cheek I felt her breath
I could feel her body's warmin' glow
My frozen blood began to flow
She's a night woman of my dreams
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam
Comes, stays, then disappears
In the morning sun my vision clears
I could smell the roses in her hair
But when I awoke, she was not there
Oooh, oooh, night woman of my dream
Oooh, oooh, night woman of my dream
Oooh, oooh, she's a night woman of my dream
Oooh, oooh, night woman of my dreamEmbed
