Too Bad Too Sad LyricsOnce I had a girl
She called me on the phone
Said "Come on over honey
You know, I'm all alone"
But when I got to her place
What I saw stopped me dead
She was standin' with a shotgun
Pointed at my head
My, my, too bad too sad
My, my, too good to last
So I'm cuttin' out fast
Once I had a friend
We had a lot of laughs
He was all a friend could be
Knowin' him was just a gas
One night I got home
He gave me one surprise
He was standin' in a woman's dress
Lashes on his eyes
My, my, too bad too sad
My, my, too good to last
So I'm cuttin' out fast
My, my, my
My, my, my
Had a pretty wife
She was all I could need
Gave me what I wanted
Never had to plead
One day a man called
And he put me wise
She's doin' the same thing
With ten other guys
My, my, too bad too sad
My, my, too good to last
So I'm cuttin' out fast
My, my, too bad too sad
My, my, too good to last
So I'm cuttin' out fast
My, my, my
My, my, myEmbed
