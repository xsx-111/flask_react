Woke Up This Morning LyricsWoke up this morning, my dog was dead
Someone disliked him and shot him through the head
Woke up this morning, my cat had died
I know I'll miss her, sat down and cried
Came home this evening, my hog was gone
People here don't like me, I think I'll soon move on
Now somethings happened, that would make a saint frown
I turned my back and my house burned downEmbed
