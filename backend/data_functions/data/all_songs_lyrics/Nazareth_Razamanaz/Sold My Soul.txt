Sold My Soul LyricsI prayed to God and Jesus
But I guess they didn't hear
My sacrfice was useless
My pleas fell on deaf ears
So I cried in desperation
Bowed to evil sorcery
I looked to the Lord in heaven
But he must have looked away
My crying eyes repentant
Please send her love to light my day
So I cried in desperation
Bowed to evil sorcery
I sold my soul
Sold my soul
I sold my soul to the devil
So I cried in desperation
Bowed to evil sorcery
I sold my soul
Sold my soul
I sold my soul to the devil
Sold my soul
Sold my soul
I sold my soul
Sold my soul
Sold my soul to the devil
To the devil
I sold my soul
I sold my soul to the devil
To the devil
I sold my soul
I sold my soul
I sold my soul to the devil
I sold my soul to the devil
To the devil, oh
Sold my soul...Embed
