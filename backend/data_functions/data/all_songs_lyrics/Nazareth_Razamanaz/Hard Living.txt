Hard Living LyricsHard living every day of my life
Hard living, every night on the wine
Never givin' anyone any time
Always losin' all I had all the time
Yes, I'm a selfish kinda man
All I need is a helping hand
Bad loser, never had anyone
Bad chooser, never owed never won
Fast mover, everyday on the run
Never knowing if I feel or I'm done
Yes, I'm a selfish kinda man
All I need is a helping hand
Hard living every day of my life
Hard drinking, every night on the wineEmbed
