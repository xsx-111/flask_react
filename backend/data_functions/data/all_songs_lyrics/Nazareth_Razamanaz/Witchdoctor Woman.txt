Witchdoctor Woman LyricsI'll make the stars fall out of the sky
Make the seas and the rivers run dry
There is nothing I can't do
Lord I'll put my spell on you
Praise the mountains down to the ground
Make the clouds and the rain fall down
There is nothing I can't do
Lord I'll put my spell on you
I'm your witchdoctor woman
And I'm gonna put my spell on you
I'm your witchdoctor woman
Lord I got my mind on you
I'll make the stars fall out of the sky
Make the seas and the rivers run dry
There is nothing I can't do
Lord I'll put my spell on you
I'm your witchdoctor woman
And I'm gonna put my spell on you
I'm your witchdoctor woman
Lord I got my mind on you
Praise the mountains down to the ground
Make the clouds and the rain fall down
There is nothing I can't do
Lord I'll put my spell on you
I'm your witchdoctor woman
And I'm gonna put my spell on you
I'm your witchdoctor woman
Lord I got my mind on youEmbed
