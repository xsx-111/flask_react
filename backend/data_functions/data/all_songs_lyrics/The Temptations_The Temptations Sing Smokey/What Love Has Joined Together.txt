What Love Has Joined Together Lyrics
It would be easier to take the wet from water or the dry from sand
Than for anyone to try to separate us or stop us from holding hands

'Cause I love you (I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
What love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can no one take it apart

It would be easier to take the cold from snow or the heat from fire
Than for anyone to take me love from you 'cause you're my heart's desire

I really love you (I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
What love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can nobody take it apart

Even if they separate us a thousand miles apart
We will still be together in each other's heart
It would be easier to change all the seasons of the year
Than for anyone to change the way I feel about you; I love you, dear
I really love you (I love you)
Oh, I love you from the bottom of my heart
What love has joined together, what love has joined together
Can nobody take it apartEmbed
