You Beat Me to the Punch Lyrics
That day, I first saw you, oh oh, passing by
I wanted, to know your name but I was much too shy
I was looking at you so hard
Until you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me my name, baby

You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch), yeah
You beat me to the punch, yeah (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)

Oh, after, I had known you for it seems like a long, long time
I wanted, wanted to ask you would you please, please be mine
Whenever you came around, my heart would pound
So you must have had a hunch
So you came up to me and asked me to be yours, baby

You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)
You beat me to the punch (You beat me to the punch)

Oh, since I loved you
I thought you would be true
And love me so tender
I let my poor heart surrender
To you, yes I did
But I found out, beyond a doubt
One day, girl, you were a playgirl
To walk away and leave me so blue
So I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down
This time I'm gonna play my hunch
And walk away this very very day, yeah

And beat you to the punch (I'll beat you to the punch), baby
And beat you to the punch, yeah (I'll beat you to the punch), baby
I'll beat you to the punchEmbed
