(You Can) Depend on Me Lyrics
You, you need a love like mine that you can depend on
When your whole world's falling in
When you need a friend, you can depend on me
You can depend on me

I'll be by your side
When you need me
When the whole world seems unfair
And no one seems to care
You can depend on me
You can depend on me

When life seems not worth living
And nothing seems to be going right
The comfort my love will be giving, giving
Will change your darkness to light

I, I, I, I, I'll be by your side
When you need me
When the whole seems unfair
And no one seems to care
You can depend on me
Ooh, you know you can depend on me
Yeah, yeah
You can depend on me
Yeah, yeah, every dayEmbed
