Way Over There Lyrics
I've got a lover way over there on the mountainside
And I know that's where I should be (got a love, got a love)
Don't you know I've got a lover way over there across the river wide
I can hear her calling to me
Oh, but she's calling my name (calling my name)
So sweet and so plain, and I can hear her saying
Come on, come on
I'm on my way
Come on, come on
I'm gonna stay
Come on, come on

Ah, they tell me that the river's too deep and it's much too wide
Boy, you can't make it over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying...
Come on, come on
I'm on my way
Come on, come on
I'm gonna stay
Come on, come on
I'm gonna get to you
Come on, come on
No matter what I have to do
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Lord, they tell me that the river's too deep and it's much too wide
Oh, you can't make it over to the other side
But they don't know I got to get there
And hold her in my arms just one more time
Like I did before when she was mine all mine
'Cause I can hear her saying...
Come on, come on
I'm on my way
Come on, come on
I'm gonna stay
Come on, come on
Baby, when I get there
Come on, come on
I ain't going nowhere
Come on, come on
No, because a river ain't deep enough
Come on, come on
The mountain ain't steep enough to keep me from your side
Come on, come on, come on
Come on
Come on, come on
I'm comin'
Come on, come on, come onEmbed
