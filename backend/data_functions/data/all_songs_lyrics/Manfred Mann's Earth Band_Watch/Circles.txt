Circles LyricsGoin' round in circles
Directions all messed up
I go to ground on a bottle of wine
Drown myself in the flood
My frozen toes are beginnin' to melt
I believe I'm catchin' a cold
Got oil on my feathers and I can't fly
I gotta get back to your love
I'm a clown without a circus
There's no one to see my act
I can laugh and sing and stand on my head
Nobody knows where I'm at
It's hard to be convincin'
When these blues don't give an inch
I ain't exactly losin'
But I'm beginning to feel the pinch
My days are long and lonely
And I feel so insecure
There ain't nothin' funny I'm losing you, honey
I can't laugh anymore, I can't laugh anymore
Goin' round in circles
Compass is all messed up
I go to ground on a bottle of wine
Drown myself in the flood
My frozen toes are beginnin' to melt
I believe I'm catchin' a cold
Got oil on my feathers and I can't fly
Gotta get back to your love
Old Chang surely told me
Not to mess with what you got
But I went stompin' all over your head
Like a bull in a china shop
My days are long and lonely
And I feel so insecure
There ain't nothin' funny I'm losing you, honey
I can't laugh anymore
I can't laugh anymore
I'm a clown without a circus
There's no one to see my act
I can laugh and sing and stand on my head
Nobody knows where I'm at
Goin' round in circles
Directions all messed up
I go to ground on a bottle of wine
Drown myself in the flood1Embed
