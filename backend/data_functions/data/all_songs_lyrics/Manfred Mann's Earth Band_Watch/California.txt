California LyricsCalifornia...
How you doin' out in California
Now that you've made the grade
Is there a chance you'd think of me
And all the things we did together
How you doin' out in California
Now that you've got it made
You must be glad you made the break
But how I wish you'd stayed
Livin' out in California
Seems to suit you well
But my news is all second hand
So it's hard for me to tell
One day I'll make it out to California
See if it's what it seems
I've been there many times before
But only in my dreams
California...
One day I'll make it out to California
See if it's what it seems
I've been there many times before
But only in my dreams
Oh it could be the money
It could be the sun
Something's keeping you away from me
California look what you've doneEmbed
