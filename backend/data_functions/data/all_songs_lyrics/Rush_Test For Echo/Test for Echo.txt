Test for Echo Lyrics
Here we go, vertigo
Video vertigo
Test for echo

Here we go, in slo-mo
Video vertigo
Test for echo
Test for echo

Some kind of trouble on the sensory screen
Camera curves over caved-in cop cars
Bleacher-creatures, would-be desperadoes
Clutch at plausible deniability
Don't touch that dial
We're in denial
Until the showcase trial on TV

Here we go, vertigo
Video vertigo
Test for echo

Some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news
Miles of yellow tape, silhouetted chalk lines
Tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knock-offs
Conform to uniforms of some corporate entity
Don't change that station
It's a Gangsta Nation
Now crime's in syndication on TV
Here we go
What a show, vertigo
Video vertigo
Test for echo

Touch and go, in slow-mo
Video vertigo
Test for echo
Test for echo

Here we go, vertigo
Video vertigo

Some kind of drama live on satellite
Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom
Nail-biting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets
Clutching at the straws of respectability

Can't do the time?
Don't do the crime
And wind up in the perp walk on TV
Here we go, vertigo
Video vertigo
Test for echo

What a show, vertigo
Video vertigo
Test for echo

Touch and go, in slow-mo
Video vertigo
Test for echo
