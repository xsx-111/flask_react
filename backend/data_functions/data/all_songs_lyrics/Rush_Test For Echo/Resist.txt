Resist Lyrics
I can learn to resist
Anything but temptation
I can learn to coexist
With anything but pain

I can learn to compromise
Anything but my desires
I can learn to get along
With all the things I can't explain

I can learn to resist
Anything but frustration
I can learn to persist
With anything but aiming low
I can learn to close my eyes
To anything but injustice
I can learn to get along
With all the things I don't know

I can learn to resist
Anything but temptation
I can learn to coexist
With anything but pain
I can learn to compromise
Anything but my desires
I can learn to get along
With all the things I can't explain

You can surrender
Without a prayer
But never really pray
Pray without surrender
You can fight
Fight without ever winning
But never ever win
Win without a fight

I can learn to close my eyes
To anything but injustice
I can learn to get along
With all the things I don't know
I can learn to close my eyes
To anything but injustice
I can learn to get along
With all the things I don't know2Embed
