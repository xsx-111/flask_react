IT MIGHT TAKE SOME TIME Lyrics
Through the fabric of space, we go
With the promise of life, I wept for the goal (I do)
Do you realize you’re caught in a web?
Would you lie to your spawn to save them a trip? (I do)

Around, they go (I do, I do)
Around, they’re gone (I do, I do)
Around, they go
Around, they’re gone

It might take some time
It might take some time (It might take some time)
It might take some time
It might take some time (It might take some time)
It might take some time
It might take some time (It might take some time)
It might take some time (It might take some time)
It might take some time (It might take some time)
It might take some time (It might take some time)
It might take some timeEmbed
