BAD SON Lyrics
How you wanna pass the time?
I know you wanna live so you can’t die
But no one knows my name, they don’t know why
Someone wants my trust in lies
I’m a bad son, that’s why the family thinks twice
I don’t have love, I just sympathize nice
But every time I wake I try
If you keep your world small you monopolize
Don’t ascribe to me for your fortunate life

Tell me the truth: do you really want someone, too?
Forced by design to forcefully realign1Embed
