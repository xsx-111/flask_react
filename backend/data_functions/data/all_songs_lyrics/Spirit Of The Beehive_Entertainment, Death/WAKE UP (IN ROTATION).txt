WAKE UP (IN ROTATION) Lyrics
I’ve read a thousand lines
They slipped through my palms
I’m already late, I can feel it. I
I’m all pitiful then one morning
I can’t feel it

I slip my hand into
My pocket and I
I see it goes right through
It goes all the way
It goes all the way
So how do I know it ends?

I want to wake up
I want to wake up in rotation
Wake up in rotation
Wake up in rotation
Wake up
Wake up in rotation


I’d utilize subterfuge to emerge unscathed
But paralyzed, I lie wide awake once again
And I ask myself (I want to wake up in rotation)
And I ask myself (I want to wake up in rotation)
The point of everything
And I see myself out of thе room, again (I want to wake up in rotation)
Destroy evеrythingEmbed
