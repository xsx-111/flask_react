ENTERTAINMENT Lyrics



I woke up when I heard the blow
Heading east towards KSMO
Sixteen wheelers passing too close
Dust picks up and swallows us whole
(It’s alright, forget it)

I regret some choices I’ve made
Entertainment only remains (While I keep descending)
Who will decipher pain from the lie?
With every decision phased and finalized

(I keep descending)
(And no one remembers my face, my name)3Embed
