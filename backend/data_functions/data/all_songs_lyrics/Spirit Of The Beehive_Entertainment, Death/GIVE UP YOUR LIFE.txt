GIVE UP YOUR LIFE Lyrics
I read your message, you were there for us all
Exposed your body to debris from the fall
What have I got me into?
Distressing letters force apologies through
If I’m not careful now
I won’t be long for this world

I read your message, I was suffering, too
Designed partitions no one gets through
I’m not lonely now
I don’t care for this world

We bump shoulders and talk
Walking the dog after dark
Give up your life to me, then you’ll see
Give up your life to me, nowEmbed
