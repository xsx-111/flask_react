RAPID & COMPLETE RECOVERY Lyrics
Scratch the itch to find the merit
No limitations, you know what I’m after

What if I don’t pull through?
Believing is selfish
But the feeling is mutual
What if I don’t pull through this time?
I know what it feels like
To live an enthused life
I know what it feels like
To be flushed out and bathing in eyes

Spanning lifetimes, compressed in a vacuum
No limitations, you know what I'm after

What if I don’t pull through?
What if I don’t pull through this time?
I don’t know how to find what I have to
I don’t know how to find what I have to
I don’t know how to find what I have to
I don’t know how to find what I have to
And though we can dance all day
Dissolve in the fragmentation
Is the hole we make devouring us?
Spanning lifetimes, compressеd in a vacuum
No limitations, you know what I'm after

What if we don’t feel the samе?
What if we don’t feel the same?
What if we don’t feel the same?
What if we don’t feel the same?
What if we don’t feel the same?
What if we don’t feel the same?
What if we don’t feel the same?
What if we don’t feel the same?1Embed
