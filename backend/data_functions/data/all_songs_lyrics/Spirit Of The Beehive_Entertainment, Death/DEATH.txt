DEATH Lyrics
This life is a party
So sweet it’s like candy
Melts in your head
I feel every moment
Like anything can happen
It can happen to me, eventually

Always falling down
Always falling down

Write checks you can’t cash
Smile for the last act
Once was a comedy is now the universe

Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, dеath (Entertainment, death)
Entеrtainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
Entertainment, death (Entertainment, death)
You can have it all
My love is chemical
Suffer for devotion
Nowhere left to runEmbed
