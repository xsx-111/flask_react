THE SERVER IS IMMERSED Lyrics
I was following (A distant future)
Paths I’ve already tried (I don’t make sense of it)
Dread desires the weak (Collapsed with one word)
And it’s all red sea above me

The server is immersed (Rewind the video)
She walks past affluent streets (It gets the best of us)
No, you don’t have a clue (I sent a post card)
But at least I know that I do

Anywhere that you go, they will find you
You might wait but you’re already in the future
Anywhere that you go, there’s a pulpit and a preacher
Anywhere that you go

Dozed on Ativan, I was out of my mind
Please, you don’t know the truth
But at least I know that I doEmbed
