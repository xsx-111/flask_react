Morning Bell/Amnesiac Lyrics
The morning bell, the morning bell
Light another candle and
Release me
Release me

You can keep the furniture, a bump on the head
Howling down the chimney
Release me
Release me, yeah
Release me
Release me

Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Your clothes are on the lawn with the furniture
And I might as well, I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around, around, around, around
And round

Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Cut the kids in half
Release me
Release me
Release me
Release me2Embed
