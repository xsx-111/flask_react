You and Whose Army? Lyrics
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy?
Well, come on, come on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

Come on, come on
Holy Roman Empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us on
You can take us on

You and whose army?
You and your cronies

You forget so easy
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses21Embed
