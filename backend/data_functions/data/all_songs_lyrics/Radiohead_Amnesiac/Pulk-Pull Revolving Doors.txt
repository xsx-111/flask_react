Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors Lyrics
There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors

There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and there are secret doors

There are doors that lock and doors that don't
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors that you can't come back from10Embed
