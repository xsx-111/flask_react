Knives Out Lyrics
I want you to know he's not coming back
Look into my eyes, I'm not coming back

So knives out, catch the mouse
Don't look down, shove it in your mouth

If you'd been a dog, they would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth

So knives out, cook him up
Squash his head, put him in the pot

I want you to know he's not coming back
He's bloated and frozen
Still there's no point in letting it go to waste

So knives out, catch the mouse
Squash his head, put him in the pot19Embed
