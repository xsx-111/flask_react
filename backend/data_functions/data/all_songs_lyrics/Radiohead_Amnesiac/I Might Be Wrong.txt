I Might Be Wrong Lyrics
I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
I used to think, I used to think
There was no future left at all
I used to think

Open up, begin again

Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back

What would I do? What would I do?
If I did not have you?

Open up and let me in

Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, it's nothing at all
It's nothing at all, nothing at all
Keep it moving
Keep it moving30Embed
