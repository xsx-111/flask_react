Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box Lyrics
After years of waiting
Nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize

I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case

After years of waiting

After years of waiting
Nothing came
And you realize you're looking in
Looking in the wrong place

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
After years of waiting

I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case15Embed
