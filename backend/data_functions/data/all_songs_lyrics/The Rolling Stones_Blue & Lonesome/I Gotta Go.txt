I Gotta Go Lyrics
Leavin' in the morning, baby I know I got to go
Leavin' in the morning, baby you know I got to go
I've got the blues and I can't stay here no more

I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun is goin' down
I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun is goin' down
I've got the blues and I can't stay in your town
C'mon!


The moon is risin' and the sun is done goin' on down, down
The moon is risin' and the sun is done goin' down
I've got the blues and I can't stay around
Oh yeah, c'mon


I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun is goin' down
I ain't seen my baby and the evening sun is goin' down
I've got the blues and my baby can't be foundEmbed
