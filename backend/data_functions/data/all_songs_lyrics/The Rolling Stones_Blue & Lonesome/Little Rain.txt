Little Rain LyricsA little rain fallin'
Little clock keep away the time
A little rain fallin'
Little clock keep away the time
Well, a little rain keep on fallin'
On this little love of mine
Little flowers open
Little birds keep singin' tune
Little flowers open
Little birds keep singin' tune
I would like to love you, baby
Underneath the shinin' moonEmbed
