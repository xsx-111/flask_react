All of Your Love Lyrics
All your love, baby, can it be mine?
All your love, baby, can it be mine?
I hate to be the one, the one you left behind

All your love, baby, don't put around
All your love, baby, don't put around
Love is one thing, baby, you won't find on the ground
C'mon


All your love, I've got to have it one day
All your love, I've got to have it one day
Don't you leave me, baby, please come back this way


All your love, can it be mine?
All, all your love, can it be mine?
I hate to be the one, the one that you left behindEmbed
