Commit a Crime Lyrics
I'm gonna leave you, baby, before I commit a crime
I'm gonna leave you, baby, before I commit a crime
You tried so hard to kill me, but woman, it just was not my time

You put poison in my coffee instead of milk or cream
You put poison in my coffee instead of milk or cream
You're about the evilest woman that I ever seen


I'm gonna leave you, baby, before I commit a crime
I'm gonna leave you, woman, before I commit a crime
Yeah, you tried so hard to kill me but woman, it was not, it was not my timeEmbed
