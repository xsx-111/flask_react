Blue and Lonesome Lyrics
I'm blue and lonesome as a man can be
I'm blue and lonesome, yeah, as a man can be
I don't have no headache about myself
My love has gone away from me

Baby please, baby please come back to me
Baby please, come on home to me
Yeah, my heart is full of misery
Baby, you won't be sweet to me


Yeah, I'm gonna cast my trouble
Down in the deep blue sea
Yeah, I'm gonna cast my trouble, yeah
Down in the deep blue sea
And the whales and the fishes
Have no fuss over meEmbed
