Just Like I Treat You Lyrics
Some say you will, some say you won't
Some say you do, some say you don't
But I know, know what you been through
You're gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you

Some say you can, some say you can’t
Some say you is, some say you ain't
But I know, know what you’ve been through
I’m gonna treat you baby, just like I treat you
Alright


Yeah, if I give you little, it can give it back
If I give you lots, I know what you’ll like
But I know, know what you've been through
You’re gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you


Yeah, some say you’re fine, some say you’re sad
Some say you’re hot, some say you’re bad
But I know, know what you been through
You’re gonna treat me baby, just like I treat you
I'm gonna treat you baby, just like I treat youEmbed
