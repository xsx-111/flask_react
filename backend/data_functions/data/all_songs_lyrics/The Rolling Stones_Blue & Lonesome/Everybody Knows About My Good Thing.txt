Everybody Knows About My Good Thing Lyrics
Yeah!
I was talking to the postman
He mentioned your name
Seems like everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
It seems like everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

Yeah!
I was talking to my neighbour
About the way you wear your hair
He said you must have a lot of children
Because the milk man is always there

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
It seemed like everybody, everybody, everybody knows
Everybody knows about my good thing
C'mon! Yeah! Alright, play a solo

I was talking to the butcher
He said you always look so neat
I guess that's why my freezer
Is always full of meat

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
It seems like everybody, everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing

Last time, here we go
Everybody, I said everybody knows about my
Everybody knows about my good thing
Everybody knows knows that, nobody wants to be my woman
Nobody wants to be, oh no, no

Call the plumber darling
There must be a leak in my drain
Yeah!
It seems like everybody, everybody, everybody
Everybody knows about my good thing1Embed
