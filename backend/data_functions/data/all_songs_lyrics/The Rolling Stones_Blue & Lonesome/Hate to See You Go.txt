Hate to See You Go Lyrics
The way you left me, left me here to cry
Now, oh, I love her, she's my desire
She's my desire, she's my desire
Came home this mornin', 'bout half past four
Found that note lyin' on my floor
The way you left me, you just don't know
Heard some bad talk, somethin' that you said
Somethin' that you said, somethin' that you said

Come on back, baby
Baby, please don't go
Oh, I love you, you'll never know
You'll never know, you'll never know
My kind of baby, you know it's so
I ain't gon' tell you, it ain't no joke
No, it ain't no joke, no, it ain't no joke
No, it ain't no joke

Come on back, baby, don't do me wrong
You know I love you, please come on home
Come on back home, come on back home
Come on back home, come on back home
Come back homeEmbed
