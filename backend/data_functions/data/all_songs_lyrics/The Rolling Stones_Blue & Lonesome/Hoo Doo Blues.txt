Hoo Doo Blues Lyrics
Now, when your woman actin' funny, begin to run around
You better get you somebody, put her down
Better let her go just as quick as you can
You know the hoo doo girl, she has hoo doo the hoo doo man

You know my woman got me on a wonder
Somethin' I can't understand
Now I look at her running with some other man
After all I did everything in the world I can
You know that the hoo doo girl, she out-hoo doo the hoo doo man


Yeah, you know she take all my money, spend it all over town
When I wanna love her, now she  can't be found
I walk and cry, dryin' tears away with my hand
You know that hoo doo girl, she out-hoo doo the hoo doo manEmbed
