Superenigmatix (Lethal Appliances for the Home With Everything) LyricsSuperenigmatix, there's one hiding in the attic
And it's getting all ecstatic cause it goes on automatic
When the lights go out
There's one in the TV and it's waiting there to please me
And I've got to take it easy cause I know that it can see me
When the lights go out
Inside, outside, watching me both night and day
Sometimes I wish I could make it go away
Sometimes when I'm dreaming, I awake to find I'm screaming
Cause they've taken all the meaning from the book that I was reading
When the lights went out
I know it seems outspoken but I'd love to see them broken
No more orders, no more slogans, no more keeping my eyes open
When the lights go out
Inside, outside, watching me both night and day
Sometimes I wish I could make them go away
Superenigmatix, always amateur dramatic
And they're trying to get me at it
But I think I'm going to kick them inEmbed
