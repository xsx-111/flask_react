Possession LyricsNelson
There's such a beautiful mess up in my room
My thoughts are tangled in the legs of chairs
I like to think that it's my token of genius
But then again perhaps I just don't care
I'm going crazy with the speed of living
I'm leaving parts of me all over the place
I think I've found a piece that looks like my heart
But then again maybe it's just my face
Possession, possession, paying the price
Possession, possession, run for my life
I charge my dreams up with the cheapest batteries
The light goes out and everything looks dim
I stumble 'round pretending that I'm dancing
Doing fine until the truth breaks in
Cameras are thieves, they always take my picture
A tape-recorder stole my voice today
I think machines and clocks have secret motives
But then again (maybe they're made that way)
Possession, possession, paying the price
Possession, possession, run for my life
I paint my shirt with all the latest outrages
Just like I did so many years before
It drives me to the brink of pink disaster
But I don't mind, that's what possession's for
Possession, possession, paying the price
Possession, possession, run for my lifeEmbed
