Lights LyricsShadows move across the faces
Of the people we once knew
And though their hearts are full of sorrow
The sun inside can still shine through
In the factories and the stations
In the house of the poor
In the darkest of all places
There is still an open door
In the factories and the stations
In the house of the poor
In the darkest of all places
There is still an open door
When you lose the smile your smiling
When the blues stare down on you
You are still the lamp that's shining
So let the sun inside shine through
So let the sun inside shine through
So let the sun inside shine through
Let the sun inside shine through
Let the sun inside shine throughEmbed
