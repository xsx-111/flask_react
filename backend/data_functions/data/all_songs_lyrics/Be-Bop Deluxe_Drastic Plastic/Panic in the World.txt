Panic in the World LyricsIn the cities there is talk of rain and fire
It was on the air today, it almost filled me with desire
All our skies are gray, they say the dreamers line the streets
Looking out from hollow houses, rivers running at their feet
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
My love and I, we escaped, we left no trace
For they had raped both body and soul
The taste was much too hard to swallow
We ran naked through the cold
Above our heads, in fiery red
The clouds they bled like open wounds across the sky
The wings of many nations falling, burning, turning
Trying oh so hard to die
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
We'll find an island, we'll burn the maps
We'll lock our hearts and throw the keys into the sea
Let's be survivors, they'll never find us
It's all behind us, I know a place they've never been
In new horizons, in golden swarms, in comes tomorrow
It's thunder storms over the hill
The future fall, beyond these walls
Destiny calling, like the dawn a sweeter thrill
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
Oh oh, oh oh, there's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the world
There's panic in the worldEmbed
