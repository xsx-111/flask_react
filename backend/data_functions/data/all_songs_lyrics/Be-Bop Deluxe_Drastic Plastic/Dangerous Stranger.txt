Dangerous Stranger LyricsNelson
It's after midnight in the city of broken dreams
Down in the alley, Galileo meets his pack of thieves
Over the river by the old hotel
There's a big car coming like a bat out of Hell
It's the dangerous stranger in his ghostly limousine
You get the feeling that he's running in an endless race
Driving through the city like a razor across its face
Stops on the corner in a flash of flame
He calls to me ('Hey boy, what's your name ?')
He's the stranger with a danger if you ever get to play his game
I want to go for a ride
To see what lies on the other side
I want to go for a ride tonight, tonight
I climb right in, like a fool I say I'll go
I listen to the messages comin' through his radio
Is that my name on channel 9 ? They say
('You're going away for a long long time')
With the dangerous stranger from a station on the other side
I want to go for a ride
To see what lies on the other side
I want to go for a ride tonight, tonight
The night is black and the stars no longer burn
The radio says that we're past the point of no return
I scream at the driver but he says
('No way, you shouldn't have come if you didn't want to stay')
He's the dangerous stranger on a highway to the end of time
He's the dangerous stranger on a highway to the end of timeEmbed
