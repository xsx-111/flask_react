Islands of the Dead LyricsNelson
Come with me to the fire festival
Let us burn each other blind
Let us dance, let us dance away
Dance till the end of time
Come with me to the islands of the dead
To the soul house, to the fire-house
To smoke and ash of laughter in your head
Sweet laughter, here after
Ever after, in the islands of the dead
Pack up all your mortal memories
Cloak your soul in sleep
The moon is in the window
And the wind is in the trees
These things are yours to keep
Oh come with me to the islands of the dead
Let us sail sail sail sail away
To smoke and ash of laughter in your head
Sweet laughter, here after
Ever after, in the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the dead
In the islands of the deadEmbed
