Surreal Estate LyricsNelson
I bought you surreal estate
Hanging gardens for your gate
You said that I could stay
See you through to another day
That day became a year
Time flies in this atmosphere
Aeroplanes and crashing cars
Automatic in the head my dreams of you
Bring telescopes and read the stars
They say the future's ours to penetrate
Electric-eye sees all within
A polaroid life you and I begin
The city dwellers drop like flies
Delirium and madness in their eyes
In bowls of blue and water-glass
My angel-fish and I, we pass the time away
It's worth the wait, surreal estate
Surreal estate, no time, no date
Accept no fake surreal estate
Design by fate, surreal estate
I bought you surreal estate
Hanging gardens for your gate
Ancient orchards in the rain
Magnetic fields and railway trains
Here beneath our haunted moon
In a room of green we disappear
Invisible to all the world we practice sleeping
Keeping time by nothing clear
It's worth the wait, surreal estate
Surreal estate, no time, no date
Accept no fake surreal estate
Design by fate, surreal estateEmbed
