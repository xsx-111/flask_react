New Mysteries LyricsNew mysteries
There's mystery in the air
New mysteries
The kind I never share
Running in the dark
Beating on your bleeding heart
Wrecked beyond repair
New mysteries
The shadow of the stars
New mysteries
In black and silver cars
Speeding through your heart
Pricking like a poison dart
Cutting to the quick
New mysteries
There's mystery in the air
New mysteries
There's mystery everywhere
A whisper in your ear
A touch so light when no one's there
The face you cannot see
New mysteries
It rains inside your room
New mysteries
You will be drowning soon
Water in your mouth
Breathing in and breathing out
A river through your soul
New mysteries, new mysteries, new mysteries
New mysteries, new mysteries, new mysteries
New mysteries, new mysteriesEmbed
