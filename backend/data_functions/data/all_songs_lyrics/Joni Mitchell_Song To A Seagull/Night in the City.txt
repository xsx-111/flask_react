Night in the City Lyrics
Light up, light up, light up your lazy blue eyes
Moon's up, night's up, takin' the town by surprise
Night time, night time, day left an hour ago
City light time, must you get ready so slow?
There are places to come from and places to go

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go flashing in time

Take off, take off, take off your stay-at-home shoes
Break off, shake off, chase off those stay-at-home blues
Stairway, stairway, down to the crowds in the street
They go their way looking for faces to greet
But we run on laughing with no one to meet

Night in the city looks pretty to me
Night in the city looks fine
Music comes spilling out into the street
Colors go waltzing in timeEmbed
