Sisotowbell Lane Lyrics
Sisotowbell Lane, Noah is fixing the pump in the rain
He brings us no shame, we always knew that he always knew
Up over the hill, jovial neighbours come down when they will
With stories to tell, sometimes they do, yes sometimes we do

We have a rocking chair, each of us rocks his share
Eating muffin buns and berries
By the steamy kitchen window
Sometimes we do, our tongues turn blue

Sisotowbell Lane, anywhere else now would seem very strange
The seasons are changing every day in every way
Sometimes it is spring, sometimes it is not anything
A poet can sing, sometimes we try, yes we always try

We have a rocking chair, some days we rock and stare
At the woodlands and the grasslands
And the badlands 'cross the river
Sometimes we do, we like the view

Sisotowbell Lane, go to the city, you'll come back again
To wade through the grain, you always do, yes we always do
Come back to the stars, sweet well water and pickling jars
We'll lend you the car, we always do, yes sometimes we do
We have a rocking chair, someone is always there
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting
With the candle in the window
Sometimes we do, we wait for youEmbed
