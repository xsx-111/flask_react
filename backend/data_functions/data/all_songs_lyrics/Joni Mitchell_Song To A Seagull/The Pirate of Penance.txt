The Pirate of Penance Lyrics
The pirate anchored on a Wednesday
And why he came to port, I wonder
To see a lady, so my friends say
She dances for the sailors in a smoky cabaret bar underground
Down in a cellar in a harbour town

I know he told her love was treasure
And they would reap the fullest bounty
He only comes to port for pleasure
So when the winds of morning blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn

The pirate he will sink you with a kiss, he'll steal your heart and sail away
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam of a broken promise in the bay
Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus
He came again to see her, yes, I think they told me it was Saturday
Ask Penance Crane, she was out in her garden, she saw us
I was at sea then, I didn't see them

I don't believe what you are saying
It isn't true, I hardly knew him
Is this some game that you are playing?
Go ask the dancer, she's the one who saw him last, the one who drew him here
He hasn't come to me since spring last year
There was a time when he would bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace
Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go"
And he would hold me close and tell me sailing stories by the fireplace
All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow
I was at sea, I tell you, I was nowhere near the mentioned murder place
Searching for sails that don't come and I guess but I don't know

Go ask the dancer
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't know
She knows the answer
I don't knowEmbed
