Marcie Lyrics
Marcie in a coat of flowers stops inside a candy store
Reds are sweet and greens are sour, still no letter at her door
So she'll wash her flower curtains, hang them in the wind to dry
Dust her tables with his shirt and wave another day goodbye

Marcie's faucet needs a plumber, Marcie's sorrow needs a man
Red is autumn green is summer, greens are turning and the sand
All along the ocean beaches stares up empty at the sky
Marcie buys a bag of peaches, stops a postman passing by

And summer goes, falls to the sidewalk
Like string and brown paper
Winter blows up from the river
There's no one to take her to the sea

Marcie dresses warm, it's snowing, takes a yellow cab uptown
Red is stop and green's for going, sees a show and rides back down
Down along the Hudson River, past the shipyards in the cold
Still no letter's been delivered, still the winter days unfold

Like magazines fading in dusty grey attics
And cellars
Make a dream, dream back to summer
And hear how he tells her wait for me
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us where or why she moved away
Red is angry, green is jealous, that was all she had to say
Someone thought they saw her Sunday, window shopping in the rain
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket and went west again1Embed
