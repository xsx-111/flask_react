The Flammable Man Lyrics
I don't lie, I don't lie
I don't lie, I don't lie
I don't lie, I don't lie
I don't lie, I don't lie
I don't lie awake at night
For a good time
I don't live, I don't live
I don't live, I don't live
I don't live, I don't live
I don't live, I don't live
I don't live near the ocean anymore
Out of fear that the tide will turn
I don't lie awake at night
For a good time, because it's fun
I don't live near the ocean anymore
For fear the tide will turn
I don't bet on the horses anymore
Keeping away from the one I rode in on

Is something burning here, or is it me?
Is something burning here, or is it me?
Is something burning here, or is it me?
Is something burning here, or is it me?1Embed
