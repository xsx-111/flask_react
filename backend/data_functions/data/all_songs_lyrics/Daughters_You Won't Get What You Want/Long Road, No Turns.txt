Long Road, No Turns Lyrics
Everybody climbs up high then falls real far
A little is all it takes
A little is all it takes
Everybody climbs up high then falls real far
And I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say when people come apart
The road is long, the road is dark
And these are just the words to somebody else's song

Everybody gets in line and makes mistakes
A little is all it takes
A little is all it takes
Everybody gets in line and makes mistakes
And I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to say when people come undone
The road is dark, the road is long
Remember these are just the words to somebody else's song
So don't play along, or play a part
Don't look to me
Under the weight of
Your shouldered cross
These are just the words to somebody else's song
Please your heart to-
Please your heart to-
It may please your heart to see some shackled, wrists and throat
Naked as the day they were born

So, everybody climb up high then fall real far
A little is all it will take
A little is all it will take
Everybody get in line and make mistakes
But I won't know what to say
When you come undone
When you come apart
Remember that the road is long
Remember that the road is dark
Don't waste your time learning the words to somebody else's song

Please your heart to-
Please your heart to-
It may please your heart to see some shackled, wrists and throat
Naked as the day they were born
It will please your heart to-
Please your heart to-
It may please your heart to see some shackled, wrists and throat
Naked as the day they were born
But no one's going to do that for you
No one will do that for you
No one will do that for you
Well, ain't it funny how it works
Someone's always got it worse
(They hit the ground harder than you)
Well, ain't it funny how it works
Someone's always got it worse
(They hit the ground harder than you)
Well, ain't it funny how it works
Someone's always got it worse
(They hit the ground harder than you)
Well, ain't it funny how it works
Someone's always got it worse
(They hit the ground harder than you)6Embed
