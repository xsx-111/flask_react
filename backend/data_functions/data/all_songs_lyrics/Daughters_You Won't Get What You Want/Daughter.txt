Daughter Lyrics
I just thought I'd let you know
There's a war in an old set of bones
When they shake, you can feel the earth moan
There's a war
When it rips through the hills on a child's roar
Skips across the water like a stone
There's a sure rope swinging, without a head in its jaws
It's waiting
There's a war

(It comes then it goes, it comes then it goes)
We're open mouthed in the deepest shit of all
(It takes time then goes, it takes time then goes)
The spitting image of an unanswered call
(It comes then it goes, it comes then it goes)
Lost love in a gaping maw
(It takes time then goes, it takes time then goes)
The same dead hand knocking at the door
(It comes then it goes, it comes then it goes)
The same dead hand knocking at the door
There's a war

So reel back and say
"Oh, we never should've let them go"
And say "No, no, no, no
There are no saints anymore"
And "Oh, love is a tired whore"
And "Oh, love is a tired whore"
And "Oh, love is a tired whore"
And "Oh, love is a tired whore"
And "Oh, love is a tired whore"
Then the piano wire is impressed by the key
The hammer pulls the car around back and everyone piles in
A schedule is mentioned, a horn sounds in the distance
Some pasteurized idea vibrates a pocket
Is this meant to be or wicked chance?
They drive on, as each street lines a memory
Knowing they'll die here or there
Knowing they die here and there
Knowing they'll die here or there
Knowing they die here and there
Knowing they'll die here or there
Knowing they die here and there
Knowing they die here and there
Knowing they die here and there
Knowing they die8Embed
