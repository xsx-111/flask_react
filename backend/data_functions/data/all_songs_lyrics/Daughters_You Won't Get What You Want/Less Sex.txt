Less Sex Lyrics
I let it into my home, I let it into my home
Led a long way down, led a long way down
I let it in from the cold, I let it in from the cold
Led a long way down, led a long way down

I let it into my head, I let it into my head
Led a long way down, led a long way down
I let it into my heart, I let it into my heart
Led a long way down, led a long way down

I let it into my bed, I let it into my bed
Led a long way down, led a long way down
I gave it complete control, I gave it complete control
Led a long way down, led a long way down

I let it into my home (Led a long way down)
I let it in from the cold (Led a long way down)
I let it into my head (Led a long way down)
I let it into my heart (Led a long way down)
I let it into my bed (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)
I gave it complete control (Led a long way down)7Embed
