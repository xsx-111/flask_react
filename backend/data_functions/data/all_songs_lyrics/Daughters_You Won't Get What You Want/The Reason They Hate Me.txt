The Reason They Hate Me Lyrics
Don't tell me how to do my job
You carry on like a son of a bitch
They got a name for people like you
But I didn't take the time to write it down, though
You have a lot of fun playing grab-ass with the boys
Which one's going to give you a ride home?
Which one's going to walk you to the door?
Wonder which one's going to call?

Maybe the sun waits for you to be shown what to do
And pretend, and pretend, and pretend
And pretend, and pretend, and pretend
And pretend, and pretend, and pretend
Maybe the sun waits for you to be shown what to do

Don't tell me how to do my job
You gimme-gimme son of a bitch
They got a name for people like you
But I don't give a good goddamn to remember what it is, now
Hoping that emotionless trip's gonna pay-off
You're gonna hope and wish all day
If you could slide a couple fingers under the skin
Will you find the affirmation that you need?
Maybe the sun waits for you to be shown what to do
And pretend, and pretend, and pretend
And pretend, and pretend, and pretend
And pretend, and pretend, and pretend
Maybe the sun waits for you to be shown what to do


Don't tell me how to do my job!
Don't tell me how to do my job!
Don't tell me how to do my job!
Don't tell me how to do my job!

Maybe the sun waits for you to be shown what to do4Embed
