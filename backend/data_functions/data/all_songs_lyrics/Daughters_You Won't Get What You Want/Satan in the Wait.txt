Satan in the Wait Lyrics
That bastard had a head like a matchstick
Face like he was sucking concrete through a straw
"Some faces not even a mother can love."
Says the spit and spatter of broken glass from above
"There's a tombstone where your headboard used to be."
They tell him every night before sleep
Every night before he dreams big and comes complete
Then he sees himself floating high above the certainty of his feet
Sees some gutless worm, seeking a free ride inside the stomach of a whale
He can live without air for several days, he says
He says he knows things, this man, he says
He says he wouldn't wait for the light or the dark to fade
He says you'll want to move for the mouths of the damned elite

Their bodies are open
Their channels are open
This world is opening up
Up, up, up

"Yeah, I'm good for whatever"
The other smiles convinced
Tell me what's best and when, I'll save the date
I'll set the tone, I'll wander in my sleep
They each raise a glass and clang
"Here's to what will
Here's to the sharpened pencil
Splitting the cast from the skin
Curing the itch, curling the toes
Here's to celebrity and fulfillment
Here's to the top of the world
Here's to a tired leaning wall
Here's to the tragedy to ensue."
Their bodies are open
Their channels are open
This world is opening up
Up, up, up
Their bodies are open
Their channels are open
This world is opening up
Up, up, up, up, up
Today's gonna feel like tomorrow, some day
Tomorrow's gonna feel like yesterday
This world is opening up
This world is opening up
Today's gonna feel like tomorrow today
(This world is opening up)
Tomorrow's gonna feel like yesterday
Today's gonna feel like tomorrow today
(This world is opening up)
Tomorrow's gonna feel like yesterday
Today's gonna feel like tomorrow today
(This world is opening up)
Tomorrow's gonna feel like
Gonna feel like
(This world is opening up)
It's gonna feel like
(This world is opening up)
It's gonna feel like
It's gonna feel like
(This world is opening up)
It's gonna feel like
It's gonna feel like12Embed
