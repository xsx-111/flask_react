Guest House Lyrics
The incorrigible wheel tilts at a grotesque angle
The delay is upon me
Who locked the door?
Who bent the key?

I've been knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
Pounding and knocking and knocking
Let me in

I need a place to bury the soulless, charming
Winter-hell creature upon me
Who boarded the windows?
Who closed the screens?

I've been knocking and knocking and knocking and knocking
And knocking and knocking and knocking
Let me in

I have come from the distance
Where you can't see
It is there, believe me
Now let me in
Let me in
Let me in
Who put a padlock on the cellar door? Let me in
I've been knocking, let me in
Who bricked off the chimney?
I can't hear you speak

I've been knocking and knocking
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in
Let me in7Embed
