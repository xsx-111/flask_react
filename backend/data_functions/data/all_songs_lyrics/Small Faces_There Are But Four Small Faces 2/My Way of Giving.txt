My Way of Giving LyricsI've been told it's just a matter of time
Before you meet someone who'll open your mind
But time's on my side and nevertheless
I know the pain of too much tenderness
It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
So what more would you have me do
Although I'm not a guy who means to hurt
And if at times it seems our love won't work
I tell you honey, you must realise
And see confusion in my rounded eyes
It's all part of my way of giving
And I'm giving it all to you
More than love it's a way of living
And it's me that you're looking throughEmbed
