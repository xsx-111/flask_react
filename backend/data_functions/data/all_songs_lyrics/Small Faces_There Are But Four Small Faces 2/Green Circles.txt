Green Circles LyricsAnd with the rain a stranger came
His eyes were filled with love and pain
He eat and slept and darkness fell
And in his sleep his mind did tell of
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles
He dreamt of circles in the air
And in his heart and everywhere
He wanted all the world to be
As free as he so they could see those
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles
His face was worn
The lines they told
The dust and patience of his load
As with the dawn he went his way
And with him went his love and pain
And Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles
Green Circles, Green Circles, Green Circles
Green Circles, Green Circles, Green Circles
Green Circles, Green Circles
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles, (circles of)
Green Circles, (circles of)
