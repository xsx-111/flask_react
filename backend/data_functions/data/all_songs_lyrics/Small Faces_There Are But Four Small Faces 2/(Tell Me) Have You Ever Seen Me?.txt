(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me? LyricsI've a feeling that I know you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Tell me have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I hear, I see, have you seen me?
Through it all I've been here without you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Tell me have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Words seem out of place, all my life I've known your face
Have you ever seen me, have you ever seen me?
Many flowers are breaking through the concrete (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
Listen everybody I can hear them breathing (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I hear, I see, have you seen me?
I felt I got a feeling that I know you (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)
I got to know have you ever seen me (hey-hey, hey-hey-hey-hey)Embed
