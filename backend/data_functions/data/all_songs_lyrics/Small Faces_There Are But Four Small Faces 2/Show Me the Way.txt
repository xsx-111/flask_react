Show Me the Way LyricsI've been walking with dawn
For my sleep hath been torn and my happiness gone
There's an old man in me, who I talk to you see
He's as old as the sun
Want to know just what I've been saying
Please, please, show me the way
All the truth I have known has been scattered and blown
I don't know who I am
Someone else's part I am playing
Please, please, show me the wayEmbed
