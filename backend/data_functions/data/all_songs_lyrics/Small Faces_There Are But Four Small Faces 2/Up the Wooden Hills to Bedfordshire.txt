Up the Wooden Hills to Bedfordshire LyricsWhen you're slipping into sleep, that's the time to unwind
Sinking down into the deep, that's the time of no time
When you're slipping into sleep
All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning
Leave your body behind you with a different feeling
When you're slipping into sleep
The day is night, the night is day
So please out the light as I slip away
Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire
Up the wooden hills to Bedfordshire
When you're slipping into sleep, there's a world you will find
That's all yours and you can keep, that's the only thing to keep
When you're slipping into sleep
All the sounds around you seem to have a new meaning
Leave your body behind you with a different feeling
When you're slipping into sleepEmbed
