Dusted Lyrics
You make me mute
Hiding the truth
Revealing a farce
Created by your mind
What do you expect
Exposing your lies
Printed in your eyes
There's no alibi
To cooperate and not be allowed
They're killing my name. sewing my mouth
Prospect in life
Lost in the line
To cooperate
And just be alive

You gonna fall hiding the truth
You gonna crawl finding the truth
To blame myself it's my disgrace
To blame the world by my mistakes

Dusted
Dusted
Dusted
Turn around and turning around
And turning around and inside out
Turn around and turning around
And turning around and inside out

Do not disturb
Leave me alone
The fear within inside and beyond
The fear within inside and beyond

You make me mute
Hiding the truth
Revealing a farce
Created by your mind
What do you expect
Exposing your lies
Printed in your eyes
There's no alibi

You gonna fall hiding the truth
You gonna crawl finding the truth
To blame myself it's my disgrace
To blame the world by my mistakes
Dusted
Dusted
Dusted
Dusted
