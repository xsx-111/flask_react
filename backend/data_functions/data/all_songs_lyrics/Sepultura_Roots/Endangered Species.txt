Endangered Species Lyrics
Life
The struggle to survive
Crawling, raging
Feed the hate inside

Are we going to see another day?
Are we going to make it all the way?
Are we going to see the light of day?
Are we going to make it till the end?

Rise
Bad moon rise
Another war, another crime
End in sight

Bleak
Why & what the fuck?
Shut your mouth, shut your mind, this the way
You're just another prey

Is that what we've became?
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise
Rise


Endangered species
Endangered species
Endangered species
Is that what we've became?Embed
