Lookaway Lyrics
Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
That a man would kill for it
Lie just to lick a bit
Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
To lie just to lick

Fake it, you like it, just take me away
Hold it, just save it and I'll be repaid

Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
That a man would kill for it
To lie just to lick a bit
Each time I pull it apart
I get disgusted, can't do it today
What makes it so good
To lie, to lick
Take it, enlarge it, became it, before
Like it, I like it, and I'll be

Fake it, then like it, just take it tonight
Take it

I look at you, then you look at me, then you look away 1Embed
