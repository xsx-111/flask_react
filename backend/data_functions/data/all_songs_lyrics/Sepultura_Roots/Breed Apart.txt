Breed Apart Lyrics
Creepy crawl
On concrete and dust
Asphalt jungle
Piles of crust
Nonsense thoughts
Inside the mind
What really means
What I want

Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way

Straight old thoughts
To force you down
Raping rage
Breed apart
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own way
Open up your mind
And go your own wayEmbed
