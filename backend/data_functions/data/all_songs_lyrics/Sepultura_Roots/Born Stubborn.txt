Born Stubborn Lyrics
Stubborn from the start
Obey no one no matter what
Our life it's our right
Why don't you go away
We live without orders
We live without rules
Tearing down the wall
That try to hold us in
I got my tribe it's my own right
And I don't have to tell you why
It's been like that from the start
And you can't break it apart
Sepultura in our hearts
Can't take it away
These roots will always remain

Born in pain
Born stubborn

Stubborn from the start
Obey no one no matter what
Our life it's our right
Why don't you go away
We live without orders
We live without rules
Tearing down the wall
That try to hold us in
Born in pain
Born stubborn

I got my tribe it's my own right
And I don't have to tell you why
It's been like that from the start
And you can't break it apart
Sepultura in our hearts
Can't take it away
These roots will always remain

Born stubborn
Born in pain
Born stubborn
Born in pain
Born in pain
Suffering life
Make us riseEmbed
