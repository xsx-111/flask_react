Roots Bloody Roots Lyrics
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots

I believe in our fate, we don't need to fake
It's all we wanna be, watch me freak!

I say we're growing every day, getting stronger in every way
I'll take you to a place where we shall find our...

Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots
Roots, bloody roots

Rain, bring me the strength to get to another day
And all I want to see, set us free

Why can't you see? Can't you feel?
This is real!

I pray, we don't need to change our ways to be saved
That's all we wanna be, watch us freak!
