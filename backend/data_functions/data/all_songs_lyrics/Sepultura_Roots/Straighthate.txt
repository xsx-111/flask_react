Straighthate Lyrics
I ask myself why I'm so hateful
Maybe just part of my nature
People say I'm fucked in my mind
Feels like there's nothing left inside
Walking now on different dirty streets
But the same old feeling still exists
Hate is like a shade that will never leave
Leave me alone I don't need sympathy

What goes around
Comes around
You're going down
Down

Straighthate
Straighthate
Straighthate
Straighthate

Criticize and call me negative
You never face life or reality
Separate myself from the rest
What the fuck do you expect?

Straighthate
Straighthate
Straighthate
Straighthate
Straight fucking hate
What goes around
Comes around

Grow up in the ghettos
Made me real
To deal with my fears
Motherfucker you don't understand
Pain and hateEmbed
