Ambush Lyrics
Screaming
For more justice
Amazonia burns
Can you hear them
I'll fight
To save another day
So join us
And we'll make them leave this land

Threatening
To kill how we feel
If we stop them it'll be worth dying for

When you go down
When you go down motherfucker
When you go down
When you go down fighting
When you go down
When you go down motherfucker
When you go down
When you go down fighting
Motherfucker
