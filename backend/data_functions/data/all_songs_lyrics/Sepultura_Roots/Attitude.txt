Attitude Lyrics
One week struggling on the real world is
So you can see
Feel your soul and shape your mind to warfare
It's all for real
Live your life, not the way they taught you
Do what you feel
Survive this jungle, give me blood, give me pain
These scars won't heal

What were you thinking?
What a wonderful world?
You're full of shit
Leave it behind, they don't care if you cry
All you left is pain

Can you take it?
Can you take it?
Can you take it?
Can you take it?

The only way to get away
Kill your pride
Attitude
I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it
I won't take it

So in the end, I want to see some respect
I said, you better show some respect
I said, attitude and respect2Embed
