Lay Low LyricsLay low, why don't you now?
Lay back awhile and I'll show you
I got the good that you want, no
Need to go and hunt something else
It's right here with me when you stay
It's always good when I get to see
That there's never more than what
You're telling me when you stay home
Lay low if the feel is right
I got all that I want here in you tonight
And we'll pass out on the bedroom floor
After going like this so long, long
Hold up, you showed me
Oh, what you told me
It's not what you want
But what you need
It's not a head full of pills
Or amphetamines when you stay
It's always good when I get to see
That there's never more than what
You're telling me when you stay home
Lay low if the feel is right
I got all that I want here in you tonight
And we'll pass out on the bedroom floor
After going like this too long
Lay low if the feel is right
I got all that I want here in you tonight
And we'll pass out on the bedroom floor
After going like this too long
Ah, ah
Yeah ah oh
Yeah ah oh
Ah ohh whoa1Embed
