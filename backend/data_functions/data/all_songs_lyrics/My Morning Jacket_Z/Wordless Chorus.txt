Wordless Chorus Lyrics
So much going on these days
Forget about instinct, it's not what pays
Pleasure up and down my smile
A carton of eggs think it's all worthwhile
Tell me spirit, what has not been done?
I'll rush out and do it, or are we doing it now?


Fissure is the thrill of day
Forget about feeling, that's not what pays
But you know all of this can change
Remember the promise as a kid you made


We are the innovators, they are the imitators
C'mon, hey, don't you know how we started
We forgot about love, but weren't broken-hearted
