Gideon Lyrics
Gideon, what have you told us at all?
Make a sound, come down off the wall
Religion should appeal to the hearts of the young
Who are you? What have you become?

Animal, come on
What does this remind you of?

Truly, truly we have become
Hated and feared for something we don't want
Listen, listen
Most of us believe that this is wrong

Animal, come on
What does this remind you of?
What does this remind you of?
Animal, come on4Embed
