Chills LyricsStill feel that I'm getting ill
Oh
Chills, down on my spine
I do on a window sill
Still, things that go away
Ah, ooh, oh
Still, feel like no one can tell
Chills run down my spine
Ah ah ah ooh
Still, no one else lives your life
Except yourself, no one else lives your life
Except yourself, no one else lives your life
Still, no one else lives your life
Still oohEmbed
