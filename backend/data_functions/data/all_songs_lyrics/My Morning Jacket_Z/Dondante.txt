Dondante LyricsIn a dream I saw you walk
Like a kid alive and talking, that was you
In the classroom, you were teaching
On the streets you were policing, that was you
To the one I now know most
I will tell them of your ghost, like a thing
That never, ever was
And all that ever mattered
Will some day turn back to batter, like a joke
Behind thin walls, you hid your feelings
Takes four legs to make a ceiling, like a thing
In a dream I saw you walk
With your friends alive and talking, that was you
Well, I saw it in your movements
And even though you never knew it, well I knew
How sweet it could be
If you'd never left these streets
You had me worried, so worried that this would last
You had me worried, so worried that this would last
But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass
But now I'm learning, learning that this will pass4Embed
