Into the Woods Lyrics
A kitten on fire, a baby in a blender
Both sound as sweet as a night of surrender
I know it ain't easy, but you do what you can
If your living gets wheezy, you can follow this plan

Put in more than you could ever get out
I'm tired of talking, I know what you're about
Now, open your mouth, here comes the spoon
You're gonna eat what I give you and you're gonna like it real good

I went over the river and into the woods, where did I go?
Where a wood-burning stream flows up through the trees
Like the soul of the hottest kind of lover I've ever seen
One who lives to choose another fool's dream

A good shower head and my right hand
The two best lovers that I ever had
Now if you find you agree with what I just said
You'd better find a new love and let them into your head

I went over the river and into the woods, where did I go?
Where a wood-burning stream flows up through the trees
Like the soul of the hottest kind of lover I've ever seen
One who lives to choose another fool's dreamEmbed
