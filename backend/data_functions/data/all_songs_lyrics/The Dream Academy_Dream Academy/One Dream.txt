One Dream LyricsThere's one dream in my life
One that I love more
Then settle down, fool around
Games that only drag you down
So if you're blue and skies are gray
That's when I love more
The one dream in my life
The one dream that's in my life
The one dream in my life
That I live for
There's one story that I heard
About a man at war
With himself, he couldn't tell
Which side he was fighting for
So if your colors start to fade
That's when you reach out for
The one dream in your life
The one dream that's in your life
The one dream in your life
That matters more
I woke up to find life was just
Leading me on, that's all
Then I found out
That I could reach it all
By just holding that one dream in my life
Right before my eyes
The one dream in my life
The one dream that's in my life
The one dream in my life
That I live for, that's what your living for
One dream in my life
One dream in my lifeEmbed
