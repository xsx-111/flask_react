In Places on the Run LyricsAll alone in bridge of silence
I suppose you shouldn't stay
All alone in dream's asylum
Don't you know we've come a long way
I suppose we were
Somewhere in the sun
We walked in colored fields
In places on the run
What a dream I had
Dressed in colored shawls
Though the night was so warm
And a nightingale
Sat on a castle wall
While the river ran on
Calling, hearing you call
The river ran on
Running
The river ran on
It felt as if we were
In places yet unknown
We walked through the bazaars
In places on the run
What a dream I had
Walking by the wall
Oh, the raiment and all
The stars flickered by
Soon to be replaced
If I asked them they'd fall
Calling, hearing you call
The river ran on
Running
The river ran on
What a dream I had
Dressed in colored shawls
Though the night was so warm
And in the darkness I
Tried to take your hand
But it was nothing at all
Nothing at all
The river ran on
Nothing at all
The river ran on
The river ran on
The river ran onEmbed
