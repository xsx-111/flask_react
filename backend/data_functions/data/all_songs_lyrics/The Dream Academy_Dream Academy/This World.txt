This World LyricsRichard's on the street with all the lonely poeple
Trying to get a job and getting nowhere
So now this is what he got
A new kind of dedication
He doesen't feel lost
He walks into the station
And Richard takes a train to go uptown
You know he's gonna find a place where the money just walks around
And with the grace of a wildcat
He steals a bag without detection
Walks on tiptoes right back
To make the right connection
And when he leaves this world
Well then he won't feel alone
Now the fighting has all gone
No more just trying to hold on
To the dreams of this world
Where he never quite belonged
Belinda meets a friend at a pub called 'The Gun'
It's full of lots of lonely people all out trying to have some fun
She says, "I'll be right back"
Although you know it's only ten to one
Her eyes are just like a wild cat
And where's the summer gone
She's been working on the ships for easy money
It's a bigger kind of tip and that may be because
You run a bigger kind of risk
She's got the dedication written in a kiss
In the promise of intoxicated bliss
She's misunderstood for all the lonely people
Living in the world and getting nowhere
Something always just goes wrong
Why should they try to hold on
To the dreams of this world
Where they never quite belonged
Gina says she's gonna stop
Settle down, you know, give it all up
But it's so hard to give it up
When all your friends say they just can't
Stop. Stop
They beat up a girl on the Ford Estate with a baseball bat
Last night the vigilante city fathers tried to get their daughters back
They didn't understand
A different kind of smack was needed
Than the back of the hand
Yeah, something else was always needed
This is for all the misunderstood lonely people
Living in the world and getting nowhere
Something always just goes wrong
Why should they try to hold on
To the dreams of this world
Where they never quite belonged?
Where they never quite belongedEmbed
