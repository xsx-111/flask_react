Moving On Lyrics"All out", cried the boy and put the girl in danger
Whose only weapon was to believe in love
All out but don't say forever too late for re-arrangement
He's already thinking of another face
And she's drawing on the memory she can't erase
They're moving on
Keep a moving it, yeah
They're moving on
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
Now the weight of intention carried the motion
And the damage was over done
And was started as a bid for independence
Has ended with a starting gun
And he's wishing that he never said, "All out", oh yes, he does
But the words just get lost in space
And you know it's such a lonely place
When you realize you've lost that face
She's moving on, counter revolution has taken place
We're moving on
(We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time)
Yeah, we're moving on
(We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time)
(We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time)
Just keep moving on
When you realize you've lost that face
You've lost that face, oh
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
We'll make it this time, I know we're gonna make it this time
