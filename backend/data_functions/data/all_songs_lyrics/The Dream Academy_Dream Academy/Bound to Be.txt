Bound to Be LyricsWell I'm bound to tell you a story that just happened to me
Bound to break down and bound not to break even
I was feeling lonely like a soledad brother
You came into my life and loved me like a mother
I'm bound, caught up
Aha, was bound to be
Don't you know that?
Our love was bound to be
You go from A to B
It's just like falling out of trees
It's as easy as 1-2-3
You shone a light in my life that could light up Park Lane
I was feeling nervous 'cause I'd missed my gravy train
Now there's no need to keep on running with the pack
'Cause I know pretty soon and in the end I'll come running back
I'm bound, caught up
Aha, was bound to be
Don't you know that?
Our love was bound to be
You go from 1 to 3
It's just like air on a G string
Easy as A-B-C
Too much of nothing and it just won't pay the rent
Can't take insurance out on General Accident
Now there's no need to keep on running, running
'Cause I know pretty soon that in the end I'll come running back
I'll come running back, running back, run, run, run
Come running back, I'll come running back
Don't you know that?
Don't you know that?
Was bound to be
Don't you know, was bound to be, oh?
Was bound to be, oh
Come one now, come one now
I'll come running, run, run, runEmbed
