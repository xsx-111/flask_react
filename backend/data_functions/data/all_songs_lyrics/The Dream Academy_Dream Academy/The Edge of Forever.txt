The Edge of Forever Lyrics
When you were young
Did you ever love somebody
Like I love
I love you now?
'Cause now that you're older
I see you don't mind
Letting go of my hand in a crowd
You don't wanna hold tight

And when we kiss goodnight
There's a million hearts
Beating in my room
I wish they would go away
I'll say it again
There's a million hearts
That break too soon
Every time you go away

When you were young
Did you ever fall down
Graze your knee
And wanna run to someone?
'Cause now that you're older
I've been falling down
I wanna run to someone
But there's nobody around
I can hear the sound
There's a million hearts
Beating in my room
I wish they would go away
I'll say it again
There's a million hearts
That break too soon
Every time you go away

Every time you go away
Think about the things I say
Think about it twice as long
Tell me what's going wrong

In the southern sky
The breeze is so wild
The bridge is so lonely
The reasons that life
Feeling so afraid
I'm talking 'bout a, two hearts
Beating as one
Now forever
I'll say it again
There's a million hearts
Beating in my room
I wish they would go away
I'll say it again
There's a million hearts
That break too soon
Every time you go awayEmbed
