Missing Wires LyricsI never asked your number
I never saw you through
And I think you're missing wires
Like a self-inflicted wound
And I know you can't believe it
Until it's on the news
All the ugly faces
Short of any clues
We can't dance around the truth
We're just looking for a truce
It's not easy but it's true
What we need is something new
We can't dance around the truth
We're just looking for a truce
It's not easy but it's true
What we need is something newEmbed
