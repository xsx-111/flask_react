Trespassers LyricsYou can't wait any longer
You have to go alone now
Cause time is running out for you
You're never going home
So let me take your coat now
You can't afford to slow down
Cause time is running out for you
Forbidding the uniforms
You're never gonna get another chance baby
You can't wait any longer
You have to go alone now
Cause everything we throw away
Is perfectly good to you
Your future's on the other side
Shot by security camera
Cause time is running out for you
Wrong side of history
You're never gonna get another chance baby
Crossing your mind for the first time
Rolling your eyes to the heavens upEmbed
