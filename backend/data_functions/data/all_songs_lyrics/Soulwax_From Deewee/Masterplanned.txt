Masterplanned LyricsSometimes I feel like walking away
			Everything is everywhere and we think it's okay
			I thought the journey was the point of the race
			but it seems the destination is taking its place
			
			Try catching every moment you see
			Time is nothing to run out of it's just memories
			instant access to all things ever made
			while we're waiting for these numbers to blow us away
			
			This machine is taking all your cash
			All the fun is happening somewhere else
			The creator has a master plan
			Now you have the world in your hand
			
			Everybody has a right to forget
			Taking pleasure in the fact that you've nothing to share
			tell me how much does it cost when it's free
			Who can tell the story that only you would believe
			
			This machine is taking all your cash
			All the fun is happening somewhere else
			The creator has a master plan
			Now you have the world in your hand
			
			Everything, everywhere, everyone is in on it (x4)Embed
