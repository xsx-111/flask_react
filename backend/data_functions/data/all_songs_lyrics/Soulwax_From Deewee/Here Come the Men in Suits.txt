Here Come the Men in Suits LyricsHere Come the Men in Suits
Feeling to dance
Here Come the Men in Suits
Selling the plans
Here Come the Men in Suits
Somewhat delayed
Here Come the Men in Suits
Throw your phones away
They'll draw you in like moths
Through a bright and shiny light
When I look I can see alarms
Go off in your eyes
Here Come the Men in Suits
Behind their desks
Here Come the Men in Suits
This is not a test
Here Come the Men in Suits
Gone in a flash
Here Come the Men in Suits
Satellites will crash
They'll draw you in like moths
Through a bright and shiny light
When I look I can see alarms
Go off in your eyes
Here Come the Men in Suits
Don't be afraid
Here Come the Men in Suits
No one gets paidEmbed
