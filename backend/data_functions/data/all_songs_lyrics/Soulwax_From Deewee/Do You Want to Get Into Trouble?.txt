Do You Want to Get Into Trouble? LyricsDo you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Is it always on time?
Is it always on?
Is it not what you want?
Does it make you come?
Do you want it tonight?
Do you want it all?
Does it make you feel sad?
Does it turn you on?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Are you looking to get into trouble?
Are you looking to run away?
Are you looking to get into trouble?
Are you looking to run away?
Running away just as fast as you can
Run away
Running away just as fast as you can
Run away
Running away just as fast as you can
Run away
Running away just as fast as you can
Run away
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?
Do you wanna
Do you wanna
Do you wanna to get into trouble?Embed
