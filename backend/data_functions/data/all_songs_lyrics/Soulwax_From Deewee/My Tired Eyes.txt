My Tired Eyes Lyrics
Don't look at my eyes
It's not your style
I've completely worn out
My tired smile
You asked me to put
Your mind at ease
I managed with mine
So cold for tears

But I'm here
So please let's go
Back to sleep
Don't wake us up
From this sweet dream
I feel one day
You might find
The lies in my
Tired Eyes

They can't conceal
The crying shame
I dread to feel
Just close the door
Behind your smile
I'll try not to yawn
The fool inside

But I'm here
So please let's go
Back to sleep
Don't wake us up
From this sweet dream
I feel one day
You might find
The lies in my
Tired Eyes


But I'm here
So please let's go
Back to sleep
Don't wake us up
From this sweet dream
I feel one day
You might find
The lies in my
Tired Eyes
