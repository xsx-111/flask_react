Transient Program (For Drums And Machines)
Take us into a factory
Turn us into your dreams
Work us into oblivion
So we don't have to fear
Oh, oh, oh
Machinery
Oh, oh, oh
Machinery
Give me something to last all night
Make me a better dancer
Seems whatever the question is
Machinery is the answer
Oh, oh, oh
Machinery
Oh, oh, oh
Machinery
It's a pill of time, took a long time
You took a long time
You took a long time, you took a long time
You took a long time
