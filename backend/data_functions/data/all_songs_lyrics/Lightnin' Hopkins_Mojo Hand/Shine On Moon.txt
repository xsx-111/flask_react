Shine On Moon Lyrics
Shine on shinin' moon
Shinin' moon, shine on, shine on
Shine on shinin' moon
Shine on, shinin' moon, shine on
I want you to shine on, shinin' moon
Give me your light, so I can see my way back home

Twinkle twinkle little star
Side the moon up of my head
Twinkle twinkle little star
Side the moon up of my head
I was cruisin' in the light, I felt like I was in heaven
Yes moon, when I wasn't there

Shine on, shine on shinin' moon
Please let me see your light again
Shine on, shinin' moon
Let me see your light again
You know that the moon, lord I want it to shine on me againEmbed
