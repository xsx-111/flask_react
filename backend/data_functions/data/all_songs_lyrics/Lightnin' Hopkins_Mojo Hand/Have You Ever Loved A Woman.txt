Have You Ever Loved A Woman Lyrics
Now, have you ever loved a woman
She cryin' all the time: "You been doin' me wrong"?
Now, have you ever loved a woman
When she cryin' all the time: "You doin' me wrong"?
Well, have you ever heard a woman say: "Excuse me
One night mean I don't mean no harm"?


You better change your way of livin', baby
Darlin' try joinin' that church again
You better change your way of livin'
Woman, try to join that church again
Well, you know that day's coming
Oh, no, we don't know whenEmbed
