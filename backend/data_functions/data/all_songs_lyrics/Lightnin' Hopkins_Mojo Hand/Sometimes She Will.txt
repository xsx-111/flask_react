Sometimes She Will Lyrics
Sometimes I believe she will
Then, again, I believe she won't
Sometime I’ma believe she will
And then, again, I believe she won't
She said she would do it
Well, now she say she won't

That’s alright, that's alright
I say that's alright, that's alright
If she don't, I got somebody that will
Play a while

Alright
I believe I'm playing

That's alright, that's alright for you
That’s alright, that’s alright for you
That's alright, little woman
Any old way will do
It’s alrightEmbed
