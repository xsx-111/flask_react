Santa Lyrics
Wow, you know Christmas time is coming now baby,
Tell me though Santa Claus gone come to you.
Wow, you know Christmas time is coming now,
Tell me though Santa Claus gone come to you.
You know i'm gone send him my step-daughter and bring you a present,
And do a little thing that you may want me to.

Yeah you know I went down main street in New York City,
Ol' Santa Claus had a belt in his hand.
Yes you know I went down New York City I saw Santa Claus,
He was standing down with a belt ringing in his hand.
Why you know the poor children was running up hollering you gone come to me Santy?
And he said lil girl please put something on Santys hand.

Wow, and I happend to see these old people learning the young ones,
Yeah just learning them exactly what to do.
So sweet, it's so sweet to see these old people,
Learning they old children just what to do.
Mother said a million-year-ago Santa Claus come to me,
Now this year he gone come to you.

My little sister said take your stocking now,
Hang it up on the head of the bed.
Talkin' to her friend she said take your stocking,
And please hang it up on head of the bed.
And she said know we all God's saint children,
In the morning Ol' Santa Claus gone see that we all is fed.Embed
