Glory Bee Lyrics
Miss Glory Bee, Miss Glory Bee, yeah
You know somebody been talkin' 'bout me
Whoa, Miss Glory Bee, Miss Glory Bee
You know somebody been tellin' 'bout poor me
You know why they wanna do poor Lightenin' so bad
Take God up in heaven to see

Glory, you know I try to treat everybody right
My doorbell start to ringin' early in the mornin'
And, it rings all night
Something's wrong, something wrong, Lightenin'
When it won't be a thing I done
Yeah, but that's alright, I want you to remember
I'm my moms seventh son
They can't hurt me too bad

Mmmmm, I be hollerin', oh, yeah, Glory Bee
Glory Bee will you please come back to me
You know I been hollerin': "Please, ma'am, please ma'am
Glory Bee
Glory Bee, will you please come back to me
You know if I'd been a bad man, Glory
Ol' Lightenin' didn't intend to be"
Well, she's my baby regardless of where she come from
Glory Bee, oh, Glory Bee
Glory Bee, oh, Glory Bee
Now, don't you hear me callin'Embed
