Awful Dream Lyrics
Have you ever looked over a mountain
One you ain't never seen?
Have you ever looked over a mountain
A mountain you've never seen?
Have you ever laid down in your bed
And had one of those lonesome dreams?

Sound like the world was comin' to an end
Somebody had passed and dropped a bomb, oh, yeah
You know they tell me this world hasn't changed none
Anything that shoulda come, Lord have mercy, now, oh
But I don't know, God knows I don't
Teach me, teach me, teach me how I done wrong

You know, little bird was singing
It was cloudy, look like it gon' rain
Yeah, the little bird was singin', it was singin'
And it looked like it was gon' rain
Looked like it was sayin': "It happened in my town
"They say I'm to blame, they say I'm to blame"

Just one more time, do me a favor
You can tell by the ringin' of the bell
I don't know where I'm going
Oh, I don't know I'm going to heaven, or hellEmbed
