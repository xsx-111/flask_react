New Orleans Is Sinking LyricsAll right
Bourbon blues on the street, loose and complete
Under skies all smoky blue green
I can't forsake a dixie dead shake
So we danced the sidewalk clean
My memory is muddy, what's this river that I'm in?
New Orleans is sinking, man, and I don't want to swim
Colonel Tom, what's wrong? What's going on?
You can't tie yourself up for a deal
He said, "Hey, north, you're south, shut your big mouth
You gotta do what you feel is real"
Ain't got no picture postcards, ain't got no souvenirs
My baby she don't know me when I'm thinking 'bout those years
Pale as a light bulb hanging on a wire
Sucking up to someone just to stoke the fire
Picking out the highlights of the scenery
Saw a little cloud that looked a little like me
I had my hands in the river, my feet back up on the banks
Looked up to the lord above and said, "Hey, man, thanks"
Sometimes I feel so good I got to scream
She said, "Gordie, baby, I know exactly what you mean"
She said, she said, I swear to god she said
Oh no
No, yeah
My memory is muddy, what's this river that I'm in?
New Orleans is sinking, man, and I don't want to swim
