Opiated LyricsHe bought two fifths of lead free gasoline
Said the bottle is dusty but my engine is clean
He bought a nice blue suit with the money he could find
If his bride didn't like it Saint Peter wouldn't mind
But now I lie here so out of breath and over opiated
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no, but maybe he could have waited
Well, the medicine man started seeing red
You think the snake just dreams up the poison in his head
Well, addicted to approval, addicted to the air
It was see if you like it or see you on up there
But now I lie here so out of breath and over opiated
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no, but maybe he could have waited
Now I lie here so out of breath and over opiated
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no, but maybe he could have waited
Now I lie here so out of breath and over opiated
Maybe I couldn't catch up, no, but maybe he could have waited
Maybe he could have waited
Maybe he could have waited1Embed
