When the Weight Comes Down LyricsAfternoon see a guy with rubies on his head
And he's shifting like, shifting like he was dead
And he's hearing something she never said
On his way back home under his bed
When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down
In the night a girl who doesn't mind her ragged sleeves
Knowing someone is going to grieve
And a man he tells her a story she just don't believe
Called "Adam never could do right by Eve"
When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down
Down on you, down on you
And a girl walks by the burning bush
She asks, "What's gone wrong here, man?"
And he smiles and says, "Open wide, wide, wide"
In my dreams a candy coated train comes to my door
With a little girl I can't have any more
You know a letter washes up to the shore
That I cannot read and I probably should ignore
When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down
When the weight, when the weight comes down
Down on me, down on me, down on me
When the weight comes down
Oh no, I cannot breathe, I cannot breathe
When the weight comes down
When the weight comes down
Well, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, no, no, no
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
No, no, noEmbed
