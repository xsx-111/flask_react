Trickle Down LyricsOld lions die, got left behind
Cut your teeth, lose your meat
And man, it's just a matter time
Keys to the coast, you might be king
That's it, that's all, that's everything
Skeletons come here to dance
Where barrooms beat their brothers
Into a bloody trance
What's the deal?
What did I do?
Who cops all the cops, is all I asked of you
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down
Something's up, taking time to get around
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown
It's just a matter of the trickle down
Twenty miles before the crash
That's the style, for a while
And man, I think it's going to last
"Hit the brakes," is all you can say
Conductor says we'll save them for another rainy day
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down
Something's up, taking time to get around
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown
It's just a matter of the trickle down
Ahhh
Old lions die, got left behind
Cut your teeth, lose your meat
And man, it's just a matter time
Keys to the coast, you might be king
That's it, that's all, that's everything
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down
Something's up, taking time to get around
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown
It's just a matter of the trickle down
Lining up, waiting on the trickle down
Something's up, taking time to get around
Belly up, all the drinks are on the crown
It's just a matter of the trickle down
It's just a matter of the trickle down
It's just a matter of the trickle downEmbed
