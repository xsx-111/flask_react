Everytime You Go LyricsLike anyone I knew a Dave
Drove a Plymouth Shallow Grave
Said, "My girl don't just walk, she unfurls"
With motorcycle language
He stumbled through his slang pledge
Then he dragged the mud for wedding pearls
He closed both his eyes and sort of gave her a kiss
Said, "Don't worry, baby, about what you're going to miss"
There will always be a much, much more than this
Every time you go
You are all I see
Holding out for you and me
Pulled down his birthday suitcase
Brown with dust from no place
Said, "I think it's time we made a start"
They danced the waltz of charity
No car garage, two kids for free
They were pissing bliss and playing parts
He closed both his eyes and sort of gave her a kiss
Said, "Don't worry, baby, about what you're going to miss"
There will always be a much, much more than this
Every time you go
You are all I see
Holding out for you and me
And the big snake pit
And we danced to the edge of it
And we laugh and we laugh
Cause we ain't seen the half of it
Every time you go
You are all I see
Holding out for you and me
Every time you go
You are all I see
Holding out for you and me
Every time you go
You are all I see
Holding out for you and me
You and me
You and me
You and meEmbed
