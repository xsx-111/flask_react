Blow at High Dough LyricsThey shot a movie once in my hometown
Everybody was in it from miles around
Out at the speedway, some kind of Elvis thing
Well, I ain't no movie star but I can get behind anything
Yeah, I can get behind anything
Get it out, get it all out, yeah, stretch that thing
Make it last, make it last, at least till the supper bell rings
Well, the taxi driver liked his rhythm, never liked the stops
Throes of passion, throes of passion, then something just threw him off
Well, sometimes the faster it gets
The less you need to know
But you got to remember the smarter it gets
The further it's going to go
When you blow at high dough
When you blow at high dough
Whoo, baby, I feel fine, I'm pretty sure it's genuine
It makes no sense, no, it makes no sense, but I'll take it free any time
Whoever fits her usually gets her, it was the strangest thing
How'd she move so fast, move so fast, into that wedding ring?
Well, sometimes the faster it gets
The less you need to know
But you got to remember the smarter it gets
The further it's going to go
When you blow at high dough
When you blow at high dough
Out at the speedway, same Elvis thing
Well, I can't catch her but I can get behind anything
Yeah, I can get behind anything
Well, I can get behind anything
Well, sometimes the faster it gets
The less you need to know
But you got to remember the smarter it gets
The further it's going to go
When you blow at high dough
When you blow at high dough
Yeah, blow at high dough
Blow at high Dough
Oh blow
Out at the speedway, same Elvis thingEmbed
