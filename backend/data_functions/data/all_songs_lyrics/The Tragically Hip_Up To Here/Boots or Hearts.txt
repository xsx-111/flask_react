Boots or Hearts Lyrics
Well, I think that there's a problem here
Her voice just don't sound right
But I left myself on her answering machine
Said, "I'm back in town tonight"
I feel I've stepped out of the wilderness
All squint eyed and confused
But even babies raised by wolves
They know exactly when they've been used

See, when it starts to fall apart
Man, it really falls apart
Like boots or hearts, oh, when they start
They really fall apart

Fingers and toes, fingers and toes
Forty things we share
Forty one if you include
The fact that we don't care
Now you've blocked off most of Main Street
For your faith parade
Well, everyone in town now, they probably all agree
I'm lying in the bed I made
See, when it starts to fall apart
Man, it really falls apart
Like boots or hearts, oh, when they start
They really fall apart
Well, fall apart

Now you won't even let me talk to you
We got some air to clear
We'd probably only agree on one thing anyway
That's what the hell is happening here?
Fingers and toes, fingers and toes
Forty things we share
Forty one if you include
The fact that we don't care

See, when it starts to fall apart
Man, it really falls apart
Like boots or hearts, oh, when they start
They really fall apart
Well, fall apartEmbed
