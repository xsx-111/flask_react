Gentle Spirit Lyrics
A hundred blowing up in the headlines
We've see it all before
The powers are killing the paupers
For some idea of God or whoever

Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts

Following the leaders with sickness
Ones with no the love within
Peddled cheap drugs, all this hatred
Let these words resonate
Everything born from love

Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts

Hey, don't you know
The circle is the melody
Beauty is a melody
Wonderful the thought of all
Circles are inside of love
Love it is a melody
Beauty is a feeling
Closest to your spirit core
The core it is a circle
Life it is a melody
In the end, an addiction
Love it is an apple core
Before the fruit was beautiful
Now it is a circle
Life and death a cycle
Cycle is a cadence
Know there are no measureables
Melody is a circle
Melody is a circle
Melody is a circle
Melody is a circle
Sit beside me, stay a while
Let me feel my life through you
Though we may not last forever
Forever all, I'm melodies
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our hearts
Gentle spirit find our heartsEmbed
