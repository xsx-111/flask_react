Rolling Universe LyricsThe universe keeps rolling along
The billy kid he walks towards the sun
I had a dream was misty heaven me
Singing the canyon me
Walked through mansion and then
Through the river well three or four times
The universe keeps rolling along
The marksman he strikes while he's young
Younger than me he's my inspiration
He's the salt of creation
He's the vision of patience
He's been in my kitchen three of four times
The universe keeps rolling along
The billy kid he walks towards the sun
I saw this thing you better leave young
Leave the good ones happiness waits
At the end of the road
The universe keeps rolling along
The billy kid he walks towards the sun
I saw this thing
Twelve valiant miners
In a labyrinth of fire words
It's just like I'm sleeping to them all
See them all on the other side
The universe keeps rolling along
The billy kid he walks towards the sun
The universe keeps rolling along
White dove she sails towards the sun
I had this dream
The universe keeps rolling along
The billy kid he walks towards the sun
The universe keeps rolling along
White doves she sails towards the sun
All down to springEmbed
