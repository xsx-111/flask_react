Magic Everywhere LyricsSeven lonely sinners on a one way track
They are all full of words going on for nothing
Seven lonely highways paved in dusty old black
So it's easy for us to leave just words bellow us
Pretty green leaves above us we can see magic everywhere
But our bodies we won't need them when we're there
Seven white sage bundles I have wrapped up with strings
Just to know everything will get better
Seven white holly diamonds only you and I ever wear
When we know everything here is over
The pretty green leaves above us
We can see magic everywhere, magic everywhere
Our bodies we won't need them we we're there
The pretty green leaves above us
We can see magic everywhere, magic everywhere
Magic everywhere, magic everywhere
Magic everywhere, magic everywhere
Magic everywhere, magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic, magic, magic
Our bodies we won't need them we we're there
Our bodies we won't need them we we're thereEmbed
