The Way I Feel LyricsThe way I feel is like a robin
Ho's babes I've flown to Condor Mall
Like a tallow tree alone and crying
The babes I flown and the beds
Now I'm all alone
And is like a young bird
In a tallow tree
Like a young men's heart
Among his mind you'll find her missing
When the nights are cold
She's warm and dryEmbed
