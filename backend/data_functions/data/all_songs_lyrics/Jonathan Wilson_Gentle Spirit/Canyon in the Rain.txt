Canyon in the Rain LyricsForest dove, forest dove, forest dove
Raining leaves, which way now
Which way now, which way now to union hall
Bringing in, bringing in, bringing in
River's this way now, this way now
This way now, out of the way
I'm like a canyon in the rain
I'm a show you this and then
The only thing the world is calm
Wait until I hold you warm you squeeze you tight
And then they say that I'm no good for you
Young love I know they never walked a day's shoes
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
Oh, save me from, save me from
Save me from wicked days
Ask me now, ask me now
Ask me now, why would you hesitate?
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
So wild, wild
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
The younger hearts are free
You can't see what I see
But you're wild and free with me
So wild, wildEmbed
