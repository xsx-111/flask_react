The Man I Love LyricsSomeday he'll come along
The man I love
And he'll be big and strong
The man I love
And when he comes my way
I'll do my best to make him stay
He'll look at me and smile
I'll understand
And in a little while
He'll take my hand
And though it seems absurd
I know we both won't say a word
Maybe I shall meet him sunday
Maybe monday
Maybe not
Still I'm sure to meet him one day
Maybe tuesday
Will be my good news day
He'll build a little home
Just meant for two
From which I'll never roam
Who would?
Would you?
And so all else above
I'm waiting for....
The man I loveEmbed
