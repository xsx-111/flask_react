Sleepyhouse Lyrics
No time frame for what I need to do today
Here at the yellow house
I think that I'm gonna play
With some free livin' lads downstreet, a ways away
Hey

As I feel the moon rise
The time that I feel is the right time
Here in our sleepy house
As I wipe eye bugs away
The candle flickers at me to say
And in my head I sometimes pray

Are you feeling fine?
As I was, as a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shining on
Shining on a little unity

See, the mistakes that I've made
No they don't seem to bother me
And I sure as hell don't feel like I've missed any kind of train
If I could only show you how I feel
Then you wouldn't bother me
Then maybe then you'll see
Maybe then you'll see see why we don't mind being
Blind
As I was, as a little child
And I'm feeling better when I'm high
With a red light shining on
Shining on a little unity

I'll probably be
I'll probably be
I'll probably be
I'll probably be... there
In a little whileEmbed
