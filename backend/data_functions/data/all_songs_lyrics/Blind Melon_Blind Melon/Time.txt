Time LyricsSo long, so long, bye

Said, all these people, they won't leave me alone
And we need, a little time to ourselves
And half these reasons why
I'm sketchin' all the time
The result of this life in Hell

But, oh well, I think it's time

My faith's falling like the leaves from a tree
Pockets both take it away
Sun warms my body as I'm sittin' on a swing, watching
Columbus clouds bring in the rain

Oh well, I think it's time
Well, it's time to go

My mind is playing tricks on me all the time
To let you know that I am real
And all the worries you build up inside your soul, oh
The ones that make your world stand still
Mean you can feel that it's time to go
Are you fed up, Are you fed up with me?
You think you could do better?
Five fed up faces with the itch to kill the king
A blood red sunrise, man, and a breath to air that's clean
I drink from the faucet, from the porch, I take a pee
I look at you through the bushes where you can't see me

I laugh and slip into another state of mind
To let you know that I am real
And all the worries you build up inside your soul
The ones that make your world stand still
Mean you can feel, and it's time to go, yeah
Well, it's time to go

Clear believing that I'm gone, that's right
Gonna burn it, gonna burn it
Gonna burn it all downEmbed
