Drive Lyrics
His feet are dirty
And his face, his face is long

Yeah, and while he's peeking out through his hair
He hides the pain
Till that Lennon song comes along
He'll turn it off and say

"Can you drive?"
Drive
Can you drive?
Drive
Can you drive?

Jimi, we need to borrow this for a minute
'Cause we need to escape

Now, there's so many things that he's gonna do
In five lifetimes, hell, I couldn't do 'em all
Yeah, and while he's rolling his own smokes
He says to me he's buying a new ride today
A classic deal the boss will give
He said the same thing two weeks ago

You've seen that sweaty jet rag feeling come over him
And I've seen that boy nod
And go into a dream, a time or two

And on his way out, his glazed stare
Will make you stop and wonder
Hey William, is that the last time I'm gonna look at you?
Yeah
(But the next day, a phone will ring
And it'll be him)

Can you drive?
Drive (Can you drive?)
Can you drive
Can you drive?

Jimi, what would you say?
What would you do?
Oh, should I pray?
Or do you think that this blind mind
Would listen to me, anyway?Embed
