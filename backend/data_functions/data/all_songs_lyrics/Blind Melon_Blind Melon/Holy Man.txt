Holy Man Lyrics
I was born on the banks of a hot muddy river
The child of one stupid steamy night
Born to roam beneath the sun
What do you think of me?
I'm better left alone

Said I met a Holyman who that said that he knew the way
And he'd like to show me so my life won't go astray
Take my hand, child
Now, little boy, don't you be afraid
I'll take your soul and walk on water

Holyman, you don't understand
The cuts on me, they run much deeper
Holyman, you righteous man
I've been shown the way a thousand times
Not one a keeper

Older man, he said "I'll tell you boy
You've planted rotten seeds
And in a land of happiness
They'll grow us evil trees"
Guided minds, and eyes that will never see
Holyman, I'll tell you
Just what it is that I believe
Holyman, you don't understand
The cuts on me, they run much deeper
Holyman, you righteous man
I've been shown the way
And not one a keeper
Oh, no
I gotta look away


Holyman, I said, I tell you, boy
You gotta believe in what you see
'Cause its you that corrupt us, man
And deep throat philosophy
I don't need your spells
Or the little games you try to pull on me
Come to think of it, I don't need your religion

Gotta get away
(I wish you would understand)
Everybody prays
Let me find my own way
Holyman, you don't understand
The cuts on me, they run much deeper
Holyman, you righteous man
I've been shown the way
And not one a keeper
Not one a keeper
Not one a keeper
Not one a keeperEmbed
