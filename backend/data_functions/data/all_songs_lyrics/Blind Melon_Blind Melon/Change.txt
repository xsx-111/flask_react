Change Lyrics
I don't feel the sun's coming out, today
It's staying in, it's gonna find another way, yeah
As I sit here in this misery
I don't think I'll ever, no, Lord
See the sun from here

And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
And they'll say
"Hey, look at him
I'll never live that way"
And that's okay
They're just afraid to change

And when you feel your life ain't worth living
You've got to stand up, and take a look around you
Then you look up, way to the sky-y-y, yeah
And when your deepest thoughts are broken
Keep on dreamin', boy
'Cause when you stop dreamin', it's time to die, yeah

And as we all play parts of tomorrow, Lord knows
Some ways, we'll work, yeah
And other ways, we'll play
But I know we can't all stay here forever
So, I wanna write my words on the face of today
And then, they'll paint it

And oh, as I fade away
They'll all look at me and say
They'll say:
"Hey, look at him
And where he is these days"
When life is hard, you have to change
When life is hard, you have to change2Embed
