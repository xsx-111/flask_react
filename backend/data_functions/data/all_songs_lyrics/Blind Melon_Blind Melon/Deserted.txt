Deserted Lyrics
Grab my knee and
Look at me and try to tell me
I'll be home soon
Asleep in my bed and unstoned
I'm tired of me this way

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish that I had for winter

It's not as gentle as it sounds
As though is sounded yesterday
When I heard a leaf of my life hit the ground
As a bottle cap flew from my fingers

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish that I had for winter

...and the sand blew in my eyes
As I stood on the edge and looked down to see
The light of a new life shining up on me

I don't know what I've gotten into
But I'm glad that it's now instead of sooner
This desert heat has crowded me strong
With a wish that I had for winter
With a wish I had

Sand blew in my eyes
Sand blew in my eyes
Sand blew in my eyes
Sand blew in my eyesEmbed
