Soak the Sin Lyrics
I've got to buy some shoes
These ones are getting loose
My feet are sinking in the sun, and it ain't fun

But it looks like rain up ahead in forty miles
A big rainbow took the blue sky

I'm gonna tell my mamma I love her so
Thank you for giving me these bones of gold
(Ooh, I'm gonna run from my home)
Yeah, jump in the river, and let the water soak the sin in my soul

Fine time, we all crossed lines
Make the music that makes us feel fine
Rednecks on sundecks said a hillside Romeo sells

"Boys, this is the good shit
So, come on y'all, and eat a little bit"
And if I ever go back home I'm gonna set

I'm gonna tell my mamma I love her so
Thank you for giving me these bones of gold
(Ooh, I'm gonna run from my home)
Yeah, jump in the river, and let the water soak the sin in my soul
Gonna soak it in my soul, soak it in my soul
Gonna soak it in my soul
Don't even say a word
It confuses me
I said, what he says to do, is that we don't have to
No, no, no, no
We don't have toEmbed
