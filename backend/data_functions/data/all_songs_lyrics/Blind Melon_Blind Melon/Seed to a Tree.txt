Seed to a Tree Lyrics
Woah, as I shit
I sit and wonder why
My floor's so cold and my back's broken tile
Life is good
Go ahead, even though it won't be long
In the candles, come emotions that
Dance with the shadows on my wall
What were your thoughts
As they were flying through your mind
Compared to what you feel from
The bars you're now behind?
If they could speak
What do you think they'd say to you?
I do believe you'd been better off
If you'd just told the truth

Never had a problem till I stood away, so face with me
And I wish there was a way for me to go inside so I could see
All the faces of the people who have torn a piece of me
As I grew from a seed, woah, to a tree

Can you feel the power of the eye
That's hidden away, five feet from where we lie?
What do you taste, when you take a drink of me?
Is it too much for me to ask if I asked you to leave?
Please, just leave
'Cause I want to be alone


There's a fine line between love and my feelings for you
High time I washed it all away
Unkind
I watch your future burn before you
Denied a chance of any love in your life
And I ask you... one time
Why?

Never had a problem till I stood away, so face with me
And I wish there was a way for me to go inside so I could see
All the faces of the people who have torn a piece of me
As I grew from a seed to a treeEmbed
