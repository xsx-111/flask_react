Two Steps From the Move LyricsWell, I have to move in order to groove, I wanna dance, prance step by step now
On the move, Put on my blue suede shoes and dance to this blues
I'm only two steps from the move, now
I'm two steps from the move, I'm two steps from the move, I'm two steps from the move
I keep the nation under a groove
Tryin' to cool down is no use, So I float right down the road
I close the door and it grows and it grows
So I go, I say bye, bye, On the moveEmbed
