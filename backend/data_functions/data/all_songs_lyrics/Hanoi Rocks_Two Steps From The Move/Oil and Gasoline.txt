Oil and Gasoline LyricsNow, she's fast, she's bad and she's Italian, she makes 100 miles per hour, oh yeah
As we cross the city lights, she takes me higher, she's the hottest one i've ever had, she's just like fire
She rocks around the clock, her motor never stops, till the sun comes up yeah
Her engine cries all night with passion and desire, so you turn her on and refuel her with fire
She's got me in a trance, and i'm just getting higher
Oil and gasoline, oil and gasoline, that's all she needs to give me head
Oil and gasoline, oil and gasoline, to keep our love burning bright, all through the night
Oil and gasoline, oil and gasoline, thats all she needs to take her through the night
Oil and gasoline, oil and gasoline, to keep her engine burning bright
Oil and gasoline, oil and gasoline, she's fast, she's bad, oh yeah
She takes me everywhere i've never been, she shows me things i've never seen
Never last, she's so fast, oh, let us pass, oh baby, we're just
Lovers on the highway, lovers on the highway
Oil and gasoline, she loves oil and gasoline, oil and gasoline, loves oil and gasoline
She loves oil and gasoline, she wants oil and gasoline, yeah
Oil and gasoline, oil and gasolineEmbed
