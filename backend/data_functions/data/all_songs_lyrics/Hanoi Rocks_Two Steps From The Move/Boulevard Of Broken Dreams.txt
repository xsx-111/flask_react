Boulevard Of Broken Dreams LyricsAll these broken dreams
Have made me see
That I'm strung out somebody rescue me
Well, do I have to tell you that I love you
Do I have to tell you that I care
Do I have to tell you that I need you to be there
'Cos in the middle of the night
When I'm much too weak to fight
You know you're such a welcome sight
In the middle of the night, yeah!
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Yeah, I talk so bad and I act so mean
On the boulevard of broken dreams
I gotta get back on my feet
And was it only yesterday
You came my way
Or was it just a while ago
And do I have to tell you you're my lover
Do I have to tell you I'm you're slave
And do we have to dance until
You're dancing on my grave
And my lips are turning white
And my jaw is getting tight
And the sun is burning bright
In the middle of the night, yeah!
On the boulevard of broken dreams
She'll eat you're heart and she'll eat you're face
On the boulevard of broken dreams
I gotta get back on my feet
Do I have to tell you that I need you
Do I have to show you that I care
Do I have to love and steal to have you
Do I have sell myself somewhere
We're gonna dance all night together
You'll be my queen, all be your slave
We're gonna stay away forever
Until we're dancing on my grave
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Boulevard of broken dreams
Boulevard of broken dreams
Boulevard of broken dreams
Boulevard of broken dreams
