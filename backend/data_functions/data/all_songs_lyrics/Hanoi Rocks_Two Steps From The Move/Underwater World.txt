Underwater World LyricsBeneath the streets, in the cars, on the trains
Or in the underground I'll be waiting
You can spare a dime or you're gonna be mine and
We're going dancing tonight
In the tunnels underground the subway rats run all
Around and hungry
So come and hide and step inside we're going on a
Midnight ride
On the subway underground it gets a little rough
This ain't
No tunnel of love
Hurricanes running through my veins I know that
You're lost and alone
And I feel no pain
In my sea of drains
In my, my underwater world
Welcome to the ocean
Welcome to the sea
Welcome to the jungle
Deep inside of me
Sink or swim, you dive right in
And you know this ain't no place
To mess around
In my swamp underground the quicksand
Slowly sucks you down
Down here I call the shots, like it or not
What you got I'm getting
You have to come down to my slum
Well welcome chum
Now sit down and shut up
So, welcome to the ocean
Welcome to the sea
Welcome to the jungle
Deep inside of me
I lay you wide open
For all the world to see
My, my, my underwater world
My, my, my underwater worldEmbed
