Futurama LyricsMy little lover's gonna be another, copy of Raquel Welch, I'll build her a house and a made named Jill
And spend the rest of my life down in Beverly Hills
I'll never have to feed her, And she'll stay pretty all the time, Oh, yes she will
I love the way she's gonna rock and roll, From the early morning 'til late late night
Non stop rock 'n' bop and she'll never ever die
When I want money she can go to work, As a roadie for Adam Ant
And if he comes on strong he'll be in for a shock, 'Cos she'll open his face and clean his clock
I'll never have to feed her, And she'll stay pretty all the time
Rock 'n' roll, My little girl, the best in the world
Softer than steel, she's alarmingly real, My mechanical girl, my satanical pearl
You're the best in the world, Wild thing, I think I love you
I'll never have to clean her, And she'll stay perfect all the time (Oh yeah)Embed
