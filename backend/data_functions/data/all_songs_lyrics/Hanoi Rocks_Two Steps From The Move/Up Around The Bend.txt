Up Around The Bend LyricsThere's a place up ahead and I'm goin'
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away
Come away, if you're goin'
Leave the sinkin' ship behind
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the gettin's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neons turn to wood
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeaah!
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
You can ponder perpetual motion
Fix your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Yeaah!
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Come on the risin' wind
We're goin' up around the bend
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
Do do do dah..
