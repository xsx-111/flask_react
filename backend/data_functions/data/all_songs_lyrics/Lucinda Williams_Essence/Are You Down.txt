Are You Down LyricsCan't put the rain back in the sky
Once it falls down
Please don't cry
Rain turns the dirt into mud
Warm and messy
Like your love
Can't force the river upstream
When it goes south
Know what I mean?
Nothin' will make me take you back
Are you down, babe
Down with that?
Can't put the rain back in the sky
Once it falls down
Please don't cry
Rain turns the dirt into mud
Warm and messy
Like your love
Can't force the river upstream
When it goes south
Know what I mean?
Nothin' will make me take you back
Are you down, babe
Down with that?
Are you down, babe
Down with that?
Are you down, babe
Down with that?Embed
