Steal Your Love LyricsDid they lay down a law and lock up your heart?
I'm gonna have to steal your love
Some laws should be broken from the start
I'm gonna have to steal your love
You ain't about to give it up for no one
I'm gonna have to steal your love
I don't need a knife, I don't need a gun
I know how to steal your love
I don't want your drugs, I don't want your money
I just wanna steal your love
I want you to squeeze me and call me honey
I just wanna steal your love
Give me your strong hand and go away with me
I'm gonna have to steal your love
Come on and let me kiss you and set you free
I'm gonna have to steal your love
I'm gonna have to steal your love
I'm gonna have to steal your loveEmbed
