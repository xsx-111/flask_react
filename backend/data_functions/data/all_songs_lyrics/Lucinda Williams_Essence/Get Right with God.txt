Get Right with God LyricsI would risk the serpent's bite
I would dance around with seven
I would kiss the diamondback
If I knew it would get me to heaven
'Cause I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with God
I would burn the soles of my feet
Burn the palms of both my hands
If I could learn and be complete
If I could walk righteously again
'Cause I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with God
I would sleep on a bed of nails
Till my back was torn and bleeding
In the deep darkness of Hell
The Damascus of my meeting
I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with God
I asked God about his plan
To save us all from Satan's slaughter
If I give up one of my lambs
Will you take me as one of your daughters?
'Cause I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with God
'Cause I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with God
'Cause I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with God
'Cause I want to get right with God
Yes, you know you got to get right with GodEmbed
