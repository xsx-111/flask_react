Reason to Cry LyricsJust to sit and talk the way we used to do
It just breaks my heart that I can't get close to you
If our eyes should meet somewhere down the road
Will you stop and be sweet or will you just walk on?
I thought things would stay the same
I thought things were right on
In our sunny days
How could we go wrong?
Now these days have found us
Right here where we stand
We thought we were so tough
But nothing worked out like we planned
Of everything in this world, I guess I'll never know why
Something as good as this could flower up and die
When you lose your happiness, when no one's standing by
When nothing makes any sense, you got a reason to cry
When nothing makes any sense, you got a reason to cryEmbed
