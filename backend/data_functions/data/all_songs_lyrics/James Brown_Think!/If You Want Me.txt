If You Want Me LyricsIf you want me, you won't hurt me
If you want me, you won't hurt me
If you want me, you won't hurt me, oh
If you, if you, if you want me
I hope that someday you'll be true
Stop going around doing the things that you do
If you want me, you won't hurt me, oh
If you, if you, if you want me
If you want me
Oh, oh, you want me
Whoa, if you want me
Whoa, if you want meEmbed
