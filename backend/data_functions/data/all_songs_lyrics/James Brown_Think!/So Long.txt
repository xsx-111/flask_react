So Long LyricsSo long, hope we'll meet again some day
Hope that maybe then you'll say
"Darling, I was wrong"
So long, I hate to see you go
You mean the world to me, you know
But we'll just say so long
All alone, just my memories of you
And I can see that you're lonely too
You're my own, even though we're far apart
And I will keep you right here in my heart
So long, so long
I hate to see you go
You mean the world to me, you know
But we'll just say so long
All alone, just my memories of you
And I can see that you're lonely too
You're my own, even though we're far apart
And I will keep you right here in my heart
So long, huh
Though you leave me here to cry
And this can never ever be goodbye
But we'll just say so longEmbed
