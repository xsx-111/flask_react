This Old Heart LyricsThis old heart
Can't stand much more
This old heart
Can't stand much more
Though I'm hurting
I won't take it, no no
This old heart
Can't bear this pain
This old heart
Can't bear this pain
If you love me
You won't hurt me
And refrain
You took my love
And now you're gone
You took my heart
And gone on home
I know, pretty baby
That you won't be true
And I don't care what you do
This old heart
Can't bear this pain
This old heart
Can't bear this pain
If you love me
You won't hurt me
And refrain
OW!
You took my love
And now you're gone
You took my heart
And you gone on home
I know, pretty baby
That you won't be true
And I don't care what you do
This old heart
Can't stand no more
This old heart
Can't stand no more
Though I'm hurting
I won't take it, no no
Though I'm hurting
I won't take it, no no
Though I'm hurting
I won't take it, no no
Though I'm hurting
I won't take it, no noEmbed
