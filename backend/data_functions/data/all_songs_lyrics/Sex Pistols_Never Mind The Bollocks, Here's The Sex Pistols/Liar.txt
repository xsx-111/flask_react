Liar Lyrics
Lie, lie, lie, liar, you lie, lie, lie, lie
Tell me why tell me why
Why'd you have to lie
Should've realised that
Should've told the truth
Should've realised
You know what I'll do

You're in suspension
You're a liar

Now I want to know know know know
I want to know why you never
Look me in the face
Broke a confidence just to please
Your ego should've realised
You know what I know

You're in suspension
You're a liar

I know where you go everybody you know
I know everything that do or say
So when you tell lies
I'll always be in your way
I'm nobody's fool and I know all
'Cause I know what I know
You're in suspension
You're a liar

Lie, lie, lie, lie, liar, you lie, lie, lie, lie
I think you're funny, you're funny, haha
I don't need it don't need your blah, blah
Should've realised I know what you are

You're in suspension
You're a liar3Embed
