Kite Lyrics
Come up and be a kite

Beelzebub is aching in my belly-o
My feet are heavy and I'm rooted in my wellios
And I want to get away and go
I want to be
From all these mirror windows
I want to be home
I look at eye level, it isn't good enough
And then I find it out when I take a good look up
There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball
There's a hole in the, there's a hole in the sky
Calling me

Come up and be a kite
And fly a diamond night
A diamond kite, a diamond kite
Ooh, what a diamond!
A diamond kite on a diamond flight
Over the lights, under the moon
Over the lights, under the moon
Over the moon, over the moon
Come up and be a kite

I feel a rush along my body, like a bullet
I'm 2D after a push-and-pull feeling
And I want to get back to safe home
I want to be
I love the homeland dome
I want to be home
I got no limbs, I'm like a feather on the wind
I'm not sure if I want to be up here at all
And I'd like to be back on the ground
I'd like to be, I'd like to be down
But I don't know how to get down-down-down

Come up and be a kite
And fly a diamond night
A diamond kite, a diamond kite
Ooh, what a diamond!
A diamond kite on a diamond flight
Over the lights, under the moon
Over the lights, under the moon
Over the moon, over the moon
Come up and be a kite
Come up and be a kite5Embed
