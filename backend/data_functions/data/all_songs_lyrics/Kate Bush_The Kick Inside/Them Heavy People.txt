Them Heavy People Lyrics
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me
(Rolling, rolling, rolling)
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me
(Rolling, rolling, rolling)

They arrived at an inconvenient time
I was hiding in a room in my mind
They made me look at myself, I saw it well
I'd shut the people out of my life

So now I take the opportunities
Wonderful teachers ready to teach me
I must work on my mind, for now I realise
Every one of us has a heaven inside

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot

Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me
(Rolling, rolling, rolling)
Rolling the ball, rolling the ball, rolling the ball to me
(Rolling, rolling, rolling)
They open doorways that I thought were shut for good
They read me Gurdjieff and Jesu
They build up my body, break me emotionally
It's nearly killing me, but what a lovely feeling

I love the whirling of the dervishes
(Come on, give me dervishes love)
I love the beauty of rare innocence
You don't need no crystal ball, don't fall for a magic wand
We humans got it all, we perform the miracles

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling the, rolling the, rolling the, rolling the...
(Ro-rolling, ro-rolling...)

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling the, rolling the, rolling the, rolling the...
(Ro-rolling, ro-rolling...)
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling the, rolling the, rolling the, rolling the...
(Ro-rolling, ro-rolling...)

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me
(Heavy, heavy, heavy)
Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Rolling the, rolling the, rolling the, rolling the...
(Ro-rolling, ro-rolling...)

Them heavy people hit me in a soft spot
Them heavy people help me10Embed
