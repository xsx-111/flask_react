James and the Cold Gun Lyrics
James, come on home
You've been gone too long, baby
We can't let our hero die alone
We miss you day and night
You left town to live by the rifle
You left us to fight
But it just ain't right to take away the light

Remember Genie, from the casino?
She's still a-waiting in the big brass bed
The boys from your gang are knocking whiskey back
'Till they get out of hand and wish they were dead
They're only lonely for the life that they led with their old friend

Ooh-wahoo-ooh-ooh
Wahoo-oohoo-oohoo-ooh
Wahoo-oohoo-oohoo
James, are you selling your soul to a cold gun?

Where lies your heart?
It's not there in the buckskin, baby
It's not there in the gin that makes you laugh long and loud
You're a coward, James
You're running away from humanity
You're running out on reality
It won't be funny when they
Rat-a-tat-tat you down
Remember Genie, from the casino?
She's still a-waiting in the big brass bed
The boys from your gang are knocking whiskey back
'Till they get out of hand and wish they were dead
They're only lonely for the life that they led with their old friend

Ooh-wahoo-ooh-ooh
Wahoo-oohoo-oohoo-ooh
Wahoo-oohoo-oohoo
James, are you selling your soul...
Oohoo-hoo-hoo
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
...to a cold gun?1Embed
