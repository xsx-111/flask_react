Room for the Life Lyrics
Hey there, you lady in tears
Do you think that they care if they're real, woman?
They just take it as part of the deal
Lost in your men and the games you play
Trying to prove that you're better, woman
But you needn't get heavy with them
Like it or not, we were built tough
'Cause we're woman

No, we never die for long
While we've got that little life to live for, where it's hid inside
No, we never die for long
Oh, woman, two in one

There's room for a life in your womb, woman
Inside of you can be two, woman
There's room for a life in your womb, woman
Mama, woman, aha

Night after night in the quiet house
Plaiting her hair by the fire, woman
With no lover to free her desire
How long do you think she can stick it out?
How long do you think before she'll go out, woman?
Hey, get up on your feet and go get it, now
Like it or not, we keep bouncing back
'Cause we're woman
No, we never die for long
While we've got that little life to live for, where it's hid inside
No, we never die for long
Oh, woman, two in one

There's room for a life in your womb, woman
Inside of you can be two, woman
There's room for a life in your womb, woman
Mama, woman, aha

A-mama-woma-mama-woman-aha
A-mama-woma-mama-woman-aha
Oh, mama-woman, two-in-a-one, aha
Oh, two in one, aha
Oh, woman, woman, woman, woman
There's room for a life in your womb
There's room for a life in your womb
Two in one, aha
Two in one, two in one, two in one
Room for a life in your womb4Embed
