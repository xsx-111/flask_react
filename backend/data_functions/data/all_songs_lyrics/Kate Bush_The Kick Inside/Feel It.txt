Feel It Lyrics
After the party, you took me back to your parlour
A little nervous laughter
Locking the door, my stockings fall onto the floor
Desperate for more
Nobody else can share this, here comes one and one makes one
The glorious union
Well, it could be love, or it could be just lust
But it will be fun
It will be wonderful

Oh, feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Feel it
See what you're doing to me
See what you're doing to me

God, but you're beautiful, aren't you?
Feel your warm hand walking around
I won't pull away, my passion always wins
So keep on a-moving in, keep on tuning in
Synchronise rhythm now
Oh, feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, feel it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Oh, I need it, oh, oh, feel it, feel it, my love
Feel it
See what you're doing to me
See what you're doing to me
See what you're doing to me3Embed
