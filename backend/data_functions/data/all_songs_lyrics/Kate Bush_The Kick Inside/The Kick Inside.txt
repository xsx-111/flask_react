The Kick Inside Lyrics
I've pulled down my lace and the chintz
Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius?
I'll send your love to Zeus
Oh, by the time you read this, I'll be well in touch

I'm giving it all in a moment or two
I'm giving it all in a moment for you
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it, giving it
This kicking here inside makes me leave you behind
No more under the quilt to keep you warm
Your sister, I was born, you must lose me
Like an arrow shot into the killer storm

You and me on the bobbing knee
Didn't we cry at that old mythology he'd read
I will come home again, but not until
The sun and moon meet on yon hill

I'm giving it all in a moment or two
I'm giving it all in a moment for you
I'm giving it all, giving it, giving it-giving it
This kicking here inside makes me leave you behind
No more under the quilt to keep you warm
Your sister, I was born, you must lose me
Like an arrow shot into the killer storm
I've pulled down my lace and the chintz
Oh, do you know you have the face of a genius?
I'll send your love to Zeus
Oh, by the time you read this...6Embed
