Brass in Pocket Lyrics
Got brass in pocket
Got bottle, I'm gonna use it
Intention, I feel inventive

Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice

Got motion, restrained emotion
Been driving, Detroit leaning
No reason, just seems so pleasing

Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice

Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me

Got rhythm, I can't miss a beat
Got new skank, it's so reet
Got something I'm winking at you

Gonna make you, make you
Make you notice

Gonna use my arms
Gonna use my legs
Gonna use my style
Gonna use my sidestep
Gonna use my fingers
Gonna use my, my, my imagination

'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me
'Cause I'm gonna make you see
There's nobody else here, no one like me
I'm special (Special), so special (Special)
I gotta have some of your attention, give it to me

Ohh
And when you walk6Embed
