Favourite Fallen Idol LyricsWhen I fail, I want to fail completely
And when I fall, I want to do it neatly
Travelling side by side
All due haste to my demise
Flickering in firelight
I'm gonna burn like Joan tonight
Oh, this is the angel's sound
With wingtips singed
You're surely heaven bound
I'm only falling now just to entertain you
I'm only failing here, because there's little else to do
Underwater, coming up for air
Wallow in self-pity and despair
Well, I haven't got a care
I've gotta do my hair
I've gotta do my hair
Oh, this is the angel's sound
With wingtips singed
You're surely heaven bound
Oh, your fallen idol
Oh, you're my favorite fallen idol
I'm only falling to entertain you
I'm only falling just to entertain you
I'm only falling just to entertain you
