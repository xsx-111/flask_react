Still Life LyricsHe was born without a sigh
And she left without a fight
This is not God, it's just the way things are
Be still, my still-born brother
And be still, my still-born lover
And be still
He was buried without a name
She buried love very much the same
This is not love, it's just the way things are
Be still, my still-born lover
And be still, my still-born brother
And be still, my still-born lover
And be still
And be stillEmbed
