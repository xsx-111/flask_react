Homeboy Lyrics
I'm tripping into the back of my mind
And your words like angels crash inside
And a word and a movement and a touch
And a word and a movement and it's all too much
It's all too much
I never understood what it meant to be
I never understood what it meant to be misunderstood
And even if I did, I don't think I'd care less
And even if I did, I don't think I'd care less

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful

I want to drown beneath the waves
I want to dig myself a shallow grave
And hold you up for all to see
I want to cut you up, I want to watch you bleed, ever so slowly

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
I can't follow what I don't believe in
I can't follow what I don't believe in
And that's why there's nothing left of me
'Cause I don't believe in you

You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful
You're so beautiful

Doo-doo-doo-doo, you're my homeboy, you're my
Homeboy
Doo-doo-doo-doo, you're my homeboy, you're my
Homeboy
Beautiful
Oh god, you're so beautifulEmbed
