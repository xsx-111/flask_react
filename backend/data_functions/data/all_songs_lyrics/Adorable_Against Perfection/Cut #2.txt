Cut #2 LyricsWhy did you say
That one line that I just so hate?
If only those three words
If only they could just dissipate
Said without meaning
You said half asleep
Said without feeling
You really cut so deep
You really cut into me
You really cut into, you really cut in
Hold on a while
Maybe your heart will follow your mouth
Hold on a while
Maybe you'll feel what came slipping out
Said without meaning
Said half asleep
Said without feeling
You really cut so deep
You really cut into me
You really cut into, you really cut in
Cut into me, cut right through me
Cut into me, cut right through
Cut into me, cut right through me
Cut into me, cut right through
I never thought that you knew me
I never thought that you knew me
I never thought that you knew me
I never thought that you, you
Oh, you cut
Oh, you cut
Oh, you cut, you cut, you cutEmbed
