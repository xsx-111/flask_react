Sistine Chapel Ceiling Lyrics
I took a breath onto a canvas I could not have cared less
About the words spilling out of my mouth
In blue and green it was the nicest sound I'd ever seen
To come stumbling out of my frozen mouth

Sitting in a corner smoking a half-drug cigarette
Sitting in a corner my half-imagined statuette
And with my hand upon my heart I'll say that she's perfect
And with my hand upon my heart I'll say that she worth it
And we all go

Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going up, up

Oh,  coming on the ceiling
Oh,  it's easier than feeling real

Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the ceiling, I'm going
Up on the Sistine Chapel ceiling, I'm up1Embed
