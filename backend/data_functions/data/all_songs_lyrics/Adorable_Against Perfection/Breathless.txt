Breathless Lyrics
My eager eyes came stumbling down over this pristine view
My second-rate poetry just is not enough to describe you
I'm scrambling 'round the floor looking for some fresh metaphor
All the words to describe this just do not exist
I feel better than ever before

I'm breathless and speechless
But still, there is so much to say
In words with one syllable
I love you

I love you
I love you

Ahhhhhhhhhh
AhhhhhhhhhhEmbed
