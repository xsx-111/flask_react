I Know You Too Well Lyrics
I heard you saying the same words that I said
I saw you reading the same book that I've read
I heard you singing a song that I wrote myself
I know you too well

I know you only too well
I know you only too well


Mirror faced, tiresome and restless, two extremes
Finite eyes, why follow me?
I know you better than I know myself
I know you too well

I know you only too well
I know you only too well
I know you only too well
I know you only too well

This is not your voice
This is not your voice
This is not your voice
And this is not youEmbed
