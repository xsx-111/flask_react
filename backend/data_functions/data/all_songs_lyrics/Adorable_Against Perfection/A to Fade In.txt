A to Fade In Lyrics
I remember walking home with my father from the station
Hand in hand, and all alone in silent frustration
And the words he said to me just drifted away in the wind
Like this memory, like the photographs in my father's house

I don't want to be faded skin
I don't want to fade out
I want to fade in
I want to fade in

Can you see me? I can't see myself
Can you hear me? I can hardly hear myself
And I don't want to be a faded memory
All I want is to be me

I don't want to be faded skin
I don't want to fade out
I want to fade in
I want to fade in
