Crash Sight LyricsHere I stand all alone
My shaking hands are all I own
And your star-struck lips
They just reminded me of what I've missed
What I've kissed
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you shine to view
Shiver when you come crashing through
Shiver at, shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you come shining
This is the only way out, this is the only way to go
This is the only way out, this is the only way I know
I know
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you shine to view
Shiver when you come crashing through
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you come shining through
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you come...
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you come crashing through
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you come shining through
Shiver at the sight of you
Shiver when you come crashing throughEmbed
