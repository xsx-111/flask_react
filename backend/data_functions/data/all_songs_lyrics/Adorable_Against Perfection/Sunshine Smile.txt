Sunshine Smile Lyrics
And then she smiled
Just for fraction of a little while
And everything was warm again inside
She's got a sunshine smile
The kind that warms up the corners of my cold room
She's got a sunshine smile
The kind that makes you forget again

Sunshine smile
A sunshine smile
A sunshine smile
A sunshine smile

And then she said "If I'm going to be someone else
I'd rather be somebody else with you"
That's exactly how I felt to her
How does it feel?

The way I feel
Doesn't feel quite real
How does it feel to feel?
She's got a sunshine smile
The kind that warms up the corners of my cold room
She's got a sunshine smile
The kind that makes you forget again
Sunshine smile
Sunshine smile
Sunshine smile
Sunshine smile

And then she said "If I'm going to be someone else
I'd rather be somebody else with you"
That's exactly how I felt, uh-huh
How does it feel to feel?
And for that one short while
It was as if she'd only just learned how to smile
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
