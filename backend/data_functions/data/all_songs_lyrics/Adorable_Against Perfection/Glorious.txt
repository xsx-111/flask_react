Glorious Lyrics
And then I awoke from a dream, I didn't really want to
And then I heard your tiresome scream, I really don't need this
And then you said, "Where's the sun?", Well, are you really so stupid
And I don't need you or anyone, oh this feeling is glorious

I've got hope and hate
And I'm feeling kind of great
Kind of great

And now I stand here, just as before, only maybe more so
And you said you know the score, well I don't want to know
And there's a whole world outside that I didn't know about
I don't need it
I don't want you to share your knowledge out and the feeling's called glorious

I've got hope and hate
And I'm feeling kind of great
Kind of great

It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious
It's glorious (it's glorious)
It's glorious (it's glorious)
It's glorious (it's glorious)
It's glorious (it's glorious)
It's glorious (it's glorious)
It's gloriousEmbed
