Sexy Man Lyrics
Bless, the sexy man
Alas, take the man
Alone at 3am
Be told, a perfect man
Oh, yes, he is

He takes, good care of me
Inside of me and all the things he says

Bless, a hetero man
Unless he's taken man
Alone at 3am
Bless, my perfect man
Oh, yes, he is

He takes good care of me
All the things he does inside of meEmbed
