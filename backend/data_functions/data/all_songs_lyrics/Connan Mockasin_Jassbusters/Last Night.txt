Last Night Lyrics*Door squeaks*
(Last night)
*Door squeaks*
(You blew me away)
Rough night, was it?
Oh, sorry I'm late
(You took your time)
*Door squeaks*
(Oh, patience is a lovely game)
Last night, oh-oh-oh, you blew me away
But you took your time
Oh, patience is a lovely game
I found out that you loved it when I lay
Told you what to do and you listened to me when I say
I blew you away the second
Did I cry?
Told you what to
Last night, ooh yeah, you totally blew me away
But you took your time, oh-oh-oh
 asking me
I love the way you play
Tell me what to do
Baby, are you true?
I pray after pulling all the weigh down
Told you what to 
Last night, oh-oh-oh, you blew me away
You took your time, oh-oh-oh
You blew me to piecesEmbed
