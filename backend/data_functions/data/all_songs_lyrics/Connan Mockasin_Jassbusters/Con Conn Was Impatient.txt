Con Conn Was Impatient LyricsWell Con Conn was impatient
It's late, we're leaving tonight
Well I still was impatient
He's late, I need you tonight
Well I can hardly take it
When my, my Josie tonight
Mmm now I feel that way
Big day, my Josie feel fly
Oh love, don't shut your eyes
My dishes tonight
I don't doubt you'll die
Now, oh, I can take you out now
But if you don't cry
I'll bend youEmbed
