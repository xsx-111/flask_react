I Guess the Lord Must Be in New York City LyricsI'll say goodbye to all my sorrow
And by tomorrow I'll be on my way
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
I'm so tired of getting nowhere
Seein' my prayers goin' unanswered
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
Well, here I am, Lord, knockin' at your back door, hmm
Ain't it wonderful to be where I've always wanted to be?
For the first time, I'll breathe free
Here in New York City
Say goodbye to all my sorrow
And by tomorrow I'll be on my way
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
So tired of getting nowhere
And seein' my prayers goin' unanswered
I guess the Lord must be in New York City
Well, here I am, Lord, knockin' at your back door, hmm
Ain't it wonderful to be where I've always wanted to be?
For the first time, I'll breathe free
Here in New York CityEmbed
