Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear LyricsI may go out tomorrow
If I can borrow a coat to wear
Oh, I'd step out in style
With my sincere smile and my dancin' bear
Outrageous, alarming
Courageous and charming
Oh, who would think a boy and bear
Could be well-accepted everywhere?
Well, it's just amazing how fair people can be
Seen at the nicest places
Where well-fed faces all stop to stare
Making the grandest entrance
Is Simon Smith and his dancin' bear
They'll love us, won't they?
They feed us, don't they?
Oh who would think a boy and bear
Could be well-accepted everywhere?
Well, it's just amazing how fair people can be
Well, who needs money
When you're funny?
The big attraction everywhere
Will be Simon Smith and his dancing bear
Yes, Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing BearEmbed
