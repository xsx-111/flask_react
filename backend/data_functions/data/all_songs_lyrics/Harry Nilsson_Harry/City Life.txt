City Life LyricsWell, I'm down and I'm out
And I've had it to here with the city life
Gonna grab me a plane
That'll take me back home to my folks
Maybe real soon
Just as soon as I get a few dollars ahead
Well, then you'll see
Gonna show up in person
Instead of those letters I never write
How does that sound ma?
You tell Dad I got a deal
That's gonna make me a million tomorrow
Yeah and it's a cinch to come through
If I just hang around for a little while
Just temporarily
City life
Oh, city life
Oh, city life
City life, city lifeEmbed
