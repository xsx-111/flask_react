Rainmaker LyricsFirst day in August
The last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day
Said the rainmaker to the people
"Tell me what you are prepared to pay"
Said the rainmaker to the people
"Well, I'll conjure up a rain today"
Ninety degrees 'neath the trees where it's shady
Hundred and ten in the hot sun
Heat from the street burns the feet of the ladies
See how they run
Called down the lightning
By a mystical name
And the rainmaker called on the thunder
And suddenly it began to rain
And the rainmaker passed his hat to the people
But the people all turned away
And the rainmaker's eyes
And the Kansas skies
Well, they both became a darker grey
First day of August
The last rain was in May
When the rainmaker came to Kansas
In the middle of a dusty day
The rainmaker smiled as he hitched up his wagon
And without a word he rode way
Then the people of the town heard the sound of his laughter
And they knew the rain had come to stay
Rain, rain go away
Come again another day
Rain, rain go away
Come again another day
Rain, rain go away
Come again another dayEmbed
