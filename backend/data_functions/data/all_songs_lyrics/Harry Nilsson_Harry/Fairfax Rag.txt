Fairfax Rag LyricsDo you have to look away when you pass by the diner
Where the squad car stops for coffee?
Don't you wish that you were any place else but here?
And don't you feel kinda funny when a man in a suit says
'Man, do you know where I can get high?'
Don't you wish that you were any place else but here?
Take a walk down any street that you choose
Yeah and you'll wind up with the Fairfax Street
Mid morning paranoia blues
Do you have to look away when you pass by the diner
Where the squad car stops for coffee?
Don't you wish that you were any place else but here?
Do you grab a cigarette when a man in an unmarked
Plymouth pulls you over just to say: 'Hi'?
Don't you wish that you were any place else but here?
And do you fumble in your wallet while you're looking for your license
And he tells you not to talk with your mouth full?
Don't you wish that you were any place else
Don't you wish that you were any place else
Don't you wish that you were any place else but here?Embed
