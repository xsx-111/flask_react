Open Your Window LyricsOpen your window and take a deep sigh
Think about letting the rest of the world go fly a kite
Taking it easy, is easy as pie
And holding your hand is such a natural high
I sent flowers, we spent hours
We spent hours, I sent flowers
We could be happy alone in a tent
Think of the money we'd save on rent
Living is easy, as easy as pie
And holding your hand is such a natural highEmbed
