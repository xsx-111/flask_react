The Puppy Song LyricsDreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true, woo woo
If only I could have a puppy
I'd call myself so very lucky
Just to have some company
To share a cup of tea with me
I'd take my puppy everywhere
La, la, la-la I wouldn't care
And we would stay away from crowds
And signs that said no dogs allowed
Oh we, I know he'd never bite me
Whoa de lo.......
We, I know he'd never bite me
If only I could have a friend
To stick with me until the end
And walk along beside the sea
Share a bit of moon with me
I'd take my friend most everywhere
La, la, la-la I wouldn't care
We would stay away from crowds
With signs that said no friends allowed
Oh we, we'd be so happy to be
Whoa de lo.............
We, we'd be so happy to be together
But dreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true
Whoa whoa..........
Dreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true
Whoa whoa woo........
Dreams are nothing more than wishes
And a wish is just a dream
You wish to come true1Embed
