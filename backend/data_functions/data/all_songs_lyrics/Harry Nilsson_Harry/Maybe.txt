Maybe LyricsMaybe
Maybe you wouldn't believe it if only I'd change
Say I'm acting just like a kid
Well maybe I'm doing what I'm doing
'cause I done what I did when I was a kid
Maybe
Maybe
Maybe I'm foolin' myself more than anyone can
Maybe you've found another man
Well how can you enjoy his touch knowin' that I love you so much?
Baby
Baby
Whoa, baby
I could learn to love your mother
And your mother's sister
And if she visit other relatives, I swear I'd miss her
And every day before I go to work, I'd stop and kiss her
Maybe
Maybe
Oh, maybe
Maybe
Things would be better if only a letter would come
Happiness is easier for some
I promise I will try to please ya
Can't you see how much I need ya?
Baby
Baby if you wanna hurt me
Laugh at me, but don't desert me
Baby
Baby if you don't believe me
Laugh at me, but please don't leave meEmbed
