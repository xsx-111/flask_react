I Will Take You There Lyrics
If only I could find a place where smiling strangers knew our faces
I would take you there
A place with constant melody where you and I could wander free
I would take you there

Seems like such a waste of time
Just trying to unwind the facts of life
If I could find a place, I'd take you where the pain don't cut you like a knife

If only there were time enough
Or word enough, or rhyme enough
I would take you there

Seems like such a waste of time
Just trying to unwind the facts of life
If I could find a place, I'd take you where the pain don't cut you like a knife

If only I could find a place where smiling strangers knew our faces
I would take you thereEmbed
