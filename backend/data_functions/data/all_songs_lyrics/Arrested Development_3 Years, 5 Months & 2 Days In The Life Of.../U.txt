U Lyrics
"Lonely, lonely. Oh woe is me, oh woe is me." I say
The complex cycle I go through almost every day
To my dismay, I imagine being in this set
Me holdin' the 21st letter of the alphabet
All my life I've been searchin' as if it's my obligation to find who? You
But my patience grows thin
'Cause U is just a letter surrounded by a better
Image of a sister who's new, but overdue for marriage
Marriage takes discipline, a problem that exist within'
The American culture I resist against
But I must recall and I trust that all
I've learned thru life is givin' way to a wife y'all
'Cause I want, not need, a companion to feed
The knowledge I read and the lovin' I've received
Through moms and my palms reads a long life
So hey I pray for the day I have a strong wife
Or a strong son or daughter or strong both
Give them a foundation of values
I think I'll make a great coach for them and warn 'em of sin
And maybe by then, they can nip it in the bud before it begins, so hey
If you're listening and U wishin' for a U like me that you have in store
Maybe I could be the U for U
And U could be the U for me too

(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
I know you're there, I just haven't found U yet
Gonna getcha five cent I'll bet
If I lose it's five cents, if I win it's five decades more
Of a life with a wife and 2 or 3 kids
My parents want grandkids wit big heads like mine
Runnin' and jumpin' on the bed with my brownish eyes
There's sort of a pressure to be married and chilled
With Terry gone, emotional gaps need to be filled
So I'm sort of searchin', but only in my spare time
Most of the time I'm busy workin' on a beat or rhyme
I don't want just a sex partner, a female friend or buddy
To be played with like silly puddy
I want to be played with like clay on a spindle
Wet it, mold it, bend it, let it hard, never dwindle
That's called longevity
Different than what U read and see On TV, so hey
If you're listening and U wishin' for a U like me that you have in store
Maybe I could be the U for U
And U could be the U for me too

(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
I don't know what's going wrong
People always askin me oh
Come on, come on, don't make me wait
If you miss you might be too late
That wouldn't be too great
So I pray for a deep sister
Take the life out on a nice date
Never thinking ho or bitch or nuttin' like that
That's a boys job, I'm a Mand√©
And I can do my thing in action
Word! That's what's happenin'
Have a funky Hungry Jack meal and set in
My moms gives me daily lessons on cooking African
Dishes. My wish is to be all I can be for U
Who you Is? Me don't know. Only U
I let down all my defenses
Let you and your entire family in my sight
(Only you) can relate to me
(Only you) can relieve me
In my world there's just us 3
You, me and G.O.D

(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me too
(Maybe) I could be the U for U
(Maybe) U could be the U for me tooEmbed
