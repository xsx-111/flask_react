People Everyday (Metamorphosis Mix) Lyrics
Hey, alright, hey, come on
Yo, this is Headliner from the Arrested Development
And right now you're in the mist of a celebration
A celebration of life, death, and the struggle of our ancestors
Check it out, let me hear you say whoa, whoa
Say yeah, yeah
Say whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
Whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
Say whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah
Whoa,  yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah, whoa, yeah

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

See I was restin' at the park mindin' my own
Business as I kick up the treble tone
On my radio tape player box, right
Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see?
Outta nowhere comes the woman I'm datin'
Investigation maybe she was demonstratin'
But nevertheless I was pleased
My day was goin' great and my soul was at ease
Until a group of brothers started buggin' out
Drinkin' the 40 oz, goin' the nigga route
Disrespectin' my black queen
Holdin' their crotches and bein' obscene
At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type
They got drunk and got guns and yes, they wanna fight
And they see a young couple having a time that's good
And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood
So they came to test Speech 'cause of my hair-do
And the loud bright colors that I wear (Boom!)
I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit
And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissin' it
Well I stay calm and pray the niggas leave me be
But they're squeezin' parts of my date's anatomy
Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me?
'Cause if I start to hit this man he'll have to kill me
You see
I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

I told the niggas please let us pass, friend
I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans
But he wouldn't stop and I ain't Ice Cube (Who?)
But I had to take the brother out for bein' rude (Hey!)
And like I said before I was mad by then
It took three or four cops to pull me off of him
But that's the story, y'all, of a black man
Actin' like a nigga and get stomped by an African
You see

I am everyday people
You see, I am everyday people

The moral of the story is you never know who you steppin' to
You might be stabbed, shot, killed, or hurt
It's not even worth it
Hey, you know it, you know it, you know it, you know it, hit it!Embed
