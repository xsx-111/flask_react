Washed Away Lyrics
Pebble by pebble
Sand grain by sand grain
Shore turns to sea
Shore turns to ocean
Serpent creates the high tides
To assure all good is floating
Good and righteousness is not intellectual
And the fabric that's good cannot be proven
And so that fabric is washed away
Far from the shore from which it was woven
The shore is a place where persons live
Sowing fabrics that's a tangent of the real one
Not wearable to most of the persons on shore
In fact, it's only wearable to the person of one
One person under an oath
An oath to a serpent, an evil snake
In search for being as powerful as God
And all God's good he'll try to take

He'll try to take
He'll try to take
Good being washed away
Love being washed away
Most of the persons follow the serpent
Cause the serpent preaches all for self
But why follow someone in search of something
When you'll get nothing
Serpent's all for self
Some are dumb, some know no better
Some believe there is no Lord
The serpent uses this knowledge to help him
And wash away more of the shore
Serpent knows once shores are gone
There's nothing left but ocean and sea
A few persons trying to save the shore
Some of those persons are A.D
Saving the shores means saving the faith
The faith that there is a mighty someone
Someone much more mighty that created everyone
Up the ocean without a paddle
Is the fabric of God, the righteous clothing
And you wear non-righteous clothes of the serpent
Naively we keep on serving

The ocean's owned by the serpent (4x)
We can stop being washed away (6x)
Why we let them wash it away
Why are we allowing them to take what's good
Why don't we teach our children what's good
Why don't we collect and save what is real
Look very hard and swim the ocean
We must find what needs to be found
Look all around and find a wise man
To feed us the truth and keep us sound
All of us must swim the seas
Coz our path's been washed away
All of us must swim the seas
Cause our path's been washed away
My only purpose is to swim the seas
Find the truth and spread it around
Give it to the children that know how to listen
So they can pass it after I drown
We can stop being washed away (6x)
Sand grain by sand grain, pebble by pebble
We can stop this, we can stop
Can you help us
Will you help us
Please
Help us stop being washed away
All of us must swim the sea
All of us
Hey
Can you help us
Will you help us
Oooh please help usEmbed
