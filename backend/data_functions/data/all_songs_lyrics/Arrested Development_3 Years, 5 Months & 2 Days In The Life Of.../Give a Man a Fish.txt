Give a Man a Fish LyricsLately I've been in a life like limbo
Looking out of a smudged up window
We're not sure where our lives are going
Friends, it's summer outside but yet we're snowed in
Don't know where our next dollar's coming from
Living the life of a poor musician
Headliner's strong so he keeps his 9 to 5
Cutting brothers' hair as a means of staying alive
If it wasn't for the rhythm
I think we would have given up by now
This system has gotten the best of me
Now I pray for God to invest in me
My dignity, invest his glory
Give me the strength so I can finish the story
Keep on searching for the right way to go out
Coz going out is what it's all about
Huh! You can't be passive, gotta be active
Can't go with what looks attractive
Gotta learn all I can while I'm able
Headliner expresses his feeling on those turntables
When we get our chance
To make a good living of the music we program
We don't sell out just to be sold out
Brothers and sisters, do you know what I'm yapping about?
Coz if they take away our contract
We still got talent and we still got contacts
Coz we're worked real hard to get this far
We were catching the bus before we bought the car
Ya see !
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Got to get political
Political I gotta get
Grown but can't hold my own
So this government needs to be overthrown
Brothers with the AKs and the 9 MMs
Need to learn how to correctly shoot'em
Save those rounds for a revolution
Poor whites and blacks bumrushing the system
But I tell you: Ain't no room for gangstaz
Coz ganstaz do dirty work and get pimped by mobsters
Some fat Italian eating pasta 'n lobster
Brothers getting jailed and mobsters own the coppers
So you you want out of the ghetto
First the political prisoners must be let go
And you must let go of your power master
You'll never get out without much discipline
Raise your fist but also raise your children
So when you die the movement moves on
Coz with no revolution, ain't no future in front o' y'all
Haha! Direct your anger, love
Nothing's ever built on hate, instead love
Love your life, tackle the government
The spooks that break down the door are heaven sent
And my phrase went...
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Give a man a fish, and he'll eat for a day
Teach him how to fish and he'll eat forever
Alright !
Rhythm makes you move your body
Rrhythm makes you move your mind
Rhythm makes your elbows groove
Rhythm makes that behind move
Rhythm makes the people move
Rhythm makes you want to move
Rhythm makes your mind soothe
