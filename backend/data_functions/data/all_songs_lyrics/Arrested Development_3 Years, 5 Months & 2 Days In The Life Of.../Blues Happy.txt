Blues Happy LyricsHey, yes indeed, this is Speech from Arrested Development
I'm the leader, ha ha
My nose is stuffed up, though
Check it out, I'm the leader
Homeboy, right over there, Headliner, is the turntable instrumentalist
We got Aerle Taree over there with her crazy set, over there, chillin'
Rasa Don is chillin', he's in the house
That's the man, he designs all our logos
And then we got Baba Oje in the house
He's just, he's like the papa, the father figure
As what, what's her name would say India?
Of course, I can't forget Eshe
Lady smiley, over here, always smilin'
And, of course, Larry's on the guitar
This song is for you, brotherEmbed
