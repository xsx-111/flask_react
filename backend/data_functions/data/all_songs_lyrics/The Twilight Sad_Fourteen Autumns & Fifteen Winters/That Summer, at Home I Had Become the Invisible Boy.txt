That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy LyricsAnd 14, and you know
That I'm looking the wrong way
And is the past outside
Or in this lovely home?
A strong father figure
And with a, a heart of gold
A loving mother
A loving mother
They're standing outside
And, and they're, they're looking in
They're standing outside
And, and they're, they're looking in
They're standing outside
And, and they're, they're looking in
The kids are on fire in the bedroom
The cunt sits at his desk
And, and he's plotting away
The kids are on fire in the bedroom
And 14, and you know
That I've learned the easy way
The stupid decisions
And with a, a broken heart
And they're sitting around the table
And they're talking behind your back
A loving mother
A loving mother
They're standing outside
And, and they're, they're looking in
They're standing outside
And, and they've, they've broken in
The kids are on fire in the bedroom
The cunt sits at his desk
And, and he's plotting away
The kids are on fire in the bedroom
The kids are on fire in the bedroom
The kids are on fire in the bedroom1Embed
