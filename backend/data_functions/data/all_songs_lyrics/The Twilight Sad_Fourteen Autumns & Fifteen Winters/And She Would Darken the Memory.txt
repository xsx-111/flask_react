And She Would Darken the Memory LyricsAnd head up, dear, you're shallow and blind
And head up, dear, the rabbit might die
Cause I'm putting the boot in tonight
And head up, dear, you're shallow and blind
And head up, dear, the rabbit might die
And you say "Hi", and you say "Hi"
Because I'm putting up with your constant whine
And I won't last too long
And friendly faces with put-on smiles
A drunken mind game past
Because I'm putting the boot in tonight
And head up, dear, you're shallow and blind
And head up, dear, the rabbit might die
And you say "Hi", and you say "Hi"
Because I'm putting up with your constant whine
And I won't last too long
And friendly faces with put-on smiles
A drunken mind game past
Cause I'm putting the boot in tonightEmbed
