Cold Days from the Birdhouse LyricsAnother hotel with woollen plans
Romantic gesture with woollen plans
And so you make it your own
But this is where your arm can't go
You make it your own
Another phone call with woollen plans
Romantic gesture with woollen plans
And so you make it your own
But this is where your arm can't go
You make it your own
But this is where your arm can't go
And your red sky at night won't follow me
It won't follow me now
I won't wear your shoes
And I won't clip your wings
I see it when you lied
We all look so surprised
And will you come back?
Will you come back?
And breathin' in smoke signs
Like a puppet told to drive
And will you come back?
Will you come back?
And your red sky at night won't follow me
It won't follow me now
And your red sky at night won't follow me
It won't follow me now
And your red sky at night won't follow me
It won't follow me now
And your red sky at night won't follow me
You won't follow me now
And where are your mirrors?
So where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
So where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
So where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
So where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
And where are your mirrors?
So where are your mirrors?
So where are your mirrors?Embed
