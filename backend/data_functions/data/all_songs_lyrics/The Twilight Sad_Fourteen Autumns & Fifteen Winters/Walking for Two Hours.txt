Walking for Two Hours LyricsWhy do they come when you're always raining?
And why can't they make a sound?
And seeing the other ones fall back down
Because you're so far from home
And you're wailing
And why do they come when you're always raining?
And why can't they make a sound?
And seeing the other ones fall back down
Because you're so far from home
And you're wailing
You're so far from home
And you're wailing
And watched it grow in a small dark corner
And why can't they make a sound?
And watching the other ones fall back down
And I've watched you go cold
And there's no tears left
And why do they come when the light stops raining?
And where have the colours gone?
And wiping their way across and now it's all gone
Because you're so far from home
And you're wailingEmbed
