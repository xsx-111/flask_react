Talking with Fireworks/Here, It Never Snowed LyricsAnd does your fear not grow when you see that you're all mine
See that you're all mine with a knife in your chest
With a knife in your chest
And only songs will know
That the lies aren't over
And come over to me
And everybody's armor
And does your fear not grow when you see that you're all mine
See that you're all mine with a knife in your chest
With a knife in your chest
And over several 
When the conversation is slow
And they take back your own time
And only songs will know
That the lies aren't over
They come over to me
And everybody's armor
And does your fear not grow when you see that you're all mine
See that you're all mine with a knife in your chest
With a knife in your chestEmbed
