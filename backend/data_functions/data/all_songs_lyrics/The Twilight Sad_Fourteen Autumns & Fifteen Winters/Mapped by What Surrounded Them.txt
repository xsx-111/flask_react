Mapped by What Surrounded Them LyricsAnd these walls
And these walls are filled with blame
And these walls
And these walls are filled with blame
And she's sitting in the primrose garden
And she's playing with her toys
Just another child-like ghost
The trees and animals cry
And you've shot her down
And you've shot her down
And she's taken far too young
And these walls
And these walls are filled with blame
And these walls
And these walls are filled with blame
And she's cut herself with stained-glass window
And she's playing with her toys
Just another child-like ghost
The trees and animals cry
And you've shot her down
And you've shot her down
And she's taken far too young
And in my dreams I watched
And in my dreams I watched Emily dance
I watched Emily dance
And in my dreams I watched Emily dance
I watched Emily dance
And in my dreams I watched
And in my dreams I watched Emily dance
I watched Emily dance
And in my dreams I watched Emily dance
I watched Emily dance
And in my dreams I watched
And in my dreams I watched Emily dance
I watched Emily dance
And in my dreams I watched Emily dance
I watched Emily danceEmbed
