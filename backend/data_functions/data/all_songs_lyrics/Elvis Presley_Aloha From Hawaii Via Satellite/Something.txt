Something Lyrics
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she moves me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe, and how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
All I gotta do is think about her
Something in her style it shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe, and how

You're asking me will our love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't knowEmbed
