Steamroller Blues Lyrics
I'm a steamroller baby
I'm about to roll all over you
I'm a steamroller baby
I'm about to roll all over you
I'm going to inject your soul
With sweet rock and roll, poor heaven

I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
I'm a cement mixer
A churning urn of burning funk
Iâ€™m a demolition derby
A hefty hunk, steaming junk

I'm a steamroller baby
I'm about to roll all over you
I'm a steamroller baby
I'm about to roll all over you
I'm going to inject your soul
With some sweet rock and roll
And shoot you full of rhythm and blues

I'm a napalm bomb
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I'm a napalm bomb
Guaranteed to blow your mind
If I can't have your love now baby
There won't be nothing left behindEmbed
