See See Rider  Lyrics
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
I said see, see, see rider
Oh, see what you have done
Oh girl, you made me love you
Now, now, now your loving man has gone

Hear what I say

Well, I'm going away, baby
And I won't be back till fall
Well, I'm going away baby
And I won't be back till fall
And if I find me a good girl
I won't, I won't be back at all

Hear what I say, I said

See see rider
Oh see what you have done
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
