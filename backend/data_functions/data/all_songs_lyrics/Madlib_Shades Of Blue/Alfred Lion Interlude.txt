Alfred Lion Interlude Lyrics
Alfred Lion…

He realized that he was a catalyst, a walking, living human catalyst. You get him near an artist like Thelonius Monk or Bud Powell and he instinctively knew that they had it down deep and he could draw that ability out of them and get it on a record. And he did it by not talking about record sales and commercialism, and who the big names on the he never got into that. He was interested in you and your thoughts and getting you to have an unrestricted flow of your ideas in his recordings. Not many people have that. And he never made a mistake. Out of over a thousand records that Alfred produced in the years that he had on Blue Note, easily 900–950 of them are classicsEmbed
