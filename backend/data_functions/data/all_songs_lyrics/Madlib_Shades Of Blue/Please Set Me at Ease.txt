Please Set Me at Ease Lyrics
How will I know this is real?
Usually I end up
Foolishly I end up (Yeah, uh)
Giving all the love I own (Yeah)

I’m in a maze cuz’ I ain’t seen you in a long time
Chocolate skin, thick thighs, innocent eyes
You used to be mines with no commitment
You stay committed hate to laugh but then I took you through it
I still admit it but your shape developed lookin’ tighter than ever
We used to roll whatever smoking blunts for escaping our issues
Remember when I first tried to hit it you held back
Now you shirking cuz’ you is flirting you was all that
My rap finally cracked surface the wait was worth it
After I hit it knew I was plumbing' for late, working' plus all
Sex secrets never hit the streets, noncompete
Oral, sweet oil to spoil me, you was doing things
In the sexiest ways, I’m still amazed that you had my back to this day
For the way now I got you
Through the fire and rain pleasure and pain
Through the riches losses and gains
Whether wife or misses we stay
Cuz we fitted and with it and I ain’t hit it in a long time
So imma’ hit it for a long time
Alize or Hennessy you never fade
To smoke weed and make money that’s my kind
(Yeah, yo)
Oh, please, won’t you put me at ease?
I try inside my feelings to hide
How will I know this is real
Usually I end up
Foolishly I end up
Giving all the love I own
And then to my dismay to you
Was just another day
You won’t even fall
