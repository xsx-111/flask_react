A Love Worth Keeping LyricsRise in the morning at sunrise
Strangers around me sleep soundly at rest
Phones and computers become me
Signals stretch back to the lands that I've left
And oh, in the quiet times
I count up the things that I lack
And slip through the road lines...
The trail of wandering back
I left you while you were sleeping
Left you the warmth in your bed, where I lay
You left me a love worth keeping
You left me a diary to count off the days
And so in the quiet times
I savour the things that I miss
And slip through the road lines
And wonder how I came to this
I guess you never know
Loss 'til you have something to lose
Choice 'til you have something to choose
Choose
So give me my quiet times
To mourn for the things that I've lost
And find me on the road lines
Counting the miles and the cost
So I never knew
Loss cause I had nothing to lose
Choice cause I had nothing to choose
But oh, all the things you do
The way that you close your door
The way that you guard your shores
Darling, I'm coming home soon2Embed
