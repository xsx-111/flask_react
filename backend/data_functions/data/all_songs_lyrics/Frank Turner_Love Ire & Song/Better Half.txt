Better Half LyricsOh my friend loneliness, where have you been?
You left me to the lure of the lover who left me alone
But now you come crawling back, and I'll let you in
And we'll slip back into grooves that we cut in ourselves long ago

But there must be a better half, somewhere out there
She lives a better life, a life that she shares
Shares with a better man
The man who is there when she calls in the night
Who says "Hey, it's alright"

And oh my dear distance, I've met you before
Longing for a lover who's lost on a far distant shore
And all my imperfections, are all have remained
And the days when I'd love you and I'd leave you
And you'd wish that I would stay

I know what she looks like, her face and skin, her smell and the rest
I know the feel of her soul, but God help me I just cannot find her address
Oh and I've how I've tried but now all that's left
Is my old friend distance and sweet loneliness

"Hey, it's alright"
"Hey, it's alright"2Embed
