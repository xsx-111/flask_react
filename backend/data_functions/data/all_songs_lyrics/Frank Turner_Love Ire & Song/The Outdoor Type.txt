The Outdoor Type LyricsI always had a roof above me, I always paid the rent
And I've never set foot inside a tent
I couldn't build a fire to save my life
I lied about being the outdoor type
Well, I've never slept out underneath the stars
The closest that I came to that was one time in my car
Broke down for an hour in the suburbs at night
I lied about being the outdoor type
Too scared to let you know that you knew what you were looking for
I lied until I fit the bill, God bless the great indoors
I lied about being the outdoor type
Never owned a sleeping bag, let alone a mountain bike
No, I can't go away with you on a rock-climbing weekend
What if something's on TV that's never shown again?
It's just as well I'm not invited, as I'm afraid of heights
I lied about being the outdoor type
Never learned to swim, can't grow a beard, or even fight
I lied about being the outdoor typeEmbed
