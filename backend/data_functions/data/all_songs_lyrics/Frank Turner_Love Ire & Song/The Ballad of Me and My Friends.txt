The Ballad of Me and My Friends LyricsEverybody’s got themselves a plan
And everybody thinks they'll be the man, including the girls
The musicians who lack the friends to form a band are singer-songwriters
The rest of us are DJ’s or official club photographers
And tonight I'm playing another Nambucca show
So I'm going through my phonebook, texting everyone I know
And quite a few I don’t, whose numbers found their way into my phone
But they might come along anyway, you never really know
None of this is going anywhere
Pretty soon we'll all be old
And no one left alive will really care
About our glory days, when we sold our souls
But if you’re all about the destination, then take a fucking flight
We’re going nowhere slowly, but we're seeing all the sights
And we're definitely going to hell
But we'll have all the best stories to tell
Yes, I am definitely going to hell
But, I'll have all the best stories to tellEmbed
