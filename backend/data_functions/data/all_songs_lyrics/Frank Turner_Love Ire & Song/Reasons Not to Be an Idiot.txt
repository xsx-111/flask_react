Reasons Not to Be an Idiot Lyrics
You're not as messed up as you think you are
Your self absorption makes you messier
Just settle down and you would feel a whole lot better
Deep down, you're just like everybody else

She's not as pretty as she thinks she is
Just picture her after she's had kids
I bet she sits at home and listens to The Smiths
Deep down, she's just like everybody else

So why are you sat at home?
You're not designed to be alone
You've just got used to saying no
So get up, and get down and get outside
'Cos it's a lovely sunny day
But you hide yourself away
You've only got yourself to blame
Get up, and get down, and get outside

He's not as clever as he likes to think
He's just ambitious with his arguing
He's crap at dancing yeah and he can't hold his drink
Deep down, he's just like everybody else
I'm not as awesome as this song makes out
I'm angry, underweight and sketching out
I'm building bonfires on my vanities and doubts
To get warm, just like everybody else

So why are you sat at home?
You're not designed to be alone
You've just got used to saying no
So get up, and get down and get outside
'Cos it's a lovely sunny day
But you hide yourself away
You've only got yourself to blame
Get up, and get down, and get outside

Amy thinks that life is lacking in drama
So she fell for horoscopes, faith healing, and karma
She's so wrapped up in her invisible armour
She'll never probe into herself
And it's okay thinking me and all my friends are just wasters
The same, I can still see through her airs and graces
I guess she's scared that life won't leave any traces
Kind've like everyone else
That's not the point anyway
Oh darling!
I felt compelled to call you up to say

So why are you sat at home?
You're not designed to be alone
You've just got used to saying no
So get up, and get down and get outside
'Cos it's a lovely sunny day
But you hide yourself away
You've only got yourself to blame
Get up, and get down, and get outside

Get up and get down and get outside!
Get up and get down and get outside!
Get up and get down and get outside!
Get up and get down and get outside!
Get up and get down and get outside!4Embed
