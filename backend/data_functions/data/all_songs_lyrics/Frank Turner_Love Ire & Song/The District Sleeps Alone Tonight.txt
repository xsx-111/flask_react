The District Sleeps Alone Tonight LyricsSmeared black ink
Your palms are sweaty and I'm barely listening
To last demands
I'm staring at the asphalt wondering what's buried underneath
Where I am
I'll wear my badge
A vinyl sticker with big block letters adherent to my chest
That tells your new friends
I am a visitor here: I am not permanent
And the only thing keeping me dry is where I am
You seem so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that I am just visiting
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
D.C. sleeps alone tonight
You seem so out of context
In this gaudy apartment complex
A stranger with your door key
Explaining that I am just visiting
And I'm finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leaving
The district sleeps alone tonight
After the bars turn out their lights
And send the autos swerving
Into the loneliest evening
And I am finally seeing
Why I was the one worth leavingEmbed
