Photosynthesis Lyrics
Well I guess I should confess that I am starting to get old
All the latest music fads all passed me by and left me cold
All the kids are talking slang I won't pretend to understand
All my friends are getting married, mortgages and pension plans
And it's obvious my angry adolescent days are done
And I'm happy and I'm settled in the person I've become
But that doesn't mean I'm settled up and sitting out the game
Time may change a lot, but some things they stay the same
And I won't sit down, and I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down, and I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
Oh, maturity's a wrapped up package deal, so it seems
And ditching teenage fantasy means ditching all your dreams
All your friends and peers and family solemnly tell you you will
Have to grow up, be an adult, yeah, be bored and unfulfilled
Oh, but no one's yet explained to me exactly what's so great
About slaving 50 years away on something that you hate
About meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity
Well, if that's your road, then take it, but it's not the road for me
And I won't sit down, and I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down, and I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And if all you ever do with your life
Is just photosynthesize
Then you deserve every hour of your sleepless nights
That you waste wondering when you're gonna die
Now I'll play, and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin
Now I'll play, and you sing
The perfect way for the evening to begin
And I won't sit down, and I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up
And I won't sit down, and I won't shut up
And most of all I will not grow up3Embed
