Substitute Lyrics
The first girl that I fell for was a fair and faithful fighter
She smoldered with her will to save the world
I did my best to help her, yeah, I stood shoulder to shoulder
On the front lines with my visionary girl
I wish that she had cared for me
But in the end her ideologies
Occupied the fortress of her heart
I wrote her fifteen songs, but still we had to part

And if music was the food of love
Then I'd be a fat romantic slob
Well music, it's my substitute for love

The last girl that I loved, she was a low and lusty liar
She set my heart on fire, but made me choke
Her beauty was a sight to see, but she didn't save it all for me
I found other fires by following the smoke
I wish that she had either cared for me or let me be
But she chased me from my mind and from my home
I wrote her sixteen songs, but I ended up alone

And if love is really all that we need
Then even all my singing is never gonna save me
Music, it's my substitute for love
Well I've had many different girls inside my bed
But only one or two inside my head
These days I cuddle up to my guitar instead
But oh, what I would give
Not to stumble, but to really fall in love
And I could substitute my singing for the sound of someone sleeping next to me3Embed
