Imperfect Tense Lyrics
Naked and retched and retching on a hotel bathroom floor
Somewhere in the city
Three days not sleeping, not eating, not feeling good anymore
Drenched in sweat and self-pity now
It's not a pretty sight
What to say in my defense?
I was imperfect, tense
Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went
So won't you be my present sense?

Breaking, I'm shaking, it's taking a long long time
To come down off this murderous medication
Trying to remember my reasons for running myself into the ground with such dedication

What to say in my defense?
I was imperfect, tense
Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went
So won't you be my present sense?

It's not meant to be
I am lost at sea
So mermaids sing to me
Of the better times and the things that can be
And of islands in the Mediterranean sea
And of eating and sleeping and times when I should
And of washing the drink and the drugs from my blood
And I've nothing to say in my defense
I'm far from perfect and I'm still tense
They say that love can change you once
Please, say that love can change me once
Come on change me2Embed
