To Take You Home Lyrics
I come from the land of the Wessex Downs
From the Hampshire hills, near Winchester town
In the country where the soft South rivers flow down to the English channel I roam
And this is where I call home

I sing for my supper and I'm pretty well fed
I cross this island and I make my bed
Where I can find a crowd and somewhere to lay my head
When the travelling day is done
And all my songs have been sung

But honey, I was lonely on the road, I was all on my own
Hanging out sad in the back of a death metal show
I saw you standing there with your hair down low
A kink in your step that made me want to know
If you would like to take me home

Who'd have thought that a French kiss from a Parisian girl would capture an English boy?

She comes from the channel's other distant shore
From the land of revolution and Agincourt
From a king's blood stain on a tricolour
And a culture a little too high for an English boy like me
She doesn't know the island I grew up upon
The valleys and the hills that I've roamed along
And she doesn't like my clothes and she doesn't like my songs
But she's still my mademoiselle
And it goes to show you never can tell

'Cos she was a quiet one
She was a shy one
She was the prettiest at the show
She crept up so slowly
She crept up behind me
But still she pretended that she didn't know
But oh, then she fixed me
And then she kissed me
And she's yet to let me go
And though I'm far away, across the sea
I'm singing for the hope that she would ever remember me

So honey, when you're lonely on the road, and you're all on your own
Hanging out sad at the back of the country show
Picture me there with my hat down low
A smile upon my face to let you know
That I would like to take you home
I would like to take you home, to the hills that I know
I would like to take you home, to the places I go
I would like to take you home

And that's the way that a French kiss from an English boy can capture a Parisian girl3Embed
