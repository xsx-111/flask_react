Front Crawl LyricsIf I was to walk from where I am
To where you are right now
I'd have to cross eight borders and three seas
But that might show you what you mean to me
And if I was to make this journey long
I'd have to learn to swim
Much better than my doggy-paddle way
But then you might believe me when I say
The time will come when you and I
Are not so far away
And I won't be singing this song on that day
I will set out for your island home
When my front crawl's up to scratch
And when I've written my arrival song
I'm working on it now, it's almost doneEmbed
