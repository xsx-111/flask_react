Jet Lag Lyrics
Heard it said, the trick
Is to set your watch when you hit the plane
And that way you can trick
The workings of a tired brain
But sometimes I feel sick
Sometimes I just feel so drained
And cut down to the quick
Longing for that voice again
On the phone
You always ask if I'm OK
It's not the same as being happy
I traveled 40,000 miles last year
And I'm working on the same again
I fell for 15 different girls
And nearly lost all of my friends
But while I am jet set, jet lag, jaded
You're always 16 hours ahead
Quietly reminding me how I used to be

Airports make me sad
I'm sure they shouldn't all be the same
But they're just landing pads
For boring tourist shopping chains
I remember times we had
Drinking while we wait for your plane
Feeling kinda bad
Wondering which one of us has changed
Cause we used to be slick
With subtle young hips, romantic young kissable lips
Unbearably sharp, unbreakable heart
With wide eyes and faith
That life could never pull apart if we were OK
But distance kills the best of intentions
I never intended it to be this way


I'm trying to remember how I used to be
I used to be so slick


That was the one!

...what? Was it?
