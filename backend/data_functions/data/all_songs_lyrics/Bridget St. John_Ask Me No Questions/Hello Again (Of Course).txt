Hello Again (Of Course) Lyrics
To write your name on every day
To see you smile, to hear you say you've come again
And it's to stay to say hello

Ivy sleepers, creep on garden walls, the cuckoo calls
Badgers seeking time 'til you come home

You'll never really go away, it's just the space between us
Growing, a little more than it ever has before

Evening weaves me spells of you, and tells me tales
The snail is listening too

You'll never really go away, it's just the space between us
Growing, a little more than it ever has before

Cat chews wishbones, pulls on strings
Knows I want to tell you, many things
'Knows I will someday, someday I will
Now I sit singing, spinning words and patterns in my head
Spiders hide their webs and welcome your return (Helloooo...)

You never really went away, it was just the space between us
Growing, a little more than it ever had beforeEmbed
