I Like to Be with You in the Sun (Song for the Laird of Connaught Hall) Lyrics
From Me to You:
A song for our everytime of being
And most of all for the seemingly first day of spring
Discovered any-and-everywhere we went

I like to be with you in the sun
Walking the city, taking the streets as they come
Down to the river, over the bridge we go on and on

Feeding a seagull, watching him waddle around
Begging politely with pigeons of London-town
Parading the pavements, picking up crumbs they found

Ride on a bus, take a shortcut through the square
Looking at trees, feeling that spring is near
Isn't it good to see all of this with you here?

I like to be with you in the sun
Walking the city, taking the streets as they come
Down to the river, over the bridge and away we run
Down to the river, over the bridge and away we run
Down to the river, over the bridge and away we runEmbed
