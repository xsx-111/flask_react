Curl Your Toes Lyrics
O, curl your toes as you would by the fire
Try to catch your life as it grows higher
O, close your eyes and you'll see what I mean
Blessings in shades of where I've been

O, watch the mole as he buries in the dirt
Ask him why he hides, what is it hurts?
He'll answer with a question: "Aren't I escaping just like you?
Blessings in shades of what I do."

O, see the curl in your hair as it grows
Wonder where it's going, no one knows
O, see me smile as I say I want to live
Blessings in shades of what I give

O, curl your toes as you would by the fire
Try to catch your life as it grows higher
So close your eyes and you'll see what I mean
Blessings in shades of where I've beenEmbed
