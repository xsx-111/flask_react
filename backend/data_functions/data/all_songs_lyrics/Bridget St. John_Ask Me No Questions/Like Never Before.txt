Like Never Before Lyrics
Into the north coast of Cornwall, is tucked a smaller-than-most beach, undistinguished in her sea and sand from many others that have laid their way inland

Was it a morning like never before?
Got out of bed, let the sun through the door
Went down to the sea and picked shells off the shore

Dizzy with laughter we fell in the sea
Nothing to laugh at, just happy to be
Race you to the shore, I'm sure I'll get there long before you do

Washed up like waves and laid out in the sun
Dreaming of things that could never be done
The tides slipped back in and we made our way homeEmbed
