Ask Me No Questions Lyrics
I wish to wake to a very-gentle you
Fears resolved and covered in crumpled sheets and half-recovered blankets
I wish you to wake to a very gentle me
Sleepy, lazy, and still needing you

Ask me no questions
Tell me no lies if you don't mind
And come with me
There, where the sun flies
There, where the sky is bluer
Still is where we'll be

Take nothing with you
I'll give you everything I can
Have no fear
For if you stumble
Or should you fall down on the way
I'll be there

Close your eyes, my love
Close your eyes, gently, come
And in the morning
Don't tell a soul of what you saw
It's just for you
Keep this a secret
Make me a promise that you will
I'll make one too

Close your eyes, my love
Close your eyes, gently, come

Ask me no questions
Tell me no lies if you don't mind
And come with me
There, where the sun flies
There, where the sky is bluer
Still is where we'll be
