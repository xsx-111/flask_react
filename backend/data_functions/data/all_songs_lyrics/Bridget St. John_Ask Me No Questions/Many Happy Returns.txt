Many Happy Returns Lyrics
Good day, Friday rise to find the sun
Lies in lazy circles 'round the room
Warms the words you write, you're coming home

I hear you running up the stair to me
I hear your voice is calling, softly
I see a smile before you come to me

Feeling good, because you still remember me
Happy that our love outlasted memory
Feeling sure of us and we'll take care of weEmbed
