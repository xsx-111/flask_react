Autumn Lullaby Lyrics
October, standing on Primrose Hill, feeling the wind breathe in and out; Watching the gentle death of summer into autumn; Listening, as to an elderly lady dying wisely, leaving what she has learnt scrawled around me

As autumn comes, I stay behind
And gather sounds she leaves for me
She sings: "Be gentle, be kind
This is not always easy
But if a man should ask for more
Don't be afraid to give
And when he dares not ask at all
Then offer what you have"

She shows me pine and cedar tree
Magnolia, yew, and tamarisk
The evergreen is everfree
I hear her, I remember this
I shuffle with October leaves
And worn out wings of butterflies
Through water whispers, grokking weeds
I sing her autumn lullabyEmbed
