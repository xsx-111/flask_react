Broken Faith Lyrics
If along the way, I hold your hand
Be not angry
It's not my place to stay, yet here I stand
Do not be angry, be not hard

And if at anytime, I need you near
Be not angry
There are so many things that we have shared
Do not be angry, be not hard

I would not if I could make this the end
Be not angry
It's hard to leave the good, to lose a friend
Do not be angry, be not hard

If along the way, I hold your hand
Be not angry
There's nothing you need say, but understand
And be not angry, and be not hardEmbed
