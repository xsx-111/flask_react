Barefeet and Hot Pavements Lyrics
A pigeon squidging everything on my crazing-paving haven beat
And my barefeet follow slowly swallowing every swollen shade of sun she cannot smother

Barefooting 'round a city
Bare feet getting dirt pretty

Living my life, loving my life
It's easy

Wake up tired, go back to sleep
There's no hurry, can't keep me from...

...Living my life, loving my life
It's easy

People may stare, I don't care a damn
I'm doing fine, just...

...Living my life, loving my life
My life is mine, it's easy
Barefooting 'round a city
Bare feet getting dirt pretty

Living my life, loving my life
My life is mine, it's easy1Embed
