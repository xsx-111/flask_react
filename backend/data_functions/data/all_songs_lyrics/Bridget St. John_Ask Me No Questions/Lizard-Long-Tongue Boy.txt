Lizard-Long-Tongue Boy Lyrics
Rubber-blue fused song
Sunday-time, used some
Time for you too to come

Canoe in maroon-time
And grow your way through time
Whenever you come, I'll be there

Lizard-long-tongue boy
Blizzard love, one boy
Coming through, slowly, I know

Lotus-love greeting
Float us on meeting
Lizard-long-tongue boy and meEmbed
