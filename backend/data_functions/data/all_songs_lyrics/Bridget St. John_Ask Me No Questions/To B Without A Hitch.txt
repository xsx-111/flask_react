To B Without A Hitch Lyrics
On the way home, a week spent doing little save rest, and read stories to two demoiselles of four and six years; Looking at them, wishing to suck barley sugar, waiting to be nine again. Having to return and leave behind the tales of Beatrix Potter, taking only a buttercup sandwich; Through the rain with the knowing there was little hurry

Cars roll by a hundred miles an hour
Windscreen wipers driving off the rain
Wonder if they'll make it where they're going to
Or will it be the same as when they came

But as for me
I'll sit and eat a buttercup sandwich
And wait 'til the shower is over

Everyone tries boarding rush-hour buses
Even though they know there's no more room
Me, I sit here trying to thumb somewhere
In time, I know a car is bound to come

But until then
I'll sit and eat a buttercup sandwich
And wait 'til the shower is over

Water does no more than get you soaking
But people act as if they're going to drown
Forget about the summer when the sun burns their skin
Forgetting man lives not by bread alone
But as for me
I'll sit and eat a buttercup sandwich
And wait 'til the shower is overEmbed
