The Curious Crystals of Unusual Purity Lyrics
“The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted; But few are the ears that hear it.”
- Henry D. Thoreau

Slender stems are bent and torn
Spindle trees wounded and worn
Blue-John and Jasper are still to be found
Lying red and yellow, lying brown

Weed-hung barberry bushes wither
Mistle thrush and the sparrow shiver
Curlews cry curfew: "Go hide from her wind!
Frost will follow your song, as winter begins."

Snow and corries and hollows drifting
Lives move slowly and feet are shifting
Measuring the riffs for another to sing
Clothed with loving, the promise of another spring

Crystal-cradle of mist and dew
Gently fade and uncover new...
...Shadows, the leaves have laid on the land
Twisting, twirling to patterns, the sun will plan
Birds return to the calm of sun-streams
Fold their nests in the arms of horn-beams
Go run with the lizard, go fly with the bee
Summer comes and her magic wanders freeEmbed
