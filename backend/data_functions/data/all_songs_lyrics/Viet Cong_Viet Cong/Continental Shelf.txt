Continental Shelf Lyrics
When all is said and done
You'll be around until you're gone
Crystallized, cancelled eyes
Illegitimate merchandise
Don't want to face the world
It's suffocating (suffocating)
Undesirable circumstances
I can't feel, no I can't feel

Fingertips in the fountain
Fondle liquid gold
Ice on the horizon
The skyline folding in
Nothing is beginning
Edges falling off of themselves
And the water is draining
Off the continental shelf

Check your anxiety
No need to suffer silently
Convulsion vibrating
Being violated (violated)
Don't want to reminisce
I can't remember (can't remember)
Fingertips in the fountain
Fondle liquid gold
Ice on the horizon
The skyline folding in
Nothing is beginning
Edges falling off of themselves
And the water is draining
Off the continental shelf9Embed
