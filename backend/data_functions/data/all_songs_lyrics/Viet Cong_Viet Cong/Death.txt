Death Lyrics
Anchored to the bottom, you can see the current
Situation bending in and out of focus
Floating to the surface, you can see much higher
Quality arrangements of the constellations

Stranded and broken
Another day where everything’s turning inside out
We went too far the other way
We’ll never get home

Sail into the shoreline, occupy the picture
Perfect combinations in the grains of sand

Stranded and broken
Another day where everything’s turning inside out
We went too far the other way
We’ll never get home

Holograms cutting through the lines
March in 4/4 time, hollow shells
Stuttering, convalescent hands
Obvious in what they desire
What does deep midnight’s voice contend
Deeper than day can comprehend?
Accelerated fall
An orbital sprawl expanded and swollen
A catalogue of the passages never seen
Apprehending the instances there have been
Weighing out the occurrences guaranteed
Overlooking the idiosyncrasy

Holograms cutting through the lines
March in 4/4 time, hollow shells
Stuttering, convalescent hands
Obvious in what they desire
What does deep midnight’s voice contend
Deeper than day can comprehend?
Accelerated fall
An orbital sprawl expanded and swollen3Embed
