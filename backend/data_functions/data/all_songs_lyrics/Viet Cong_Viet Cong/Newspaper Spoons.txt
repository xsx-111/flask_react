Newspaper Spoons Lyrics
Writhing violence essentially without distortion
Wired silent, vanishing into the boredom
Deliberately made to disintegrate
Difficult existence
Underestimated alienation
Writhing violence essentially without distortion
Wired silent, vanishing into the boredom
Deliberately made to disintegrate
Difficult existence
Underestimated alienation

We're bending newspaper spoons
We're bending newspaper spoonsEmbed
