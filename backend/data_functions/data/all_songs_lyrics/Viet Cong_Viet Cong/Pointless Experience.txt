Pointless Experience Lyrics
Poisonous precedence
A pointless experience
Accidental taxidermy
Filling your head with
Sandblasting cemetery monuments naked
Downward velocity
Another endeavor

Failed to keep the necessary papers for evacuation
Hideously synchronized with cold and cruel arithmetic
We’re desperately debilitated
If we’re lucky we’ll get old and die

Everything’s better and then you notice
That you were always unaware
Miscalculated the effectiveness of competent stupidity
There is no reason, you know?
No reason for being awake
Seems like we’re trying much too hard
To recreate all of the same mistakes
 x2
Failed to keep the necessary papers for evacuation
Hideously synchronized with cold and cruel arithmetic
We’re desperately debilitated
If we’re lucky we’ll get old and dieEmbed
