Silhouettes Lyrics
Stained unnecessarily
Unrestrained inevitability
Overwhelmed by all the drunken silhouettes
Entertained with their broken cassettes

Hey, is there any consequence
In getting lost in international time?
Uncontrollable spontaneous tirades
Trying to unmake all of the things that are made

Secondhand industry
Rusted out viciously
All the days are delayed
Becoming memories

There’s no connection left in your head
Another book of things to forget
An overwhelming sense of regret
Relay, reply, react, and reset

Relay, reply, react, and respond
The simple task of turning it on
Only receiving electrical shock
Not everything can stay interlocked
Maybe too late will be much too soon
It isn’t something that’s safe to assume
And anyone can disappear in a spark
There’s no connection left in your head
Another book of things to forget
An overwhelming sense of regret
Relay, reply, react, and reset2Embed
