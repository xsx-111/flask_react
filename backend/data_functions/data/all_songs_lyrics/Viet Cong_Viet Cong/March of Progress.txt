March of Progress LyricsLately there’s a wound that needs some healing soon
Before the infection can set in
Slowly, this repulsion leads to nausea
And fear for these old forgotten halls
Maybe you just need someone to keep you warm
With fire coming from a different sun
Your reputation is preceding you
We’re all sufficiently impressed
And this incessant march of progress
Can guarantee our sure success
We play the life secure with give and take
We build the buildings and they’re built to break
Tell me, tell me, tell it to me, tell it straight:
What is the difference between love and hate?
We play the life secure with give and take
We build the buildings and they’re built to break
Tell me, tell me, tell it to me, tell it straight:
What is the difference between love and hate?
We play the life secure with give and take
We build the buildings and they’re built to break
Tell me, tell me, tell it to me, tell it straight:
What is the difference between love and hate?Embed
