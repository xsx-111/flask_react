Bunker Buster Lyrics
Go where, go where fluorescent primates teem
And wind through the neon screens
That scan over muted lips on Japanese ships

Swelling, screaming
It’s a deranged enhancement
Deflated amplifiers
Overdeveloped in incompetent ways

Slowly, slowly
Fall through the snow so softly
Carry me where we're going
Nowhere at all, we're going
Nowhere at all

Go where, go where fluorescent primates teem
And wind through the neon screens
That scan over muted lips on Japanese ships

Swelling, screaming
It’s a deranged enhancement
Deflated amplifiers
Overdeveloped in incompetent ways
What side are you on, man?
I think we look the same
I know eventually you'll tell me where you came from
You'll tell me where you came from
You'll tell me where you came from
You'll tell me where you came fromEmbed
