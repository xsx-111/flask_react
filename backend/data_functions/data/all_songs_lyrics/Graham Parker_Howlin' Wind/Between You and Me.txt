Between You and Me LyricsAll I knew were the lights in the harbour
All I saw was the flash in my head, yeah
And that's all that's left between you and me, oh yeah
Said that's all that's left between you and me
Next thing I knew I was being carried out to sea
Somebody whispering, "Hey what is wrong with me?" yeah
And that's all that's left between you and me, oh yeah
Said that's all that's left between you and me
Say, did you realise when this bit came to be ?
Yeah it's always in somebody's eyes
When they really don't wanna see, yeah
All I knew was the storm crashing arou-ou-ou-ou-ound
Nothing more than silence, not even a sound, yeah
And that's all that's left between you and me
Said that's all that's left between you and me
And that's all that's left between you and me, yeah yeah yeah
Said that's all that's left between you and me, bop bop
Between you and me, bop bop, between you and me, bop bop
Between you and me, bop bop, between you and me, bop bopEmbed
