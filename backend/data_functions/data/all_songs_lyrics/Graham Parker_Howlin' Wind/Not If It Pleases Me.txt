Not If It Pleases Me LyricsIf I should stumble down the street
Pay no attention just jump my feet yeah
You can't stop me not if it pleases me
And if I should steal your only girl-child
Don't you worry mama just drive a while
You can't stop me not if it pleases me
Not if it pleases me not if it pleases me
Not if it pleases me hey hey
Not if it please it please it pleases me
But if I should lie to get a little high
Just pass me another don't you ask me why
'Cause you can't stop me not if it pleases me
And if I should lie to get real high
Pass me another don't you dare ask me why
'Cause you can't stop me not if it pleases me
Not if it pleases me hey hey not if it pleases me
Not if it pleases me yeah
Not if it please it please it pleases me
Not if it pleases me hey hey not if it pleases me
I said you can't stop me not if it pleases meEmbed
