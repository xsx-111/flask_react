Gypsy Blood LyricsNow don't you try to put it down
Don't pour cold water over me
'Cause I been up and I been down, yeah
She's the warmest thing I've ever seen
'Cause she's got red hot gypsy blood
Keeping me warm tonight
Yes she's got red hot gypsy blood
Keeping me feeling all right
Now don't you try to sell your wares
'Cause I'll buy everything you've got, yeah
Pots and pans and caravans
And jet black curls all tied right up in a knot
'Cause she's got red hot, hey hey, gypsy blood, oh yeah
Keeping me warm tonight
Yes she's got red hot gypsy blood, oh
Keeping me feeling all right, ooh ooh
(instrumental verse)
Now don't you try to sell your wares, little babe
'Cause I'll buy everything, Just about everything you've got
Pots and pans and charabancs
Jet black curls all tied right up in a knot
'Cause she's got red hot, hey hey, gypsy blood, hmm hmm
Keeping me warm tonight, yeah
Yes she's got red hot, huh, gypsy blood, oh oh
Keeping me feeling all right
Yeah I feel all right, baby
Yeah I feel all right now
Yeah I feel all right
Oh, I feel all right, hmmEmbed
