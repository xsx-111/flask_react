Silly Thing LyricsYou want me be someone better
I just wanna monkey 'round yeah
You want me to write you a letter
But the words just won't come the right way
My pen won't listen to a thing that I say
Silly thing hey hey silly thing hey hey
Well it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing
Silly thing hey hey yeah hey hey
Maybe you're getting sloppy
Under the midday sun oh yeah
You come on like a carbon copy
But I just wanna hang to the way you live
Don't you want the love I got to give
Silly thing hey hey silly thing hey hey
Well it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing
Silly thing hey hey yeah hey hey
Well I just wanna hang to the way you live
Don't you want the love I got to give
Silly thing hey hey silly thing hey hey
Well it don't mean a thing if you ain't got that swing
Silly thing hey hey yeah hey hey
I said you don't-a mean a thing if you ain't got that swing
Silly thing hey hey repeat and fadeEmbed
