Soul Shoes LyricsWell I ain't got no worry
I ain't in no hurry
You better tell your mother
That you're a real soul brother
Hey hey!
I have to say it's all right
About five past midnight
And we don't stop a-rollin'
Until the floor board cave in
Yeah I feel like I've been a-living to die
But when that rhythm play I don't know how to cry
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes on my feet
If you wanna leave me go dance with another guy
If you wanna grieve me baby just set my soul to die
Yeah the place is buzzin
Please don't let the fuzz in
You better tell your mother
That you're a real soul brother
Oh yeah I said I feel like I've been living to die
But when that rhythm play I don't know how to cry
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes on my feet
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes on my feet
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes
I got my soul shoes on my feetEmbed
