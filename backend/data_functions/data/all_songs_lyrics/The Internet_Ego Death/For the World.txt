For the World Lyrics
Cigarettes and sex are on your breath again
It's cool, I'm the same, the way we kiss
Girl you’re special, I wanna protect you and I’ll kill so you could live
But when the first body went down, you wouldn't tell me that I know it again
I'd rather lay it down and get back cuz killin' is a sin
We're chillin' instead, give me a kiss
Girl

If not for me
For the world

False arrest, unrest, was on the docket
It’s cool, at least that’s what CNN says
Girl you’re special, I wanna protect you and I’ll kill so you could live
But when the last body goes down, it won’t make any sense
I’d rather lay you back, down on your back, than killin' and shit
Chillin' and shit, give me a kiss
Girl

If not for me
For the world
If not for me
For the world
For the world
Just do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me babe
Don't you wanna love me babe
Aw Yeah
Just do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me babe
Aww Yeah!
Do it like ya love me babe
Do it like ya love me baby
