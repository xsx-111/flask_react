Girl Lyrics
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Passion burning, causing rapture of laughter
Pressure building, falling faster and faster
If I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word, baby
And I got you, darling, I got you

Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Chapters turning, so old fashioned and natural
Potions got me falling for you, oh yeah
Baby if I told you that you rock my world, I want you around me
Would you let me call you my girl, my girlfriend, my girlfriend?
I can give you the life you deserve, just say the word
And I got and more
Girl (you're mine)
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours
Girl
If they don't know your worth
Tell 'em you're my girl
And anything you want is yours

Baby
Baby

Baby, baby, love me, save me
Keep me wrapped up in your open arms
Come on, baby, gave me, something amazing
But don't mistake me for someone, for the next girl, nah
We don't fight, we just fuck
I'm in like, she's in love
She gave in, I gave up
Can we just live in the moment?49Embed
