Penthouse Cloud Lyrics
Did you see the news last night?
They shot another one down
Does it even matter why?
Or is it all for nothing?

Father who art in heaven
Is this how you saw it when you made your creation?
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?

Maybe we’ll never know
Or maybe we’ll find paradise in the sky when we die
When we die
When we die, yeah

Took her to the moon last night
Little bit of weed, a little wine
Left everything else behind
No plans on coming home

Father who art in heaven
This is what you’ve started, it’s your creation
Is this what you wanted?
Is this what you wanted?
Rather watch the world burn down
From a penthouse cloud, real talk
But if this is what you want, I’ll fight ’til the
Smoke-filled skies make the days turn night, then what?
Maybe when the world burns down
And the clouds turns black
And the sky turns white
And the days turn night
It’s a war outside
It’s a war outside
It’s a war outside

Or maybe we’ll find paradise in the sky
When we die
When we die, yeah
