Losing All Sense LyricsWhen I woke up today I was so bound
To a memory cut long ago
I could hear all your words echo on down
And then my heart rate dropped to a crawl
Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show
Could I ask of you not to cut into me
Dividing all of my body for me
I was left here to go through all the pieces
Nothing more to spare
I keep looking for reasons to come 'round
To make sense of your internal row
But it's a maze and there's nothing to be found
It just leads me away from my end goal
Move too fast
Here we are
Can't let go
Take the past
Own your scars
Let it show
Like a rogue wave you
Wash right over me
Losing all sense of what my body could feel
I was able to drift away from here
I have lost all control
The cipher walks alone
The cipher lies so long awake
She can't help
One night to lie so long awake
Just thinking
Just thinking
It's too late5Embed
