Aquarian LyricsGreat disaster, shocking sight
Scream and run or test your might
Every moment brings a bitter choice
The knowledge you can't win with what remains
Astral actor, find your fight
Walk beside your shadow life
Lay your body on the burning ground
That separates this mind from all that's passed
Never reach the end1Embed
