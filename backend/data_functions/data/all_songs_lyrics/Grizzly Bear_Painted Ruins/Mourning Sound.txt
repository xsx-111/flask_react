Mourning Sound Lyrics
I made a mistake
I should have never tried
I took the cake
Finished every slice
I moved away
Still paying off the fines
For every day
That I shared, I left a lie

I stare at my face
Looking through my eyes
I move at a pace
That I cannot survive
I'm holing away
I do it all the time
Let love age
And watch it burn out and die

I woke to the sound of dogs
To the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
I'll own our fate
Could never deny
This isn't a place
Where I can even try
I'll haul it away
I do it all the time
Let love age
And watch it burn out and die

We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks
We walked with the mourning sound
It's the sound of distant shots and passing trucks5Embed
