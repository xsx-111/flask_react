Sky Took Hold Lyrics
Your mind is racing
The sky took hold
Of all my little daily fears
They never seem to go
A dusty vista
You hunger for the core
I never meant to take it so far
A mirror never shows

Who I am beneath the surface
Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay blind to it
Habit comes and tears me open wide
All the time

Your heart is racing
The time just froze
And left me with little doubt
That there's anywhere to go
I'm pushing forward
To leave this home
I never meant to stay so long
My reflection never shows
Who I am beneath the surface
Hiding out so long inside my mind
Every day I stay blind to it
Habit comes and tears me open wide
All the time

Since I was a young boy it was always there
Inside me growing none of it seems fair
I've grown to accept it, let it take the stage
And leave me helpless, watching far away
Since I was a young boy it was always there
Inside me growing none of it seems fair
I've grown to accept it, let it take the stage
And leave me helpless, watching far away3Embed
