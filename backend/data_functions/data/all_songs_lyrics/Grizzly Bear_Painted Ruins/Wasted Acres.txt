Wasted Acres Lyrics
Howling at the field
The clearest of days
Where does that hound run?

Were you even listening?
Were you riding with me?
Were you even listening?
TRX 250

Trust in your machine
The kick and the wheeze
That hauls for the winter

Were you even listening?
Were you riding with me?
Were you even listening?
TRX 250

Trusted friend
Tell me what you need
Why would you stay here?
Were you even listening?
Were you riding with me?
Were you even listening?
