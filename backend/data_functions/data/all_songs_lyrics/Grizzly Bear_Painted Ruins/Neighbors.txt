Neighbors Lyrics
And here we go again
I pick up a pen
I write your name down
With a sense of dread
Could see you for an hour
Conversation stalls
And after so long
There's nothing really there

Face to face
We'll watch our bodies break
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play
Face to face
But you left me broken
We'll watch our bodies break
But you left me helpless
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play

Half a mile away
Could see you every day
We never go there
And yet I don't care
With every passing day
Our history fades away
And I'm not sure why
There's nothing left to say
Face to face
We'll watch our bodies break
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play
Face to face
But you left me broken
We'll watch our bodies break
But you left me helpless
Not a care in the world
That's the way you play2Embed
