Cut-Out Lyrics
You are like an invading spore
Growing inside of me
Never ever letting go
Medicine is not what I need
Inhale your older self
Cut it up and let it go

Focused on the point that won't be found
Moving slowly with clear resolve
Written on your face, the only truth
Pure as ether, that empty room
Can't you see, do you see
What's out in front of you?
A black sheet

A perfect man is not hard to find
You'll never know the feel
To be a good guy inside
A panorama of all our faults
Looks the same to me
When you're waking up in the dark2Embed
