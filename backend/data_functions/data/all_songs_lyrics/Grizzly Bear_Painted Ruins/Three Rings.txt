Three Rings LyricsWill you move on again?
See that turn, I have to flee again
You always make it alright
Is that the way it is?
Let's get along again
Even though you moved around the bend
Why is that the way it is?
The morning always shows all
I wanna show you my best side
I wanna be the guy who's right
I want you to see things clearly
I wanna make it alright
Don't you be so easy
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?
Don't you be so easy
Don't you know that I can make it better?
Don't you ever leave me
Don't you feel it all come together?7Embed
