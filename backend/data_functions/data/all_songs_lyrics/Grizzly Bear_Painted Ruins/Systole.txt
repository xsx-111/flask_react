Systole LyricsOnce in a while
Come around and bleed it
This has got to end next time you're needing more
They can take it up with me any time
You're needing
Try once more, it'll stop the bleeding
Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home
I could take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home
Give a little more as your eyes grow colder
Even if it's all that you wanted, let it go
Take the sheets from the bed
Throw them all to the fire
Watch the room light up
As the flames grow warm and tired
Try giving me a chance to get out
I want it
There ain't nothing wrong
Every time I got it home
I could take one look at the things that we started
But you know that I lost that key that promised home3Embed
