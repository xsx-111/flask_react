Framed Lyrics
I was walkin' down the street, mindin' my own affairs
When two policemen grabbed me, uh, unawares
He said, "Is your name Henry?" I said, "Why, sure"
They say, "You the boy we've been lookin' for"

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

They put me in the line up and let the bright lights shine
There were ten poor souls like me standing in that line
I knew I was a victim of someone's evil plan
When a stool pidgeon walked in and said, uh, "That's the man"

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

The prosecuting attorney started prosecutin' me
Man, that cat gave me the third degree
He said, "Where were you the night of, uh, June 29th?"
I said, "I was home in bed" he said, "Judge, this man is lying"
Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

I deny the charges of robbing the liquor store
Deny the charges of carrying a .44
Deny the charges of vagrancy too
But when the judge came down
Poured whiskey on my head
Turned around to the jury and said
"Convict this man, he is drunk"
What could I do?

Framed, I was framed
I never do nothin' wrong
But I always get framed, framed

He was framed (I was framed)
He was framed (I was framed)
He was framed (I got framed)Embed
