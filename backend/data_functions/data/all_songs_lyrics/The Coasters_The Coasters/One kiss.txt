One kiss LyricsMy girlfriend was
Babysitting down the street
So I bought some soda pop
And sandwich meat
She laid it on the table
And I took a seat
But I never got the
Chance to drink or eat
Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
The lights were low
When she turned on the radio
I could hear the music
Playing soft and low
I said, we better dance
Before I flip my lid
We both got up to dance
But we never did
Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
I thought the night was young
Until I saw the clock
The clock was striking midnight
It was quite a shock
I started for the door
But she grabbed my sleeve
She put her arms around me
Man, I couldn`t leave
Cause one kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
One kiss led to another
And another and another
And another and another
And another and another
And another and anotherEmbed
