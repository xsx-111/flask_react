Youngblood LyricsI saw her standin' on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from shoutin:
Look a-there! Look a-there!
Look a-there! Look a-there!
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered:
What's your name? What's your name?
What's your name? What's your name?
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
What crazy stuff! She looked so tough
I had to follow her all the way home
Then things went bad; I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
I couldn't sleep a wink for tryin'
I saw the rising of the sun
And all night my heart was cryin':
You're the one, you're the one
You're the one, you're the one!
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mindEmbed
