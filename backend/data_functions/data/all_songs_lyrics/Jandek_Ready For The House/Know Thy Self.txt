Know Thy Self LyricsYou think I got time for you?
You're just somebody in the snow
I don't even know why I think about you
Somehow I just keep seeing you around
Everybody's coming and going
I thought I'd stay for a while
It had to be you threw me out
I didn't know you were so cruel
But thanks for all the gifts
Hang on silver branches
And now we're all out here
And your eyes find me in the glassEmbed
