Show Me the Way, O Lord LyricsWould you show me the way, O Lord
Show me the way
I got an ace to tell the time
I got my face all red with wine
I got my eyes above all men
I don’t even listen to them
Would you show me the way, O Lord
Show me the way
I’m walking on a planet
I take everything for granted
The stars are falling
Emptiness, and I am calling
For your caress
Would you show me the way, O Lord
Show me the wayEmbed
