Cave in on You LyricsA stick would do the trick
A dog would jump all over you
A mine cave in on you
Jump out the window
Hit the floor
Tap tap tapping at your door
In the moonlight behind the sun
The blind man's coming
He's the one to read about you
To see your name
My blind man
I'm glad you came
Blind man blind man
Be the one behind the moonlight
In the sun
You tell my fortune
Wait, you are my fate
My hands are bleeding
Am I too late
You walk outside
A moon is low
Round the corner
An Eskimo
Gently tapping
Whispers your name
Says hi how are you
From the blind man I came
To read you a messageEmbed
