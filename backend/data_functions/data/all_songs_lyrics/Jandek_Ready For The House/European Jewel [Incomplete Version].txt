European Jewel  LyricsYou sure are cool, a European jewel
I dig you most
A letter came, it’s not the same
The ink was blue
A relative stopped by to say he saw you, hey
A walkin’ down a lonesome town
Some time ago
He said you had a mouth so bad
The lips were rotting off
You dropped a tear to end his fear
You seem quite well
It’s a long time spell
I’m wondering where you got that infection
There’s bugs in my brain
I can’t feel any pain
Just a shaking sha—Embed
