What Can I Say What Can I Sing LyricsWhat can I say what can I sing
You always knew about everything
What can I show what can I do
Is it all for me, is it all for you
Well I don’t know, we’ll have to see
Everyone needs, ’cept you and me
And then sometime I’m not so sure
There’ll never be another cure
The early morning sun shines through
And all my thoughts are shades of blue
Oh I don’t know, I’ll have to go
Oh I don’t know the reason for
I already left
It’s no surprise
I saw it in your raining eyes
Adrift a dream
A time we spent
Much more than that
Forever was all that we meantEmbed
