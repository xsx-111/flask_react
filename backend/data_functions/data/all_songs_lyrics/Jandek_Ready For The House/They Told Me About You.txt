They Told Me About You LyricsThey told me about you
They told me about you
Sneaking up on me
I’m crazy about you
I’m crazy about you
Forever to time 
Forever do mine
Take it up and lock it
Arrange a new day
Placate a new way
Gangrene in two legs
Drunken I’m up on pegs
Leaning, a month or so
Wrestle with a wandering
See the lights up in the sky
Vagrant in your cripple eye
Wandering’s been creeping byEmbed
