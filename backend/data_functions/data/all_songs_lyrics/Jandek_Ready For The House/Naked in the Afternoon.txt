Naked in the Afternoon LyricsI got a vision, a teenage daughter
Who's growing up naked in the afternoon
I know a brother close to his mother
Who stays out late in the evening time
I keep repeating, it takes a beating
To grow up naked in the afternoon
You are a cowboy if you wear those boots
You are a cowboy when you wear those boots
Big time in the city
Big time in the city
Big time in the city
Big time in the city
I got a letter
I read in the paper
It said a man was shot to death
It said a cow gave poison milk
Big time in the city when you wear those boots
I keep repeating, it takes a beating
To wear those boots in the afternoon
You call it a question
You call it a color
I got a letter
I think it's a vision
Big time in the city
I got a vision
I know a brother close to his mother
After the morning
You've had your rest
Time to go naked in the afternoon
Take off your hat, take off your coat
Big time in the city
You've had your rest
I got a letter
You are a cowboy
Read in the paper
Big time in the city
It's time to go naked in the afternoon3Embed
