The Handshake Lyrics
I just shook the handshake, I just sealed the deal
I'll try not to let them take everything they can steal
People always told me, said "Don't forget your roots"
I know I can feel them underneath my leather boots

You toss all the mornings lost to the clouds
And you watch it go
Your fair weather friends on a parachute binge
Get lost when the wind blows
The handshake's stuck on the tip of my tongue
It tastes like death but it looks like fun

I was a loner, I was just waiting by myself
When you, warped temptress rose to bring me happiness and wealth
Black tears, black smile, black credit cards and shoes
You can call all the people you want, but it's you who's being used
Under your black eyes, honey, right beneath your nose
A curse on all creation, every single thing you know
White smoke, white light, white marble on the floor
It would only take a few seconds of darkness to figure out what's in store
Little girl
You convince yourself that you want it
But you don't know
You keep trying to wash the blood from your hands
But it won't go
We're gonna keep you on the run
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue
We got the handshake under our tongue

We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake
We got the handshake6Embed
