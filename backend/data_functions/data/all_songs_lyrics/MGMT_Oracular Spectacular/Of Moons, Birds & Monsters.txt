Of Moons, Birds & Monsters Lyrics
Why'd you cut holes in the face of the moon base?
Don't you know about the temperature change in the cold black shadow?
Are you mad at your walls or hoping that an
Unknown force can repair things for you?
Pardon all the time that you've thrown into your pale gray garden?
If your ship will never come, you gotta move along

Even a bird would want a taste of dirt from abyssal dark
The prick of a feather could make a kingdom burn
And the bloodshed start the falling apart
Made me a shadow in the shape of wonder the waves of black
If she's going under, I can hold my breath till the sky comes back
Or drown like a rat, rat, rat
He's a rat


To catch a monster, we make a movie
Set the tempo and cut and cut its brains out
It will inspire on the burning pyre
Half the distance, half the motion
Communication is easy as the ocean20Embed
