Future Reflections Lyrics
And there were future reflections
On the face and the hands
On a green colored island
On a primitive man
It was the future reflecting
It felt familiar but new
A street was missing a building
The kids had something to do

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader
Someone was walking on floorboards
Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation
I wrapped a string around my finger
Into the forest with the young ones
I don't expect to be a winner
But as long as you feel it, I'm a believer
My heart is phosphor
Sea rolls and death tolls
Break the surface, don't break my bones
Off of the trail and off of your hands and
Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin
Pale and thin

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell
But pieces come together for some reason just as well
Their guns couldn't see us, there's a sea outside my door
And one day I'll appreciate the rush of blood and the washed out beat of the shore

And remember what it felt like
To be alone
Sitting in the sunlight
All alone7Embed
