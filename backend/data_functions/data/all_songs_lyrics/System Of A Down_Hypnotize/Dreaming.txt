Dreaming Lyrics
For today, we will take their body parts
And put them on the wall

For treated indigenously, digenously
Human right is private blue chip, pry
For treated indigenously, digenously
(We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)

You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond, you saw it all
Why did you?

For treated indigenously, digenously
(We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage)
For treated indigenously, digenously
(We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)
You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond, you saw it all
Why did you go there?

She lost her mind
Someone kicked her into the back of the line
She lost her head
When they called and said that they thought he was dead
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind, I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind, I hate these thoughts I can't deâ€“

For treated indigenously, digenously

Human right is private blue chip, pry

For treated indigenously, digenously
(We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water)
Human right is private blue chip, pry
(Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die)
You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there
From beyond, you saw it all
Why did you?

Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na, na-na, na-na-na
Ah, ah, ah-ah

Dreamin' of screamin'
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreamin' of screamin'
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny

You will take the body parts and put them on the wall
And bring the dark disaster8Embed
