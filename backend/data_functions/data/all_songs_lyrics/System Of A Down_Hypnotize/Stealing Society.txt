Stealing Society Lyrics
Yeah
Alright
Yeah, alright

Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies living it all fading
Two skies watching it all fading
Two skies fading, one's abating
Two suns living it all, dying
Two suns fighting, one's abiding
Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns seeing them both dying
Two suns watching them both fighting
Two suns fighting, one's abiding
Two skies seeing them both dying
Two skies fading, one's abating
Ah, ah, ah

Crack pipes, needles, PCP and fast cars
Kind of mix really well in a dead movie star
When I feel like talking, I never be wrong
If I feel like walking, you best come along
I close my windows, crank the heat up high
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
'Til my palms are wet and my tongue is dry
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
(Na, na, na, na, na, na)
I'm a midnight fist fight
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
I'm a midnight fist fight
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
Alright
I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
Alright
(Two suns fighting, one's abiding)
Looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
(Two skies fading, one's abating)
'Cause I'm looking for a mother that will get me high
Just a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
(Two suns fighting, one's abiding)
Yeah, I am looking for a mother that will get me high
I'm a stupid motherfucker, if I die, I die
Alright
(Two skies, two suns, watching them all go)
Yeah
Alright
Yeah, alright5Embed
