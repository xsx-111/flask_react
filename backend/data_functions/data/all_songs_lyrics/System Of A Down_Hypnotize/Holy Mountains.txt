Holy Mountains Lyrics
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, yeah

Can you feel their haunting presence?
Can you feel their haunting presence?

Liar! Killer! Demon! Back to the River Aras
Someone's blank stare deemed it warfare
Liar! Killer! Demon! Back to the River Aras

Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free

Can you hear the Holy Mountains?

Liar! Killer! Demon! Back to the River Aras
Someone's mouth said, "Paint them all red"
Liar! Killer! Demon! Back to the River Aras
Freedom, freedom
We're free, we're free

They have all returned, resting on the mountainside
We have learned that you have no
They have returned, resting on the mountainside
We have learned that you have no
Honor! Murderer! Sodomizer! Back to the River Aras
They have returned, resting on the mountainside
We have learned that you have no
Honor! Murderer! Sodomizer Back to the River Aras

Freedom, freedom
We're free, free

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh7Embed
