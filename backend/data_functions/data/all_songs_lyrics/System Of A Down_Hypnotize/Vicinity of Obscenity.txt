Vicinity of Obscenity Lyrics
Liar, liar

Banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie

Is there a perfect way of holding you, baby? (Liar)
Vicinity of obscenity in your eyes
Terracotta, terracotta, terracotta pie
Is there a perfect way of holding you, baby? (Liar)
Vicinity of obscenity in your eyes
Terracotta pie, hey
Terracotta pie, hey
Terracotta pie, hey
Terracotta pie

Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Do we all learn defeat
From the whores with bad feet?
Beat the meat, beat the meat, treat the feet
To the sweet, milky seat

Banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie

Is there a perfect way of holding you, baby? (Liar)
Vicinity of obscenity in your eyes
Terracotta pie, hey
Terracotta pie, hey
Terracotta pie, hey
Terracotta pie

Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Do we all learn defeat
From the whores with bad feet?
Beat the meat, treat the feet
To the sweet, milky seat

Liar! Liar! Liar! Liar!

Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie
Banana, banana, banana, banana, terracotta
Banana terracotta, terracotta pie5Embed
