The Moon Atomic (...Fragments and Fictions) Lyrics
Its like the day has turned to rust
Like every dreams been sealed shut
Like every door is closed before we've gotten out
As bullets rip the air in two from house to house

We are all that we are, so terribly sorry
We are all that we are, so terribly sorry
The moon you've felt, it has no side
That's dark like hell, or safe from light
Just blown apart, by wind from stars
With white dust tides to pull on ours

I see the crowds their giving way
For some, they're better off that day
The bombs blew off the shells
Their glowing red at burst
The less there is to feel each night upon the earth

We are all that we are, so terribly sorry
We are all that we are, so terribly sorry
The moon you've felt, it has no side
That's dark like hell, or safe from light
Just blown apart, by wind from stars
With white dust tides to pull on ours
The moon you've felt, it has no side
That's dark like hell, or safe from light
Just blown apart, by wind from stars
With white dust tides to pull on ours
(You're all that I want, you're all that I need)
(My everything)Embed
