Hallucinations Lyrics

And you look real close
Cross the lines and the roads
It is there to decode
What you thought was a ghost
Or a spark to explode
It's the start of the show
It's the part you love the most
When your heart will implode within

Do you believe in hallucinations, silly dreams or imaginations
Don't go away 'cause I feel you this time
Don't go away 'cause I need you there this time

As the wind floats home
Carry us back to shore
And up the mountainous coast
Where the sun starts to glow
From our head to our toes
To the stars that we know
And with you as my host
It will keep us afloat again
Do you believe in hallucinations, silly dreams or imaginations
Don't go away 'cause I feel you this time
Don't go away 'cause I need you there this time
Do you believe in hallucinations, any dream or it's revelation
Don't go away 'cause I need you there this time
Don't go away 'cause I'm making you all mine

The silence is taxing
I'm waiting for something
There's images of love and war
And everything's here to explore
It's all alike, unusual, a different place
But beautiful and it is not quite as it seems
I hear the children's laughs and screams

It's beautiful
So beautiful
It's beautiful

Do you believe in hallucinations, silly dreams or imaginations
Don't go away 'cause I feel you this time
Don't go away 'cause I need you there this time
Do you believe in hallucinations, any dream or it's revelation
Don't go away 'cause I need you there this time
Don't go away 'cause I'm making you all mine
I'm making you all mine
I'm making you all mine
I'm making you all mine4Embed
