Clever Love Lyrics
Oh I know you well
All your life, I've watched you breathe
I've watched you lie across the seam through space and time
Through every year of every kind
I'd wait like snow, on the eve of spring
I can outlast cold, can you outlast me?
Every word you say, is a perfect thing
It's the perfect time, for the perfect line

And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire

Oh I've felt your spell
And all alike, it's been like hell
Every single time the cycle goes in and out of mind
In and out of fear of getting left behind
I see your glow, your eyes are kind, they kill as well
I bear in mind, every word I say is a silent thing
And a solid wish, will you lay with me?

And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire
And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire
And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire
And you oh, you're all I desire
And you oh, this clever love won't tire
And you oh, you're all I desire
(You, you're all that I want, you're all that I need)
(My everything)
And you oh, our clever love caught fire
(You, you're all that I want, you're all that I need)
(My everything)

(You, you're all that I want, you're all that I need)
(My everything)
(You, you're all that I want, you're all that I need)
(My everything)3Embed
