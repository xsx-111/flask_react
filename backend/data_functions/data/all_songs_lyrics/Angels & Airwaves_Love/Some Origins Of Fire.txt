Some Origins Of Fire Lyrics
Cars crash through the streets
The west end waves break city heats
The east coast storms fill in the sky
Winter weekends
Cold, unbearable
Life's so terrible
Shots ring out in blind stellar night time
Town lights come alive like a land mine
Eyes wide up in five second intervals
Unpredictable, life's a miracle

We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
It breaks my heart
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
So heres my heart

I can't close my eyes
The east end girls, it's summer time
The west coast lives got butterflies
So literal
Cold, unbearable
Life's so terrible
Kids live fearlessly and curious lives
Grow up to be so serious
Lost time, broken dreams
So usual
Unpredictable, life's a miracle
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
It breaks my heart
We all are love and love is hard
We're hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
So heres my heart

It's only the cycle
It's deafening though
This age old recital is king of all sounds
There is no release, free, we are silently numb
A subtle, rolling wave with a wake that's yet to comeEmbed
