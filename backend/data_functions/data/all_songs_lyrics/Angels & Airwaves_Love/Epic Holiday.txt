Epic Holiday Lyrics
And the brightest sign, it is full of holes
And it's full of pain, loss and violent criminals
With a little fate and the worst of lies
With a love so deep, it's war with endless fire inside
Go right back to the line
Every single day, every nine to five
Everybody works it hard, but then we finally die
And there's no remorse, or the slightest sound
We're forever cool with the way it all breaks up and down

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game
It's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday

On the Sunday rain
Like a lonely ghost
And the furthest point from here is right outside the door
Open up your eyes
Take a breath if you will
And the sun is still alive even though it's hard to tell
Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game
It's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday
Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game
It's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday

Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Let's start a riot

Let's start a riot
Nobody's right
Nobody's wrong
Life's just a game
It's just one epic holiday
However far this
Takes us along
Take us away
It's just one epic holiday2Embed
