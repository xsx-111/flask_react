Shove Lyrics
Forget the things that you own
And travel almost anywhere you can go
Dance across the tree tips, set them ablaze
Soaking in her pleasant warm summer haze
And weeping on her streets and school city blocks
And finding strings on her while you're skipping rocks
And feeding on her touch as it will barely keep you alive

She said show me the world that's inside your head
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help
'Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

It can be so bold and so cavalier
To reach out to the fire her souls sending here
It can be like death that blows like a breeze
Making all ones strength go weak at the knees
I hate to feel the shallow ground giving way
I've never let myself fall this much astray
And feeding on her touch is all one does to survive

She said show me the world that's inside your head
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help
'Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love
She said show me the world that's inside your head
Tell me your secrets of life and death, and your one regret
'Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

She said show me the world that's inside your head
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help
'Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love
She said show me the world that's inside your head
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use some help
'Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love
She said show me the world that's inside your head
Tell me your secrets of life and death, and your one regret
'Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

If you're ever alone, then your heart will know
It can call to mine, and I'll be at your side
If you're ever alone, then your heart will know
It can reach to mine, I'll be at your side5Embed
