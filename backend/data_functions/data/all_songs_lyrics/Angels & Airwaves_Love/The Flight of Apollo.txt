The Flight of Apollo Lyrics
I'm floating and something's reaching out
Vibrations, can you hear them now?
Please help us, we are running out of time
My brothers, we are deathly out alive
I feel you on a far off distant land
We fucked up, let's give ourselves a hand
It's over from the heavens on down
Heard footsteps, God's coming around

I got an ache like a cat thief's got an alarm
It's got a sound like a gunshot over and over
I've got a voice so lost off back in my head
It takes the heart rate up then down even more
I've got my friends face down like a kid in the dark
They've got the same fear built up more even more
I've let my eyes bright up like a predator shark
To let my mind close down every hour by hour

Finally, I get this feeling we're all alone in one big world
Just to realize that all these shapes and colors are
So it doesn't hurt so badly

So life doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
So life doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
Please don't look at life, look at me so sadly
Life shouldn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
Do you feel light shine in the darkest of nights?
Or does the pain stack up from the skin to the core?
Do you find every time that you cover your eyes
To keep the tears held up, dripping down even more?
You let the words cut down every minor insight
You put the young flames out it make you cower and cower
If the sun breaks in to start a spark and a sign
I promise you'll be here to let the light in

Finally, I get this feeling we're all alone in one big world
Just to realize that all these shapes and colors are
So it doesn't hurt so badly

So life doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
So life doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
Please don't look at life, look at me so sadly
Life shouldn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly

I'm floating and somethings reaching out
Vibrations, can you hear them now?
Please help us from the heavens on down
Our footsteps, God's coming around
Go!
So life doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
So life doesn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly
Please don't look at life, look at me so sadly
Life shouldn't hurt, doesn't hurt so badly

Gotta make like a cat thief's got an alarm
It's gotta sound like a gunshot over and over
I've gotta voice so lost off back in my head
It takes the heart rate up then down even more
I've got my friends face down like a kid in the dark
They've got the same fear built up more even more
I've let my eyes bright up like a predator shark
To let my mind close down every hour by hour

Do you feel light shine in the darkest of nights?
Or does the pain stack up from the skin to the core?
Do you find every time that you cover your eyes
To keep the tears held up, dripping down even more?
You let the words cut down every minor insight
You put the young flames out it make you cower and cower
If the sun breaks in to start a spark and a sign
I promise you'll be here to let the light in3Embed
