Letters to God, Part II Lyrics
All the phones have rung and rung
Theyre off the hook, all but one
And all the mail stacked up inside
Up from the floor, a mile high

And like one would, like a child
I am asking
Like I could knock on your door
Will you let me in?

And dear God, I found out the same things we learn when we die
I found out the truth is its all a big lie
I find that the words are hard to describe
I tell you I'm lost here, awaiting reply

Climbing trees and paper planes
Life as a kid, we're all the same
Tears of joy, and sullen hearts
Sticks and stones and broken arms

And like one would, like a child
I am asking
Like I could knock on your door
Will you let me in?
And dear God, I found out the same things we learn when we die
I found out the truth is its all a big lie
I find that the words are hard to describe
I tell you I'm lost here, awaiting reply
I found out whats wrong, and its not you or i
Or anyone else that you chose to deny
It seems like the madness of choice in the life
Has made it unclear if we run or we hide

And dear God, I found out the same things we learn when we die
I found out the truth is its all a big lie
I find that the words are hard to describe
I tell you I'm lost here, awaiting reply
I found out whats wrong, and its not you or i
Or anyone else that you chose to deny
It seems like the madness of choice in the life
Has made it unclear if we run or we hide1Embed
