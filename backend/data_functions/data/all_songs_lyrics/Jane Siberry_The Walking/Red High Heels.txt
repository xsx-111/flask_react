Red High Heels Lyrics
Red high heels
Is the way I feels
Got the sways and reels
Going home
Red high heels
And the church bells peal
Cross the snowy fields
Going home

I walk down these aisles
Nobody's here—just me
And the birds in the belfry
Oh, murmuring murmuring
I took all your letters
Strung together
A white river of love and kneeling
Trailing trailing

Well, I don't know
I'm on my own again
Start alone
End alone
So my love
Maybe I'm glad
I met you on the way...
I walk up these aisles
Nobody's here—just me
And the doves up above me
Oh, murmuring murmuring
Where could you be now?
Could you be that far?
Are you still thinking of me...?
Oh, listening listening

Well, I don't care
If I'm on my own again
Start alone
End alone
So my love
I guess I'm glad
I met you on the way...

Red high heels
Is the way I feel
Got the sways and reels
Going home
Red high heels
And the church bells peal
Cross the snowy fields
Going home
I walk down these aisles
Nobody's here—trust me
Is it already gone now?
Oh, and the bells start to ring
Better get outside
Before they arrive ('Scuse me)
Merry Christmas and Easter
Snow
Falling falling

Well, I don't care
If I'm on my own again
Start alone
End alone
So my love
I guess I'm glad
I met you on the way...

Red high heels
Is the way I feel
Got the sways and reels
Going home
Red high heels
And the church bells peal
And the children steal
Going home
Red high heels
Is the way I feel
And I teeter off
Cross the parking lot
I could steal your heart
But I don't know who...
I could make you mine
Such a tall street light
Love is what I say
It won't go away
La la lala...
Maybe I'll lie down here
And watch the stars awhile
And these red high heels
I can still see them
They're the only thing that's real
In these frozen fields
Yeah yeah...Embed
