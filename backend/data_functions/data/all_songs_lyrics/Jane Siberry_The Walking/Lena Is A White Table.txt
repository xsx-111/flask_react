Lena Is A White Table Lyrics
First you go up the hill
(Don't forget to say the church)
The church why? I don't thinkâ€“
(In case they miss the turn)
Hey, let me do the talking
(You make mistakes sometimes)
Well, so do you
(You never let me talk)
Yah, drink your beer
This is no surprise

They're always arguing
They're from down in
(Darts my friend?)
And when you reach the top
Out on the scraggy backs just there
Say, you must be new
A movie camera! (Oohh!)
Well - I wouldn't go
(Darts?) Don't!
Who is that with you?
(Darts my friend?)

How does she hang the clothes
Climb up on herself?
There's a house (White)
A back porch (Grey)
Just a table there
(Don't forget the laundry line)
Yes, nobody knows how far it goes
(Many men have died)
Past the fishing banks
(Many men have)
Probably past the edge of the earth maybe
(Oh come on)

And sometimes there is a chair
The table legs they never
Move waiting and pressing
And the clothesline stop don't move

Well, maybe she should go to school
No, no, she's a table
Lena's a white table (No no no no)

And in the afternoon
And in the autumn air
The porch is bare and still
There is a waiting there
And flint the laundry line
Apples rolling down the hill
I hope that she's here
What if she's not here
I don't think she's here
I hope that she's here
What if she's not here
What if she's not here

And sometimes there is a chair
The table legs they never
Move waiting and pressing
And the clothesline stop don't move

Well, maybe she should go to school
No, no. she's a table
Lena's a white table
Well, maybe she should learn to pray
No, no, she's a table
Lena's a white table
We saw her waiting by the line
Which line? The laundry line
Waiting for the clothes to dry
What if she freezes in mid-air?
No no no no noEmbed
