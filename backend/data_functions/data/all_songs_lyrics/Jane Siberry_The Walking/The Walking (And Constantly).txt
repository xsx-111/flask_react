The Walking (And Constantly) Lyrics
The
The

The walking and constantly
An endless stream of endless dreams
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder

The waiting and constantly
An endless shift of sifting through
The facts, the fey
You never know for sure

I was sure until they asked me
Now I don't know
All I know is something touched me
Shadows lift my fingers
Don't let the cold...
Every now and then things become clear

There's nothing that will bring you back
There's nothing that will change this fact
There's nothing that I will take back
I know I know
This is a fact
I'm pretty sure I know
I don't know I don't know I...
I tell everyone a different story
That way nothing's ever boring
Even when they turn and say you lied

Petals drifting past my shoulder
Or maybe snow - I'm cold I'm not sure
Someone yelled at me I don't know why

If you want someone to love you
Just let me know
People pushing past me
If you want someone to love you
Then don't just go (Don't just go)
Every now and then things become clear

That there's nothing that will bring you back
And there's nothing that will change this fact
There's nothing that I will take back
Your shoes you left your hat
It's on the bed or else the chair
I don't know I don't know I...
The walking and constantly
An endless stream of endless dreams
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder

That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
That wheel and roll just past my shoulder
That wheel and roll just past my shoulderEmbed
