The Bird In the Gravel Lyrics
I was dreaming in the steam room
Everything was so clear for a minute
And the dripping tiles and...
And I said I'll confess everything
Yes, I own this land
I own these forests surrounding my... my estate
This is my tea coming
Everything I can—I confess

Bend
Now I have the bend
The best I ever
Place the tea just so
Then release and turn
Oh no not yet
Then release and turn
Turn away then go

I was walking through the forest

Better try again
Looking at me he's
On my break today

Wait 'til tomorrow
Don't want him to know

I had this funny feeling

Next time he orders tea
Release and turn

Something was going to change

Turn and limp away
Turn and limp away

I was walking through the dry leaves

Turn and limp away
Turn and limp away
It was very strange
They hadn't changed their colour
All the leaves were green
I don't mind when it's over
I don't mind when it's all done
It's just the moments in between
Just before it's gone
Something's gonna happen
Something's gonna change

And when, and when autumn comes
Well, there's lots of work to do
Bill—that means you
Time to clean the kettles and the pots on the wall
Pickling and preserving all the vegetables
Stop kicking the apples
Are we pickling this year?
Yes—you know we are
And when, and when autumn comes
Well, there's lots of work to do
Bill—that means you
Time to get the twigs up—you know, all those stick things
Time to trim back the roses so next year even more grow
Does it hurt them to do that?
Does it hurt them?
No, no, no

And when, and when autumn comes
Well, deliveries start to go
Here he is now
Down into the valley fo the market he goes
Down along the tiny roads that wind along the vineyards
And people lean on their rakes and they say hello
Hello there Francesco
Francesco there hello



And those are my swans, believe me...
There's no light
And there isn't because...
It's so dark
Because it's so dark
Because it's so dark

I was walking through the dry leaves
It was very strange
The leaves fell without changing
No yellows and no reds
Something's gonna happen
Something's gonna change

Place the tea just so

And just then as I looked up

Then release and turn
Oh not yet

I remembered what you said

Turn away then go

I'm crying because I love you

Better try again
He's looking at me

I know that things must change

Wait until tomorrow
Don't want him to know

I can't be there when you leave

Next time...
Time he orders tea

What if you're afraid?

Release and turn
Turn and limp away...

You said something about the leaving

Turn and limp away...
Turn and limp away...

The moments in between

Turn and limp away...
Limp away just go

The yawning when the world shifts
The clanging of the trains
And a dog sits up and growls
And a cow begins to bawl
And a nun nearby stops to listen
Cross herself and then move on
I was laughing in the forest
I fell down in the leaves
And I watched the trees above me
Crossing in the breeze
I love the bare branches
I love the healing bells
The bareness in the last sun
The greyness and the gold
And a flock of geese flew over
And I laughed harder still
I laughed 'til I was heaving
Then everything was stillEmbed
