The Lobby Lyrics
So I go down to the lobby
And everybody stares
They say "Take off that foolish hat"
What man? I say

So I go down to the lobby
And everybody stares
They say "Take off that foolish hat
Put down that chair"

So I go down to the lobby
And everyone's still there
And they say "The snow is getting deeper
Don't go out there
You can't leave him like that
Go back upstairs"

So I run down the fire escape
I leap into the air
And I say "I thought I'd like to fly
I needed air"
So I run down the main street
I knock some people down
And they say... I know their lips are moving
I hear no sound
Five geese flew down beside me
I ran along
I don't know what you're saying
I'm not unfair

So I go down to the lobby
And everyone's still there
And they say "Take off that foolish hat
Put down that chair"
And they say "This is your darkest hour"
This is my finest moment
"You can't leave him like that"
He'll be okay

So I go down to the lobby
I know it
I know itEmbed
