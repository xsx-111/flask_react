One More Time LyricsHow can you stand there smiling
After all you've done
You know it seems to make you happy
When you've hurt someone
Twice before you fooled me
With your deceiving and lying
Come in and close the door
One more time, one more time
Yeah you've been gone so long
No one knows where
And you say that you still love me
Then show me you care
Because you got what it takes, sweet mama
To make a man feel fine
So I'll take the word of a liar
One more time, one more time

Girl you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Get burned every time
Yes I'm a fool for you baby I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time
Girl you've got me hungry
Losing my mind
I know I'm playing with fire
Get burned every time
Yes I'm a fool for you baby I can't deny
But I got to have your sweet love
One more time, one more time
Yes I'm her fool once more
I can read her brown eyes
But when the rooster crows tomorrow
Well its her turn to cry
I'm headed down that old road
She lost her free ride
So tonight I'll take what I paid for
One more time, one more time
One more timeEmbed
