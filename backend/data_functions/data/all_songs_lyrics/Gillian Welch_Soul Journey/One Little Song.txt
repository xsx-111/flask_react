One Little Song LyricsThere's gotta be a song left to sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of everything
One little song that ain't been sung
One little rag that ain't been wrung out completely yet
That's got a little left
One little drop of falling rain
One little chance to try again
One little bird that makes it home now and then
One little piece of endless sky
One little taste of cherry pie
One little week in paradise and I start thinking
There's gotta be a song left to sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of everything
One little note that ain't been used
One little word ain't been abused a thousand times
In a thousand rhymes
One little drop of falling rain
One little chance to try again
One little bird that makes it every now and then
One little piece of endless sky
One little taste of cherry pie
One little week in paradise and I start thinking
Gotta be a song left to sign
'Cause everybody can't have thought of everything
One little song that ain't been sung
One little rag that ain't been wrung out completely yet
'Til there's nothing leftEmbed
