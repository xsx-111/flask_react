I Made A Lovers Prayer LyricsI made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
Then watched the sky
Then wanted to cry
It's only you and I
And how I try
So, I made a lover's prayer
So, I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
Help me rise above
What I'm thinking of
Just a little more love
Just a little more love
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayer
I made a lover's prayerEmbed
