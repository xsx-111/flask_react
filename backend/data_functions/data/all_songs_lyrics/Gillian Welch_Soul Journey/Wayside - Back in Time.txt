Wayside / Back in Time LyricsStanding on the corner with a nickel or a dime
There used to be a rail car to take you down the line
Too much beer and whiskey to ever be employed
And when I got to Nashville, it was too much soldier's joy
Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the way
If I don't go tomorrow, you know I'm gone today
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Black highway all-night ride
Watching the times fall away to the side
Clear channel way down low
Is coming in loud and my mind let go
Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall
If I can't have you all the time, I won't have none at all
Oh, I wish I was in 'Frisco in a brand new pair of shoes
I'm sitting here in Nashville with Norman's Nashville blues
So come all you good time rounders listening to my sound
And then drink a round to Nashville before they tear it down
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Hard weather, driving slow
The buggies and the hats in town for the show
Oh darling, the songs they played
Are all I got left of the love we made
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine
Back, baby, back in time
I wanna go back when you were mine1Embed
