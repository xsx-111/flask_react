No One Knows My Name LyricsOh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
Oh, my mother was just a girl, seventeen
And my dad was passing through
Doing things a man will do
And my mother was just a girl, seventeen
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
And I have a life to claim
Though I really don't know my name
It's a wonder that I'm in this world at all
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But it's written up in the sky
And I'll see it by and by
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Well, I had a good mother and dad just the same
Well, I had a good mother and dad just the same
And they took me to their rest
And they surely stood the test
Yes, I had a good mother and dad, the same
Well, there ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Just another baby born
To a girl lost and lorn
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
And on the crowded street I see
A stranger's face that looks like me
Now and then, there's a lonesome thought in my mind
Well, there ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my name
But I'll see it by and by
'Cause it's written up in the sky
Ain't one soul in the whole world knows my nameEmbed
