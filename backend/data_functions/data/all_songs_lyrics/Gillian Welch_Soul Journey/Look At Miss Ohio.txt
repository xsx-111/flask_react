Look At Miss Ohio LyricsOh me oh my oh look at Miss Ohio
She’s a-running around with her ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"
Gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
Running around with the ragtop down
Yeah, I wanna do right, but not right now
Had your arm around her shoulder of a regimental soldier
And mamma starts pushing that wedding gown
Yeah, you wanna do right, but not right now
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio?
She’s a-running around with the ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"
I know all about it, so you don’t have to shout it
I’m gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right, but not right now
Oh me oh my oh, look at Miss Ohio
She a-running around with her ragtop down
She says "I wanna do right, but not right now"
Oh, I want do right, but not right nowEmbed
