Lowlands LyricsSaw a girl on the street from my home
Like a fire on the hillside she shone
And I knew right then that my best days were gone
And I'd been, been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long
This is not how it was at the start
There's a doubt and a blame in my heart
And it's no one else, no fault but my own
And I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too long
What is this weight in my mind
And what is this new sense of time
It's the open fields and the friends that are gone
And I've been in the lowlands too long
I can sing out at all sing a song
I can do nothing all the day long
But I can't do right and I know I'm wrong
And I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh I've been in the lowlands too long
Oh, I know, I know that I should go
And I've been in the lowlands too longEmbed
