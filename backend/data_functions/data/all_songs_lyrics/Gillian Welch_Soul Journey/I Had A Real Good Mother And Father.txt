I Had A Real Good Mother And Father LyricsI had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now they're in bright glory
And are sleeping on the savior's breast
They set a good example for me
And they taught me how to pray
Now I truly converted
And walking on the narrow way
I know that if I can not meet them on high
Then how lonely I will be
For what good is my journey
If I miss out on eternity
I had a real good mother and father
And they surely stood the test
And now they're in bright glory
And are sleeping on the savior's breastEmbed
