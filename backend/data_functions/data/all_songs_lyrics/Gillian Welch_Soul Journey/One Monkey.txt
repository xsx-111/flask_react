One Monkey LyricsOne monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
Here comes the freight train
Here comes the freight train
Here comes the freight train
So get on board
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
There is a purpose, a running keep
There is a captain with a steady wheel
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
Here comes the slow train
Here comes the slow train
Here comes the slow train
So get on board
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
She's at the station, running slow
Ready for leaving and she's gonna go
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
Here comes the freight train
Here comes the freight train
Here comes the freight train
So get on board
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
One monkey don't stop the show
So get on board
Here comes the freight train
Here comes the freight train
So get on boardEmbed
