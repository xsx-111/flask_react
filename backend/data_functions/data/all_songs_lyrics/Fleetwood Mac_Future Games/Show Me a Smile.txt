Show Me a Smile Lyrics
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me, my little child

Shine me a light from your eyes, dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy, show me a smile
Soon you'll be a man, my little one
So have fun while you can or there'll be none
Everything's going fast around you
There will be things to astound you
You'll be a man in your time, my little one

So take everything easy
Show me a smile
It doesn't take much to please me, my little child

Shine me a light from your eyes, dear
Don't let me see a single tear
Take everything easy
Show me a smile
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
