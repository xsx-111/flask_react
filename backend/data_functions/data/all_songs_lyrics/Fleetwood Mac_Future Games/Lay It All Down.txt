Lay It All Down Lyrics
Let me re-tell a story I know
About a man named Moses who lived long ago
He prophesied good, he prophesied bad
And now that prophecy's coming to pass

Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

A whole lot of people, including myself
Thought the story of Moses was just a tall tale
But all of the things that we see going on
Are just what Moses set down

Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth
Let me re-tell a story I know
About a man named Moses who lived long ago
He prophesied good, he prophesied bad
And now that prophecy's coming to pass

Let all your sons and your daughters
Of the golden calf
Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay it all down, for paradise here on earth

Lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I just can't imagine a reason for sorrow
Just can't imagine the hurt

You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down
You've got to lay it down

I said, lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
Lay down your burden of sorrow
There's just no reason to hurt
You've got to lay down your burden of sorrow
Lay down your burden of hurt
I said, lay it all down, for paradise here on earthEmbed
