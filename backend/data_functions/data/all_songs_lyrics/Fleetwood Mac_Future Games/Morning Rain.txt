Morning Rain Lyrics
Clear as the morning rain
Seeing it very plain
We've got to start again

What's that you do
What's that you say
There's no use complaining
It's the only way
There's no use feeling dissatisfied
Because how can you know until you've tried


Ever things going around in my head
The futures new and the past is dead
Pull out the stops, turn on the light
Because away from the darkness everything seems bright


Do do do do doEmbed
