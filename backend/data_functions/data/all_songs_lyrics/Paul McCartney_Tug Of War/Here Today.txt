Here Today Lyrics
And if I said I really knew you well
What would your answer be
If you were here today?
Ooh ooh ooh, here today

Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say that we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh, here today

But as for me, I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Ooh, ooh

What about the time we met? (What about the time we met?)
Well, I suppose that you could say that we were playing hard to get
Didn't understand a thing, but we could always sing
What about the night we cried? (What about the night we cried?)
Because there wasn't any reason left to keep it all inside
Never understood a word, but you were always there with a smile
And if I say I really loved you and was glad you came along
Then you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh
For you were in my song
Ooh ooh ooh, here today4Embed
