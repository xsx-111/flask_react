Somebody Who Cares Lyrics
When your body is coming apart at the seams
And the whole thing's feeling low
You're convincing yourself that there's nobody there, I know
I know how you feel

Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's annoying, not going to get very far, I know
But somebody cares

There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares

And if you don't know it, how will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feel

I know how you feel
Like somebody has taken the wheels off your car
When you had somewhere to go
Well it's frustrating, not going to get very far, I know
But somebody cares

There's always someone, somewhere
You should know by now
Always somebody who cares
It's happening day in, day out
Well you know by now
Always somebody who cares

And if you don't know it, how will it find you?
How will we know your whereabouts?
But I know how you feelEmbed
