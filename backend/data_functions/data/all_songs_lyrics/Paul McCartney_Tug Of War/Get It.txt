Get It Lyrics
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good

Once I had a little Spanish guitar
The neighbours told me I could go pretty far
Well I came and I went
And my guitar got bent
But I discovered that the people who love
Are what we need if we're to get up above it all
And that's that
Unless the world is flat

I want to get it mm mm
I want to get it just in case
It doesn't come around again
I want to get it mm mm
I want to get it and I wanna get it good

Pardon me if I've been misunderstood
I want to get it while the going is good
The telephone rang
About a song I sang
The life of Cadillac and ultra for sure
Is automatic for a lady demure
She came and she went
Without a single dent
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it good
(I get you
Go get)

Come on, let's get it mm mm
Come on, let's get it don't forget
It doesn't come around again
You've got to get it mm mm
You've got to get it and you've got to get it goodEmbed
