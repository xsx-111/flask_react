The Pound is Sinking Lyrics
The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appalling

The mark is holding, the franc is fading
The drachma's very weak, but everyone's still trading
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the strong are survivors

Well, I fear, my dear, that it's eminently clear
That you can't see the trees for the forest
Your father was an extraordinary man
But you don't seem to have inherited many of his mannerisms
Oh, any of his mannerisms

The dollar's moving, the ruble's rising
The yen is keeping up, which hardly seems surprising
The market's bottom has fallen right out
And only the stout are survivors

Hear me, my lover (Hear me lover)
I can't be held responsible now (Oh no, it wasn't me)
For something that didn't happen (I didn't do it anyway)
I knew you for a minute
Oh, it didn't happen only for a minute
Your heart just wasn't in it anymore
Mmm, hmm
The pound is sinking, the peso's falling
The lira's reeling and feeling quite appallingEmbed
