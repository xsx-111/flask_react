Ballroom Dancing Lyrics
Well, I used to smile when I was a pup
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup
With the recipe for a lovely day
Sticking out of my back pocket

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Then we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got what I got from ballroom dancing
Big B.D.

Well, I used to fly when I was a kid
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit
On a carpet ride to a foreign land
At the time of Davy Crockett

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Till we made it up in the ballroom
Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D.
...tell you the band is ready. We're starting with the first of five dancers in this competition: that's the cha-cha-cha!

Well, it went so fast and we all grew up
Now the days that passed in the china cup
Are the memories of another day
And I wouldn't want to knock it

But it wasn't always such a pretty sight
'Cause we used to fight like cats and dogs
Then we made it up in the ballroom

Ballroom dancing made a man of me
One, two, three, four
I just plain adore your ballroom dancing
Seen it on TV
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing
Big B.D.
