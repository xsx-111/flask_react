Year Zero Lyrics
Be a hero, kill your ego
It doesn't matter, it's all just a pack of lies
Build a new base, steal a new face
It doesn't matter it's all just to save you

We'll never fade away
We'll never fade away
I will stand my own ground
I will tear down myself, I won't fade

Year Zero, another hero
Is anybody alive here across the line?
Buy a new face, start a new race
It doesn't matter, it's all just to save your face
It's all just to save your face
It's all just to save you

We'll never fade away
We'll never fade away
I will stand my own ground
I will tear down myself, I won't fade
We'll never fade away
(We will never fade away)
We'll never fade away
(We will never fade away)Embed
