Anarchy in Tokyo (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Here, the moment of truth
It comes in the air
It's always the same, it's so insane
You cover your eyes
You fall inside
Before it begins it's over

Crash, crash, out of control
Lose yourself
Go and even the score
Crash, crash, out of control
Try and start a riot
Now you're beggin' for more

Anarchy in
Tokyo

They say the city is safe
The keepers of faith
The bullet is safe for one and day
Eclipsed by the one
Don't bother to run
The target is on your back, you're done
Crash, crash, out of control
Feed the source
Come join in the war
Crash, crash, out of control
Take it, break it
A million or more

We're outta control
We're outta control
We're outta control
We're outta control

Crash, crash, out of control
Feed the source
Come join in the war
Crash, crash, out of control
Take it, break it
A million or more

Anarchy in
Tokyo
Anarchy in
TokyoEmbed
