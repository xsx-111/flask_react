Welcome To The Universe Lyrics
And so the time has come, it's here
(It's here, it's here, it's here)
The silence ends
The change is near

You wait in the pallid slivered sky
Come into the pantheon

Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe

If there's a past into the clear
We better take the pace, erase this face
In constant search for everything

You wait in the pallid slivered sky
Come into the pantheon

Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe
Welcome to the universe
A new day has begunEmbed
