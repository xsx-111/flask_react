Buddha For Mary Lyrics
A simple fear to wash you away
An open mind canceled it today
A silent song that's in your words
A different taste that's in your mind
This is the life on Mars
This is the life on Mars

Mary was a different girl, had a thing for astronauts
Mary was the type of girl, she always liked to play a lot
Mary was a holy girl, father whet her appetite
Mary was the type of girl, she always liked to fall apart

Tell me did you see her face?
Tell me did you smell her taste?
Tell me what's the difference
Don't they all just look the same inside?

Buddha for Mary, here it comes!

Mary was an acrobat, but still she couldn't seem to breathe
Mary was becoming everything she didn't want to be
Mary would hallucinate and see the sky upon the wall
Mary was the type of girl she always liked to fly
Tell me did you see her face?
Tell me did you smell her taste?
Tell me what's the difference
Don't they all just look the same inside?

Buddha for Mary, here it comes!
Buddha for Mary, here it comes!

This is the life on Mars
This is the life on Mars
This is the life on Mars
This is the life
He said, "Can you hear me, are you sleeping?"
She said, "Will you rape me now?"
He said, "Leave the politics to mad men"
She said, "I believe your lies"
He said, "There's a paradise beneath me"
She said, "Am I supposed to bleed?"
He said, "You better pray to Jesus"
She said, "I don't believe in God"

Mary was a different girl, had a thing for astronauts
Mary was the type of girl, she always liked to play a lot
Mary was a holy girl, father whet her appetite
Mary was the type of girl, she always liked to fall apart
Buddha for Mary, here it comes!
Buddha for Mary, here it comes!
Buddha for Mary, here it comes!
Here it comes!1Embed
