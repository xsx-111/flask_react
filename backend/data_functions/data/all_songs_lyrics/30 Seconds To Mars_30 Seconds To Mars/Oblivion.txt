Oblivion Lyrics
The enemy arrives
Escape into the night
Everybody run now, everybody run now
Break into another time
This enemy of mine
Divinity defines
Everybody run now, everybody run now
Everybody run now, everybody run

Under the burning sun
I take a look around
Imagine if this all came down
I'm waiting for the day to come

Come with us to the ride
Join in the fight
Everybody run now, everybody run now
Break into another time
Unity divides
Division will unite
Everybody run now, everybody run now
Everybody run now, everybody run
Under the burning sun
I take a look around
Imagine if this all came down
I'm waiting for the day to come

A miracle is oh, so beautiful
Until it goes away

Under the burning sun
I take a look around
Imagine if this all came down
Under the burning sun
I take a look around
Imagine if this all came down
Under the burning sun
I take a look around
Imagine if this all came...Embed
