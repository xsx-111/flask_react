The Mission Lyrics
I open up my head inside
And find another person's mind
I'm gonna to take this chance I've got
I'm underlying as we speak
Hiding my face among the weak
Some say their day is on the way

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Into the wild
(Hey!)
Into the wild

On! My! Way!
(On my way)
See! The! Change!
(Rearrange into)

High above the serpentine
I cross below the well worn lines
Entangled in a missing memory
A violent oversight
A formless order will give rise
To something some new world is here to seize
Into the wild
Into the wild

I'm underwater breathing
This is not a dream
(Hey! Hey!)
Always talking 'bout the things my eyes have seen
(Hey! Hey!)
To find, suffer, and then someone who believes
(Hey! Hey!)
And try to find the reasons
Seeing what you mean

Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
And come here with me

On! My! Way!
(On my way)
See! The! Change!
(Rearrange)
Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me
Into the wild
I'm with a mission
Over the hill
Come here with me

Come here with me
Come here with me1Embed
