Capricorn (A Brand New Name) Lyrics
So I run and hide, tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name
And eyes that see into infinity

I will disappear
I told you once and I'll say it again
I want my message read clear
I'll show you the way, the way I'm going

So I run and hide, tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name
And eyes that see into infinity

I was almost there
Just a moment away from becoming unclear
Ever get the feeling you're gone
I'll show you the way, the way I'm going

So I run and hide, tear myself up
Start again with a brand new name
And eyes that see into infinity
Into infinity

So I run, start again
With a brand new name
With a brand new name

(So I run) So I run and hide, tear myself up
(Start again) Start again with a brand new name
(With a brand new name)
And eyes that see into infinity
(With a brand new name)
Into infinity

I will disappearEmbed
