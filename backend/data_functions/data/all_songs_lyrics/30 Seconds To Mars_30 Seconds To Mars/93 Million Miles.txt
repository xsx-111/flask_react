93 Million Miles Lyrics
Where does your garden grow?
Tell me the secrets that you know
Another time, another place
Where are the holy ones?
Selling the secret to the sun
Welcome to the Universe

Cross the line, redefine
Lose your mind, come crawl inside

Hey, hey!
What do you got?
Doesn't matter to me
Cause I don't want that
I'm not the only one

The unified divide among and then deny
Now could you kindly cut to the chase?
It's like some other song
Pretty, but something's always wrong
Show me the secret ancient sign
Cross the line, redefine
Lose your mind, come crawl inside

Hey, hey!
What do you got?
Doesn't matter to me
Cause I don't want that
I'm not the only one
Hey, hey!
What do you got?
Doesn't matter to me
Cause I don't want that
I'm not the only one

See, it's in your eyes
Come break me down
Come break me

Hey, hey!
What do you got?
Doesn't matter to me
Cause I don't want that
I'm not the only one
Hey, hey!
What do you got?
Doesn't matter to me
Cause I don't want that
I'm not the only one

Hey!
What do you got?1Embed
