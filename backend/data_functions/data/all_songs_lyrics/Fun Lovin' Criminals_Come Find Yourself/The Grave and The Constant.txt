The Grave and The Constant LyricsI used to wear dress blues, I used to get my cues from the dudes in
D.C. with the wing tip shoes
My boss said it was Parris or Prison, the judge said son you better
Make a decision
I chose the former because I heard it was warmer, April in Parris, hell
South of the border. They put me together, tougher than leather. Set
Me on your ass because they didn't know better
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on
I hold the fort left, right and center
The number running hardass punk, flygirl bender. Check the photo
Finish I'm in this to satisfy parole, not posing or playing the role
See I got more gumbas than Bobby De Niro and if I was you I'd
Act like Nixon and Spiro. So smoke your pot and drink your rock
And chill where it's shady. I got more endurance than In-A-Gadda-
Da-Vida baby
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it on
Up to no good, with no place to go but down. 
Getting it on to the grave spot, getting it onEmbed
