Coney Island Girl LyricsConey island girl
I know this ain't no time to be talking
Yo baby, I'll understand it if you keep on walking
It's not like I liked you anyway
It's the way that you swag it and sway
Reminds me of a girl I used to know back in the bay
Coney island girl
Now come here and don't get mad
I gave her all I thought I had
I must live my life alone and never kiss anyone else on the cyclone
As crazy as it seems
I'm having recurring dreams
You are not there, but she is
So now split
Coney island girl. (4x)Embed
