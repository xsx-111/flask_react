King Of New York Lyrics

Frankie was a mook from the block we used to live on
The wanna be the gangster
The wanna be the dapper Don, Don John
On the wall, an' said
"I'm your biggest fan next to my little brother Paul"
He's losing his grip, like Pesci, he'd flip
If you talk to his brother he says they always planned this trip
He wasn't okie-dokie running around like Don Quixote
Trying to free a man, he didn't even know B
He had the roots and he bought the suits
And the boys didn't like him to tell you the truth, yeah
He had "J.G." on his pinky ring
And he lied about doing some time up in Sing Sing
Flipped one fine Summer afternoon
He told his brother Pauli, "something had to be done soon"
He took Pauli and a couple of boys
And decked the Coupe de Ville to Illinois

La-di da-di, free John Gotti, la-di da-di, la-di
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the King of New York, the King of New York!
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, la-di da-di, la-di
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the King of New York, the King of New York!
He got a clipper from a stripper, he met at a club
Two sticks of dynamite, a .38 Snub
He went to see the Don, without an invitation
I-said-I'd-stay outside the gate with this three man demonstration
They was waving picket signs, and the C.O. saw a nine
And only Pauli got away with the skin on his behind
Back in the borough, the cops are acting thorough
They raided Frankie's room
That's when they saw his bureau (echo)
Upon it was a note, with a rhyme that was dope
About how he was breaking John out and how he couldn't cope
It said, "I don't fly coach, never save the roach...
The King of New York, The King of New York"
It said, "I don't fly coach, never save the roach...
The King of New York, The King of New York"
It said, "I never fly coach, never save the roach...
The King of New York, The King of New York"

La-di da-di, free John Gotti, la-di da-di, la-di
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the King of New York man, the King of New York!
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, la-di da-di, la-di
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the King of New York man, the King of New York!

La-di da-di, free John Gotti, la-di da-di, la-di
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the King of New York man, the King of New York!
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, la-di da-di, la-di
La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the King of New York man, the King of New York!

The King of New York!!
