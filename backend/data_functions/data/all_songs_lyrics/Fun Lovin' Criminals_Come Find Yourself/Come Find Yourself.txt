Come Find Yourself LyricsNow Hemlock five caught me out later on
It's the girl I told the man but he swore he'd prove me wrong
Not seeing as I saw it as I gazed at the skyline
Someone dropped a dime and someone took the time
Now I'm not a man with a grasp on reality
Kerouac is wack and I'm down with Dostoevsky
Sugar's got my back plus Baretta. 380's
One of which I dropped as the man tried to bait me
Come on, find yourself
Come on, find yourself
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
Now don't get it messed up, they got me all dressed up to feed me to the fishes
I use my mojo for the loco
I know the soft machine and it's goings ons and I'll be damned if the man's gonna spill me
You wanna see me go wild and crazy
I'm sorry man but your threats don't phase me
You covered the ground but you're lazy
Come on, come on, contest me
Come on, find yourself
Come on, find yourself
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you (Come on)
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you (Find yourself)
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you (Come on)
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you (Find yourself)
It's you, it's you, it's always been you and it's always been in you
It's you; it's you (Baby, baby) (A'ight)
Rush, be the man
Rush, be the man
Rush, be the man
Rush, be the manEmbed
