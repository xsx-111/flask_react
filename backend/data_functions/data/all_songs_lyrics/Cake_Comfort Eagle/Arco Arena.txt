Arco Arena Lyrics
Welcome to the Kings' palace
Arco Arena
Arco Arena
Why walk in circles?
Why walk in circles?
Why walk in circles when you can win?
Move your feet to the spirit of the ball
Move your feet to the spirit of the ball
Welcome to the Kings' palace
Arco Arena
Arco Arena
Crazy Train, daisy chain
People just getting lazy, complaining
Arco Arena
Arco Arena
The parking lot sparkles hot
Around the busy sports complex
Crazy Train, daisy chain
People just getting lazy, complaining
Arco Arena
