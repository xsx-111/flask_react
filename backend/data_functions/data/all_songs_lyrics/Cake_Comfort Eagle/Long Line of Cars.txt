Long Line of Cars LyricsThere's a long line of cars and they're trying to get through
There's no single explanation, there's no central destination
But this long line of cars is trying to get through
And this long line of cars is all because of you
We don't wonder where we're going or remember where we've been
We've gotta keep this traffic flowing and accept a little sin
So this long line of cars will never have an end
And this long line of cars keeps coming around the bend
From the streets of Sacramento to the freeways of L. A
We've gotta keep this fire burning and accept a little grey
So this long line of cars is trying to break free
And this long line of cars is all because of me
There's a long line of cars
Long, long, long line of cars
Long, long, long line of cars
Long, long, long line of cars1Embed
