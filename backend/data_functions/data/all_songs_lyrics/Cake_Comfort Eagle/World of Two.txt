World of Two Lyrics
I don't want to
Hear you whisper
I don't want to orbit
Your world

Of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two

I don't like to
Hang around you
I don't want to
Live in your world

Of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two

It's not that I don't like you
But it's not that I don't love you
It's not that I don't think you are
Two of the most
Perfectly
Beautiful
People in your world
In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two
There's only room for you
In your world of two
In your world of two
There's only room
There's only room
There's only room
For you1Embed
