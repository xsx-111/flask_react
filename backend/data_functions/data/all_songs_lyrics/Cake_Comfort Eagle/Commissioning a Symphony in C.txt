Commissioning a Symphony in C LyricsSo you'll be an Austrian nobleman
Commissioning a symphony in C
Which defies all earthly descriptions
You'll be commissioning a symphony in C
With money you squeezed from the peasants
To your nephew you can give it as a present
This magnificent symphony in C, you'll be
Commissioning a symphony in C
Completely filling the palace concert hall
It's warm and golden like an oven that's wide open
It has a melody both happy and sad
Built on victorious known triads
You've entered the room with great caution
Though no one in the hall is even watching
They are transfixed, they are forgetting just to breathe
They are so taken by your symphony, ah, in C
You're sitting there thinking your thoughts
They are not about what is but what is not
You're sitting there breathing in your breath
You are seldom breathing life, but mostly death
So you'll be an Austrian nobleman
Commissioning a symphony in C
Which defies all earthly descriptions
You'll be commissioning a symphony in CEmbed
