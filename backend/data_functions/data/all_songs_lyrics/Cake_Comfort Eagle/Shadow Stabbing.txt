Shadow Stabbing LyricsAdjectives on the typewriter
He moves his words like a prize fighter
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell
The man on the street might just as well be
The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be
Outside, outside the walls
Out there you don't hear the echoes and calls
But the steel eye, tight jaw
Say it all, say it all
But the white paint
Plastic saints
Say it all, say it all
Say it all, say it all, say it all, say it all
Say it all, Say it
Somebody has got to say it all
Somebody has got to say it all
I'm so nervous
I'm so tense
My heart can't forget about this self defense
The air is so hot
And my breath comes fast
I thumb the cool blade
But I know this can't last
(so nervous)
(so tense)
I thumb the cool blade
But I know this can't last
(so nervous)
(so tense)
Outside, outside the walls
Out there you don't hear the echoes and calls
But the steel eye, tight jaw
Say it all, say it all
But the white paint
Plastic saints
Say it all, say it all
Say it all, say it all, say it all, say it all
Say it all, say it
Somebody has got to say it all
Somebody has got to say it all
Adjectives on the typewriter
He moves his words like a prize fighter
The frenzied pace of the mind inside the cell
The man on the street might just as well be
The man on the street might just as well
The man on the street might just as well be...1Embed
