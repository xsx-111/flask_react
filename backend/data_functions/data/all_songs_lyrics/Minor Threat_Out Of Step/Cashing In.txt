Cashing In LyricsHow do you do, I don't figure we've met
My name is Ian, and I'm from Minor Threat
You know I tell them, usually, to be at their best
Catch me in town after every set
(Yeah, yeah)
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your shows
I've got some money, and I'm feeling fine
A couple of dollars, everything in time
Well you know, I'm gonna be all right
With the money I'm making off of YOU tonight
(Sucker!)
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your shows
(You know something?)
The trouble with money, is that I want more
So let's, let's raise the price at the door
How much tonight, three dollars or four?
You know we'll make a million when we go on tour
(Yeah, that's the way I've been thinking about it)
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your shows
(You know that's the way it is, man, it's dog-eat-dog, ha ha!)
I'm taking a walk on the yellow brick road
I only walk where the bricks are made of gold
My mind and body are the only things I've sold
I need a little money 'cause I'm getting old
(Well, that's the way it goes, isn't it? Yeah!)
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your shows
Yeah, you don't care and we don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your shows
That's the way it is in this world...right?
Ain't that right?
Boy, you had us pegged all along...damn!
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So where am I?
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So where am I?
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So where am I?
There's no place like home, right?
There's no place like home
So where am I?
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So where am I?Embed
