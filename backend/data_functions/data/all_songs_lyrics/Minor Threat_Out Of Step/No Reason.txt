No Reason Lyrics
So you hate me
That's the way it goes
What the fuck?
I guess I'll never know
If it makes you feel better
Then I guess it's just as good
You know I'll never accept it
'Cause I never thought you could

Sit in the same room
We look the other way
Fuck conversation
We've got nothing to say
I'm sure we both hate to be ignored
Haven't we met someplace before?

What's the problem?
Is it justified?
Or are we dealing
With our fucking pride?
Do you really want to leave it alone?
I don't know what it's worth to you
But it's all I fucking own
Sit in the same room
We look the other way
Fuck conversation
We've got nothing to say
I'm sure we both hate to be ignored
Haven't we met someplace before?

Excuse me
Haven't we met before?
Yeah, haven't we met before?
Haven't we met before? (x2)1Embed
