Betray Lyrics
Maybe it was no one's fault
I know it wasn't mine
But now that you've moved along
I guess I'm next in line
I thought we had the same ideas
But you, you proved me wrong
I've been played the fool before
But never for quite so long

Betray, Betray, Betray, Betray
Betray, Betray, Betray, Betray

So what now?
Do we shake hands and go our separate ways?
Or do I open my mind and follow you into the haze?
No, I'll see you tomorrow
Same channel, same time, same place
I'm not going anywhere 'cause I quit your fucking race

Goddamit, we were supposed to stay young
And now it's over, it's finished, it's done
No expectations, were on the run
But now it's over, it's finished, it's done
Over and done
The End1Embed
