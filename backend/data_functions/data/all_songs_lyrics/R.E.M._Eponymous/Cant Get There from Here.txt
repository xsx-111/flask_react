Cant Get There from Here Lyrics
When the world is a monster
Bad to swallow you whole
Kick the clay that holds the teeth in
Throw your trolls out the door
If you're needing inspiration
Philomath is where I go by dawn
Lawyer Jeff, he knows the lowdown
He's mighty bad to visit home

(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)

When your hands are feeling empty
Stick head jumping off the ground, ground
Tris is sure to shirr the deer out
Brother Ray can sing my song

(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here, here, here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Hands down, Calechee bound
Landlocked, kiss the ground
Dirt of seven continents going 'round and 'round
Go on ahead, Mr. Citywide, hypnotized, suit-and-tied
Gentlemen, testify

If your world is a monster
Bad to swallow you whole
Philomath, they know the lowdown
Throw your trolls out the door

(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Can't get there from here
(I've been there, I know the way)
Hmm... thank you, RayEmbed
