Talk About the Passion Lyrics
Empty prayer, empty mouths
Combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths
Talk about the passion
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world

Talk about the passion
Talk about the passion

Empty prayer, empty mouths
Combien reaction
Empty prayer, empty mouths
Talk about the passion

Talk about the passion
Talk about the passion

Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Not everyone can carry the weight of the world
Combien

Combien de temps?
Talk about the passion
Talk about the passion
Talk about the passion
