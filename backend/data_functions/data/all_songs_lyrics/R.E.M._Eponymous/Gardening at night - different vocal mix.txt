Gardening at night - different vocal mix LyricsI see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real
The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere
It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
The neighbors go to bed at ten
Call the prayer line for a change
The charge is changing every month
They said it couldn't be arranged
We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow
I see your money on the floor I felt the pocket change though all
The feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Your sister said that you're too young
She should know she's been there twice
The call was two and fifty-one
They said it couldn't be arranged
We echoed up the garbage sound but they were busy in the rows
We fell up not to see the sun gardening at night just didn't grow
The yard is nothing but a fence the sun just hurts my eyes somewhere
It must be time for penitence gardening at night it's never worked
Gardening at night
Gardening at night
Gardening at nightEmbed
