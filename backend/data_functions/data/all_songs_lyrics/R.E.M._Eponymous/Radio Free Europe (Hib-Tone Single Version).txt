Radio Free Europe (Hib-Tone Single Version) LyricsBeside yourself if radio's gonna stay
Reason, it could polish up the gray
Put that, put that, put that up your wall
That this isn't country at all
Ray beam station
Beside yourself
Keep me out of country in the word
Deal the porch is leading us absurd
Push that, push that, push that to the hull
That this isn't nothing at all
Straight off the boat
Where to go?
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe, radio
Beside defyin' media too fast
Instead of pushin' palaces to fall
Put that, put that, put that before all
That this isn't fortunate at all
Ray beam station
Beside yourself
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe, radio
Beside yourself
Callin' on a boat
Media's too fast
Keep me out of country in the word
Disappointers into us, absurd
Straight off the boat
Where to go?
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
Radio Free Europe
Callin' on in transit
Callin' on in transit
Radio Free Europe
