Finest Worksong (Mutual Drum Horn Mix) LyricsThe time to rise has been engaged
You're better best to rearrange
I'm talking here to me alone
I listen to the finest worksong
Your finest hour
Your finest hour
Another chance has been engaged
To throw Thoreau and rearrange
You are following this time
I beg you not beg to rhyme
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
Take your instinct by the reins
Better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
Take your instinct by the reins
You're better best to rearrange
What we want and what we need
Has been confused, been confused
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour
(Blow your horn)
Your finest hour1Embed
