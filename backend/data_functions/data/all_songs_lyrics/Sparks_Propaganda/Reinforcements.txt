Reinforcements LyricsI'm on guard again but unprepared to fend for myself in a battle
You won't tell me why the shrubbery moves
Or why there always has to be subterfusion
You won't even say "at ease"
After waging a costly siege
When a potentate ain't so potent in his state he summons help fast
Unilaterally I withdraw
What was peace is now a grand coup d'etat
The Purple Heart for valour please
And no heart for you Denise
Reinforcements, reinforcements
I could use a strong rear guard
Reinforcements, reinforcements
First the left flank, then the right
I'd sooner work the PX tonight
Spoken: You intercept my S.O.S in order that no
News of my distress will ever reach the
Homefront and about my camouflage
Well, it didn't work on you ... in fact most
Things they tell recruits never seem to do
Raise my rank if I should last another night so tortuous
Reinforcements, reinforcements
I don't want a tete-a-tete
Reinforcements, reinforcements
Let's reach accord, and ink a pact
Then, please dismiss your regimentEmbed
