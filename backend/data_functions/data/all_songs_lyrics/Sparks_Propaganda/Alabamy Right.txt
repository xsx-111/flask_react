Hustle it's nearly five, hustle it's nearly five
They're coming with coupons they're coming with kids
All hungry, pretty soon they'll need to be fed
And they'll Alabamy right around the register
It sure looks good to me
Alabamy milk and honey everywhere
They're scaling the mountains of frozen delights
There's been an avalanche on aisle number nine
And they'll Alabamy right around the register
It sure looks good to me
No need to go miles to Hollywood or pretend that you're celestial
There's no waiting now on check-stand number eighteen
Squeeze in between the lines
Hustle it's nearly five, hustle it's nearly five
This place plays no favorites by day or by night
It will not be offended if you buy light
Just so you Alabamy right around the register
It sure looks good to me
Alabamy milk and honey everywhere
It sure looks good to me
It sure looks good to me
It sure looks good to me
It sure looks good to me
It sure looks good to meEmbed
