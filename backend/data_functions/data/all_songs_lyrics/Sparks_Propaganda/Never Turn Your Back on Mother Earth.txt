Never Turn Your Back on Mother Earth LyricsWhen she's on her best behaviour
Don't be tempted by her favours
Never turn your back on Mother Earth
Towns are hurled from A to B
By hands that looked so smooth to me
Never turn your back on Mother Earth
Grasp at straws that don't want grasping
Gaze at clouds that come down crashing
Never turn your back on Mother Earth
Three days and two nights away from my friends
Amen to anything that brings a quick return
To my friends
To my friends
Never turn your back on Mother Earth
I'll admit I was unfaithful
But from now on I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on Mother
Never turn your back on Mother
Never turn your back on Mother EarthEmbed
