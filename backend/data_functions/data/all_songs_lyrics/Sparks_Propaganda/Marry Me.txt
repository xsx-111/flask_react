Marry Me LyricsSomeone to bring me out
Someone to let me in
Someone, someone...
And all the eager-beaver men come macho way their blues
They place themselves in place of me and face to face with you
And each pretend, you're loving him but that's not very true
Cause you're not acting, nor am I though I could use some proof
Marry me, marry me, what's the story
Though a thousand hungry people try to crash our story
But no one in this darkened world
Need ever know but I know
Marry me
A happily-ever-after does that seem to much to ask?
With trees and tots and stucco walls and fountains in the back
And lawns that you or I can mow and neighbours who will chat
About important issues and the state of this 'n that
Marry me, marry me...
Someone to bring me out
Someone to let me in
Someone to bring me joy
Somebody near me
Somebody near me
Somebody nearly me
The purple mountains majesty above the fruited plain
Is peeling off the wall of Lucky Miramar Motel
Marry me, marry me...
Someone to bring me out...
Marry me...Embed
