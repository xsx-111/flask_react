Bon Voyage LyricsClouds forming on the gospel sky, trouble is about to brew on us
It didn't matter that we tried, they can only take a few of us
The fins and the paws and hooves and feet
Saunter up the gangway
The randomest sampling is complete
God, could there be some way
That I could
Wear a hood
Or by the
Way I stood
Sneak aboard with you
Imitate
Imitate
Imitate
Imitate
They still know its you
Bon voyage, bon voyage, bon voyage, peace be with all of you
I wish that I, I wish that I, were one of you
Tears falling on the sloping sand, they're about to leave and we will stay
All governed by the rules of chance, they're about to leave and we will stay
Goodbye to my lucky friends and foes, glad that we could know you
Everyone sends their last hello, I wish that we could join you
Two of you
Two of them
Two of those
Two of them
Safety for the few
Two of you
Two of them
Two of those
Two of them
They will start anew
Bon voyage, bon voyage, bon voyage peace be with all of you
I wish that I, I wish that I, I wish that I?
Bickering
Dickering
Bickering
Dickering
Everything that moves
Bickering
Dickering
Bickering
Dickering
Final, futile moves
Bon voyage, bon voyage, bon voyage, peace be with all of you
I wish that I, I wish that I, I wish that I?Embed
