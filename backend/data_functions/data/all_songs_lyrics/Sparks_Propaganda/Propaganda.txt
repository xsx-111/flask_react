Propaganda Lyrics"Hello soldier boy," oh boy, she's spewing out her
Propaganda, propaganda
Might makes right, though you are wrong
You're right to fight her
Propaganda, propaganda, propaganda
"Come to our side," she does say
"Come on over," she does say
Well I don't need more
Competition for
Her affection
You should fight on
Fight on
Over thereEmbed
