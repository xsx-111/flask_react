California Dreaming Lyrics
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've went for a walk—yes, I did
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I were in L.A
California dreamin'
On a winter's day

Went to the church—yes, I did
I stopped along the way
Oh! I fell down on my knees
I began to pray
You know, the preacher dig the cold
'Cause he know I'm gonna stay—I'm gonna stay, I told him so
California dreamin'
Oh, unlet

Ohhh!
Somebody, help me now
Gotta go so bad—yeah
Oh!
Alll the leaves are brown
Sky is gray
Went for a walk
On a winter's day
Oh! I'll be safe and warm
If I were in L.A
California dreamin'
On such a winter day, oh, yeah
Such a winter's day, mhm
Such a winter's day

Hey
Hey
Oh, yeah!
California dreamin'
Gotta get some sunshine
'Fore I blow my mind
Oh, gotta get to L.A
Where the folks and the sun shine every day
Oh!
I said
California dreamin'
I'm dreamin'
I'm dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'Embed
