Every Boy and Girl LyricsEvery boy and every girl needs a love like mine
I was sick in my room
One day in the afternoon
My baby came in to me
She said: Lee, I'm gonna ease your misery
She said: Honey don't you worry
Let me tell you this:
She sit by me
And call me sweet names
She say all the sweet words
A man likes to hear
I tell ya, the sweet things
She do 'bout me
Oh every boy and every girl needs a love like mine
Oh one of these days
I'm gonna shake her hand
And tell her how proud I am to be
The one and only man
And I say this: Honey don't you worry
That I'm gonna send out
Call you sweetin' names
And tell her all the things
A woman likes to hear
The sweet thing
Oh she do for me
I tell you, baby
Every boy and every girl needs a love like
Every boy and every girl needs a love like
I just want the whole wide world to know
Every boy and every girl needs a love like mineEmbed
