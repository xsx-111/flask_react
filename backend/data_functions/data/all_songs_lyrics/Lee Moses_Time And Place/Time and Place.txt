Time and Place Lyrics
Mmm-mmmmmm-mmm-mm
Aw, yeah
We've got to share our love in secrecy
Nobody must know about you and me
We can't take too much liberty
Until the time he sets you free—and I gots to tell you
No matter when, no matter where
Just name the time and I'll be there (I'll be right there)
We can't go to a million places
We can't be around a million faces
We're this chance oh, this I know
But I don't mind it baby 'cause I love you so, ah yeah
No matter when, no matter where
You just name the time and I'll be there (I'll be right there)
(now) If you've got the nerve to slip away
Then I've got the nerve to meet you wherever you say
We'll be taking a chance, this I know
But I don't mind it baby 'cause I love you so—and I gots to tell you
No matter when, no matter where
Ahhh name the time and I'll be right there, oh yes I will
I'll be right there
I'm gonna hold you, I'm gonna squeeze you
(no matter when) No matter when
(no matter where) No matter where
(no matter when) I'm gonna hold you baby
(no matter where) If it takes a train
(no matter when) If it takes a plane
(no matter where) No matter how I get there babyEmbed
