Adorable One LyricsBehind every good man there's a woman
Every man have his own way of expressing the way he feel about this woman
I like to tell the world today just how I feel about the woman I love
I can say you are my adorable one
Talking to you people everywhere
I can say you are my adorable one
Oh yes you are
Listen, you are a dream beyond compare
You are the answer to my prayer
That's why I can say I want the whole world to know that you're mine
Oh yes you are
Yes you are my adorable one
Another thing I want you to know
There will be no tomorrow if we part
I believe this with all my heart
I said there will be no tomorrow if we part
Oh don't ever leave me baby
Please be fair
Please be true
All my life depends on you
That's why I can say
That I know you're my adorable one
Please be fair
Woman won't you please be true
Can't you see that my life depends on you
I like to tell the whole world
I know you're mineEmbed
