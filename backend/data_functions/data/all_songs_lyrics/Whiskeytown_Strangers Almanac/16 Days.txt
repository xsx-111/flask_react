16 Days LyricsI got sixteen days
One for every time I've gone away
One for every time I should have stayed
Shoulda wore my wedding ring
I got sixteen days
Fifteen of those are nights
Can't sleep when the bed sheet fights
Its way back to your side
Well the ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
The ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
Away from you, away from you, away
Well the ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
Well the ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
Away from you, away from you, away
I got sixteen days
Got a bible and a rosary
God, I wish that you were close to me
Guess I owe you an apology
I got sixteen days
Fifteen of those are nights
Can't sleep when the bed sheet fights
It's way back to your side
Well the ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
Well the ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
Away from you, away from you, away
Well the ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
The ghost has got me running (ghost has got me running)
Away from you, away from you, away
Old tin cups, little paper dolls
All wrapped up, in ribbons, bows, and hearts
Old tin cups, and little paper dolls
All wrapped up, in the ribbons of your heart
I got sixteen days
Sixteen days
I got sixteen days
It's like before I hangEmbed
