Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight Lyrics
One, two, three, four

Well, excuse me if I break my own heart
It was mine from the finish I guess
It was mine from the start
The situation just don't seem so God damn smart
The situation is tearing me apart
So you'll have to excuse me if I break my own heart

Well, excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
Some things aren't born too strong
They have to learn how to fight
The situation keeps me drinking every God damn day and night
The situation don't seem so right

So excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
Well, excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
After all it was mine, after all it was mine
After all it was mine
Can I have it back sometime?

So if the rain falls down on your Mississippi town
Let your eyes drift easy into mine
If the rain falls down on your Mississippi town
Let your eyes drift into mine
You're on the road, but your diary entry reads blank
(it reads blank)
Is this some sort of joke to you?
Is this some sort of joke to you?
Well, excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
Well, excuse me if I break my own heart tonight
After all it was mine, after all it was mine
After all it was mine
Can I have it back sometime?3Embed
