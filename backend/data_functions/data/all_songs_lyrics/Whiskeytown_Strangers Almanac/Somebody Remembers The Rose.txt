Somebody Remembers The Rose LyricsSomebody remembers the rose
While the other forgets how it grows
What are the dangers
What are the dangers of love
I'm still a stranger
Somebody remembers the dress
How it was handsome, beautifully pressed
What are the dangers
What are the dangers of love
I'm still a stranger
Honey, I'm out of service for a while
Damage hearts been manufactured
And every day this one never works anyway
Somebody remembers the rose
While the other forgets how it grows
What are the dangers
What are the dangers of love
I'm still a stranger
Honey, I know you make me high
Know you, yet I know youEmbed
