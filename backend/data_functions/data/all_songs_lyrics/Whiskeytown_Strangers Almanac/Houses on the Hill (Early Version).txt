Houses on the Hill (Early Version) LyricsWell, I found a bunch of letters
They were written for the fellow
Who broke your momma's heart
And the envelope folds smelled of her ancient perfume
I'll bet she didn't know
How to respond before the blankets of snow
Caught him out wandering alone
With no place to go
There were stars in the sky
There were houses on the hill
There were bottles and pills
That were easy to buy to keep her warm
From the oncoming storm
Well, I found them in the northwest corner of the attic
In a box labeled "Tinsel and Lights"
Didn't know what I was looking for
Maybe just a blanket or artifacts
Eisenhower sent him to war
He kept her picture in his pocket that was closest to his heart
And when he hit shore
It must have been a target
For the gun-men
There were stars in the sky
There were bunkers on the hill
And there were caskets to fill where he would lie
Shrouded in the red, white & blue with the stripes
There were stars in the sky
There were houses on the hill
There were bottles and pills
That were easy to buy to keep her warm
From the oncoming stormEmbed
