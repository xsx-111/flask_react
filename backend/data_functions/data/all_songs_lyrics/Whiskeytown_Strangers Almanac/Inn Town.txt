Inn Town LyricsParking lot, movie screen. I can't feel anything
Cigarette, beat up TV, I can't feel anything
Now that I'm
I'm in town
I feel fine
Fine for now
Hang around with the people I used to be
Hang around on a corner waiting to go, have a seat
Now that I'm
I'm in town
I feel fine
Fine for now
Fifty cents, or a dollar three
I don't owe you anything
Spent a life on a heart
That would rather not feel anything
I can try. I can see
I can want it to be
I can laugh. I can feel
I can't see anything without dreaming
Now that I'm
I'm in town
Hang around with the people we used to be
We hang around on a corner waiting, to go have a seat
I can try. I can see
I can want it to be
I can laugh. I can feel
I can't say anything that seems real
It's just like a dream
I can feel
I can laugh
I can want it to still be real
Its a dream
I've had, its the last, now it seems
Now that I'm
I'm in town
I feel fine
Fine for now
Now that I'm
I'm in town
Now that I'm
I'm in townEmbed
