Oh, beautiful Lana
I told it my mama
And my dad
What I had
Was the sweetest
And the neatest
Little girl
In the world
Oh La-La-La-La Lana

Hey Hey Lana

O- Oh Lana
Don't make me blue
O- Oh Lana
Don't you know
Don't you know
I love you

Oh beautiful Lana
Don't you know that I wanna
Hug and kiss you
Let you know that I miss you
While we're apart
Oh my heart
All it can say is
