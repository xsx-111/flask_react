Wedding Day LyricsWonder how long it will take
For this heart of mine to break
There's I watch you walk away
This was to be our wedding day
I won't hear the choir sing
While I hold your golden ring
Might as well throw it away
With my dreams of wedding day
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh to hold you in my arms again
I watched my whole world fade away
On this our wedding day
Who was right and who was wrong
Makes no difference when you're all alone
As I watch you walk away
Goodbye darling, goodbye wedding dayEmbed
