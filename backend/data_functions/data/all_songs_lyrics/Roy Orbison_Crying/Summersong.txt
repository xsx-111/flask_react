Summersong LyricsOur summersong
Lingers on in my memory
Since you've
Been gone from me
Summer's come again
And again I'm alone
Wish you were near
When I hear our summersong
Our summersong lives on and on and on
Inside of me
And it will, yes until
You return to me
Oh, when the leaves
Fall away from the trees
I'll still be blue
All winter long
And I'll sing our summersong
And dream of you
I'll sing our summersong
And dream of youEmbed
