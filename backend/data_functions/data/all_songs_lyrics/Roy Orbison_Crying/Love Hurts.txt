Love Hurts LyricsLove hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart not tough
Nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts
Love hurts
I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves, I guess
But they're not foolin' me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie made to make you blue
Love hurts
Love hurts
Love hurts
