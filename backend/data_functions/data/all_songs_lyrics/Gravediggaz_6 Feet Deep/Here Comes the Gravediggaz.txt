Here Comes the Gravediggaz Lyrics
You gotta keep saying it
Say Gravediggaz, Gravediggaz
Come on say it with me, come on
Gravediggaz, come on
Gravy, yeah, uh huh

You don't pull on Superman's cape
You don't spit into the wind
You don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger
And you can't fuck with me and my men - so check it out

Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)

Low billed competition ain't shit
Fakin' the funk like silicone tits
Never on the level of the skill of a champion
Foes are like the Buffalo Bills
They come close but can't win, or do a damn thing, huh!
I'm Merciless like Ming
As I get the wreck off, I navigate a course like Chekov
Soft MCs—you better step off
Will a villain ever learn? I'm killin' like a mad germ
I burn MCs like a bad perm
Do not turn, 'cause I got you on my infrared
Wimps are dead, I pop 'em like a pimple's head
I get up and get down like I was gravity
Cause pains like cavity, then collect a salary
Foes with little or no skills, I kill 'em
My shows are ill, I'm makin' a mountain out of a molehill
Chill! Or your ass'll be tooken fast
Lost in the style like Alice in the looking glass
You wanna see the Grym get raw?
Aiyo, I bust ya whole shit, Señor!
My style's gravy, rough and real
Reds up the rugged on my Gravedigga shield
That's how I deal with the fake frauds
I flow hard, y'all hearthrobs'll get robbed
I come with the wicked one stompin' tons
I'm under the ground as I wreck your town
Clock my boat to hell as we dwell
To a ludicrous lunar eclipse, no two exit
I radiate gamma rays at random, I slam 'em
Yo, quick fast like The Phantom
Guard my gate with a passed down cape
You wanna escape and now ain't no one safe
Check it, as I hit you with a boom from the trigger

Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)

I learned to burn rap germs like antiseptics
Then release a piece of music lyric epic
Words like proverbs—blended, braided
Strong like a psalm or song from King David
Potentially vital, holy as The Bible
Can't allow you to worship the false idols
New form of literature, dance to the fiddler
Don't mean to riddle you, God, I'm not The Riddler
Don't shoot for the moon, no, wait for high noon
While the others face doom, I be entombed
I don't squawk like a hawk or stalk like a stork
But walk in New York, stay away from pork
Rhymes are my passion, don't need the hassle
Slingin' everything cause I'm king of the castle
Niggas gettin' boggled, you squeak and squabble
Gravediggaz got the paperback novel
So line-by-line you should read, take heed
Or you'll bleed and bleed and bleed and bleed
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)
(Pray for your mommy)
(Pray for your mommy)
(Pray for your mommy)
(Pray for your mommy)
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
Yah! Here come the Gravediggaz!
(Pray for your mommy)2Embed
