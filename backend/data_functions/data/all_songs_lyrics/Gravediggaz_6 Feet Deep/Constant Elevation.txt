Constant Elevation Lyrics
Beware! Four figures appear through the fog
Yeah, Gravediggaz cut like sword... AHHHHHH
Fear makes ya brain go numb
You ain’t got a clue where the gods come from
I told myself to exist and then I fled
Over millions of sperm cells and I found the egg
No luck or mere chance
I came to enhance, represent and get open as a vent

Psyyychopaaaaathic, a deep thoracic
Gravediggaz have mastered puttin' niggas in caskets
Blowin' like the wind, when I’m in my spin
You got fucked, cross the path of the twister
You face the storm and bring it on
And get chopped in the blocks from Hitchcock
The Birds, my mental ward is my brainstorm
Somehow I flipped and came equipped with a chainsaw

Makin' gravy pays my rent for the day
Some hate the image that I must portray
Critics say, "Go to Hell", I go, "Yeah
Stupid motherfucker, I’m already here"
Frustrated, mentally aggravated
To be the rebel that society created
I’m good most times but when I’m foul, then I’m flagrant
Livin' in the shadows like a government agent
I'mmmmm one side of the story
Shit cooked up from Gravediggaz laboratory
Transferrin' brains with remains of a slug
Let The Undertaker make the beats that’s buuugged
Path we're creatin', splittin' genes
Choppin' necks with the fat guillotines
I’m your nightmare, fright with the worst
One verse will put ya ass in my black hearse

RZAreeeector! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!
Woohooo, hooah, hooah, hoo!
Danger, enter the Graveyard Chamber
It’s like someone diggin' inside your ear with a hanger
I inject my poisonous stinger to your finger
Of all your life forces, I’ll drain ya
I’m blood thirsty, thirsty for sure
About to blood-suck the same ones who blood-suck the poor
You’re not safe anymore
To all the holy spooks, I declare war
I’ll grave-dig them up from Hell, RZArect 'em
From the poisonous worms of swine, I disinfect 'em
Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation
Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation
Out of the darkness
Out of the deep of the darkness
Lies the Gravediggaz
From the parts unknown
The world that’s unknown
People fear what they don’t understand
So, this is why we’re here
To explain that there’s nothin' to be afraid of
Have no fear, Gravediggaz are here1Embed
