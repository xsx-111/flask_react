2 Cups of Blood Lyrics
Ayo, Reaper, those kids out there say you're mad thirsty
You got somethin' for them to drink?
Yo we can wet up two cups of blood

Arm to the leg-leg, arm to the head
Yo, be the RZArector, resurrect the mental dead
G to the R to the Y-M-Reaper
As I get deeper than a crypt, resurrect, kid
Don't go against the grain, mad slang is my thang
I leave the hearty party with a bang
Buzza boom! Check my tune, it gotcha hyper
Don't give a fuck about a sucker C-cipher
As you decipher the tricks of a viper
Swine is lethal, ****** is evil!
I am original, we can build upon
The ill form, and keep all your brain cells warm
Hocus pocus, yo! What's the focus?
Weak techniques you speak, the shit is bogus
Even in a mortuary, science will bloom
As I seek the knowl' from the womb to the tomb
(Tomb, tomb, tomb, tomb, tomb)
Yo! Deadly, deadly, ya-ah! Get ready
Here come the styler, wilder than Freddy
(Dead) 'Cause a Krueger, boom, I do ya
Just to let ya know Gravediggaz comin' to ya
Dead stinkin' rotten, your braincells forgotten
The past, you had your bumba raas pickin' cotton
Now ya hate ya knotty hairstyles
I guess you figure the texture is too wild, child
Two cups of blood, boy
Two cups of blood, girl
Alright, drink that shit upEmbed
