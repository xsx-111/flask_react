Diary of a Madman Lyrics
​​​They killed my baby, oh God, they killed my baby
Order in the court, order in the court
​​I will make you pay for this you murderers
I said order in the court now!
Now, before this court passes judgement
Will the four defendants please rise and approach the bench
Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the insanity plea
Oh yeah, don't forget my retainer balance
Okay, I understand you guys are pleading insanity, claiming
Demonic spirits possessed you to do these hideous murders
(Yeah, word)
Can you please explain to this court how these so-called spirits made you into these raving madmen

Be a witness as I exercise my exorcism
The evil that lurks within the sin, the terrorism
Possessed by evil spirits, voices from the dead
I come forth with Gravediggaz and a head full of dread
I've been examined ever since I was semen
They took a sonogram and seen the image of a demon
At birth, nurses surrounded me with needles
And drugged me all up with the diseases of evil
Grew up in Hell, now I dwell in an Islamic temple
I’m fightin' a holy war in the mental
Look deep in my eyes, you'll see visions of death
Possessed by homicide is what I am obsessed
Givin' niggas brain dimples
Draggin' their asses on my hook by their temples
The cause of death is unknown to the cops
'Cause when I kill 'em, I’m not leavin' one element to autopse
First I'll assassinate him, and then I'll cremate him
Then take all of his fuckin' ashes and evaporate him
Or creep through the graveyard and hunt down your tombstone
Dig up your skeleton and stomp all your fuckin' bones
You try to haunt me, nigga? I ain't tryna hear it
Buck! Buck! Buck! I'll give your ass a holy spirit
Stressful, try to avoid all my impure thoughts, I am losing my mind
And it seems I don’t know what’s true or dream
Can you please explain to the court
When these problems first began?

The year '84, November, day 10
Overwhelmed by the wicked inspirations of an evil jinn
I realize my ideas have spawned
For 400 years of blood sweat and tears
I saw the torture, brutal murder of my father
So my brain became stained with the horror
I'm havin' reoccurring nightmares
Of bein' soakin' wet, strapped down to the electric chair
I got tackled with handcuffs and shackled and restraint
In the bottom of a holy tabernacle
They gave me nothin' to eat for two weeks
And sewed my eye lids open so I couldn't sleep
About to die from thirst, that's when the minister
Quenched my jaws with a cold glass of vinegar
Upon my wounds, they seasoned me with salt
And nailed my hands and feet to the form of a cross
Ahh!! I cry as the blood dripped inside of my eye
Refusing to die
Visions of Hell tormented my fate
So I chewed my fuckin' arm off and made an escape
(Your arm?! No way, goddammit)
(Oh no, me mataron mi amigo, hijo de la gran puta
Esos cogines me mataron mi amigo que voy a cerca carajo, cono)
[Calm down, people, please calm down
Let us please proceed with the defendant's explanation]

Enter the realms of understanding
And take good heed or you could bleed while I’m scannin'
Three stages of pure Hell, 16 pages of red cells
*Shh* Rain drops hits the pails
Path is dull and narrow, you're stalked by a shadow
I'll pierce your skull with the fucking arrow
So narrow, only one could enter at a time
Stuck in the center, read the signs
A thousand doors to choose, you better hurry
Don’t stop, shit is getting hot as a pot of curry
On your right side there’s fire, your left, deep waters
Watch your step, it's deep waters
What's that comin' through the floor? It's a claw
*pssh* Took his fuckin' ass to the fuckin' core

Ahhhh! Stroll through the dark conditions
I stone ya till I see sparks of friction
I chop ya like a coal miner
Then combine the drug and mix it with your blood
Some more, I give you some more and watch you crawl
Guts hit the floor, worms exit your pores
I trick ya, ha, then I'm quick to syringe
Deep between my thoughts then bust out your skin
You scream, portraits of inflictable pain, you can't stand
You're up to your hands in quicksand
You're sinking and sinking deep into the earth
Thoughts was possessed since the first day of birth
My mental says it's my turn to possess the matter
Stab you with a dagger of Jacob's ladder
Thoughts become shattered, confused and tragic
Fiery thoughts of Gravediggaz..

Guilty, next case4Embed
