6 Feet Deep Lyrics
Sup, this is the Gravedigga jam session (Add a little riff)
What's today's date? (Today's the 20th) (Friday)
The 20th of May, 1994
We chillin' in GLC studios
And we gonna go like this
Got my man BB Frukwan (look at the riff)

G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep

I floss my teeth on a gospel track
I'm not an apostle, but I bring the axe to ya back
I chew and attack, like Crest on plaque
After that, your world is black
You drop into a hole
Your mold separates from your soul
Behold, the Gravediggaz told you 'Beware!'
But you didn't listen
So now we appear, eardrums glisten, ha ha
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep

When I wreck, I commence to detect
Ready to dissect, so come step alive and die
Next murder is mayhem
Diggin' graves is a regular
Treach-orous mangler
Tha Boston Strangler
Heated and trapped in a fury of hate
Daredevil, the rhyme rebel, my art terminates
Subduin' and pul-ver-i-zin' ya head
You bled, fell dead, and your tomb-stone read
Rza-to-the-recta, Grym-to-the-reap
Unda-to-the-taker, Gate-to-the-keep
Creepin' thru tha ghettos and the slums and streets
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet
Darkness shall fall upon y'all
Who slept on the styles that crept through the door
The grave, behave, we come to save
So don't be afraid of the dark
We spark like light in night
Excite, excite is right, is right
Come follow the light
And see what I see and be what I be
Tha G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V... E

G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep

In the mind, I come with the sparks from the attic
Yet psychopathic brain tracks is tragic
Twist liftin' wrist like riff of a Taurus
Deep in tha forest, I slay for tha porridge
Yet it's cold, ya die slow like a tortoise
Deep in my chorus, ya result Diggamortis
Let me see, I'm castin' disease
Contrary, yet some fairy 'cause ya bleed
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep

Demonic, the sonnet is bangin' like chronic
And niggas be Audi faster than Sonic
Bubonic, plutonic, ya best to hop on it
Beats bein' programmed - ASR Ensoniq
Styles compiled for miles and childs
Bodies in aisles and upside-down smiles
Deflect, catch wreck from sun-moon sect
Larynx shines light then thought reflects

G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep
G-to-the-R-to-the-A-to-the-V
E-to-the-D-to-the-I-to-the-G
G-to-the-A-to-the-zig-zag-Z
Gravedigga, nigga, 6 feet deep

I came on the scene in a wheel that Ezekiel seen
To exploit your flaws like Philistines
Look in the sky, oh my, it is I
No alibi, so don't even try to feed me swine
And Grymreaper's mind is so refined
I'm deep, I'm deep, I'm deep
As a hill or a cliff or a steep
Incline at the bottom of an ocean reef4Embed
