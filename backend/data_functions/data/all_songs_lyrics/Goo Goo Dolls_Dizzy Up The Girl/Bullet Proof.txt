Bullet Proof Lyrics
Do you listen to yourself?
Never live for someone else
Do you like the way you feel?
Nothing hurts when no one's real
She wants to shake this scene
Yeah, she wants to shake with me
She's not looking for the holes in all their lies

I want to bullet proof your soul
Would you like to lose control?
I won't let you fall until you tell me so

What are we?
(What you want to be?)
Everything
(That you want to be)
All I need
(Right in front of me)
I've know before

Would you come my way
Or did you burn out to the end?
Would you come my way
Should have listened when you called my name
Yeah, she wants to tear you down
And she leaves without a sound
It's like falling backwards into no one's arms


 

Should have listened when you called my name 1Embed
