Blues in the Bottle Lyrics
Blues in the bottle, blues in the bottle
Where do you think you're at, pretty mama?
Blues in the bottle, where do you think you're at?
Well, you kicked my dog
And now you drowned my cat

I'm goin' to Speonk bull race, I'm goin' to Speonk bull race
To see my bullies run, pretty mama
I'm goin' to Speonk bull race to see my bullies run
If I win a prize
I'll give my baby some


Well, I'm goin' to Sillyputty, and I'm goin' to Sillyputty
And I'm sorry but I can't take you, pretty mama
I'm goin' to Sillyputty, sorry but I can't take you
Well, I don't want no woman
Who goes around sniffin' glueEmbed
