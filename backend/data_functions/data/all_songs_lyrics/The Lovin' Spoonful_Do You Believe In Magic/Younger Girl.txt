Younger Girl Lyrics
She's one of those girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you forget everything
You had ready to say
And I saw her today, yeah
A younger girl keeps rollin' 'cross my mind

No matter how much I try
I can't seem to leave her mem'ry behind
I remember her eyes, soft, dark and brown
Said she'd never been in trouble even in town
A younger girl keeps rollin' 'cross my mind

No matter how much I try
I can't seem to leave her mem'ry behind
A younger girl keeps rollin' 'cross my mind

And should I hang around actin' like her brother?
In a few more years they'd call us right for each other
And why?
If I wait I'll just die, yeah
A younger girl keeps rollin' 'cross my mind
No matter how much I try
I can't seem to leave her mem'ry behind
I remember her eyes, soft, dark and brown
Said she'd never been in trouble even in town
A younger girl keeps rollin' 'cross my mind

She's one of these girls who seems to come in the spring
One look in her eyes and you forget everything
You had ready to sayEmbed
