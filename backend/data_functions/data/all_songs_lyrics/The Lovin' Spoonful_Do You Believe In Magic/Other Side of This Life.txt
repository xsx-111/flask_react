Other Side of This Life Lyrics
Would you like to know a secret?
Just between you and me
I don't know where I'm goin' next
Don't know where I'm gonna be

And there's another side to this life I've been livin'
And there's another side to this life

Maybe I'll go to Nashville
Way down to Tennessee
This ten-cent life I've been livin' in the city
Ain't worth a dime to me

And there's another side to this life I've been livin'
And there's another side to this life


And there's another side to this life I've been livin'
And there's another side to this life
The whole world's in an uproar
My own world's upside down
I don't know where I'm goin' next
Maybe just keep on bummin' 'round

And there's another side to this life I've been livin'
And there's another side to this life

And there's another side to this life I've been livin'
And there's another side to this lifeEmbed
