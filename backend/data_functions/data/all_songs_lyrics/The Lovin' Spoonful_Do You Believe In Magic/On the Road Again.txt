On the Road Again Lyrics
I woke up this mornin', looked around my four walls
And a dream told me, "You ain't happy at all"
I packed up my bags, I took my last look and then
Look out, pretty momma, I'm on the road again

I'm on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
I'm on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Look out, pretty momma, I'm on the road again

I ran home last night to get my dinner hot
I pulled on the door but found the door was locked
And I jumped through my window and believe it or not
She had not even put my dinner into the pot

I'm on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Yeah, I'm on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Look out, pretty momma, I'm on the road again
Bye, baby!

I've never been evil, I've never been sly
But if I sit some place and let the time roll by
I start to get restless, pack my bags up and then
Look out, pretty momma, I'm on the road again

I'm on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Yeah, I'm on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Look out, pretty momma, I'm on the road againEmbed
