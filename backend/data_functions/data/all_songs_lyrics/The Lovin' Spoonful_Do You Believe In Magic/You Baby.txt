You Baby Lyrics
You know I've been wantin' you
My whole life through
And now that I'm your guy
I'm gonna live and die
For only you

Baby, baby, now you're gonna know
All the ways I plan to thrill you so
You're gonna see
I'll save all the love in me

Just for you (you), baby
You (you), baby
You (you), baby
Only you
Whoa-oh, only you

Could've made me wait this long
Wantin' your kiss
And now you're really mine
I'll make up all the time
You've made us miss
Baby, baby, now that it's alright
I'm gonna hug and kiss you ev'ry night
You're gonna see
There's a lifetime of love in me

Just for you (you), baby
You (you), baby
You (you), baby
Only you
Whoa-oh, only you


Baby, baby, now that it's alright
I'm gonna hug and kiss you ev'ry night
You're gonna see
I'll save all the love in me

Just for you (you), baby
You (you), baby
You (you), baby
Only you
Whoa-oh, only you
You (you), baby
You (you), baby
You (you), baby
Only you
Whoa-oh, only youEmbed
