My Gal Lyrics
Well, a rich gal will drink good pineapple juice
And a poor gal would do quite the same
Yeah, but my gal she drinkin' old shoe polish
You know, she'd get drunk just the same

I will be there in the mornin' if I live
I will be there in the mornin' if I don't get killed
Yes and if I never no more
See you again, I said "Be
Sure to remember me"

Well, a rich gal loves to party, she love to carry on
And a poor gal would do quite the same
Yeah, but my gal is satisfied just to be with me
You know, she loves me just the same

I will be there in the mornin' if I live
I will be there in the mornin' if I don't get killed
Yes and if I never no more
See you again, I said "Be
Sure to remember me"

Now, a rich gal will hit you, she'll bop you with a stick
And a poor gal would do quite the same
Hell, but my gal will get a rusty razor and run you all over town
You know, she'll catch up with you just the same

I will be there in the mornin' if I live
I will be there in the mornin' if I don't get killed
Yes and if I never no more
See you again, I said "Be
Sure to remember me"

Well and if I never no more
See you again, I said "Be
Sure to remember me"Embed
