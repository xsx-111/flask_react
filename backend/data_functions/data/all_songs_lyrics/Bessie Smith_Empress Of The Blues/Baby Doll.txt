Baby Doll LyricsHoney, there's a funny feeling 'round my heart
And it's bound to drive your mama wild
It must be something they call the Cuban Doll
It weren't your mama's angel child
I went to the doctor the other day
He said I's well as well could be
But I said, "Doctor, you don't know
Ooh what's worrying me"
I want to be somebody's baby doll
So I can get my loving all the time
I want to be somebody's baby doll
To ease my mind
As long as he can eagle rock and ball the jack
I want to be somebody's baby doll
So I can get my lovin' all the time
I mean to get my lovin' all the time
Lord, I went to the gypsy to get my fortune told
She said you in hard luck
Bessie, doggone your bad luck soul
I want to be somebody's baby doll
So I can get my lovin' all the time
I mean to get my lovin' all the timeEmbed
