Fake Happy Lyrics
I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy

So I been doin' a good job
Of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
Better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath

Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
And if I go out tonight
And dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low, they'll never see me frown

Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
Ooh ooh
I shoulda known when things were going good
That's when I'd get knocked down
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba
Oh please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh no
Oh, what's the use?
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
