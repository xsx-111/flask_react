Pool Lyrics
As if the first cut wasn't deep enough
I dove in again 'cause I'm not into giving up
Coulda got the same rush from any lover's touch
But why get used to something new?
'Cause no one breaks my heart like you

When you kiss me, I wish we could see what happens next
For a moment, I could forget what happens in my head
If I doubt you, would you come through?
Happy second chance or happy ending
But this time you don't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

As if the first blood didn't thrill enough
I went further out to see what else was left of us
Never found the deep end of our little ocean
Drain the fantasy of you
Headfirst into shallow pools
And I wonder, is it better to get it over with?
The illusion, can shatter before we begin
If you're really sorry
Happy second chance, think I could forgive
This time you won't leave me sinking

(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in

Dive back into
Right back into
Dive right back into you
And now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you
Back into
Right back into you
Dive right back into you
And now I know you
Now I know you
Now that I know you
Dive right back into you
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in
(I'm underwater) No air in my lungs
(My eyes are open) And I'm giving up
(You are the wave) I could never tame
If I survive, I'll dive back in
I'll dive back in, I'll dive back10Embed
