White Is Red Lyrics
Frankie was a heart breaker
I didn't know it at the start
She was only sixteen
But, she went and broke my heart
And she pulled up in her dad's car wearing white
She said she knew a place where we could hide
She didn't have a license and she told me I could drive
So, I drove all night

"Why don't you leave me," she asked that night
I said, "I see I didn't know the kid is mine"
I'll never leave you, it isn't right
Let's stay together until the end of time

Oh, now the white is red
Can't get it outta my head
Oh, now the white is red

I heard that there's a place where we can go
Across the state there's no one that we know
Or maybe rent a place where we can stay
Where what we have will go along the way
Then, Frankie turned to me, she looked me in the eye
She said that I looked tired, she told me she could drive
I pulled up to the station, walked through neon lights
Then, she put her foot down, down, down, down

Why did you leave me alone that night
You took off racing, the kid is mine
You left me standing, out on the yellow line
The daylight's fading into the night
We cross the line x4

Oh, now the white is red
Can't get it outta my head
Oh, now the white is red

I don't know why she left, took off racing
I ran down yellow line, red lights fading
She went left, double line, outta luck, outta time
I cover my eyes, I know she crossed the line
She crossed the line x8
Oh, now the white is red
Can't get it outta my head
Oh, now the white is red1Embed
