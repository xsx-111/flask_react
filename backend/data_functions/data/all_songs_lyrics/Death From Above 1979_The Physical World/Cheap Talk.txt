Cheap Talk Lyrics
She uses her body
To say the things that she can't say
But so do I, I can't lie
I could never really move that way

So listen, I go crazy
The way she makes me
Get on my knees, yeah
I'm begging please, yeah

What he said
What she said
It doesn't really matter in the end
I can see it going fast
Talking cheap will never last

I noticed you noticing me
The way you were walking out; I believed
Everything you said
Your body won't lie in bed

So listen I go crazy
The way she makes me
So listen I go crazy
The way she makes me
Get on the floor, yeah
I want some more, yeah

She's in the backseat
Buying everything he says
While's he's burning like a book
Catch a look in the mirror and...
You can turn aroundEmbed
