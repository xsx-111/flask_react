Crystal Ball Lyrics
If my heart bruises
Everybody loses
Oh!
I can't stress enough
And on the weekend
Everyone's my best friend
Oh!
I don't believe it

If I can see the end
I can't see the beginnin'
There's no crystal ball
To see the happy endin'
I know I can't say
That this will last forever
But I need you to know
I don't want you to go

If my hand losing
Everybody bruises
Oh!
You gotta believe me
And if the house wins
Everybody else sins
Oh!
The truths the city
If can see the end
I can't see the beginnin'
There's no crystal ball
To see the happy endin'
I know I can't say
That this will last forever
But I need you to know
I don't want you to go

It's not in the cards
There's no crystal ball
There's no way to predict
Who will take it all
Can always have what you want
You know it's for the try
I see you gettin' turned on
I know the reason why

If my heart bruises
Everybody loses
Oh!
You gotta believe me
And on the weekend
Everyone's your best friend
Oh!
I don't believe it2Embed
