Always On Lyrics
Innocence is fadin'
Cause we see and hear too much
Everyone you know around you
Always keep in touch
Show me something new
Somethin' I can like

Cause we're always, always, always on now

If we brought Kurt back to life
There's no way he would survive
No way, not a day

I've been losin' sleep
Just keepin' up with what's become
Reachin' out for something else
When all I want is love
Cause you can't turn off
You're always on
Who is that callin' on the phone
Cut the ring, can't ignore
No one alone, not anymore
Cause we're always, always, always on now

If we brought Kurt back to life
There's no way he would survive
No way, not a day

If we brought Kurt back to life
There's no way he would survive
No way, not a day1Embed
