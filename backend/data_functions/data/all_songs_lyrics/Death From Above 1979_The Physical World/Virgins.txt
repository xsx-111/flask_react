Virgins Lyrics
Where have all the virgins gone
Sleeping on their parents' lawn
Bad kids sent to summer school
Skip to skate in the empty pool
No one seems to listen
The rule is no exception
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough

Please won't you stay with me
I'm begging tonight
I'll hold back your hair if you're not feeling alright
There's nothing left for us here
This town has spit us out, dear

I drag my feet up and down these halls
I write my name on the bathroom walls
There's nothing sacred to me
I lost it in the back seat

Where have all the virgins gone
Sleeping on their parents' lawn
Bad kids sent to summer school
Skip to skate in the empty pool
No one seems to listen
The rule is no exception
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough
I believe there's room for friends in all the beds
It all depends on what they said
Opposites attract sometimes
But others find that love is blind
And I don't mind
Yeah Yeah
Where have all the virgins gone
Sleeping on their parents' lawn
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough

Where have all the virgins gone
Sleeping on their parents' lawn
Bad kids sent to summer school
Skip to skate in the empty pool
No one seems to listen
The rule is no exception
Don't ever change
Bad is good enough1Embed
