Gemini LyricsMy girl is a Gemini
She gets things done
Sometimes she's mean
But she can be a lot of fun
She cries on her birthday
No it's not the first time
Yeah, she cries on her birthday
No it's not the first time
Her blood stained walls
Stepped on and forgotten
Cut from the film
Cut from her wrists
Twenty-four seven
Still believes in heaven
Raspberry lips
Never been kissed
She's over there sleepin'
She's warm when I sneak in
I sleep with the sunshine
She gets up before 9
She cries on her birthday
No it's not the first time
Yeah, she cries on her birthday
No it's not the first time
Her blood stained walls
Stepped on and forgotten
Cut from the film
Cut from her wrists
Twenty-four seven
Still believes in heaven
Raspberry lips
Never been kissed
Her blood stained walls
Stepped on and forgotten
Cut from the film
Cut from her wrists
Twenty-four seven
Still believes in heaven
Raspberry lips
Never been kissed
Raspberry lips
Never been kissedEmbed
