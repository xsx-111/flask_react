Trainwreck 1979 Lyrics
I was born, on the highway, in a train wreck
With a heart, that was beating, out of my chest
So now I follow it, around the world, I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon, I know I'll bleed, until I drop

Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

There's a darkness, and a hollow, on the highway
Every cross, on the roadside, tells a story
So now I follow it, around the world, I can't keep up
The story never ends, as long as we have blood and guts

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

It ran off the track
In 11, 79 (eleven seven-nine)
While the immigrants slept
There wasn't much time
The mayor came calling
And got them out of bed
They packed up their families
And headed up wind
A poison cloud
A flaming sky
200,000 people
And no one died
And all before
The pocket dial
Yeah!
I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'
Now I'm stranded
Tied to the tracks
There's no hero
There's no villain
There's nobody I can blame
The story's still the same
I'm never satisfied
It's a problem with my brain

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enough
I can't get enoughEmbed
