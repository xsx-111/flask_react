Government Trash Lyrics
Well you can't say nothing
We're doing right
Cause the government trash
Will give me up all night
'Cep for drugs so hard
They need to break their backs
Don't step on the crack
Cause you know about that

21, 21, nobody knows anything at 21
22, 22, nobody knows anything at 22
She's alright, alright
She'll make it alright, alright

It's not a secret
Everybody has decided
Look in the mirror
Staring back in those eyes
Don't stop thinking
Nrrgh now pass the phone
I said do what you want
But just leave me alone
Nothing is free
Call the police
They dress to kill
I dress to die

It's not a secret
Everybody has decided
Look in the mirror
Staring back in those eyes
Don't stop thinking
Nrrgh now pass the phone
I said do what you want
But just leave me aloneEmbed
