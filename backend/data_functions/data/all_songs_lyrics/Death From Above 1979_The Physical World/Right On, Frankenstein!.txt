Right On, Frankenstein! Lyrics
I dig my own graves lately
I don't need any help
Just let me sit here quiet
In here by myself

I don't wanna die but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery

I've been a zombie lately
I got nothin' to say
Always too much talking
Not enough eating brains

I don't wanna die but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery

I'll wait here 'til I'm ready

All my life I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out
Nothing's new
It's the same old song
Just a different tune
All my life I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out
Nothing's new
It's the same old song
Just a different tune

Right on, Frankenstein!
Youth is in the door
Lazarus push the stone off
Where's the way back to bed

I don't wanna die but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery

Chasin' the beast inside me
He pushes and shoves
Sensitive thugs need hugs so
Why do I get no love

I don't wanna die but I wanna be buried
Leave me at the gates of the cemetery
I'll wait here 'til I'm ready

All my life I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out
Nothing's new
It's the same old song
Just a different tune
All my life I've been waitin' for you
Not waitin' to find out
Nothing's new
It's the same old song
Just a different tune


Right on, Frankenstein!
You don't believe in ghosts
Lightning strikes the body
And threatens life the mostEmbed
