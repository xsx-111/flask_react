The Physical World LyricsI can't help you
If you don't try
Starin' at nothin'
Nothin' is right
Can I say somethin'
That might sound wrong
Maybe we've been too
Free too long
Oh no, not again
I get the feelin' this is never gonna end
Go bridge won
Has strung out
Build up tear it down
Sun burn walk it out
Look in my
I can't sell you
If no one buys
Torn out your heroes
Click and they die
Oh no, not again
I get the feelin' this is never gonna end
Oh no, not again
I get the feelin' this is never gonna end
Go bridge won
Has strung out
Build up tear it down
Sun burn every thing
I can't lieEmbed
