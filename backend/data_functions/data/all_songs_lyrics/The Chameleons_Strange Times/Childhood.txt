Childhood LyricsI saw innocent kids turn cruel
In the playground at school
Poor Claudius played the fool
Survival is cool
One for the space to prowl as you please
Two for the pulpit down on your knees
We've hanged our hearts to shame
And no one's to blame
Hey, everything was clearer than today
Oh, you have to hang on to your childhood
O-o-open your eyes or stay as you are my friend
You have to hang on, hang on
Hang on
My life is a Milbury's home
On Hereford Way
My life is a Barclays' loan now
And a mortgage to pay
Let's drink to freedom and family ties
Here's to the bags that are under my eyes
We've opened our eyes to pride
With nothing inside
Hey, everything was clearer than today
You have to hang on to your childhood
Open your eyes or stay as you are my friend
You have to hold on, hold on
La-la-la-la
La la la
How have you been, I hope you go far
Together we'll stand and prop up the bar
I'm watching you now cleaning your car
Open your eyes or stay as you are
Open your eyes or stay as you are
You have to hold on to your childhood
Ya-ya-you have to hold on to your childhood
Bop-ba-da-de-bom-bom
Bop-ba-da-de-bom-bom
Bop-ba-da-de-bom-bom
Bop-ba-da-de-bom-bom
Hang on, hang on with just a little more heart now
With just a little more
Come on, a-just a little more heart now
Just a little bit
Come on, with just a little more heart now
Heart, heart, now, now (Just a little bit)
Come on, come on, just a little more heart now
Just a little bit
Come on, come on (just a little more heart now)
Come on, come on (Just a little bit)
Come on
I hope you are very happy
Hope you're very happy
Hope you're very happy
Hope you're very, very, very, very, very, very, very happy
(Come on, with just a little more heart now)
(Just a little bit)
(Come on, hang on)Embed
