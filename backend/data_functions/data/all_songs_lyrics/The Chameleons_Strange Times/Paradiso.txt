Paradiso LyricsI recall a closing door, and i remember
Seeing shadows cross a stained glass sky
Long before the strangers came down to steal our clothing
And our consciences and long before
Eyes were empty, hearts were cold
We'll watch the rattlesnakes slide
Slowly swerve into view
To tease and tantalise
To sucker your senses and spit out the peices
Hey magazine girl, she was living in a different world
Or is it a he?
Pull back the curtain my son
I look around, the colour has gone
And slowly darkness descends upon me
Paradiso i know you lied, that much i see
Well the sepent sings his song
To so many sleeping staring eyes
Like sheep they sing along
And clap in time to a heart that's beating
Crazy child, she was wicked, oh she was wild, her eyes are open
Pull back the curtain today
I look around, the colour is grey
Grey as the ghost town that towers above me
Paradiso i know you lied, that much is clear, to me
I see the poet and the fool
Walking hand in hand to school
I recall a lonely outcast and i remember
Laughing children, it was long before
Thier eyes were empty, hearts were cold
So dance this final dance with me
I'll wrap my sting round your spine
Will poison wash away the fear, wipe the world from my mind?
Look up, what can you do?
I looked around the colour was blue
Wise up! it's in your head
I looked around me and the colour is red
Red as the words that i read on the wall
Paradiso you can try, so must they fall
And only ashes remain in the end
Paradiso i know you lied, lies without end
I'll see it again and again and againEmbed
