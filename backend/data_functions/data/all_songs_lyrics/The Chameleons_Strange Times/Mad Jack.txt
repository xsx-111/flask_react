Mad Jack LyricsHe's cold to the kiss
In ignorance he's dangerous
In innocence he's bliss
And he stalks the night with sonar senses
And he holds you tight
Masturbates the madness in you
Bop-ba-dop-ba
He dreams when he's not sleeping
Plays the trusted friend, trust him, friend
About as far as you can piss
And he holds the night and walks in shadow
And avoids the light
Masturbates the madness in you
Bop-ba-dop-ba
His frightened eyes can't disguise
Blatant lies, blatant lies
Step inside
Wow!
Bop-ba-dop-ba
Oh, well, we will watch him now where he's walking
It's a vacuum world and every word
A silent, strangled scream
Oh, he's God tonight, he walks on water
And he's always right
Talks about the madness in America
In America
Oh, he's God tonight, walks on water
And he's always right
Talks about the madness in Africa
Africa
His frightened eyes, Mad Jack's eyes
Can't disguise blatant lies
Frightened eyes, Mad Jack's eyes
Are open wide, his eyes are wide
Eyes are wide
It's been a long time, Jack, welcome back
Have some speed, have some smack
(If you want to dance, Jack)
(Don't look back)
(If you want to dance, Jack)
(Don't look back)
(If you want to dance, Jack)
(Don't look back)
(If you want to dance, Jack)
(Don't look back)Embed
