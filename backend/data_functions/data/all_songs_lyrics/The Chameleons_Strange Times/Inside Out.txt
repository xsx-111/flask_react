Inside Out LyricsLove and laughter fills his life today
Dragged into this world and thrown away
She never wanted you, better things to do
You won't remember...
Drawn to the door, whizzing through the week
Dancing round the fire with the rest of the freaks
Oh no, no, things are different now
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn him inside out
His second mother holds him to her breast
She sees her children come and go
Ripping the heart from her
All of them part of her
And some will remember...
Time heals all wounds they say
She can't let them take her boy away
This son, oh, she would die without
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn her inside out
When she was young, the world was a different place...
After all
And his heart is in his home
There helplessly waiting for someone to smash his world to pieces
Ignorant and cruel
Social student fools
Pull him to the right, pull him to the left
Pull him by the arms, pull him by the legs
Let go!
Oh, things are different now...
Don't let these days of doubt
Turn them inside out
When you were young, they wore a different face
When she was young, the world was a different place
When you were young, they wore a different smileEmbed
