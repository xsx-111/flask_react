Soul in Isolation Lyrics
Soul in isolation
I can hear you breathing down the hall
Soul in isolation
I can hear you whisper through the walls
And if I had a mind to now
I could call to you
Or I could simply shut you out
No more would you cry, cry, cry

I give you my time to kill
But you'll never never break my will
Or I could sink a sleeping pill
And in the morning could be sleeping still
But most of you are much too ill
Oh, way beyond a surgeon's skill
In bondage to a dollar bill
What more can you buy, buy, buy-uy-uy

Oh, when you think on it, when you think of it
We're all souls in isolation
Alive in here, I'm alive in here
I'm alive in here
Oh, when you think on it, when you think of it
Come here!
A word in your ear
A word in your ear
A word in your ear
Back to the trees
Back to the trees
Back to the trees

Big bad giant standing tall
Crushing all the creatures great and small
I'd like to see this giant fall
When will it come?
When will it come?
Words that rattle 'round my head
Struck by lightning, someone said
Diamond bullet through the head
Right in the brain
Are they right in the brain?
Are they right in the brain?
Are they right in the brain?

Will I see the jailer's face?
Did my mother lead me to this place?
Or will I live to see his face?
Will another come to take my place in total isolation?
Surrounded by fears
Too many clowns, too many tears
Isolation, surrounded by crowds
In another world, head in the clouds
I'm alive in here, I scream
But you still can't hear
I'm alive in here
I'm alive, turn on the light
Turn on the light
Oh, when you think on it, when you think on it
We're all souls in isolation
Alive in here, I'm alive in here
I'm alive in here
Oh, when you think on it, when you think on it
We're all souls in isolation
Alive in here, I'm alive in here
I'm alive in here
Oh, when you think on it, when you think on it
We're all souls in isolation

We're always searching for something
Searching
Dear, dear, dead days
I'm longing for you
Sweetest virgin
Now deflowered...
Now deflowered...Embed
