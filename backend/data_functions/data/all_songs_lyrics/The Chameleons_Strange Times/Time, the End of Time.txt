Time, the End of Time LyricsOne chance is all you have
When it's gone all you have is sorrow
One chance is all you have
Take it on like there's no tomorrow
Don't waste your time
Don't waste time
Time
Time slipping away
Have to make the most of your time
You don't have time
Time, open the door
Somewhere in the back of your mind
Child, you don't have time
Anymore
Time
Unchained intoxicating youth
Such an endless feeling
These days are softly stolen away
While your head is reeling
Don't waste your time
Don't waste time
Time, time
Time slipping away
Have to make the most of your time
You don't have time
Time, open the door
Somewhere in the back of your mind
Child, you don't have time
Anymore
Don't waste your days away
And crying all night
Lonely child, lonely child
Hear me
Don't waste your days away
Crying all night
Lonely child, lonely child
Hear me
Don't waste your days away
Crying all night
Oh, lonely child, lonely child
Hear me
Time slipping away
Have to make the most of your time
You don't have time
Time, open the door
Somewhere in the back of your mind
Child, you don't have time
Time, time, time slipping away
Somewhere in the back of your mind
In your mind, in your mind
Tick, tick, tick, tick
Tick, tick, tick, tick
Oh no
Time
