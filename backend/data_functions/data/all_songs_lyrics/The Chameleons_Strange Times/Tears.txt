Tears LyricsIt's just coincidence
Well, you can talk that way, but I have to say
I don't believe in it
And with a chill of chance, I decided to dance
The days away
And I wasn't worried at all
Sneaking through the back door
And I wasn't worried at all
Dreams are what you live for
Waiting for the light to turn green
And carry me home
To the kindest eyes that I've ever seen
Carry me home
Well, can you tell me how will it be now?
How will it be?
Can you tell me how will it be now?
How will it be? Oh
Well, we were younger then and the days were long
And slow
But were we wiser then? I couldn't say
I wouldn't know
But I wasn't worried at all
I had someone to run to
No, I wasn't worried at all
I knew which way the wind blew
Picking out the chaos in bloom
Carry me home
And I watched the ceiling spin 'round the room
Carry me home
Well, can you tell me how will it be now?
How will it be?
Can you tell me how will it be now?
How will it be?
In a cold world
How will it be?
In the real world
How will it be?
In a lonely world
How would it be?
Will the ghosts just stop
Following me?
In a cold world
How will it be?
In a real world
How will it be?
Beg and crawl
How will it be?
Will the ghosts just stop
Following me?
Oh no, drawn into the sun
He was the only one
He cries out to everyone
For his only son
From the window of my room now
I can see the color bloom now
You can't even look in my eyes now
What will you see?
If you could look into my eyes now
What will you see?
What would you see?
Just coincidence
And you can talk that way
It's just coincidence
Well, you can talk that way
I don't believe in it
Don't believe in itEmbed
