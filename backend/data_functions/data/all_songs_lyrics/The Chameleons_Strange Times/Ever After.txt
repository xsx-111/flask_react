Ever After LyricsI don't believe in fascists or flashing females or factory floors
I don't believe in speeding, I don't believe in spreading spores
I don't believe in Cupid or his laden arrows out of the blue
All of that is stupid but then again it's up to you
Disguise and distort all you will
I'm burning up I can't stand still
I'm finding out I always will
For ever after
I don't believe in fireworks, I don't believe in CND
It's just another slogan from a student library
I don't believe in justice, I don't believe in love on the dole
I don't believe in wham-bam, I don't believe in what comes now
Disguise and distort all you will
I'm burning up I can't stand still
I'm finding out I always will
For ever after
It's just another avenue to walk down
Disguise and distort all you will
I'm burning up I can't stand still
I'm finding out I always will
For ever after
Everybody's crazyEmbed
