Caution LyricsWe have no future, we have no past
We're just drifting ghosts of glass
Brown sugar, ice in our veins
No pressure, no pain
Everybody looks the same to me
Rows and rows of faces on a balcony
I can hear them calling down to me
"Come up here, set us free"
Got sugar in our brains
Or a dagger in our hearts

This is not my home, no
Everyone's bought and sold
This is not my home
Everybody's walking round the dead and cold
Ho-ho
And one by one by one we disappear
But day after day, year after year
You all run about, are we still there?
Nobody hears cause nobody cares
Put a dagger in my heart now
Cold here and I shudder and I shiver
I wanna look twenty but I can't deliver
Pains in the heart
Ba-ba-bow-wow-wow-wow
It's cold in here
Can you hear my teeth a-chatter?
The time has come for all of us to scatter
Caution to the wind
Caution to the wind
Dagger in the heart
No, this is not my home
No, everyone's bought and sold
This is not my home
Everybody's checking out the dead and cold
Ba-ba-bow
We have no future we have no past
We're just drifting ghosts of glass
Brown sugar, ice in our veins
No pressure, no pain
No pressure, no pain
No pressure, no pain
No pressure, no shame
No pressure, no shame
No pressure, no shame
And no pressure, oh, throw it away
Nothing on earth could help me, no
Nothing on earth could help me, no
Nothing on earth could help me, no, no, no
Nothing on earth could help me, no, no, no
Nothing on earth could help me, no
Nothing on earth could help me, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no
Nothing on earth, I said nothing on earth
I said nothing on earth, I said...
Hoo-ah, hoo-ah, hoo-ah, hoo-ah
No!Embed
