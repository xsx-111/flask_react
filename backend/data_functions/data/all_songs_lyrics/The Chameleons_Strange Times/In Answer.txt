In Answer LyricsHey, one afternoon
A part of me parted too soon
And slipped away
I don't know what to say
Eyes that drew me in
To wonderfully wonderful sin
And it blew me away
I don't know what to say
In answer
In answer
In answer
Nothing matters to me
Hey, one cold grey afternoon
A part of me parted too soon
And it slipped away
I don't know what to say
Eyes that drew me in
To wonderfully wonderful sin
And it blew me away
I don't know what to say
In answer
In answer
In answer
Nothing matters to me
Nothing matters to me
Believe me
You own my soul completely
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
And from day to day
Oh, from hour to hour
I will be
I will be
Always in your power
Set my spirit free
As I fell, fell to the ground
My head swam around and around
And I didn't know
Which way was up or down
Hey, one cold grey afternoon
A part of me parted too, parted too soon
I touched the moon
I don't know what to say
In answer
In answer
You're all that matters to me
You're all that matters to me
Believe meEmbed
