Here She Comes Now Lyrics
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...

Ah, oh, it looks so good
Ah, oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and see

Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...

Ah, oh, it looks so good
Ah, oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and see
Oh, it's made out of wood
Just look and see now
She ever comes, if she ever comes now
Now, now, now, now
She ever, ever, ever comes n-n-n-now
If she ever, ever, ever comes n-n-n-now
If she ever comes now now now now
If she ever, if she ever, if she ever
If she ever comes n-n-n-now
If she ever, if she ever, if she ever, if she ever
If she ever comes n-n-n-now
If she ever1Embed
