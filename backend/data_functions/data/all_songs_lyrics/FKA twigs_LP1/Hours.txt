Hours Lyrics
I could kiss you for hours

Who'd have thought
I'd be here?
In your mouth
Loud and clear

Harder
Do you feel it with me?
Harder?
Am I suited to fit
All of your needs?
Master of all of your needs

I could kiss you for hours
And not miss a thing
Read my lips now
I could kiss you for hours
The feeling you bring
So deep in now
I could kiss you for hours
How would you like it if my lips touched yours
And they stayed close, baby, till the stars fade out?
How would you like it if I sucked before I bite?
But it wasn't too hard, so it felt alright
How would you like it if I held you in my arms?
Round off your edges, be a substitute for calm

Harder
Do you feel it with me?
Harder?
Am I suited to fit
All of your needs?
Master of all of your needs

I could kiss you for hours
And not miss a thing
Read my lips now
I could kiss you for hours
The feeling you bring
So deep in now
I could kiss you for hours

Driving heaven under the ground
The sweetest thing a girl like me has found
(I could kiss you for hours)
Flying in a higher world of your own
A long lost boy aside a man that's grown
I could kiss you for hours
And not miss a thing
Read my lips now
I could kiss you for hours
The feeling you bring
So deep in now
I could kiss you for hours

I could kiss you for hours
I could kiss you for hours
I could kiss you for hours
I could kiss you for hours13Embed
