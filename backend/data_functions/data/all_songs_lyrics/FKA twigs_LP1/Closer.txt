Closer Lyrics
Now I yearn to
Follow you in
Everything I do
All those years in isolation
Helped me want for you
Lead me to a
Place I'm free from
All the wrongs I do

In return, I'll live my life
Forever loving you

Closer
I'm here to be closer
Closer
To you, to you, to you, to you
Closer
I'm ready now, closer
Closer
To you, to you, to you, to you

In my mind
Eternal darkness
Seemed like it was true (true, true, true)
Oh, so wretched, wretched, wretched, wr-wretched
My savior knew (oh, so lost)
I was weary
I was sleepy
But you held me through
Carried me along the sand
Your footsteps gold and couth

Closer
I'm here to be closer
Closer
To you, to you, to you, to you
Closer
I'm ready now, closer
Closer
To you, to you, to you, to you

All those years in
Isolation
Isolation
