Video Girl Lyrics
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
You lie and you lie and you lie

Nineteen, too keen
Looking at the game though
Trying to make a stand for the main squeeze
Please, you don't stand a chance
Stop acting like you can

The camera's on you, ain't that enough?
You're looking for that all 'round good love
So nothing's gonna get in your way
You're gonna get yourself broke one day

Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Stop, stop lying to me
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
You lie and you lie and you lie
Nineteen, I see
A body that can move, the hardest in the room
With a quick switch, kiss
Got all eyes on you now
What you gonna do?

The camera loves you, ain't that enough?
You're craving for the whole universe
So nothing's gonna get in your way
You're gonna get yourself broke one day

Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Stop, stop lying to me
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
You lie and you lie and you lie

Got something to say?
I don't want to hear about it
So you're feeling the fame?
I hate, the things you're going through now
What you gonna do?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Stop, stop lying to me
Was she the girl that's from the video?
Was she the girl that's from the video?
You lie and you lie and you lie

You lie and you lie and you lie
You lie and you lie and you lie
You lie and you lie and you lie
I can't recognise me38Embed
