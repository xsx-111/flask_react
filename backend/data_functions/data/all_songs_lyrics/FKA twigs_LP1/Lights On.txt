Lights On Lyrics
I shy away in my mind
In hope someday I could share this place, with you
You'll be the first one to find
The shadows that make the girl you undo
'Cause the man that you are is defined
By the way that you act in the light

Break or seize me
If the flame gets blown out and you shine
I will know that you cannot be mine
Live or leave me

When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done

Break or seize me
Let the things that I tell you survive
In the way that you handle your size
Live or leave me
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we can do it with the lights on
When I trust you, we'll make love until the morning
Let me tell you all my secrets in a whisper till the day's done26Embed
