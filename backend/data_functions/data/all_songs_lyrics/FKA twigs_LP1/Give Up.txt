Give Up Lyrics
Tell me why I act this way
Tell me that I'll change someday
I'll be the one that can satisfy you
If I can rectify the...
The few things I've got to change
The few things in my way
Okay, so I've said it before and I won't imply that...
You're not too close to the fact

Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe
I know that sometimes you wish I'd go
Away, away
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe

Do I get another chance?
Did I make the final stand?
Above the ones that are, oh, so perfect
'Cause they know how to work it
Work it, work it
Looking like I'll keep it up now
I made the cut
Okay, so I've done it before and you think its an act
But I call this time a wrap
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe
I know that sometimes you wish I'd go
Away, away
I know that sometimes you wish I'd go
Away, away
But I wish that you would know that I'm here
To stay, to stay
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe

Tell me what I've got to do
No, no, don't give up
I'll do anything to make it better, babe
I'll do anything, thing (I, I)
Do you like it like that? (Do you like it like that?)
Tell me what I've got to do
No, no, don't give up
'Cause I'll do anything to make you see me, baby
I'll do anything, thing
I'll make it better
I know that sometimes you wish I'd go
Away, away
I know that sometimes you wish I'd go
Away, away
But I wish that you would know that I'm here
To stay, to stay
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up, babe
Just nod your head and get up
I'm not gon' let you give up32Embed
