Two Weeks Lyrics
I know it hurts, you know, I'd quench that thirst
(I can treat you better than her)
You say you're lonely, I say you'll think about it
'Cause you're the only one who resonates
That chase, mouth open like ahhh

Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
(Mouth open, you're high)
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Mouth open, you're high)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognise her
Mouth open, you're high

I know it hurts, you know, I'd put you first
(I can fuck you better than her)
You say you want me, I say you'll live without it
Unless you're the only one who instigates
Get your mouth open, you're high

Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover (Mouth open, you're high)
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Mouth open, you're high)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognise her
Mouth open, you're high
Feel your body closing, I can rip it open
Suck me up, I'm healing for the shit you're dealing
Smoke on your skin to get those pretty eyes rolling
My thighs are apart for when you're ready to breathe in
Suck me up, I'm healing for the shit you're dealing
High motherfucker, get your mouth open, you know you're mine

I'll put you first, just close your eyes and dream about it
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
I'll quench your thirst, just chase the high and stop your doubting
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Mouth open, you're high)
High, high
High, high
Higher than a motherfucker, dreaming of you as my lover
Flying like a streamer, thinking of new ways to do each other
(Mouth open, you're high
High, high
High, high)
Pull out the incisor, give me two weeks, you won't recognise her
Mouth open, you're high285Embed
