Numbers Lyrics
(Was I just a—?)

Was I just a number to you?
Was I just a lonely girl to fly?
Tonight I've got a question for you
Tonight do you want to live or die?
Was I just a number to you?
Was I just a lonely girl to fly?
Tonight I've got a question for you
Tonight do you want to live or die?

Was I just a—?
Was I just a—?
Was I just a—?
Was I just a—?

Why you gotta go and hurt me, babe?
Why you gotta go and make me cry?
I just wanted to see you
And I've got to clean the mess you made
I left your heart slow beating on the side
Was I just a number to you?
(1122334)
Was I just a lonely girl to fly?
(I'm lonely, baby, I'm lonely, babe)
Tonight I've got a question for you
Tonight do you want to live or die?

(1122334)
Was I just a number to you?
(I'm lonely, babe, I'm lonely, babe)
Was I just a number to you?
(1122334)
Was I just a number?
Was I ju-ju-ju-just—?
(I'm lonely, baby, I'm lonely, babe)13Embed
