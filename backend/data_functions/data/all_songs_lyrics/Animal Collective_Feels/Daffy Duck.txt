Daffy Duck LyricsWhat I need is good advice (ooo-ooo)
Cooked on plates of ground meat
Rubber hands and silly friends
Pasted on my wall
Someone salt a sweet sea soup
That I could swim in proudly
We might swim like laughing ducks
In your pink light glow
There we go changing again
There you go again
My hands can make yours warm again
If not absorbed in blankets
Are you in need of teen angst
And nibble on your neck?
And if I had volcano boots
For swimming in volcanoes
Do you know the origins of laughing ducks?
Oh what's a matter with those birds
There we go changing again
There you go again
What you need's a happy farm
With happy goats and sheep
What I need's a happy arm
To swing ya 'round like fatherEmbed
