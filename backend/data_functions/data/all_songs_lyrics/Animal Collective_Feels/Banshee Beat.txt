Banshee Beat LyricsOh there'll be time, to get by, to get dry, after the swimming pool
Oh there'll be time, to just cry, I wonder why, it didn't work out
Oh there'll be time to fish fry, for letters by, yours truly
Yours truly
Someone in my dictionary's up to no good
I never find the very special words I should
So I have another party with a water glass
And I sit on all your actions it's a birthing game
And I'll bet he needs a shower cause he's just like me
And the soldiers in the painting know your secret face
Well your parrot told me just how I can make you smile
Gonna let you do your thinking if you need awhile
But what I gave you made him get mad
A little bit funny how a thing like that
Could travel from one mouth in through another and
The next thing you know you gotta hear it from your brother and
The words they sting like a stump of old wasps
Do you remember when I said go throw the rock in there?
And we ran through the woods to our good house
And you forgot about the things that he could say like
I don't think that I like you anymore
Well I found new feelings at the feeling store
And I can't find you at our kissing place
And I'm scared of those new pair of eyes you have
So I duck out and go down to find the swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
Caused when I'm snuffed out I doubt I'll find a swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
But I don't wish that I was dead
Now a very old friend of mine once said
That either way you look at it
You have your fits I have my fits but feeling is good
Confusions not a kidney stone in my brain
But if we're miscommunicating, do we feel the same?
Then either way you look at it
You have your fits I have my fits but feeling is good
So I duck out and go down to find the swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
Caused when I'm snuffed out I doubt I'll find a swimming pool
Hop a fence leave the street and wet your feet to find the swimming pool
And you can laugh a little
And you can laugh a little bit3Embed
