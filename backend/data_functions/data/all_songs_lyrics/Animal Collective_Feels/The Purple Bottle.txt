The Purple Bottle LyricsI've gotta big big big heart beat, yeah!
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways?
With good friendly homes
You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that
Likes to drink with horses
Knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze a thing or two at night
It'd make me sick sick sick to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays
I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you
An accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you don't you go
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if its empty it definitely fits the room
And we would too
And my dear dear dear Khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Let's just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore
I've gotta big big big heart beat, yeah!
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways?
With good friendly homes
Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. Well, hello...
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part
Gotta crush high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high
Then I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my do's and still feel ill
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that
Gotta crush high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high
Then I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my do's and still feel ill
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!
You get that, woo!

Gotta crush high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
'Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know cause it's in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high
Then I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my do's and still feel ill
