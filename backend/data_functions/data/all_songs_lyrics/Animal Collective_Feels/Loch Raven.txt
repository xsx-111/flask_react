Loch Raven LyricsI will not give up on you
I will not give up on you
I will not give up on you
I will not give up on you
(I will not give up on you)
Cute red hood come walk with me
(I will not give up on you)
Leave your room mate friend
(I will not give up on you)
Come up to this apartment with me
(I will not give up on you)
Your soft feet will melt
(I will not give up on you)
They walked so far, jumped workin' streets
(I will not give up on you)
They need to feel some furs
(I will not give up on you)
Come up to my den with me
Wait just a second
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh

Cute red hood come walk with me
Leave your room mate friend
Come up to this apartment with me
Wait just a second
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you're some feet above her
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you make me want to...
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
Oh, I'm fevering
Oh, you're some feet above her
Now I'm gonna gonna chase you
(I will not give up on you)
