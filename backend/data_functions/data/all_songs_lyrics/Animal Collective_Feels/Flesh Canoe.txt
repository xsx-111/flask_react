Flesh Canoe LyricsYoung red bird
They're just natural feelings
I can't keep from changing my brains
Bending my wants with my rights
Are my friends still half right
Should I keep them separate from me
It's unclear
Then I get a cold
Can I get a light
It's a certain type of easy pace
That's what we need to make it
Come in close
I trust you
Your nose dipped in my sweat
It dripped on your beautiful sweater
Kind of nice
Should I really lie with you
I never know
When I'm on my own
Are there more important things to do
Then kiss or sleep today we gotta wake up
Then I talk to your breath and we
Enjoy the air
And I creep on your chest
To the hut I have where
I pluck a few notes
On the strands of your hair
And I'm singing to you
What to do if I'd ask you to make funny faces
With me in the mirror of the bathroom
Know your next
You make me feel alright
Are you just like me
Never gonna pick one kind of fruit
Like a mushed banana on your tooth
And you like the sting of the cherry juice
Never eat an apple
That's just one color
Young red bird
They're just natural feelings
Like walking off to ride my bike
Or just bump into you
I haven't seen you in a week or three days
Though it really bugs me
It's nice to find new ways to smile
I keep thinking that
When you feel sad you can't pout
'Cause what this song's about is me singing
I'm just wondering what to do with you myself and me
Naked in the mirror of the bathroomEmbed
