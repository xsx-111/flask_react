Stray Cat Blues (Live) Lyrics
I hear the click-clack of your feet on the stairs
I know you ain't no scared-eyed honey
There'll be a feast if you just come upstairs

It's no hanging matter, no
It's no capital crime

I can see that you're just thirteen years old
I don't want your I.D
You look so lonesome and you're so far from home

Ain't no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Yeah, don't you scratch like that
Yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Bet your mama don't know that you bite like that
I bet she never heard you scream like that

You look so lonesome and so far from home
Well I don't really miss my mother
Don't look so scared, I'm not no mad-brained bear
It's no hanging matter, no
It's no capital crime

Oh, yeah

You say you got a friend, she's wilder than you
Why don't you bring her upstairs?
If she's so wild then she can join in too

It's no hanging matter
It's no capital crime

Yeah, you're a strange stray cat
Yeah, why don't you scratch like that
Oh yeah, yeah, you're a strange stray cat
I bet your mother never saw you scratch like that
Bet she never saw you bite like thatEmbed
