Honky Tonk Women (Live) Lyrics
I met a gin-soaked barroom queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She had to heave me right across her shoulder
'Cause I just can't seem to drink it off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris
As naked as the day that I will die
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris
But they just don't seem to sail you off my mind

It's the honky tonk women
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues


It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues
It's the honky tonk women
That gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk bluesEmbed
