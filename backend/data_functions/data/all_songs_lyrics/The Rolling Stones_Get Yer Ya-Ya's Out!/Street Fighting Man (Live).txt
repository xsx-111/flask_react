Street Fighting Man (Live) Lyrics
Everywhere I hear the sound of marching, charging feet, boy
Because summer's here and the time is right for fighting in the street boy

But what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band
Because in sleepy London town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no

Hey! Say the time is right for a palace revolution
But where I live the game to play is compromise solution

Well then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band
Because in sleepy London town
There's just no place for a street fighting man, no

Hey! Said my name is called disturbance
I'll shout and scream, I'll kill the King, I'll rail at all his servants

Well then what can a poor boy do
Except to sing for a rock and roll band
Because in sleepy London town
There's just no place for street fighting man, no
No, get down boyEmbed
