Sympathy for the Devil (Live) Lyrics
Please allow me to introduce myself
Well I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you, well I hope you guess my name
What's been puzzling you is just the nature of my game
Ah yeah

I stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Czar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank, held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged and the bodies stank

Pleased to meet you, well I hope you guess my name
Ah baby
What's been puzzling you is just the nature of my game
I watched with glee while your kings and queens
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made
I shouted out, "Who killed the Kennedys?"
When after all, after all it was you and me
Let me please introduce myself
Well I'm a man of wealth and taste
Yes and I laid traps for troubadours
Who get killed before they reach Bombay

And I'm pleased to meet you baby, hope you guess my name
Ah yeah
What's been puzzling you is just the nature of my game
Aw woo

Oh hoo, oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh get on down
Tell me baby, what's my name?
Tell me sweetie, what's my name?
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Ooh hoo, ooh hoo, ooh hoo, yeah
Aw get on down
Get on down, get on down
Get down, come on down, come on down
Yeah get down
Ah yeah
I gotta move
Ah get on down, ah get on down
