Gemini Dream LyricsLong time, no see
Short time for you and me
So fine, so good
We're on the road like you knew we would
First night, so long
A state of mind, what can go wrong
We're here, the time is right
To rock and roll right through the night
Make it work out, make it work
Make it work out, make it work out
For each other tonight
Stage fright, candle light
You can let go, tonight's the night
Came back for you
Glad to see that you came too
There's a place, a Gemini dream
There's no escaping from the love we have seen (so come with me)
So come with me, turn night to day
You're gonna wake up
You know you're gonna wake up in a Gemini dream
Turned 'round to see
Where we've been and what we believe
In life, love, take a chance, see it through
You'll be glad that you came too
There's a place, a Gemini dream
There's no escaping from the love we have seen (so come with me)
So come with me, turn night to day
You're gonna wake up
You know you're gonna wake up in a Gemini dream
Long time, no see
The lights go up for you and me
We're here, the time is right
To rock 'n' roll right through the night
Living it
Believing it
Wanting it
Make it work out, make it work
Make it work out, make it work out
For each other tonight
Long time, no see
Short time for you and me
So fine, so far, so good
We're on the road like you knew we wouldEmbed
