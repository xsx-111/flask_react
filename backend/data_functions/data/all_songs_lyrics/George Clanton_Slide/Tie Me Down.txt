Tie Me Down LyricsTry me and I feel like you would like it
Did you hear that I could hurt you bad?
Cause I think that you should know that
Try me
I don't feel it when you fight back
I don't feel it when you hurt me bad
All I feel is that I like that
If you think it over
You can put me under
Cause I can't get over you
Did you think it over?
You can put me under
And I can't get over you
Over you
Over you
Over you
Over
So tie me down, I won't hate you
It doesn't hurt to try
I promise I won't make you
And then that's the night
"It doesn't fit your daydream"
"It doesn't suit you right"
"It doesn't make you mainstream"
And then that's a lie
Tie me down
It doesn't make you mainstream
Doesn't hurt to try (Over you)
Tie me down (Over you)
Tie me down (Over you)
Tie me down (Over you)
I promise I won't hate you (Tie me down, over you)
Tie me down (Over you)
I promise I won't hate you (Tie me down, over you)
Tie me down (Over you)
Tie me down (Over you)1Embed
