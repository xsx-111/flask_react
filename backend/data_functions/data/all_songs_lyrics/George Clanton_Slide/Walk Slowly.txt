Walk Slowly LyricsAnd I was crazy 
I was high to fall in love 
I was crazy high 
And I wanna say 
I was high, I was crazy 
To live a wasted life 
All right 
All right 
I'll wait my turn 
I'll rush, you'll learn 
I'll break my word 
And I'll come running 
While I walk slowly 
I'll wait my turn 
I'll rush, you'll learn 
I'll break my word 
And I'll come running 
While I walk slowly 
I'll wait my turn 
I'll rush, you'll 
I'll wait my turn 
I'll rush, you'll 
I'll wait my turn 
I'll rush, you'll
I'll wait my turn
I'll rush, you'll1Embed
