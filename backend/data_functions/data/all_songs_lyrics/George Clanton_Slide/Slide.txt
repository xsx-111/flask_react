Slide LyricsI'm gonna stay the way you want me 
The way I oughtta be 
The way I am 
Then you slide 
And you don't want me 
But I've got to be stuck in love with you 
Here again forever 
Slide 
Slide 
Hey, I want you so bad 
I need you more and more 
Than I can say 
Babe, my dreams about you 
They keep me hanging on and on 
To every day 
Then slide 
Slide 
Slide
Asleep asleep asleep 
Asleep asleep asleep 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
My dream to be with you 
Don't sleep I want to see you 
(Asleep asleep asleep) I want to see you 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
My dream to be with you (Asleep asleep asleep) 
Don't sleep I want to see you 
(Asleep asleep asleep) I want to see you 
Asleep asleep asleep (Stay the night) 
My dream to be with you (Asleep asleep asleep) 
Stay the night
