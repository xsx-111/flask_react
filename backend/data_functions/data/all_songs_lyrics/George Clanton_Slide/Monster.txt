Monster LyricsSleeping in two beds and thinking 
I'm with the wrong girl and you're with the wrong man 
I'm not too dense to understand 
I guess we won't stop drinking 
Cuz you're in the wrong place and I'm in the wrong town 
I wish you'd want to come around 
And say "I want ya" 
And say "Hello" 
Or just give up and say "It's over" 
But you don't 
But you don't 
Always such a pretty view 
When I get straight I'd like to live with you 
But when we're both fucked up and 
You're in my stairway or I'm at your window 
I hope you're bright enough to know, to know 
That I want ya 
So say "Hello" 
Or just give up and say "It's over" 
I'm not the monster 
You think you know 
Afraid I'm only there to haunt ya 
But I don't 
I dont 
I'm not the monsterEmbed
