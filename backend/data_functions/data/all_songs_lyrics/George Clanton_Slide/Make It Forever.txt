Make It Forever Lyrics
How long can I miss you?
I want you to know
The seconds you leave me are ticking so slow
I give up
I know that I need it when Iâ€™ve had enough
Like falling to pieces and picking them up
Let me go

Holding back the tears from falling
That's what I do
Holding back the tears so long
When you come back again, we can convene, and make it forever

Holding back the tears from falling
That's what I do
Holding back the tears so long
When you come back again, we can convene, make it forever

Holding back the tears so long4Embed
