Dumb Lyrics
Stuck in a ditch, I left you to die
No "I'm leaving you tonight"
It's not leaving if I wasn't there
What I mean is I don't care

I feel dumb, I feel lazy
And you feel, you feel nothing at all
I like to dream I'm not the crazy one
But everything I do is wrong

Yet I'm just the same as everyone
And you're just the same as me
I feel dumb, I can't make an easy hole in one
And you feel, you feel the same to me3Embed
