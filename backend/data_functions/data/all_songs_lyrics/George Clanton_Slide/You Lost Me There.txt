You Lost Me There LyricsYou lost me there 
Where did you go? 
I'm stuck again 
Waiting here at home 
How you could go 
Leave me here again 
I will never know 
Will you come back again? 
We can convene, make it forever 
I tried to stop you 
But you don't listen baby 
I tried to stop you 
But you just keep on fading 
God 
And I won't ask why 
I'll just fake it til the end 
Baby, If you throw me out 
Can I tell you then? 
I don't touch the fire 
Still I get burned til I'm dead inside 
Will you come back again? 
We can convene, make it forever 
You lost me there 
Where did you go? 
I've lost my friend 
Don't let me go 
I've been wasting time 
You can say the word and I'm back in line 
I'm old, I bit the dust 
Try to stay alive for the both of us 
Have fun I'm done with you 
I can move on but it don't feel good 
If you come back again 
We can convene, make it all better 
Make it all better 
Make it all better 
Make it all betterEmbed
