Bewildered (Live At The Olympia, Paris / 1971) LyricsBewildered
Lost in a dream
There's a love that I need
Tell me, why did we part?
Why did we part?
Bewildered, at last
At last has love died dear
Wishing your heart could feel
What's in my heart?
What's in my heart?
What-
Must I have sleepless nights
And endless days?
Oh love, why did you leave my soul?
Without a spark I'm in the dark, oh!
Bewildered
I need your, i need your
I need your guiding hand
I'll never understand
How you can love me, then leave me
Bewildered
How you can love me
Oh baby
Baby, I need your love so bad
I need it, I need it
I need it
Baby, I need your love so bad
I need it, I need it!
I, YOW!
I need it, I need it
I, I, I, I need it!
I need your love so bad
I need it, I need your love so bad
Hit me brother, hit me!
Oh yeah!
YOW!Embed
