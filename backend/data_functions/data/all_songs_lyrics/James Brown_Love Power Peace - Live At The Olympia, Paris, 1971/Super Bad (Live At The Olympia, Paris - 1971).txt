Super Bad (Live At The Olympia, Paris / 1971) Lyrics
Hit it!
Watch me
I got it
Watch me
I got it
Hey!

I got something that makes me wanna shout
I got something that tells me what it's all about
Huh, I got soul, and I’m super bad

I've got soul, and I'm super bad

I love 
I got something that tells me what to do
Sometimes it feel so good, I wanna try myself with you

I got soul, and I’m super bad
Alright

I love, I love to do my thing
And I don't, good god
And I don't want no one else, hit it!
Sometimes it feels so good
I've got soul, and I'm super bad
I've got soul, huh, and I'm super bad
YOW!

Up and down
All around
Right-on people
Huh, let it all hang out
If you don't brothers and sisters
Then you won’t know
What it’s all about
Wait a minute
Gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme
Gimme
Gimme
Hey! YOW!

I got the something that tells me what to do
It feels so good, I wanna try myself with you
I got soul, and I'm super bad

I got soul, alright, and I’m super bad
I love to do my thing
And I don't, good god
And I don't want, hit me
No one else, ha
Sometimes it feels so good, good god
I jump back, I wouldn't test myself
I got soul, and I’m super bad

I got soul, alright, and I'm super bad
Yeah, yeah!

Get down
And all around
Right on people
Let it all hang out
If you don't brothas and sistas
Then you won't know
What it's all about
Wait a minute
Gimme, hey
Gimme, YOW!
Good god, super bad
Super
I'm super
Hit me, ha
Super bad, ha
In the morning or noon
Right on people
Make it soon
In the evening
So I gotta move
I got it, I-I-I
I got it, huh
I got it, hey!
I got it, wait a minute
I said give me the clap, soul clap
Give me the clap, soul clap
Give me the clap, soul clap
Give me the clap, soul clap
Hey! Come on
Hey!
YOW!Embed
