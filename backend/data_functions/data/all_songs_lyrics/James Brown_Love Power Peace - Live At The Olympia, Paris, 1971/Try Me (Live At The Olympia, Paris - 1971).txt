Try Me (Live At The Olympia, Paris / 1971) Lyrics
Try me, try me
Darling tell me
I need you
Try me, try me
And your love will always be true
Oh, I need you, alright
Baby, baby, baby
Hold me, hold me
I want you right here, right here by my side
Won't you hold me, hold me
And your love, your love we won't hide
Oh I need you, alright, alright

Oh i need you
I need youEmbed
