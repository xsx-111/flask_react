Georgia On My Mind (Live At The Olympia, Paris / 1971) Lyrics
Georgia
Oh, Georgia
No, no, no, no, no, no
No peace I find, alright
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
Alright

I said a-Georgia
Maybe you'll come home by the time I get back to Georgia
A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
Like the moonlight through the pines
Through the pines

Her arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
And peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you

I said a-Georgia
Georgia
No, no, no, no, no, no
No peace I find
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind
On my mind
Her arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly, yeah
And peaceful dreams, I see
The road leads back to you
YOW! YOW!
YOW! YOW!
YOW!

Georgia
No, no, no, no, no, no
No peace I find, tell the truth
Just an old, sweet song
Keeps Georgia
Keeps Georgia

I wanna know, I wanna know do you feel alright?
Tell me you've got the sex machine
Then I believe you've got to be super bad
And if you are, get up, get into it, and get involved
I wanna know do you feel alright?

And I've got Georgia
Georgia on my mind
GeorgiaEmbed
