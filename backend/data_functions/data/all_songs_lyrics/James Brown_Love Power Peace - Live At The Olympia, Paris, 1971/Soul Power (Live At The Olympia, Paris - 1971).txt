I want to get under your skin
If I get there, i've got to win
You need some soul, come on get some
And then you'll know, where I'm comin' from
I may lay in the cut and go along
And I'm still on the case and my rap is strong
Huh huh, yeah!
Go jump on my train, when I'm outta sight
Check yourself and get it right
Don't fall on the ground
You got to get down, down, down
Don't fall on the ground
You got to get down, down, down
Love me tender, love me slow
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Love me tender, love me slow
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
If that don't get it, come back for more
(If that don't get it, come back for more)
Hey! (Yeah)
YOW! (Yeah)
Let me get in the bracket
Though I like it, alright
Don't fall on the ground
You've gotta get down, down, down, down, down
Hey!
Alright
Alright
What we want? (Soul Power)
What we need? (Soul Power)
We got to have it (Soul Power)
We want it (Soul Power)
Give it to me (Soul Power)
We want itEmbed
