Get Up, Get Into It, Get Involved (Finale) (Live At The Olympia, Paris / 1971) LyricsWhen we say get up, what do we mean?
(Get on up!)
When we say get up, what do we mean?
(Get on up!)
When we say get up, what do we mean?
(Get on up!)
Everybody over there
(Get on up!)
Everybody over there
(Get into it!)
Everybody right there
(Get involved!)
Everybody
Everybody over there
(Get on up)
Everybody out there
(Get into it)
Everybody right there
(Get involved)
Everybody
(Get involved)
