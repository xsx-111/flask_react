When in the World LyricsI don't have trouble sleeping
It's too much trouble worrying
I've got to think of my health
If I don't, who will?
It's okay, I'll change my attitude some day
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
Things are getting desperate
Everyone is out for all they can get
It won't stop 'til there's nothing left
It won't matter no more
It's okay, I'll change my attitude some day
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
I said I don't have trouble sleeping
Too much trouble worrying
I've got to think of my health
'Cause if I don't, who will?
It's okay, I'll change my attitude some day
Things are getting desperate
Everyone is out for all they can get
It won't stop 'til there's nothing left
It won't matter no more
It's okay, I'll change my attitude some day
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about me
When the world starts worrying about meEmbed
