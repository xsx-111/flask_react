Mom and Dad and God LyricsDad's a perfectionist
And Mom's a beautician
He is into sin
She's into contrition
Mommy is a martyr
Dad's a professional
Fantasy love inside a confessional
Mom and Dad and God
Mom and Dad and God
Dad is a perfectionist
And Mom's a beautician
He is into sin
She's into contrition
Mommy is a martyr
Dad's a professional
Fantasy love inside a confessional
Mom and Dad and God
Mom and Dad and God
This endless repetition
Of mundane superstition
Is no kind of religion for me
Your mindless devotion
Your lack of emotion
Is no kind of religion for me
Mom and Dad and God
Mom and Dad and God
Mom and Dad and God
Mom and Dad and God
This endless repetition
Of mundane superstition
Is no kind of religion for me
Your mindless devotion
Your lack of emotion
Is no kind of religion for me
Mom and Dad and God
Mom and Dad and GodEmbed
