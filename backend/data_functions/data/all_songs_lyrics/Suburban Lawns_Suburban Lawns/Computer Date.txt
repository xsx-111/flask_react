Computer Date LyricsI couldn't wait
Depend on fate
The perfect mate
Computer date
I filled out a form
And she filled out a form
Our data was merged
And love was born
I couldn't wait
Depend on fate
The perfect mate
Computer date
Now I love her
And she loves me
And technically that's how it should be
Computer date
The perfect mate
Science is great
