Intellectual Rock LyricsGoodbye
Goodbye
So long
It hasn't been that long
It doesn't make any sense at all
You wanna hang me up
You wanna let me down
You really turn me on
When you push me around
You're so sublime
You're mystifying
Well, I like your pants
Well, come on
Let's dance
Shake, shake
Shake it, baby
Shake it, baby
Come on, shake it, baby
Let's go
All rightEmbed
