Anything LyricsIt don't mean, ah, anything
Anymore, ah
'Cause you can't find anything to do
Don't blame it on me
If you want it good, get it
If you want it good, get it
Got to try anything
Gotta find out, yeah
Gotta find out, yeah
What does it mean?
It don't mean, ah, anything
Anymore, ah
'Cause you can't find anything to do
Don't blame it on me
If you want it good, get it
If you want it good, get it
Got to try anything
Gotta find out, yeah
Gotta find out, yeah
What does it mean?
It don't mean, ah, anything
Anymore, ah
'Cause you can't find anything to do
Don't blame it on me
If you want it good, get it
If you want it good, get it
Got to try anything
Gotta find out, yeah
Gotta find out, yeah
What does it mean?Embed
