Flying Saucer Safari LyricsStation wagon full of Fritos
Coke and Twinkies, stale Doritos
Head for the desert, Interstate 10
Pull off anywhere, and then
Concentrate, don't make a sound
We'll psychokinetically pull one down
Flying Saucer Safari
Flying Saucer
Flying Saucer Safari
Taco Bell and filter kings
Correctol and onion rings
Banning, Blythe and Indio
Desert Center too, you know
Concentrate, don't make a sound
We'll psychokinetically pull one down
Flying Saucer Safari
Flying Saucer
Flying Saucer Safari
Will they have protruding brows?
Will they breed us just like cows?
Will there be some tests to run?
We'll be guinea pigs for fun
Don't really care if they take us away
As long as we're back for work Monday
Flying Saucer Safari
