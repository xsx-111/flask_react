Janitor Lyrics
All action is reaction
Expansion, contraction
Man the manipulator
Underwater, does it matter?
Antimatter, nuclear reactor
Boom boom boom boom

Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
Oh my genitals, I'm a janitor

All action is reaction
Expansion, contraction
Man the manipulator
Underwater, does it matter?
Antimatter, nuclear reactor
Boom boom boom boom

Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
Who's your mother? Who's your father?
I guess everything's irrelative
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
I'm a janitor, oh my genitals
Oh my genitals, I'm a janitorEmbed
