Protection LyricsLook farther, see beyond your first step
Is it what you expected?
There's a bad boy in the parking lot
And he's waiting for you
I've got pieces of paper for protection
Got a house built out of cards
Check out my reference list
Clout! That's what I'm talkin' about
Nobodies, you're famous
You want your name next to mine
Come along Buster, Rover
Sporting suits and ties
And makin' out and makin' out
And makin' out and makin' out
Someone will solicit you today
Eerie sounds come from the parking lot
Got pieces of paper for protection
Got a house built out of cards
Check out my reference list
Clout! That's what I'm talkin' about
Nobodies, you're famous
You want your name next to mine
Come along Buster, Rover
Sporting suits and ties
And makin' out and makin' out
And makin' out and makin' out
Someone will solicit you today
Eerie sounds come from the parking lotEmbed
