Jam the Controls LyricsJam the controls, full speed ahead
Any other speed won't make it
Jam the controls at full speed ahead
'Cause any other speed won't make it
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Deny the illusion
That we're eternal, forsake it
Jam the controls
Deny the illusion
That we're eternal, forsake it
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
'Cause makin' a livin'
Ain't makin' it livin'
Jam the controls
'Cause makin' a livin'
Ain't makin' it livin'
Jam the controls
Jam the controls
