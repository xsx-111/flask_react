Pioneers LyricsFlatten it
Slap 'em up
Pack 'em in
Lost pioneers
Consuming new frontiers
Stand 'em up
Then knock 'em down
Your hopes, your dreams, your desires
Technology for leisure hours
Time to waste, waste, waste, waste
Lost pioneers
Exploring new frontiers
I would rather be sorry than safe
But the price is going up, up, up, up
Lost pioneers
Consuming new frontiers
Make it
Spend it
You earned it
Why not burn it?
I would rather be sorry than safe
But the price is going up, up, up, up
Lost pioneers
Consuming new frontiersEmbed
