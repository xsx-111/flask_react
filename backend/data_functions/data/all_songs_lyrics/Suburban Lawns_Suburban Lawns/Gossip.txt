Gossip LyricsI don't believe you
I don't deceive you
Can't you remember?
Your appeal is slum
I don't remember
They are not bad now
These days are cruel
I need some more to run
I will hit your head now
I will hit your head now
I will hit your head now
I will hit your head now
You're a bit chagrin
Languid languor
Oh, stato staunch
Oh, so welkin
Lies, paradox, a parade of rest
Lies, paradox, a parade of rest
Lies, paradox, a parade of rest
Lies, paradox, a parade of rest
Lies, paradox, a parade of rest
Lies, paradox, a parade of restEmbed
