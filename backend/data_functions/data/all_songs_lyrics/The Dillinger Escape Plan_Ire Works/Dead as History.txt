Dead as History LyricsI made a big mistake with you tonight
The way our insides burned like moths flying to light
As the sun begins to set
I cannot find my way back
Walking with my eyes on fire
I never found the payback
We'll never feel like anything is wrong
But the tragedy is not just our own sad song
I, I know the games we play
Give us a way
A way for us to see if we still feel alive
As the sun begins to set
I cannot find my way back
Walking with my eyes on fire
I never found the payback
We'll never feel like anything is wrong
But the tragedy is not just our own sad song
Walls we have built and bridges we have burned
Deeper the hole the farther we feel from harm
Time is always right behind us
Like the lamb under the gun
I'll hold on to this forever
That is never long enough
Time is always right behind us
Like the lamb under the gun
I'll hold on to this forever
That is never long enoughEmbed
