Lurch LyricsI don't know your name, but I know you
Do you lust for fame or forgiveness?
Well I'll give you everything you want
Well I'll give you everything you need
You won't be perfect so best to freeze you in this state
Go on home, you shouldn't be walking around on this day
Now you've stuffed your throat
You've walked on your burial ground
Oh you'll draw the crowd
With honey porcelain skin and crystal baby blues
Your picture in my pocket, I'm obsessed with you
Oh sweety, there's no sense in crying when you're above them all
Barricade the door, you can hold my hand for comfort when you fall
You wear your skin so fresh
Your smell intoxicates
