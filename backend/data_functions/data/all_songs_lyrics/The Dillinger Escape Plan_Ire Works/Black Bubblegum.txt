Black Bubblegum Lyrics
Got so much salt from your lies poured into me
You didn't see yourself dead already
So full of life with every breath that you breathe
But you forgot that in your fairy tale I'm the wolf
All this attention got you thinking that you're a queen
You think that everything you're doing isn't a dream
Long as it feels alright

I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
By the love that you gave
By that look on your face
It's a cover up
I know everything
I had gotten frozen by the way you walk
By the love that you gave
By that look on your face
It's a cover up
I know everything
I know everything

You're made for four-letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel
Check out your face on the wall
Like what you see?
I'm sure you see yourself oh so unique
You're just a sucker for the flame of the week
But you forget that in your fairy tale, bitch I'm the wolf
All this attention got you thinking you were a queen
You thought that everything in life you want should be free
Nothing is what you think

I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
By the love that you gave
By that look on your face
It's a cover up
I know everything
I had gotten frozen by the way you walked
By the love that you gave
By that look on your face
It's a coverup
I know everything
I'm your everything
I know everything

You're made for four-letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel
You're made for four-letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel
You're made for four-letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted
It's what you're dying to feel
You're made for four-letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel
You're made for four-letter fame
Regret is part of your name
It's something you couldn't tell
It's what you wanted to feel
It's what you're dying to feel1Embed
