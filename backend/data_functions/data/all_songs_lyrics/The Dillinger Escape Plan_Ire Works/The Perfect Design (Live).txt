The Perfect Design (Live) LyricsMotions that make gods cringe
Running in circles as fast as we can
Take what you can 'cause now it's all over
Run hot and cold to break the skin
And we won't take no for an answer
For just when the door slams
The pill drops oh my sweet unknowing partner
The perfect design
The pill drops so start the silent dance
Slumping silhouette unforgiving hands
Harboring regret
Play it just once more for old times
Yeah....you know you're all I ever wanted
Yeah....you know you're all I'll ever want
How we laughed when we first saw each other
How you screamed when I saw your eyes melting
This is the end of every rainbow
And now your face shatters
Every waking second I know your face shatters
Every waking second I know your face shattersEmbed
