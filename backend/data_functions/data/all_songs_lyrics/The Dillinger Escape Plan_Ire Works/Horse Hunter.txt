Horse Hunter LyricsStumbling over dead forgotten
Catch you and the secret falls away
Falls away
You were drunken from delusion
Slipped and so the secret fell away
Fell away
I see you, tears in your eyes
Yeah this party is a bore and you're the joke
Me and you, we are the light
Sit with me, give me your hand
You should go your way
You are no friend of mine
Life still lives on lives
Red sea inside these walls
Commerce is your god, cannibalistic flies
Monarch of your womb, messiah of your thighs
How sacred is the web that must be spun
Your taste is on the tip of every tongue

Down, let's lay down
Take me all the way
All the way
Down, let's lay down
Take me all the way
All the way
Shout, shout out loud
Make us proud for days
All the way
Shout, let's lay down
Take me all the way
All the way
Down, give to fire
Beyond the soul desireEmbed
