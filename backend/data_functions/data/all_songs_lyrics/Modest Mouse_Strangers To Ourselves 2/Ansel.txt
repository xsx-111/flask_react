Ansel Lyrics
Here we go!

I took a trip down to Mexico
With my father and brother, Ansel
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Was I really supposed to know?
How the hell would I know?
There it goes!

I made a mess of myself and the trip on the whole
My father stayed patient with me; why? I don't know
You can't know, you can't ever really know
That's the last time I'd see my brother, Ansel
There it goes, so!

Troubles on the head winds, troubles on the tail winds
Troubles on the head winds, troubles on the tail winds

Me and my sister we hung on the phone
Watching the news as they looked for Ansel
On top of that mountain, underneath the snow
Their dogs were a-sniffin', I guess you never know
You can't know, well, you can't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
How the hell would you know?
On gears around an uncaring sun
It doesn't know what it gave
As the bone moon winds 'round again
Again this allows one sphere's heart to pump
Pumping waves of hearts that come and go
And then come and then

You can't know, well, you won't ever really know
Would you really want to know?
No, you can't know
The last time that you'll ever see another soul
No, you never get to know
No, you don't know7Embed
