The Tortoise and the Tourist Lyrics
Wake up, get ready, wake up, get ready
What a wonderful trip's ahead
Well, wake up, get ready, wake up, get ready
Such a wonderful trip's ahead
We get dressed as ghosts
With sheets taken from the bed
Inside our socks, we hide travelers checks
We are tourists of the dead

So let's pack up!
Let's go
So let's pack up!
Let's go
Well, let's pack up!
Let's go
Let's go

There was this tortoise
Its shell was covered in jewels and had been since time began
It knew the world through all its histories
And the universe and its mysteries
One day, it came across a man
The two were talking
The tortoise offered to tell him about the future and how the universe ran
Oh, the man killed the tortoise, took his shell
And, with a song on his lips, walked off again
So let's walk off!
Let's go
So let's walk off!
Let's go
Let's walk off
Let's go
So let's walk off
Let's go!

Pack a lunch, wander 'round
Toss the map on the ground
It is inaccurate anyways
We've been getting away
We've been getting away
We are strangers to ourselves
We sneak out, drip by drip
Through paper cuts on our hands
Day after day, nothing's quite the same
We are tourists in our own heads

So let's walk on!
Let's go
Let's walk on!
Let's go
Let's walk on! (I think I feel ready to go)
Let's go
Let's walk on!
Let's go
I think I feel ready to go, I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to go, I think I feel ready to go
I think I feel ready to goEmbed
