Be Brave LyricsFrom day, to day, to day, to day, to today
From day, to day, to day, to day, to today
We carry, we carry, we carry our own weight
From day, to day, to day, to day, to today
As sharks in sheep's clothing, pumping with our hips
Filling every single corner with our soft little gifts of ourselves
Getting carried, so, so carried away
I am not afraid to be dead but it's scary for me to stay
From day to day, to day to day to today
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, and be brave
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, and be brave
At the Parthenon
Ants were climbing 'round
Every head of bronze
At the Parthenon
Another monster hiding inside of a cave
We go from day to day misbehaving in the most appropriate ways
The unicorns missing last call to get on Noah's ship
We don't quit, we won't quit, we can't quit, we just don't quit
Well the Earth doesn't care and we hardly even matter
We're just a bit more piss to push out its full bladder
And as our bodies break down into all their rocky little bits
Piled up under mountains of dirt and silt
And still, the world, it don't give a shit
But be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave! (Be brave!)
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave! (Be brave!)
Be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave, be brave!
Ants were climbing 'round
All them heads of bronze
At the Parthenon
The ants are climbing on1Embed
