Shit in Your Cut Lyrics
I'd hate to be a shit in your cut
But the package it's gonna be late
I buried it in an abandoned lot
When I was young, this was where I played
Dug under the fence with my claws
Smelled the cool dirt on my face
I'm waiting till the hands fall off the clock
Spending dollars at the nickel arcade

I think I'll ride this winter out
I guess I'll ride this winter out

You echo from side to side
Pacing in your clumsy ballet
Based on the books and clothes on the floor
I don't think that this is even your place
When the doctor finally showed up (oh boy!)
His fur was soaking wet
He said that this should do the trick
We hadn't told him what the problem was yet
(Kaw kaw kaw kaw!)

We'll have to ride this winter out
This time we'll ride the winter out
With the strain and the comforting
You know everyone needs to go
But don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once
Expulsion from an exoskeleton
Of our mothers we arrive
Soft, sticky, and cold, we arrive and then start to cry

Oh, all those insects that I sent
Are trapped in my window once again
Empty their pockets out and I'll sort it at the table
Line 'em up then shoo 'em off
Sure as hell they'll all get caught
In our window, pockets full as they are able

The signs all flicker and buzz all night
Passing by you can hear them say, "Hey!
Please won't you just come on in?
Won't you please just go away?"

This time we'll ride the winter out
I guess we'll ride this winter out
I think I'll ride this winter out
(With the strain and the comforting
You know everyone needs to go)
I guess we'll ride this winter out
(But don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once)
It's time we ride the winter out
(With the strain and the comforting
You know everyone needs to go)
I guess we'll ride this winter out
(But don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once)
I think I'll ride this winter out
(With the strain and the comforting
You know everyone needs to go)
I guess we'll ride this winter out
(But don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once)
It's time we ride the winter out
(With the strain and the comforting)
I guess we'll ride this winter out
(With the strain and the comforting)
I think I'll ride the winter out
(With the strain and the comforting)
I guess we'll ride the winter out
(Don't everyone go, don't everyone go at once)3Embed
