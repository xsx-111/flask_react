Strangers to Ourselves LyricsWe're lucky that
We're lucky that we slept
Didn't seem like we realized we'd be stuck in traffic
We're lucky that we slept
Not to be confused the points from the purpose
We're lucky that
We're lucky that we're so capable to forget
How lucky we are, that we are, so easy to forget
How often we become susceptible to regret
I do regret
How often we are confused
How honestly we have tried
But we'll forget
We have designed, have designed, have designed more unusual things as yet
How often we are confused
How honestly we have tried
But will forget
We'll forget2Embed
