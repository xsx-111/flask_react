The Best Room Lyrics
Let loose with your charms
Go reckless, unharmed
We all signed the card:
"Get well, but don't you try too hard"
The lessons unlearned
Oh, this meeting is adjourned
Oh, these Western concerns
Hold my place in line while I get your turn

To the empty balconies we serenade
All the playgrounds where them kids don't get to play
Dirty parkies went and chased them all away
To the game consoles to fatten

The best room they have
Is the last room you want
The bathroom's outside
Police tape is tied
To the doorknobs for rooms
Nine through thirty-two
These Western concerns
We beg while we chew
These Western concerns are all I ever really learned to be concerned with
But don't you, don't you know it's hard
Feeling tired every time that you try?
Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time?

The family living upstairs must have a fleet of rider lawn mowers
While the novelist to my right's convinced that every woman's a whore
But he bothers me time and again
To set him up with my very best friends and I say, "What?!"
Says he doesn't restate but he will not shut up!

Well don't you, don't you know it's hard
Feeling tired every time that you try?
Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time?
Well don't you, don't you know

I'm going to bury
My head in the woods right now
Scan for some mycelium
And bring a little back to town

Well don't you, don't you know it's hard (I'm going to bury)
Feeling tired every time that you try? (My head in the woods right now)
Ain't it hard feeling tired all the time? (Scan for some mycelium and bring a little back to town)
Go reckless, unharmed
Yep, the shut-ins, they're well armed
Well, we all led the charge
'Til we ran aground in our party barge
Every little gift was just one more part of their grift
Oh, yeah, we know it
Oh, yeah, we know it

The best news that we got
Was some dumb hokum we'd all bought
Oh, though reckless, feeling great
We're the sexiest of all primates
Let's let loose with our charms
Shake our ass and wave our arms
All going apeshit5Embed
