Of Course We Know LyricsThe streets are just blankets and we sleep on their silky course
Covered up by them, why would we ever want to wake up?
Oh, no
Well, of course, of course, of course, of course
Of course we just do not know
What in hell are we here for?
We just do not know
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
The air is like cotton that we wear wherever we go
Covered up by this, why would we ever want to try on your clothes?
Well, of course, of course, of course, of course
Of course we just do not know
Well, Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down
(Lay down your guard)
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your own damn soul
Lord lay down, Lord lay down, Lord lay down your only son
Of course we know1Embed
