Sweet Instigator LyricsAnyway the water turns
You're always on my mind
Sweet instigator
Anyway the water turns
You're always on my mind
Dear insolation
(You) make me beautiful
You give inspiration
(You) make me beautiful
Know that you can never let me down
We're to sail and see the world right now
Know that you can never let me down
We're to sail and see the world right now
Anyway the water turns
You're always on my mind
Sweet instigator
Anyway the water turns
You're always on my mind
Sweet insolation
(You) make me beautiful
You give inspiration
(You) make me beautiful
Sweet instigator
Know that you can never let me down
We're to sail and see the world right now
Know that you can never let me down
We're to sail and see the world right now
'Cause you're all I ever wished for
And that's You, You, You
'Cause you're all I ever wished for
And that's You, You, You
(You) make me beautiful
You give inspiration
(You) make me beautiful
Any way the water turns
You're always on my mind
You made all this
Because you made all this
Sweet insolation
You make me beautiful
You give inspiration
You make me beautiful
Sweet instigator
Know that you can never let me down
We're to sail and see the world right now
Know that you can never let me down
We're to sail and see the world right now
'Cause you're all I ever wished for
And that's You, You, You
'Cause you're all I ever wished for
And that's You, You, You
You make me beautiful
You give inspiration
You make me beautiful
Any way the water turns
You're always on my mind
You made all this
Because you made all thisEmbed
