Do You Love Me LyricsWell there is no one
And my head acts to see
Well there is no one
And my heart needs to speak
And my soul is on fire
And my head has to scream
Do you love me?
Would you open up your door
Do you love me?
It is all I'm hoping for
(Heyhey)
Here I walk undone
With a heart that bleeds
I can hardly think
For my head can only scream
Do you love me?
Would you open up your door
Do you love me?
It is all I'm hoping for
(Heyhey)
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
Do you love me?
(Heyhey)Embed
