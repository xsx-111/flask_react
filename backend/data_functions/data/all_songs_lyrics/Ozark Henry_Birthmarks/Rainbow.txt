Rainbow LyricsWe used to look out for our rainbow
And we still are
From the sideway of our very street
Before we ride
Off towards the isle of things
A club for members only just for us
To have a common goal
All of the night and all of the day
A matter of time is a matter of faith
We used to look out for our rainbow
You and me
We used to look out for our rainbow
Here
We used to look out for our rainbow
Cause freaks we are
From the sideway of our very dream
With lust for life
Picturing a life with wings
As angels we would play the life we know
And share a common goal
All of the night and all of the day
Awake for the tide, awaiting the wave
'Till our sleeplessness will crave
We're gonna catch that wave
We're gonna travel trough the point break
As if we float on air
'Till our sleeplessness will crave
We're gonna catch that wave
We're gonna travel trough the point break
As if we float on air
All of the night and all of the day
A matter of time is a matter of faith
I still wait for our rainbow
I wait for our rainbow
I still wait for our rainbow
I wait for our rainbow
'Till our sleeplessness will craveEmbed
