Rescue LyricsKill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Would you sing that tune for me
And make me sail towards your knee
To lose my boat amid the sea
With all my hope and disbelief
Would you rescue me
With the pills you have in mind
Would you rescue me
Like an architect of life
'Cause I'm on to you
Like you're on to the world
Would you pull the fuse on me
And take me out like lovers sleep
On afternoons, in troubled dreams
To lose a love that finders keep
Would you rescue me
With the pills you have in mind
Would you rescue me
Like an architect of life
'Cause I'm on to you
Like you're on to the world
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Would you rescue me
With the pills you have in mind
Would you rescue me
Like an architect of life
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
For she needs to...
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jar
Kill and lock me
Kill and lock me in a jarEmbed
