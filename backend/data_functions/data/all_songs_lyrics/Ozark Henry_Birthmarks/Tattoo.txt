Tattoo LyricsWeather's great for the time of year
And I'm glad we can share being here
I tattoo you, you tattoo me
We restore our souls
We set off down
As summer leads the way
It rushes on us
It's more than a game
I tattoo you, you tattoo me
Anyway
Anyhow
Interest in life is free
Bring it on, bring it on
Interest in life is free
Bring it on, bring it on
Interest in life is free
We put it down
Every single curve
And every move that rocks us through this
I tattoo you, you tattoo me
We restore our souls
We set off down
As summer leads the way
It rushes on us
It's more than a game
I tattoo you, you tattoo me
Anyway
Anyhow
Interest in life is free
Bring it on, bring it on
Are we never to have pleasure
Never ever to have faith
Never to let the imagination fulfil itself
Whatever it takes?
Are we never to have leisure
Never ever to feel safe
Never to let the imagination fulfil itself?
Interest in life is freeEmbed
