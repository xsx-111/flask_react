This Is All I Have LyricsThis is all I have
It's been spread out loud
You took all of me
Everything
Nothing left to pack
But my cigarettes
And a photograph
You forgot
Still I'm on my way
Chasing love behind
Not knowing what to find
All I know
Still I'm on my way
Oh for all I care
Hanging on to love's
Sweetest crime
Am I guilty of
All that you've committed
All of what you did
Everything?
Rumours spread around
That I was unsound
That I let you down
All the way
Still I'm on my way
Chasing love behind
Not knowing what to find
All I know
Still I'm on my way
Oh for all I care
Hanging on to love's
Sweetest crimeEmbed
