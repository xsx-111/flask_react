Word Up LyricsWord up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
There's no way for you to know how you're wanted
Passing here, passing here unwanting
Every morning as I wake
I'm greeting all things
Like Mark in his poem
Looking forward just to see you pass
So I can catch a glimpse of you
It is time I let you know (2x)
It is making me nervous
Are you the one for me?
Are you the only one?
It is time I let you know (2x)
It is making me nervous
Are you the one for me?
Are you the only one?
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
There's no way for you to know how you're wanted
Passing here, passing here unwanting
Would you wear the jeans
You wore before
The day it rained all afternoon?
Maybe not because it's far to warm
And that's ok, we're halfway June
It is time I let you know (2x)
It is making me nervous
Are you the one for me?
Are you the only one?
It is time I let you know
It is making me nervous
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
I am looking out for means
To star into your dreams, girl
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
Word up, word up heyhey
Word up, word up
Are you the one for me?
Are you the only one?
