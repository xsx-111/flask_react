Honeymoon Blues LyricsBetty Mae, Betty Mae, you shall be my wife someday
Betty Mae, Betty Mae, you shall be my wife someday
I wants a little sweet girl, that will do anything, that I say
Betty Mae, you is my heartstring, you is my destiny
Betty Mae, you is my heartstring, you is my destiny
And you rolls across my mind, baby, each and every day
Li'l girl, li'l girl, my life seem so misery
Hmm hmm, little girl, my life seem so misery
Baby, I guess it must be love, now, hoo mm, Lord that's takin' effect on me
Some day I will return, with the marriage license in my hand
Some day I will return, hoohoo, with a marriage license in my hand
I'm gon' take you for a honeymoon, in some long, long distant landEmbed
