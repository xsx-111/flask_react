Love In Vain (Take 1) Lyrics
I wanna go with our next one myself

And I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
And I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain
All my love's in vain

When the train rolled up to the station
I looked her in the eye
When the train rolled up to the station
And I looked her in the eye
Well, I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome
And I could not help but cry
All my love's in vain

When the train, it left the station
With two lights on behind
When the train, it left the station
With two lights on behind
Well, the blue light was my blues
And the red light was my mind
All my love's in vain
Ou hou ou ou ou
Hoo, Willie Mae
Oh oh oh oh oh hey
Hoo, Willie Mae
Ou ou ou ou ou ou hee vee oh woe
All my love's in vainEmbed
