Drunken Hearted Man (Take 1) LyricsI'm a drunken hearted man
My life seems so misery
I'm a drunken hearted man
My life seems so misery
And if I could change my way of livin'
It would mean so much to me
I been dogged and I been driven
Ever since I left my mother's home
I been dogged and I been driven
Ever since I left my mother's home
And I can't see the reason why
That I can't leave these no-good women's alone
My father died and left me
My poor mother done the best that she could
My father died and left me
My poor mother done the best she could
Every man like that game you call love
But it don't mean no man no good
And I'm the drunken hearted man
And sin was the cause of it all
I'm a drunken hearted man
And sin was the cause of it all
And the day that you get weak for no-good women
That's the day that you bound to fallEmbed
