Me and the Devil Blues (Take 2) LyricsEarly this mornin', when you knocked upon my door
Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door
And I said, "hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go"
Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side
Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side
I'm goin' to beat my woman, until I get satisfied
She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round
(Spoken: Now, baby, you know you ain't doin' me right, now)
She say you don't see why, ooh, that I will dog her 'round
It must-a be that old evil spirit, so deep down in the ground
You may bury my body, down by the highway side
(Spoken: Baby, I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone)
You may bury my body, ooh, down by the highway side
So my old evil spirit, can get a Greyhound bus and rideEmbed
