Little Queen Of Spades (Take 2) LyricsMmm, she is a little queen of spades, and the men will not let her be
Hoo ooo ooh, she is a little queen of spades, and the men will not let her be
Everytime she makes a spread, hoo, cold chill just runs all over me
Well, I'm gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if its the last thing that I do
Ooh hoo eee, gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if its the last thing that I do
A man don't need a woman, hoo, fair brown, he got to give all of his money to
Well everybody say she got a mojo, baby, you've been usin' that stuff
Hmm hmm hmm, everybody say she got a mojo, 'cause she been usin' that stuff
She got a way trimmin' down, hoo we', babe, and I mean it's most too tough
Well, well, little girl, since I am the king, fair brown, and you is a queen
Hoo ooh ooe, since I am the king, baby, and you is a queen
Let's we put our heads together, hoo, fair brown, then we can make our money greenEmbed
