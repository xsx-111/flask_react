The View from This Tower LyricsWhen I leave here I'll be glad
Much like the ones that drove me out
Their smiling heads bag as one
Taking care, nurture your ego
But we're not being chosen the truth they bear
I said let them play with their power and fracture
Let's take on something less petty
I'm ready to move on
I'm readyEmbed
