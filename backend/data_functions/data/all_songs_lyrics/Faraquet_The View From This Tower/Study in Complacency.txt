Study in Complacency LyricsTake the pill now
Makes you sane
Ruin the face-line
Like to care
Couldn't sleep late
Couldn't be on time if I tried
Obligation
Is a world that inviting when you can't control
I give in to the promise
I can see what a useless man I've become
I debate with existence
Ask myself and I know
Not give answers
I'd rather be blind
Had a big tear
Seems like days
Had to come now
But I can't
Makes a circle
Restlessness made out of
Had to come now
But I won't
I'd like to get closer to you
From the words that we share
Spent a lifetime
Giving out
Obligation
Is a world that inviting when you can't control
I give in to the promise
I can see what a useless man I've become
I debate with existence
Ask myself and I know
Don't believe
I've ever had the pleasure
I'm not careful
Wish I could say
I was wrong
I was wrong
I don't get itEmbed
