Cut Self Not LyricsCut self not
To validate the life as whole
I would say
How splintered and locked away
Tired of sin
Here I am afraid
To set the ties and attain
Away
To be caught up in it somehow
Here in your mind
Cut self not
Just forget a battle with split self
I would fail
So what if I walked away
Take a second and look at what you have
Take a second and look at what you don't have
One with another locked out
On my own, it's the same thing
Sometimes I get it
No time to get itEmbed
