Conceptual Separation of Self LyricsShare
Form and space
The lost wait on us
Know when
Heart beats dark warnings
It's gone
This concept of separation, well
Put it this way its not
Giving hope for it
But I don't give a damn
Hold out
Anyway you want it all
Cold heart makes good
Bright lines have deceit
One could make it solid
But I don't give a damn
Hold out
Anyway I want it allEmbed
