Song for Friends to Me LyricsBreak the back the ones that help to hold you
Then come again
Beat your head against you know we made you
You'll fall again, you're fucked!
Change your crack, complaining how it's so hard
I sympathize
One into the next is how it's done here
You'll fall again, you're fucked!
We're okay
I know you well
We're okay
You'll fall again, you're fucked!Embed
