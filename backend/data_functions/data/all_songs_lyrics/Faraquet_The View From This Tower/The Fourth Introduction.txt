The Fourth Introduction LyricsYou sink to a re-breathe
Then to breathe in
Position ideology
With no substance
What's in a word
Deserves new meaning
Terror flown high
Single file, existence
For kid doing bom with open arms
Could make us feel dead
We've been killing for
One last fillet pig
Taunt me, save me
Answer quietly
Fate of flown high
Single file, existenceEmbed
