Infinite Arms Lyrics
I had a dream, I had a dream
That I was your neighbor, about to give birth and then
Everything was really hurtin'
And I was so lonely I didn't see it's like
Living in a movie, twistin' the plot
My friends and family, little things I got, I got
When my thoughts drift to you

I love the morning, I like to listen
To 4 AM birdies begging to feed, now there's
Something here before me, a figure I think
Isn't there a warning or something to drink? My god, my god
When my thoughts drift to you
When my thoughts drift to you


These mended bones, the storms approach
Ever so slowly out on the sea, there's a
Animal below me, lack of control
Others came before me, others to come, to come
When my thoughts drift to you
When my thoughts drift to you1Embed
