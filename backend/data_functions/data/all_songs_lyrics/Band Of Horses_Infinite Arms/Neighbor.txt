Neighbor Lyrics
The wind blew a path through the fallen leaves
And there showed a crack in the old oak tree
The door stood as if it was standing guard
Of the dozen chipmunks in the backyard

Every house's not a home
But dare do I roam
There's a light on the porch here for someone

And once upon a time in a border town
The war was over, the guns laid down
The women, the men, the children saved
Now it's hard to remember it any other way
When the law acts as though there's nothing to show
There's compassion and depth in a neighbor

Now if Bartles and Jaymes didn't need no first names
We could live by our own laws and favor

Every house's not a home
But dare do I roam
There's a light on the porch here for someone
Now if Bartles and Jaymes didn't need no first names
We could live by our own laws and favorEmbed
