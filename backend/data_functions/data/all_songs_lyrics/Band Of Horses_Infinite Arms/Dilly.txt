Dilly Lyrics
Just the mentioning of (just the mention of)
Such a simple phrase
Are we passengers on (separated trains)
Separated trains?
Take the mask off (take the masking off)
When you speak to me
And I'm alright to go on (it's the little things)
It's the little things

But anymore, you've become
Ethereal to everyone
To everyone

I'm reeling in the wrong day, getting behind
Why didn't I think, "What in the world?"
It really took a tall one to see it, two to believe it
Three to just get in the way

All your life to think of (all your life think of)
What a mess you made
Dig a hole in the ground (for your wedding ring)
For your wedding ring
Rainmaker call (the rainmaker call)
Throw your hammer down
And everything that I know (can't remember now)
Can't remember now
Anymore, you've become
Inherent of another one
Another one

I'm reeling in the wrong day, getting behind
Why didn't I think, "What in the world?"
It really took a tall one to see it, two to believe it
Three to just get in the way2Embed
