For Annabelle Lyrics
If I want to walk home with you
Hearin' every word, thinkin' it's true
The barren field for us to cut through
On our victory lap, 'cross an old street cat

That turns to stop and see you
A small stone somewhere in your shoe
All day long
All day long, long

The old folks wake up for the day
Seeing the monsters have lingered from the past
And a great bird is flying away from our family tree
Something wrong with me

Yeah, I got a secret or two
Hiding somewhere but it won't take long
No it won't take long, longEmbed
