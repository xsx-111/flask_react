Factory Lyrics
The elevator in the hotel lobby has a lazy door
The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seein' just the very sight of me
Decided he better hike it to the second floor

It's temporary, this place I'm in
I permanently won't do this again
My belongings scattered all across the hotel floor

Now and later, I was thinkin' it over by the snack machine
I thought about you and a candy bar
The Now and Laters, now and I've got 'em stuck between my teeth
I fell asleep to the greatest movie of the year

A man gets lonely, for Heaven's sake
He's wonderin' only what did you do today
The world is spinnin' 'round into an old, sad song

Well it's comin' down outside like I've never even seen before
I fell into some kind of sorry state
Lookin' back now, I think it's finally time for me to laugh about it
Get my things together and find something to say
Well I feel awful and I believe
Time gets wasted in this misery
And darling I never wanna come back home1Embed
