On My Way Back Home Lyrics
On my way back home, by chance I thought of
All my favorite songs, where I'd gone wrong
The only words that I could think of
I'm pissin' my life away in the form of a song
On my way back home

Every step, a victory it was
I was cheatin' death, just in time I woke
My memories start to wander off
Come to me, the rememberance of
On my way back home

I've come in this way and here now I'll stay
If the unknown have to wait one more day
There's often times that it comes out wrong
But luckily I, I got a mind to know
On my way back home1Embed
