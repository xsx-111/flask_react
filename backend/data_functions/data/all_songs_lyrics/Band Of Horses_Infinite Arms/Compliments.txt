Compliments Lyrics
I'm fixin' a drink in the morning with the way things are
You may have stayed too long
You're splittin' apart at the seams from the hospital call
You've known him so long

If there's a God up in the air
Someone lookin' over everyone
At least you got somethin' to fall back on

Deep in the heart of the country was a house I built from logs
A raven and a lady hawk
A quiet and calm through the day
See the sun burn through the fog
Approachin' was a yellow dog

If there's a God up in the air
Someone lookin' over everyone
At least you got somethin' to fall back on
What are people really for?
Does anybody even care?
I'll bet you get a lot of compliments down there
If there's a God up in the air
Someone lookin' over everyone
At least you got somethin' to fall back on
Do you got somethin' to say?
Isn't somethin' comin' over you?
Do you got important things still left to do?Embed
