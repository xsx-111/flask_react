Laredo Lyrics
Gonna take a trip to Laredo
Gonna take a dip in the lake
Oh, I'm at a crossroads with myself
I don't got no one else
Impossibilities at the door
I won't be needing them anymore
Oh is this the first time in your life
It's hard just to get by?

But oh, my love, don't you even know?
And oh, my love, are you really gone?

Can you see the world through a window?
Are you havin' troubles in droves?
Oh, it ain't the worst thing I could do
Is get back home to you
I put a bullet in my Kia Lorenzo
A kitchen knife up to my face
Throw me in the deep of Jammer Lake
Believe me when I say
That oh, my love, you don't even call
And oh, my love, is that you on the phone? Oh

Oh, my love, you don't even know
Oh, my love, are you really gone? OhEmbed
