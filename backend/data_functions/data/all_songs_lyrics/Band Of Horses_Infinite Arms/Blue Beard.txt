Blue Beard Lyrics
I used to see the night so anxious, but now I know
The only thing it ever taught me was a grand illusion
That comes and goes
The city blanketed of snow

What if we die?
No end and no conclusion
How could you smile, just walk away? Well I don't know
I don't know

I met you at the railroad station, now years ago
And somethin' happened on the night I last drank with you
In the neon glow
Now I don't see you anymore

The midwestern sky is gray and cold
The sun never shines but that's alright
And I couldn't find the letters that you wrote me
What did you write? Where'd you go, well I don't know
No

Take a little time, gonna roll the dice
Taken for a ride, any normal life will do, too
Find another way, try break the ice
Everyday and night, the banana peels were true, trueEmbed
