Older Lyrics
Climb the cliff, tower over all
And fallin' water, fallin' waterfall

After all my plans, they melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get older

It's time to dry off tattered overalls
Impatient waiting, way to hide a fall

After all my plans, they melt into the sand
Yeah you will be there on my mind through all
Don't want to understand why you never get olderEmbed
