NW Apt. Lyrics
Northwest apartment, apartment
I'm driving over in Moclips, babe
With the whole neighbourhood in tow
Somebody trapped in the underground basement
Just a few blocks down the road
Northwest apartment, apartment
With three guitars and one amplifier
I'm gonna blow the dust off this scene
Everybody in population
Are gonna find out what I mean
Northwest apartment, apartment

When all the parts equal more than the sum
And the sum equals none

This thing was built in a day
Both knowing that the Romans took longer than that
We brought a bass player, a cold old soul
And he's a first-class welcome mat
Well cleaned apartment, apartment
In the morning I wake up
I'm ready for the night time to begin
And what's that over there on my pillow
Someone sleeping in my bed
Northwest apartment, apartment
When all the parts equal more than the sum
And the sum equals none

Yeah, wellEmbed
