Being at War with Each Other LyricsEveryone comes from one father, one mother
So why do we complicate our lives so much
By being at war with each other
Maybe I'm crazy, but I don't understand it
Why do we seem to vote to dig more holes
It's such a waste of a planet
There must be a reason that I can't see
Maybe somebody else knows better than me
All I know is
Everyone else is a sister or brother
So we've got to look around again and stop
Being at war with each otherEmbed
