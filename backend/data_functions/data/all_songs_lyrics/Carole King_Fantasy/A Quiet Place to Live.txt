A Quiet Place to Live LyricsAll I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can enjoy the fruits of my labor
Read the paper
And not have to cry out loud
In my mind I can see it crystal clear
Sharing my dreams with the people around me
Now they surround me
And I'm just a part of the crowd
What will become of us
What about the children
What will they do to us next time around
What will the answer be
What will it mean to me
When are they gonna see we're underground
Here underground
And all I want is a quiet place to live
Where I can be free in a world of my making
Instead of taking
What they decided to give
I wouldn't want what they have - no
If I could only find
A quiet place to liveEmbed
