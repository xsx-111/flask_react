Haywood LyricsHaywood, where have you been, tell me now
Haywood, you been on the street again, I know, I know
Haywood, that man's not your friend
Haven't you had enough of the stuff
Oh, you know it's got to do you in
Remember John John
How mama stayed awake all night
The night they brought him in
She cried and said she always knew he was up to no good
It broke her heart the night he died
And she made me promise I'd stand by your side
And try to protect you from the evil in the neighborhood
Haywood, where have you been, tell me now
Haywood, you been on the street again, I know, I know
Haywood, hangin' out with your so-called friends
What makes you think that you'll be the one to put it down
Use your ears, use your eyes, just look around
Everyone's dying, everyone's going down
Just think of Vallorie
She's always been so good to you and you've never let her down
What about the life you planned
It can still come true, it's all up to you
I know it's hard to shake it
But you got to be a man and take it
I know this is no way to make it
It's not too late for you
Listen to me, HaywoodEmbed
