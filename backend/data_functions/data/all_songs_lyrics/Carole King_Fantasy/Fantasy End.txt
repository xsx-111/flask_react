Fantasy End LyricsNow that I've expressed my soul
I'll step back into my real-life role
And hope I've brought you back across the line
You may think there's nothing you can do
To change what's all-too-true
But all you have to do is use your mind
In fantasy you can be anything you want to be
And someday our reality will be as good as never never landEmbed
