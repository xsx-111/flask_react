Welfare Symphony LyricsWelfare workers
Prying into her life
Was she really someone's wife
And where was he
She often cried as they left her without a shred of pride
She had so many things to think about
So many children to feed
She had need of something that would ease her mind
(Store-front religion--play the numbers)
She had trouble in her time
She had so much trouble in her timeEmbed
