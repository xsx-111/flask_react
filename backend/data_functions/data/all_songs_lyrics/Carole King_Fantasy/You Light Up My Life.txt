You Light Up My Life LyricsYou light up my life like sunrise in the morning
You make me believe anything is possible
I didn't have a dream to my name
Darkness was mine, it was such a shame
But you came to light up my life
You brought me faith and hope and love and light
With your tender smile you brought me to the promise
Of life outside a world of 9-to-5 and Sunday
I didn't know how rich I could be
Until you gave your love to me
Don't you see, you light up my life
You give me faith and hope and love and light
You brought your sweet understanding
Like sun rays in my hazy skies
If you hadn't opened up my eyes
Love would have passed me by, right on by
I never knew how good I could feel
Loving you's left me with nothing to conceal
Yeah--you really light up my life
You give me faith and hope and love and lightEmbed
