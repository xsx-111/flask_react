Believe in Humanity Lyrics(Words and music by Carole King)
If you read the papers you may see
History in the making
You'll read what they say life is all about
They say it's there for the taking
Yeah, but you should really check it out
If you want to know what's shaking
But don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm wrong, but I want to believe in humanity
I know it's often true - sad to say
We have been unkind to one another
Tell me how many times has the golden rule
Been applied by man to his brother
I believe if I really looked at what's going on
I would lose faith I never could recover
So don't tell me about the things you've heard
Maybe I'm wrong, but I want to believe in humanity
Maybe I'm living with my head in the sand
I just want to see people giving
I want to believe in my fellow man
Yes, I want to believeEmbed
