A Night to Remember Lyrics
I can't sleep tonight
I won't sleep tomorrow
I'm going deep and tight
I don't need no excuse
I feel mean tonight
One-eyed jacks and aces
Read 'em and weep tonight
I'm going to let all hell break loose

I want drums like thunder
Gimme guitars that scream
One woman who could shake me
Yeah, be my love machine

I need a love machine
To keep my motor running
Upon the big wide screen
I want to see it all
Yeah, we'll be lean and mean
We'll be synchronized together
Me and my love machine
We're going to do it all
I want drums like thunder
Gimme guitars that scream
One woman who can rock me
Yeah, my little love machine

We're going to make tonight
A night to remember
We're going hard and strong
Again and again
Yeah, we're going to make tonight
A night to remember
Yeah we're going to take tonight
Right to the end

I need drums like thunder
Gimme guitars that scream
One woman who can rock me
I need a love machine

We got to make tonight
A night to remember
We're goin' hard and strong
Again and again
Yeah, we're going to make tonight
A night to remember
Yeah we're going for a night
A night without end


We're going to make tonight
A night to remember
Yeah we're going to take tonight
Right to the endEmbed
