Orange and Red Beams LyricsOrange and red beams
In and out
Peek through my window
In the night
The baby was born
Before a storm
And now I believe them
What they said
The thousand people
Who aren't really dead
The baby was born
Before a storm
And now a fate calls him a mile away
'Cause orange and red beams
Yes, are here to stay
Now I believe him
Before I escape
The thousand people
Do not really care
The baby was born
Before a storm
Orange and red beams, orange and red beams
Orange and red beams, orange and red beams
Orange and red beams, orange and red beams...Embed
