Just the Thought LyricsThere’s a staircase in my living room
And it leads to (k)nowhere land
There are flowers growing from my wall
They lend a touching hand
They are flowers that only I can touch
I must turn my back before I rush
To their self-destroying beauty
That only I can touch
I slowly turn, and take a step
I feel a change, that I accept
Is it a game I will regret
As I play I see me winning
And I gain what’s called self pride
And I turn around with a smiling sigh
See a flower that has died
I feel a change, another change
Another game, I will have learnt
There’s a staircase in my living room
And it leads to (k)nowhere land
There are flowers growing from my wall
They need a helping hand
I feel a change, another change
Another game I will have learnt
I slowly turn, and take a step
I feel a change, that I’ll accept
Is it a game, I will regretEmbed
