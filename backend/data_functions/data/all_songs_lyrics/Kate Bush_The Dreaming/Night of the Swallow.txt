Night of the Swallow Lyrics
The night doesn't like it
Looks just like your face on the moon to me
And I won't let you do what you want to do
It's funny how, even now
You're laughing

I won't let you do it

If you go, I'll let the law know
And they'll head you off when you touch the ground
Ooh, please, don't go through with this
I don't like the sound of it
It's funny how, even now
You're miles away

I won't let you do it
I won't let you do it
I won't let you go through with it

"Meet them over at Dover
I'll just pilot the motor
Take them over the water
With a hired plane
And no names mentioned
Tonight's the night of the flight
Before you know
I'll be over the water like a swallow
There's no risk
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight
And though pigs can fly
They'll never find me posing as the night
And I'm home before the morning"

In Malta, catch a swallow
For all of the guilty - to let them free
Wings fill the window
And they beat and bleed
They hold the sky on the other side
Of borderlines

I won't let you do it
I won't let you do it
I won't let you go through with it

"Meet them over at Dover
I'll just pilot the motor
Take them over the water
Like a swallow flying to Malta
With a hired plane
And no names mentioned
Tonight's the night of the flight
Before you know
I'll be over the water like a swallow
There's no risk
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight
And though pigs can fly
They'll never find me posing as the night
And I'm home before the morning"

"Give me a break!
Ooh, let me fly!
Give me something to show
For my miserable life!
Something to take!
Would you break even my wings
Like a swallow?"

Let me, let me go
"With a hired plane
And no names mentioned
Tonight's the night of the flight
Before you know
I'll be over the water like a swallow
There's no risk
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight
And though pigs can fly
They'll never find me posing as the night
And I'm home before the morning"
Let me, let me go
"With a hired plane
And no names mentioned
Tonight's the night of the flight
Before you know
I'll be over the water like a swallow"
Let me, let me go
"There's no risk
I'll whisk them up in no moonlight
And though pigs can fly
They'll never find me posing as the night
Like a swallow
And I'm home before the morning"

But you're not a swallow5Embed
