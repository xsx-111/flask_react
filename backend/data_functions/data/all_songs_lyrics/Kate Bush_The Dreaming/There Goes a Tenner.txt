There Goes a Tenner Lyrics
Okay, remember
Okay, remember
That we have just allowed half an hour
To get in, do it and get out
The sense of adventure
Is changing to danger
The signal has been given:
I go in, the crime begins

My excitement
Turns into fright

(Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh)
All my words fade
What am I gonna say?
Mustn't give the game away

We're waiting
We're waiting
We're waiting

We got the job sussed
This shop's shut for business
The lookout has parked the car but kept the engine running
Three beeps means trouble's coming
I hope you remember
To treat the gelignite tenderly for me
I'm having dreams about things not going right
Let's leave in plenty of time tonight
Both my partners
Act like actors

You are Bogart, he is George Raft
That leaves Cagney and me
What about Edward G.?

We're waiting
We're waiting
We're waiting

You blow the safe up
Then all I know is I wake up, covered in rubble
One of the rabble needs mummy
"What's all this then?"
The government will never find the money
"What's all this then?"
I've been here all day
A star in strange ways
Apart from a photograph, they'll get nothing from me
Not until they let me see my solicitor
Ooh, I remember
That rich, windy weather
When you would carry me
Pockets floating in the breeze
Ooh, there goes a tenner
Hey, look! There's a fiver
There's a ten-shilling note
Remember them?
That's when we used to vote for him3Embed
