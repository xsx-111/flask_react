The Dreaming Lyrics
"Bang!" goes another kanga on the bonnet of the van
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree
'Til you near him on the motorway and the tree begin to breathe
See the light ram through the gaps in the land

Come in with the golden light
In the morning
Come in with the golden light
Is the New Man
Come in with the golden light
Is my dented van
Woomera

The civilised keep alive the territorial war
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
Erase the race that claim the place and say we dig for ore
Or dangle devils in a bottle and push them from the Pull of the Bush
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
You find them in the road
See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand
In the road

Come in with the golden light
In the morning
Come in with the golden light
With no warning
Come in with the golden light
We bring in the rigging
Dig, dig, dig, dig away

Many an Aborigine's mistaken for a tree
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
You near him on the motorway and the tree begin to breathe
Erase the race that claim the place and say we dig for ore
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
Dangle devils in a bottle and push them from the Pull of the Bush
See the sun set in the hand of the man

'Bang!' goes another kanga on the bonnet of the van
See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand
You find them in the road
See the light ram through the gaps in the land
In the road
See the light
Push 'em from the
Pull of the Bush
See the light bounce off the rocks to the sand
Push 'em from the
Pull of the Bush
See the sun set in the hand of the man
