Pull Out the Pin Lyrics
Just as we hit the green
I've never been so happy to be alive
Only seven miles behind
You could smell the child
The smell of the front line's survival

With my silver Buddha and my silver bullet

You learn to ride the Earth
When you're living on your belly and the enemy is city-birth
Who need radar? We use scent
They stink of the west
Stink of sweat
Stink of Cologne and Baccy and all their yankee hash

With my silver Buddha and my silver bullet

I'm pulling on the pin
Ooh, pull out, pull out the pin
Pulling on the pin, woah...
Just one thing in it: me or him
I love life!
Pull out the pin
Just one thing in it: me or him
I love life!
Pull out the pin
Just one thing in it: me or him
And I love life! I love life! I love life!
Oh, oh, pull out the pin

I've seen the coat for me
I'll track him 'til he drops, then I'll pop him one he won't see
He's big and pink and not like me
He sees no light, he sees no reason for the fighting

With my silver Buddha and my silver bullet

I had not seen his face
'Til I'm only feet away unbeknown to my prey
I look in American eyes
I see little life, see little wife
He strike a violence up in me
With my silver Buddha and my silver bullet

I'm pulling on the pin
Ooh, pull out, pull out the pin
Pulling on the pin, woah...

Just one thing in it: me or him
I love life!
Pull out the pin
Just one thing in it: me or him
I love life!
Pull out the pin
Just one thing in it: me or him
And I love life! I love life! I love life!
Oh, oh, pull out the pin


Just one thing in it: me or him
And I love life!
So I pull out the pin
Just one thing in it: me or him
And I love life!
So I pull out the pin
Just one thing in it: me or him
And I love life! I love life! I love life!
I love life! I love life! I love life!
I love life! I love life! I love life!
