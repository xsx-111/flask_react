Houdini Lyrics
I wait at the table
And hold hands with weeping strangers
Wait for you to join the group

The tambourine, jingle-jangle
The medium roams and rambles
Not taken in, I break the circle

I want this man
To go away now

With a kiss, I'd pass the key
And feel your tongue
Teasing and receiving
With your spit
Still on my lip
You hit the water


Him and I in the room
To prove you are with us too
He's using code that only you and I know
This is no trick of his, this is your magic
I'd catch the queues, watching you
Hoping you'd do something wrong
Everybody thinks you'll never make it
But every time you escape
Rosabel, believe
Not even eternity
Can hold Houdini!
"Rosabel, believe!"

Through the glass
I'd watch you breathe
Not even eternity
Bound and drowned
And paler than you've ever been
Will hold Houdini
With your life
The only thing in my mind
We pull you from the water
Houdini...


You
And I
And Rosabel believe1Embed
