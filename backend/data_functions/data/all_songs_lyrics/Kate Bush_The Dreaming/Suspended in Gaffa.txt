Suspended in Gaffa Lyrics
Out in the garden there's half of a heaven
And we're only bluffing - we're not ones for busting through walls
But they've told us unless we can prove that
We're doing it we can't have it all
I want it all

He's gonna wangle a way to get out of it
She's an excuse and a witness who'll talk when he's called
But they've told us unless we can prove that
We're doing it we can't have it all
I want it all, I want it all
We can't have it all
I want it all

"I caught a glimpse of God, all shining and bright..."

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you
Can I have it all?
I try to get nearer, but as it gets clearer
There's something appears in the way - it's a plank in me eye
With a camel who's trying to get through it
Am I doing it? Can I have it all now?
I want it all

I pull out the plank and say, "Thank you for yanking me
Back to the fact that there's always something to distract
But sometimes it's hard to know if I'm doing it right"
Can I have it all now?
I want it all
Can I have it all now?
I want it all
Can I have it all?
I want it all
I can't have it all

"We all have a dream... maybe"

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you
Can I have it all?
I won't open boxes that I am told not to
I'm not a Pandora, I'm much more like
That girl in the mirror between you and me
She don't stand a chance of getting anywhere at all
I want it all
Not anywhere at all
I want it all
No, not a thing
I want it all
She can't have it all

"Mother, where are the angels? I'm scared of the changes"

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in Gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you

Suddenly my feet are feet of mud
It all goes slow-mo
I don't know why I'm crying
Am I suspended in Gaffa?
Not until I'm ready for you
Not until I'm ready for you
Can I have it all now?7Embed
