Sky Blue and Black Lyrics
In the calling out to one another of the lovers up and down the strand
In the sound of the waves and the cries of the seagulls circling the sand
In the fragments of the songs carried down the wind from some radio
In the murmuring of the city in the distance ominous and low

I hear the sound of the world where we played
And the far too simple beauty of the promises we made

If you ever need holding
Call my name, I'll be there
If you ever need holding
And no holding back, I'll see you through
Sky blue and black

Where the touch of the lover ends and the soul of the friend begins
There's a need to be separate and a need to be one and a struggle neither wins
Where you gave me the world I was in and a place I could make a stand
I could never see how you doubted me when I'd let go of your hand

Yeah, and I was much younger then
And I must have thought that I would know if things were going to end
And the heavens were rolling
Like a wheel on a track
And our sky was unfolding
And it'll never fold back
Sky blue and black


And I'd have fought the world for you
If I thought that you wanted me to
Or put aside what was true or untrue
If I'd known that's what you needed
What you needed me to do

But the moment has passed by me now
To have put away my pride and just come through for you somehow


You're the color of the sky reflected in each store-front window pane
You're the whispering and the sighing of my tires in the rain
You're the hidden cost and the thing that's lost in everything I do
Yeah and I'll never stop looking for you
In the sunlight and the shadows and the faces on the avenue
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
That's the way love is
Sky blue and blackEmbed
