The Icing On The World Lyrics
When is it good or not good
To perceive a petrifying life
Or to solving a problem
That's here tomorrow, gone today
"I am a worthy subject"
Says one person catching somebody out
"And I'm tired of all that I am doing now"
Says somebody else

Not to reason why
Ours is but to do and die
Says you, says I
Yes, it's starting to show
But it's already pie in the sky
No reason if adapted for ordinary use
In everyday lives
There's a clause that's not written down
We assume it's just a disguise

Look, I know everything
Knowledge forms the best of me
After all I've done, don't blame me
No, not all the time
I put the icing on the world
Something is wrong, so how is it now?
Is there something on your mind?
Or are your problems deleting the course
That was set in your mind?
Now we are calm
Don't tell me you are living now
What you lived before
There's a will in everyone's mind
To exude an air of some kind

Think back some years, the age of ten
That's not you, that was someone else
Different thoughts and surroundings
Just memories exist today
When is it good?
Tomorrow, the day after?
Is living but a farce?
There must be truth in what I say
Seeing as how the sun shines from my arse

Dull seems the evergreen style of all our unity
And over the fence
An old mother's sympathy makes a spectacle of life
All for the sake of love
Look, I know everything
Knowledge forms the best of me
After all I've done, don't blame me
No, not all the time
I put the icing on the world
Look, I know everything
Knowledge forms the best of me
After all I've done, don't blame me
No, not all the time
I put the icing on the world
