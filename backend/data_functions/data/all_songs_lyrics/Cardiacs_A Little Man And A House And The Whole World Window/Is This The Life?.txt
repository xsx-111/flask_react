Is This The Life? Lyrics
Following around to see a life
That's never in
Always calling itself on its own phone
Though its never quite at home in the world today
See it to arranging the day
Prepared in its own s-special way
With added loving care
Though it's not been there since yesterday

Looking so hard for a cause
And it don't care what it is
And never really ever seeing eye to eye
Though it doesn't really mind, perhaps it's why
It never really saw
Never really saw
Saw, aw aw aw aw
Aw aw aw aw...
