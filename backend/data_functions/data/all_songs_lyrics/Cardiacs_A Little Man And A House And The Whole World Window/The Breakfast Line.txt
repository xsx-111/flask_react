The Breakfast Line Lyrics
"People need to be on the table"
"On the table, we can plead the right to say that I've created my own monster! (created my own monster)"
"Ant and bee and the ABC, hope for the day in my visions"
"I hate this! I wanna go back to my house! Haha, ha! Oh."
"Pa ha haha! Look at him running! Look at our boy! Stupid girl!"
"Ha ha, is everybody happy?"
"Happy as we are, ant and bee and the AB-"
"When I've created my own monster!"
I regard them (by force of habit)
It is so, that's why I
In a few days I will informally la-la-la-la-laugh
Ha ha ha ha ha!
As if withered with despair, which is ever so
Hard
A woman in white surrounded me with a jar
Gave me something I don't need, la la la
But for all I know it's ever so
For all I know it's ever so (ever so)
Ever so hard
Tow, tow the breakfast line
It's not too late, so step in time
Tow, tow the breakfast line
It's easy as can be
Take it fast, take it slow
Take it any way you go
Will despair descend on me?
I don't know
But for all I know it's ever so
For all I know it's ever so (ever so)
Ever so hardEmbed
