Dive Lyrics(HELLO)
Cancel out my lowness with a high, so here we go
Caught in arrears with your different ideas
And I'm saving all my troubles in my
Deceptive calendar mind
It's a dreadful situation really
"What's in a name?" says Elaine and her mind is a
Part of everything in time
She is fattened up for eating with all her parts left behind
She's a sucker for your deepness
Shall we d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-dive?
The will and the ability to grow a foetus of my own some time
Dies (But it does it nicely)
The world she says there's wrong in all she says and do-be-do's
We understand, but I can't when her hand is in
Saving all her troubles in her
Deceptive calendar mind
It's a dreadful situation really
D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dive!
Life is bad so we are led to believe
Bad news makes money's world go round
Anna Ford hammers a post into a cup of mud
Claiming it is the ground
Really then anything is better than that
Is better than watching your
Fake news win in the end
But now it's my turn, nuh-nuh-nuhnuh-nuh-nuh
(Here we go)
Oh, the grand old Duke of York
He had ten thousand men
He marched them up to the top of the hill
And he marched them down again
Oh no!
Dive!
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
Life is constantly on my mind
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
Life is constantly on my mind
Life's a part and it lies on top of me
Life is constantly on my mind
Life's a part and it lies on top of meEmbed
