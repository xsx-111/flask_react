In A City Lining Lyrics
Oh what a plain necessity to be alive
Always too soon to criticise
I have had under my eyes and nose
My mouth singing me lullabies
I have no right to complain that I am alone
And have no-one permanently
But if one "takes it by the hand" the "funny man" laughs
Forever landing them on me

Oh what a plain necessity to be alive
Always too soon to criticise
I have had under my eyes and nose
My mouth singing me lullabies
I have no right to complain that I am alone
And have no-one permanently
But if one "takes it by the hand" the "funny man" laughs
Forever landing them on me

Biting while I'm cutting deep
Makes me end up with a clean sweep, making all my fears
Completely dissolve away
The saving up for the hope day disappears (Get off!)
It's funny how when you breathe in
Your mouth opens, air goes in
She won't boil using Teflon on her
Should I go and put the kettle on her?

Michael's got himself a girlfriend, he's a lucky fellow
Katy's top was as white as ever, but now it's gone all yellow
Malcolm's a bastard and keeps acting like Emperor Nero
Peter is constantly pretending to be a superhero

What's in a name, la la la, what's in a name, la la la
What's in a name, la la la, what's in a name, la la la

Biting while I'm cutting deep
Makes me end up with a clean sweep, making all my fears
(La la la-la-la-la)
Completely dissolve away
The saving up for the hope day disappears
The funny man hiding something
Hands me one thing, trying not to laugh
Then he gives me news of an epitaph
For the creatures dying in my bath
Tracy is turning and revolving in a city lining
Martin keeps his new Lambretta gleaming and shining
All news has its way then leaves me staring at my pillow
All clouds have a silver lining gleaming and shining

All of the time
On the Siegfried Line
All news has its way then leaves me staring at my pillow
All clouds have a silver lining gleaming and shiningEmbed
