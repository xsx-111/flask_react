The Whole World Window LyricsIt's just a funny world
That hides me out of sight
And I will stay with her
All through the day
And through the night
And if she only had
Stopped making that hissing noise
That haunts me now
And makes a joke of me
With all the other boys
And then the world begins to seethe
Then she releases what's closed in on me
And then asks
"Is it just mud that breaks the whole world window?"
And turns as if to try
So do I
So do I
And when I'm really here
That's when I'm really here
My right life begins to disappear
And I remember my mum
Told me out of all my funny toys
That you won't make a man of me
And growing up's an interesting
Thing to do
And then all life begins to scream
The whole world changes like I've never seen
And then she goes up to the window
And leaps into the sky
So do I
So do I
So do I
So do I
Will you sit down
Is everybody happy?
There is a sign outside your house saying
"Everyone is happy"
Well I for one am most certainly not
Is everybody happy?
Is it just mud that breaks the whole world window?
I'll turn as if to try
Poor soldier now you've created your own monster
Then turn as if to tryEmbed
