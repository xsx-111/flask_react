A Little Man And A House LyricsLeaving early, just before the hour
A few moments won't make any difference, not to me anyway
The early bird catches the worm
I don't really want to go in tomorrow
The man will tell me off for leaving early yesterday
Close your eyes dear, never mind
And there's voices inside me
They're screaming, they're telling me
"That's the way we all go"
There's thousands of people just like me all over
But that's the way we all go
What can I do when everyone's been so helpful?
How can I have the right to say I'm different to you?
Oh
But I'm lost not for words or for kindness or sympathy
That's the way we all go
And if you're bigger you fall a bit harder
But that's the way we all go
There's a pain in my side it's a lesson I learned
From a while ago (That's the way we all go)
I'll be screaming inside, I'll be biting my nails
But it won't show (That's the way we all go)
There's a knock at my door as I fall to the floor
But I still don't know (That's the way we all go)
That the people outside shed a tear for my pride
But they still won't go (That's the way we all go)
Why should I think I'm alone the whole factory thinks
That's the way we all go
Then there's Washington, Tokyo, New York and Moscow
But that's the way we all go
They're all crying and arguing down the telephone
But that's the way we all go
Then there's me standing here with my whole life to spare
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
That's the way we all go
It's easier when you know how obviously but that's how it goes
(That's the way we all go)
Look at me now I know something that you don't
But that's the way we all go
The turning wheel reeks of the whale and the whaler
But that's the way we all go
The early bird catches the worm
Does the worm think that that's the way we all go?1Embed
