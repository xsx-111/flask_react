Littlething Lyrics
It's how I've often felt
When I find myself
Oh, on nights like these
Like Christmas Eve
From the empty office window
To the street outside
It's everything not to call
And find out why

It's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away, from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I'm not supposed to think
Eating away at my mind
Could you be with me tonight?

On the cab ride, you said nothing
Just hair all in your face
But I was scared to name it
And nothing changed
So, I walked 'til I just couldn't
Too late, I understood
It was always half invented
But the other half was good
It's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away, from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I'm not supposed to think
Eating away at my mind
Could you be with me tonight?


I know, it's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away, from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I know, I shouldn't think
Eating away at my mind
Could you stay with me tonight?
It's just a little thing
Buried in the other things
Burning away, from inside
Would you stay with me tonight?
And there's a quiet dream
I know, I shouldn't think
Eating away at my mind
Stay with me tonightEmbed
