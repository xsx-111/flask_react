Heart Is Hard to Find Lyrics
I can't compete with the clear eyes of strangers
I'm more and more replaced by my friends each night
I can't compete
I just can't recover
How many years it's been
It's day one in my mind
That's the first step, each time

The heart is hard to find
Yes, the heart is hard to find
It's hard to find the heart sometimes

I can't compete with your new-found religion
The good word seems everywhere
But good words only
I can't compete with a real education
All the fucked up things you say
Couldn't possibly be any less help to me

The heart is hard to find
Yes, the heart is hard to find
It's hard to find the heart sometimes

The heart is hard to find
The heart is hard to find

It's hard to find the heart sometimes
Heart
It's hard to find the heart sometimes
Heart
It's hard to find the heart sometimes
Heart
SometimesEmbed
