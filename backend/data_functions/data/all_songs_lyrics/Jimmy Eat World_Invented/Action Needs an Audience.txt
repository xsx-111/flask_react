Action Needs an Audience Lyrics
I'm hypnotized by rituals
Now that I am on my own
Tranquilized like an animal
All because I lost control

Are you tuning in to our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter, the illuminated
Control the audience

The weight of the world has dragged you down
And took with it what you've earned
Communications lost to the radio
Burning all your bridges down
I may never be quite satisfied but that's the only way I know
I am overcome with sympathy for your, for your pathetic soul

Are you tuning in to our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter, the illuminated
Control the audience
Are you tuning in to our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter, the illuminated
Control the audience

Breathe in the air while you still can
Take all that you have while you still can
Sleep all night while you still can
Breathe

Are you tuning in to our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter, the illuminated
Control the audience
Are you tuning in to our conversation?
Oh yeah, you'll get your chance
The bigger, the brighter, the illuminated
Control the audience1Embed
