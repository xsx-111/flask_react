Higher Devotion Lyrics
The quiet should be nice but isn't
I guess we're going to spend the day like this
In psychic screaming
And don't you feel my eye-lasers hit?
I stare you down, but God, your skin is thick
What's it take to notice?

Show me you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me you can read my mind
Read my mind
Read my mind

I'm tired of all the war you bring home
I command a higher devotion
You better get busy
What makes you think I'd give in for less?
I'm only happy with my happiness
If you push me over, it's over
Show me you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me you can read my mind
Read my mind
Read my mind


Show me you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me you can read my mind
Read my mind
Read my...
Show me you can read my mind
You're useless to me if you
Don't know the why or how
Or what my body needs
Give me something I can feel
Show me you can read my mind
Read my mind
Read my mindEmbed
