Cut Lyrics
I made it
And now, there's no turning back
I know there's no depth you wouldn't sink for the chance
I'm sorry, boy
I'm not cut for this no more

You came in
Yeah, you happened to me
And so, I waited and nothing else has since
I'm sorry, boy
But I'm no good for you no more

If it's your name in lights
And if the time is yours
Then, you'd be on your back
You'd be on this floor
It's the kind of night that I'd always hoped
And he's the kind of guy worth waiting for

There's always some baggage you've got to check
And yeah, I'm trying
Hope that you'd understand
I'm sorry, boy
I'm not cut for this no more
If it's your name in lights
And if the time is yours
You'd be on your back
You'd be on the floor
It's the kind of night that I'd always hoped
And he's the kind of guy worth waiting for
If it's your name in lights
And if the time is yours
You'd be on your back
You'd be on this floor
It's the kind of night that I'd always hoped
And he's the kind of guy worth waiting for

There's always some baggage you've got to check
And yeah, I'm trying
Hope that you'd understand
I'm sorry, boy
I'm not cut for this no more

Yes, I loved you, boy
I'm not cut for this no moreEmbed
