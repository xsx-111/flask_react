Movielike Lyrics
A face coming down in streaks
All alone with your things
The apartment still ringing
Clean up and make my start
Not the way I hoped for
Welcome to New York

Nothing movie-like
And nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already

The train comes at 1:15
He said, "Maybe I'll leave
Give you time, let you think."
Don't know just what he wants
'Cause I'm all that I've got
But this time, I'm on it

Nothing movie-like
And nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best already

This time believe it
Believe me
This time you'd better believe it
You know I'm gone

Nothing movie-like
Nothing magic
People just tire to fight the constant battle
Waiting to see a sign?
Then you've seen the best already

Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best already
Then you've seen the best alreadyEmbed
