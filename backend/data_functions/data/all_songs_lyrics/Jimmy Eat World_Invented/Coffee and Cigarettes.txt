Coffee and Cigarettes Lyrics
When I finally finished school
It was the first thing that I did
What every townie kid dreams of
I packed and started west
A thousand dollars I had saved
And my sister's two cassettes
The Dead from Fillmore East
And Otis Redding's Greatest Hits

Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettes
Coffee and cigarettes

Then, I commit with some restraint
To a boy I thought might care
It didn't work but I found out soon
And never dug roots there
I've been a lot of places since
And nothing else compares
To easy times and easy eyes
To meet you in a stare
Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettes
Coffee and cigarettes


When I finally finished school
It was the first thing that I did
What every townie kid dreams of
I packed and started west

Coffee and cigarettes
As simple as it gets
Of all the things I think I'll miss
There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettes

There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettes
Coffee and cigarettes
There's staying up with you
Coffee and cigarettesEmbed
