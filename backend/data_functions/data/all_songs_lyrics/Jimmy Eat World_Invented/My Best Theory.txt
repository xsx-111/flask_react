My Best Theory Lyrics
It's been a long time, so long
There's only one life I know (I know)
But I have my own mind
I'll say so if it seems right (air rush out)
I see your warm face with the soft mouth
But it speaks something else (else)
I'll take my chances with the cast down
We can feel the air...

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me
In me

(We can feel, we can feel the air rush out)

So many questions
And the answers come back unanswered
Let's hold the old script
It's a new twist
You can feel the air...
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me

In a lonely, real place
Neither part nor mistake
Love what you have with your time
By dousing, find my true desire
My threat, my appetite
(My true desire)
I feel the air...

Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me
Rush out, out from the center
Not like one side is any better
Stand up as they bend, reaching
My best theory?
It’s already in me
In meEmbed
