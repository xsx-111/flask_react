Invented Lyrics
When I first came to see you
I called it Houston Street
Could we meet?
Show me all the things you see
I'm one more here
Some old-time pioneer
Who believes with a shaken faith
I still have some cool

I could leave you here with your 'people'
If I'm the flag you'd not prefer to wave

You're always in my head
You're just what I wanted
I live in constant debt
To feel you, invented

When I first came to LA
I met you the old fashioned way: too drunk
And even worse, much too lonely
I'll leave it there
A busted homesteader
Who believes in virgin grace
Somehow, I'll stay proud
Any dick can roll up in a suit
But only I would know what really moves you

You're always in my head
You're just what I wanted
I live in constant debt
To feel you, invented

There's a cinematic end
I picture it just right
Having trouble with the right words
But you tell me with your eyes
There's something good I miss
There's something I can't find
Do you believe me now?
Can you see it in my eyes?
See it in my eyes?
See it in my eyes?

You're always in my head
You're just what I wanted
I live in constant debt
To feel you, invented1Embed
