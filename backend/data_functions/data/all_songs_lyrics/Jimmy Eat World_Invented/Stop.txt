Stop Lyrics
Don't have to be the prettiest
If you have the mind and willingness
No one stops a girl who knows what sheâ€™s got
No reason why
I can't help following with my eyes
Even at my best
I guess I'm still just one of them

I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am

A combination of strong and lost
How easily you turn, then turn it off
Do you take what you want
Then save it for a better time?
Don't act that way
Honey, I don't buy it at all
If you're really as tough as your defenses
You'd let them fall
I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You can call this a game
You can look at my face
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have


I see it all in my head
The cool hands on your sweat
You wanna make me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You can call this a game
You can look at my face
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you have

You wanna see me mad?
Stop 'cause I am
You wanna hurt me, baby?
Stop 'cause you haveEmbed
