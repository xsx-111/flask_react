Evidence Lyrics
Follow you around until it's time, time to leave
Swimming into the idea of your scene
There all the while, proving patiently
I earned to lie by you when you fall asleep

Hang up a sheet
Between our things
Won't have to see
Evidence
Evidence

I watched you put on a dress I'd never seen
Something that begged for East Atlantic breeze
There all the while, hated quietly
There, just to see a smile... anything

Hang up a sheet
Between our things
Won't have to see
Evidence
You did what you did
The memory lives
Nothing cleans
Evidence
Evidence


Hang up a sheet
Between our things
Won't have to see
Evidence

You did what you did
The memory lives
Nothing cleans
Evidence
