Rita Ballou Lyrics
She could dance that slow Uvalde
Shuffle to some cowboy hustle
How she made them trophy buckles shine, shine, shine
Wild-eyed and Mexican silvered
Tricking dumb old cousin Willard
Into thinking that he got her this time

Hill country honky-tonking Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played a fool for you
Backsliding barrel-riding Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you

She's a rawhide rope and velvet mixture
Walking talking Texas texture
High-timing barroom fixture kind of girl
She's the queen of the cowboys
Look at old Willard grinning now, boys
You'd have thought there's less fools in this world

Hill country honky-tonking Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backsliding barrel-riding Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you
So good luck, Willard, and here's to ya
And here's to Rita and I hope she'll do ya right all night
Lord, I wish I was the fool in your shoes

Hill country honky-tonking Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backsliding barrel-riding Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for you
Hill country honky-tonking Rita Ballou
Every beer joint in town has played the fool for you
Backsliding barrel-riding Rita Ballou
Ain't a cowboy in Texas would not ride a bull for youEmbed
