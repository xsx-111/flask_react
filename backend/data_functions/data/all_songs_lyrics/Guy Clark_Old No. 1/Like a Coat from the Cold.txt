Like a Coat from the Cold Lyrics
I found comfort and courage in bottles of whiskey
I swear to you, friend, that that life is some risky
I have backed away quickly from those that would burn me
And stopped up my ears that no one should learn me

But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold

I have flown like a bird from each cage that confined me
And broken every one of the ties that would bind me
And I have danced me around some sad old situations
And taken up my share of them sweet invitations

But the lady beside me is the one I have chosen
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold
To walk through my life like a coat from the cold1Embed
