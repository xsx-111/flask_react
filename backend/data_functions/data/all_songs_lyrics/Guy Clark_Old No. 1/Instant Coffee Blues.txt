Instant Coffee Blues Lyrics
Now he washed all the road dirt from his face and from his neck
And sat down at her table as she picked up his check
And she took him home for reasons that she did not understand While him, he had the answers, but he did not show his hand

'Cause, him, he knew the taste of this wine very well
It all goes down so easy, but the next day is hell

Morning
"Man, was I drunk," she whispered in the shower
While he lay there and smoked his way there through the final hour
She felt wholly empty like she'd felt it every time
And he was feeling just the same except he was trying to make it rhyme

Time was of the essence, so they both did their best
To meet up in the kitchen feeling fully dressed

She just had to go to work and he just had to go
And she knew where and he knew how to blow it off and so
They shot the breeze quite cavalier to the boiling of the pot
And sang the 'Instant Coffee Blues' and never fired a shot
Him, he hit the driveway with his feelings in a case
And her, she hit the stoplight and touched up her face
So you tell them the difference between caring and not
And that it's all done with mirrors, lest they forgot
I said it's all done with mirrors of which they have none
To blend the instant coffee blues into the morning sunEmbed
