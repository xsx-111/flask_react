Texas - 1947 Lyrics
Being six years old I had seen some trains before
So it's hard to figure out what I'm at the depot for
Trains are big and black and smoking steam screaming at the wheels
And bigger than anything they is, at least that's the way she feels
Trains are big and black and smoking, louder than July Four
But everybody's actin' like this might be something more
Than just picking up the mail or the soldiers from the war
This is something that even old man Wileman never seen before
And it's a late afternoon on a hot Texas day
Something strange is going on and we's all in the way

There's fifty or sixty people just sitting on their cars
And the old men left their dominos and come down from the bars
And everybody is checking, old Jack Kittrel check his watch
And us kids put our ears to the rails to hear 'em pop
So we already knowed it when they finally said, "Train time"
You'd a-thought that Jesus Christ hisself was rolling down the line
Because things got real quiet, mama jerked me back
But not before I'd got the chance to lay a nickel on the track

Look out, here she comes, she's coming
Look out, there she goes, she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog Cyclone
Big, red, and silver, she don't make no smoke
She's a fast-rollin' streamline come to show the folks
I said look out, here she comes, she's coming
Look out, there she goes, she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog Cyclone

Lord, she never even stopped
But she left fifty or sixty people still sitting on their cars
Wondering what it's coming to and how it got this far
But me, I got a nickel smashed flatter than a dime
By a mad dog runaway red silver streamline train

Look out, here she comes, she's coming
Look out, there she goes, she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog Cyclone
Big, red, and silver, she don't make no smoke
She's a fast rollin' streamline come to show the folks
I said look out, here she comes, she's coming
Look out, there she goes, she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog Cyclone
Look out, here she comes, she's coming
Look out, there she goes, she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog Cyclone
Look out, here she comes, she's coming
Look out, there she goes, she's gone
Screaming straight through Texas like a mad dog CycloneEmbed
