10 Miles High LyricsI'm getting closer
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer all the time
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer all the time
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer all the time
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer
I'm getting closer

I tried to get so high
I made it ten miles high
I'm gonna get so high

My nightmare's everywhere but inside
A living indication of every situation
But it seems I have neglected complication
Hindered my salvation
But I try and I try and I try
I'm gonna get so high
You'll never get inside
I swore I'd never turn into you
I'm closer all the time
I made it ten miles high
Can't tell my truth from my lies
I swore to god I would never turn into you
I'm getting closer all the time
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all down
Tear it all5Embed
