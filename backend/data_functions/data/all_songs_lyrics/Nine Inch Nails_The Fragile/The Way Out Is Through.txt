The Way Out Is Through LyricsAll I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
Underneath it all
We feel so small
The heavens fall
But still we crawl
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on
All I've undergone
I will keep on1Embed
