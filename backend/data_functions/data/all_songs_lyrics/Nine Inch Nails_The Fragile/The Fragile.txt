The Fragile Lyrics
She shines in a world full of ugliness
She matters when everything is meaningless
Fragile, she doesn't see her beauty
She tries to get away
Sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving
I can't watch her slip away

I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart

She reads the minds of all the people as they pass her by
Hoping someone can see
If I could fix myself I'd--
But it's too late for me

I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
I won't let you fall apart
We'll find the perfect place to go where we can run and hide
I'll build a wall and we can keep them on the other side
...but they keep waiting
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...
...and picking...

It's something I have to do
(I won't let you fall apart)
I was there, too
(I won't let you fall apart)
Before everything else
(I won't let you fall apart)
I was like you
(I won't let you fall apart)8Embed
