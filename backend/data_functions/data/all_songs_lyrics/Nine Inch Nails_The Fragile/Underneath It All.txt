Underneath It All Lyrics
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you

Numb all through
I can still feel you
Hear your call
Underneath it all
Kill my brain
Yet you still remain
Crucified
After all I've died
After all I've tried
You are still inside

All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
All I do
I can still feel you
You remain
I am stained3Embed
