The New Flesh LyricsSideways
Sometimes
Some things
Feel like
I'm on the other side
Waves
Of every feeling ever felt
Screaming
This is how it all begins
This is how it all begins
I can almost see (...how it all begins)
The blackest eyes
The new flesh
This is how it all begins
Give it to me
I can take it
Give it to me
I can take it
Give it to me
I can take it
Give it to me
I can take it
Give it to me
I can take it
Give it to me
I can take it
I've begun
I've begun
I've begun
I've begun2Embed
