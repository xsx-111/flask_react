Truce Lyrics
Now the night is coming to an end, ooh
The sun will rise and we will try again, ooh

Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die

I will fear the night again, ooh
I hope I'm not my only friend, ooh

Stay alive, stay alive for me
You will die, but now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure to die106Embed
