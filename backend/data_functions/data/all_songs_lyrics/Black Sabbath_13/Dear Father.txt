Dear Father Lyrics
A childhood innocence was drowned in your tears
The demons that you fought are feeding your fears
The poisoned secrets of your life stand revealed
The truth destroys you it's no longer concealed

Dear Father, forsaken
You knew what you were doing
In silence, your violence
Has left my life in ruin, yeah

In ruin, yeah

You preyed upon my flesh then prayed for my soul
Belief betrayed by lust, the faith that you stole
Indoctrination by a twisted desire
The catechism of an evil messiah

Dear Father, forgive me
I know just what I'm doing
In silence, this violence
Will leave your life in ruin, yeah
In ruin, yeah

Preacher of theocracy
Hiding your hypocrisy
Under a false sanctity
Holy phony empathy
You have taken my life
Now it's your turn to die
Can you sleep at night?
When you close your eyes
Do you think of all the pain from your lies?
Or do you deny, you're responsible
For the victims of the sins you devised?
What you gonna tell them, when they ask you well then?
Is your conscience pure in your heart?
There is no exemption when you seek redemption
For all the lives that you've torn apart!

Your molestations of the cross you defiled
A man once holy, now despised and reviled
You took possession while confessing my sins
And now you have to face whatever death brings, yeah!
Dear Father, forsaken
You knew what you were doing
In silence, your violence
Has left my life in ruin, yeah

In ruin, yeah, yeah, yeah
In ruin, yeah
