Three Thousand LyricsSlice through ice
Minefield mics
Tone-wheel cyclones
Your thoughts, mine
Wear fun death-suit
Tropical design
Blade grammar, to the death
Everybody run

Some hearts bleed
So do these
Some sounds can put tides in seas
We'll think till our minds align
That's when we're slicing through time
We'll think till our minds align
That's when we're slicing through time
Three thousand thoughts in our mind
That's when we're slicing through time
We'll think till our minds align
That's when we're slicing through time
Fight through ice 
Toxic sound
Line for line
Line for line
There are worlds up above
There are worlds inside
Some hearts bleed
So do these
Some sounds can put tides in seas

We'll think till our minds align
That's when we're slicing through time
We'll think till our minds align
That's when we're slicing through time
Three thousand thoughts in our mind
That's when we're slicing through time
We'll think till our minds align
That's when we're slicing through timeEmbed
