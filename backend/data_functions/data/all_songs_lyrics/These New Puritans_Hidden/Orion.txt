Orion LyricsRemote places where we'll go
Without a doubt
I don't think the stars are symbols
But let's find out
And here we go up into the stars
Inside the pyramid
Deeper in it
Hidden exits after Osiris
All the stars are swords
I've never been so sure
Remote places where we'll go
Without a doubt
I don't think the stars are symbols
But let's find out
And here we go up into the stars
Up into the stars
But 'til then we'll be hanging on the wall
All our faces will be boomerangs hanging on the wall
All the trees started to walk and all the rivers started to talk
But only through digital manipulationEmbed
