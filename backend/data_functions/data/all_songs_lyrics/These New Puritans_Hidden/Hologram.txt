Hologram LyricsShut the door, shut the door
Because I'm staying here
The world might disappear under blankets of snow
And
There's a wonderful word that you will liken it to
But it's caught in the back of your mind though
Okay
And some will say, "To you will go the world"
Shut the door because I disagree
And Memnon sighs relief
Some circles you can't leaveEmbed
