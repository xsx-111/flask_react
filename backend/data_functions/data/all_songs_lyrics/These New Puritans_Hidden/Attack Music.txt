Attack Music LyricsIt was September harmful logic
It was September this is attack music
It was September harmful logic
It was September this is attack music
It was September harmful logic
It was September this is attack music
It was September holy relic
It was September this is attack!
You look around now
You look around now
You look around now
You look around
(repeat)
I'm not an actor, I don't have lines to say
Until I write them all down on this piece of paper
So are you ready, you are my sound (?)
....................
No longer human you are a weapon
These frozen guns ..............
It was September harmful logic
It was September this is attack music
It was September harmful logic
It was September this is attack music
It was September harmful logic
It was September this is attack music
It was September holy relic
It was September this is attack!Embed
