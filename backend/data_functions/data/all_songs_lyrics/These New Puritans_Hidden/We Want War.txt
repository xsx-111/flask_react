We Want War Lyrics
(We want war)
(We want war)

Some of these trees have been growing for years
The leaves on the floor must be five metres deep (we want war)
The paths are a labyrinth or even a trap (we want war)
Some tides don't turn some things never come back

We want war
We want war
We want war
We want war

Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, gotta get 'em out (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, gotta get 'em out

Secret recordings were made in the marsh
I bore a hole in the tree just to see
Knights dance in molecules, here's Gallahad
They're rising back up, they're rising back up
Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, gotta get 'em out, let this in, let (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, let in, let... (we want war)
Let in, let out, gotta get 'em out, gotta get 'em in now
(we want war)
Let in, let out, let in, let out, gotta get 'em out (we want war)

Shadows dance back up, it's happening again
If you listen carefully you might hear them whisper:
"We hold all the secrets, we hold all the words;
But they're scrambled and broken so you'll never know"

(And that the Thames flows beneath the grass?)
 
Can't you see them
Floating like black ash?
Can't you feel them
Crawling down your back?
Can't you feel them
Breathing down your neck?
Can't you see them
Float across the marsh?
Can't you feel them
Breathing down your neck?
Sea breeze, sea breezeEmbed
