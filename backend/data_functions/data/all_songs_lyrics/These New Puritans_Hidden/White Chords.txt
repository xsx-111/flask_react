White Chords LyricsFrames of colour litter the bracken, regal and strange
Through the broken plastic a canal
The platform heaves like a human body, divide by two
'X' marks the spot or it sometimes means 'No'
Frames of colour flicker between ancient and brand new
I've got white cords running through my body
And the fur of a white cat on my back
But you see you gave him black wool and we have a black cat
Beneath the peering dead trees I walked back
"Respect the invisible"
"I can't respect what's not there", I avoided you
Sloping concrete becomes a shoulder (Words inscribed in the air)
Frames of colour litter the bracken, regal and strange
Tectonic riddle, your eyes as terminals
Words enshrined in air, words enshrined in air
You are in the stars / sky, I will meet you there
Your name becomes cosmic in my mind
Rangeless, endless and my blood explodesEmbed
