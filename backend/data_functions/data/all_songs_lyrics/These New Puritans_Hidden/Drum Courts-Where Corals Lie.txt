Drum Courts-Where Corals Lie LyricsThis is the
This is the land where corals lie
...beach into the sea
Your lips are like a sunset glow
Your smile is like a morning sky
Yet leave me, leave me, let me go
And see the land where corals lie
The land where corals lie
Some request my eyelids closed
So I'll leave my eyelids closed
It's time, it's timeEmbed
