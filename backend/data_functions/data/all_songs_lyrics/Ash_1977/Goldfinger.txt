Goldfinger Lyrics
Move closer
Set my mind on fire
Taking over
The world seems so alive, ah-ah-oh
The world seems so alive

She slips into the night and she is gone
Gone to set the score
Gone into the town
Rain shining in her eyes
Her brother started school again today
A thought to pass the time
To occupy my mind
While I'm waiting for her

Down in the basement
Listening to the rain
Thinking things over
I think it over again, ah-ah-oh
I think it over again

She slipped into the night and she was gone
Gone to set the score
Gone into the town
Rain shining in her eyes
Her brother started school again today
A thought to pass the time
To occupy my mind
While I'm waiting for her
I'm riding it down
Listen to the rain
She'll be here soon
I lie back and drift away, ah-ah-oh
I lie back and drift away

She slipped into the night and she was gone
Gone to set the score
Gone into the town
Rain shining in her eyes
Her brother started school again today
A thought to pass the time
To occupy my mind
While I'm waiting for her

I'm feeling so alive, feeling so real
On a stormy night
The rain is coming down
Rain like never before
I've got some records on and some bottles of wine
On a stormy night
The rain is lashing down
And I'm waiting for her1Embed
