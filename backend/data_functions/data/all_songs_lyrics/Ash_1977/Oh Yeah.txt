Oh Yeah Lyrics
Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer

On warm June evenings she would come to my house
Still in her school skirt and her summer blouse
Talking too long as the night came on
It was the best time of my life
Her bee stung lips, kisses sweeter than wine
The things she whispered with breathless sighs
The summer air was soft and warm
Her eyes were making silent demands
As her hair came undone in my hands

Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer
Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer

Driving her home after midnight
I felt so good, everything was alright
Her thoughts seemed lost in the night sky
I remember everything
I don't know why these things ever end
I sometimes wish it was that summer again
I still see her in my sleep
And hear the sighing of the summer wind
Still I don't regret one thing
Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer
Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer

Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer
Oh yeah, she was taking me over
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summer
It felt just like it was the start of forever
And oh yeah, it was the start of the summerEmbed
