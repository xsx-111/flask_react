Let It Flow Lyrics
Here she comes walking across the sand
She'll never know how she blows my mind
She's there with the chemicals in my brain
Spinning softly 'round my head
I'm gonna give in, I'll never change my mind
I feel it now, tonight is the night
And why should I try to resist
When it's calling out to me?
Calling out to me

She's blowing my mind
She's always blowing my mind
She's blowing my mind
She's always blowing my mind

The autumn and the winter have been and gone
Half the time I never knew what was wrong
I never noticed I was feeling down
It just went day by day
She'll never know how she turned it 'round
She'll never know how she blows my mind
It was a long time coming to me
I'm gonna outshine every star
She's gonna bring me through
She's blowing my mind
She's always blowing my mind
Look in my eyes
She's always blowing my mind

I won't be able to help myself
Falling in love with her
I have all the time in the world
The answer was always there
Why should I try to resist
When it's calling out to me?
She can take my heart or pay the price
She's the sweetest thing I've ever known

Here she comes walking across the sand
She'll never know how she blows my mind
She's there with the chemicals in my brain
Spinning softly 'round my head
I'm gonna give in, I'll never change my mind
I feel it now, tonight is the night
And why should I try to resist
When it's calling out to me?
Calling out to me
She's blowing my mind
She's always blowing my mind
She's blowing my mind
She's always blowing my mindEmbed
