Angel Interceptor Lyrics
I stayed in last night
I wasn't feeling alright
I knew it couldn't last
I started thinking of you

Oh, and I wished
We could be dancing in the dark really slow
Oh, it's good to know
Tomorrow, you are coming home
I won't be so alone

I feel heaven in you
Don't you know I feel heaven in you?
Don't you know I feel heaven in you?
Oh, it's true, I can't let go
I miss you, oh, you know

Sitting alone
With the TV on
I fell asleep
I was hoping you'd call
And I dreamed
We were dancing in the dark really slow
Oh, it's good to know
Tomorrow, you are coming home
I won't be so alone

I feel heaven in you
Don't you know I feel heaven in you?
Don't you know I feel heaven in you?
Oh, it's true, I can't let go
I miss you, oh, you know

Angel Interceptor
Apollo 21
Yuri Gagarin
Flew into the sun
The angels in Heaven
Look down where he lay
Well, tomorrow you're coming home

I feel heaven in you
Don't you know I feel heaven in you?
Don't you know I feel heaven in you?
Oh, it's true, I can't let go
I miss you, oh, you knowEmbed
