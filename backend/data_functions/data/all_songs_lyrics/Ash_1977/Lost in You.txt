Lost in You Lyrics
Lying wide awake under strange skies
Wanting to call you, but it is late at night
And you're far away, but you are always on my mind

I feel like I'm on fire, nothing I can do
I'm troubled with doubt, though I know it is not true

And it's times like these when I am dying to speak to you
I'm dying to get through
I'm dying to speak to you
Dying to get through
I'm dying to speak to you

Staring at the wall, I sink inside
I think about it all, I get caught up in my life
I can't think straight because it's tearing up my mind

I feel like I'm on fire, nothing I can do
I'm troubled with doubt, though I know it is not true

And it's times like these when I am dying to speak to you
Dying to get through
Dying to get through
The more that I think how I need you
The more that I think, the more it seems true
And now it means more that I ever meant it to
Ever meant it to

Lying wide awake under strange skies
Wanting to call you, but it is late at night
And you're far away, but you are always on my mind

You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mind
You are always on my mindEmbed
