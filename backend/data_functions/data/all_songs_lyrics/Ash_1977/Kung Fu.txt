Kung Fu Lyrics
Kung Fu, do what you do to me
I haven't been the same since my teenage lobotomy
Full on and move to Hong Kong
With Bruce Lee's brother and Johnny Wong

I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu
And he thinks he loves you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Daniel-san, made in Taiwan
Come on, Jackie Chan, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Last night Jackie Chan came 'round
I played pool with him and we hung out
Mr. Miyagi and the X-Men
Called in for a while as well

I think it's strange, he's friends with Fu Manchu
And he thinks he loves you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Daniel-san, made in Taiwan
Come on, Jackie Chan, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Yeah, yeah, Kung Fu, do what you do to me
I can't live without my Kung Fu movies
Shanghai Killers and Deadly Road
My life was ruined when the Green Dragon closed
Oh, I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu
And he thinks he loves you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Daniel-san. made in Taiwan
Come on, Jackie Chan, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think it's strange he's friends with Fu Manchu
And he's in love with you, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, Daniel-san, made in Taiwan
Come on, Jackie Chan, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh2Embed
