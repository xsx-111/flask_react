Darkside Lightside Lyrics
Remembering the warm summer nights
When everything is gonna turn out right
When all the answers lie behind your eyes
And everything's gonna turn out right

All I want is to see you smile
All I want is to see you smile

The answers always are waiting there
You give me feelings that I used to get
And remember things that I had forgotten long ago

Remembering the warm summer nights
When everything is gonna turn out right
Remembering the warm summer nights
And everything's gonna turn out right

All I want is to see you smile
All I want is to see you smile

The answers always are waiting there
You give me feelings that I used to get
And remember things that I had forgotten
I get the feelings I used to get
And remember things that I had forgotten long ago
All I want is to see you smile
All I want is to see you smileEmbed
