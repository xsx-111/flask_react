Innocent Smile Lyrics
Tripping 'round the town as the sun comes down
Flying with your friends with the stars alive
Tripping 'round the town as the sun comes down
Flying with your friends with the stars alive
Running on a high from the spirit inside
Taking on the world with an innocent smile
Running on a high from the spirit inside
Taking on the world with an innocent smile

Something knocked me down and I fell far to the ground
I lost it all in one night
Just wandering around

Vandalism's fun when there's nothing to do
Break a few things, say it wasn't you
Vandalism's fun when there's nothing to do
Break a few things, say it wasn't you
Let it all kick in, take you for a ride
Strapped to a rocket heading for the sky
Let it all kick in, take you for a ride
Strapped to a rocket heading for the sky

Something knocked me down and I fell far to the ground
I lost it all in one night
Just wandering around
That's when I got the shiver that reawoke my mind
Swinging on a chandelier hanging from the sky
You turned it all around, it only took a smile
Swinging on a chandelier hanging from the sky
Hanging from the sky

Running on a high with the spirit inside
Taking on the world with an innocent smile
Running on a high with the spirit inside
Taking on the world with an innocent smile
Running on a high with the spirit inside
Taking on the world with an innocent smile
Running on a high with the spirit inside
Taking on the world with an innocent smileEmbed
