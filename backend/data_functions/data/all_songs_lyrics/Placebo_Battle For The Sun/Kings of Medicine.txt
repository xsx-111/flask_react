Kings of Medicine Lyrics
They're picking up pieces of me
While they're picking up pieces of you
In a bag you will be, before the day is over
Were you looking for somewhere to be?
Or looking for someone to do?
Stupid me, to believe that I could trust in stupid you
And on the back of my hand
Were, directions I could understand
Now that old buzzard Johnnie Walker
Has gone and ruined all our plans
Our best made plans

Don't leave me here, to pass through time
Without a map or road sign
Don't leave me here, my guiding light
Cause I, I wouldn't know where to begin
I asked the kings of medicine

They're picking up pieces of me
While they're picking up pieces of you
Lying on ice you will be before the day is over
It's a case in point baby
That you never thought it through
Stupid me, to believe I could depend on stupid you
And on the tip of my tongue
Were, words that always came out wrong
Cause they were drowned in Southern Comfort
Left to dry out in the sun
The noon-day sun
Don't leave me here, to pass through time
Without a map, or road sign
Don't leave me here, my guiding light
Cause I, I wouldn't know where to begin
I asked the kings of medicine
But it seems they've lost their powers
Now all I'm left with is the hours

Don't leave me here, to pass through time
Without a map, or road sign
Don't leave me here, my guiding light
Cause I, I wouldn't know where to begin
I asked the kings of medicine
But it seems they've lost their powers
Now all I'm left with is the hours

Don't leave me here
Don't leave me here, oh no-oh
I wouldn't know where to begin3Embed
