Bright Lights Lyrics
Cast your mind back to the days
When I'd pretend I was okay
I had so very much to say
About my crazy livin'
Now that I've stared into the void
So many people I've annoyed
I have to find a middle way
A better way of givin'


So I haven't given up
But all my choices, my good luck
Appear to go and get me stuck
In an open prison
Now I am tryin' to break free
Be in a state of empathy
Find the true and inner me
Eradicate the schism

No one can take it away from me
And no one can tear it apart
Because a heart that hurts
Is a heart that works
A heart that hurts
Is a heart that works
Bright lights and black holes
Bright lights and black holes
Bright lights and black holes
Bright lights and black holes
A heart that hurts
Is a heart that works

No one can take it away from me
(Bright lights and black holes
And no one can tear it apart
(Bright lights and black holes)
It may be elaborate fantasy
(Bright lights and black holes)
But it's the perfect place to start
(Bright lights and black holes
Because a heart that hurts
Is a heart that works
A heart that hurts
Is a heart that worksEmbed
