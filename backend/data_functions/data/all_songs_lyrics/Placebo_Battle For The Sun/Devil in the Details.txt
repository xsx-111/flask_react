Devil in the Details LyricsI've been wasting all my time with the devil in the details
I've got no energy to fight
He's a fucking pal o' mine that devil in the details
And he's fixing up to take a bite
I don't see the point in trying
I've got the devil in the details
He's gonna teach me wrong from right
That fucking pal o' mine, the devil in the details
I'm gonna dance with him tonight

All of my wrongs and all my wicked ways
Will come back to haunt me, come what may
For all of the songs I hope to write some day
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Let me take you for a ride with the devil in the details
We'll kiss and tremble with delight
Everything is fine with the devil in the details
We're gonna dance with him tonight

All of my wrongs and all my wicked ways
Will come back to haunt me, come what may
For all of the songs I hope to write some day
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay
All of my wrongs and all my wicked ways
Will come back to haunt me, come what may
For all of the songs I hope to write some day
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay
Looks like the devil's here to stay
I've been wasting all my time with the devil in the details1Embed
