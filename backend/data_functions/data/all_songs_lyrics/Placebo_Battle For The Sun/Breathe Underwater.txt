Breathe Underwater Lyrics
Here comes another fall from grace
I'm always falling on my face
This attitude that I embrace
For the love I'm trying to replace
I try to kill this song
'Cause the melody's all wrong
And there's a fever coming on

It's hard to reconcile
What I've become
With the wounded child
Hiding deep inside

Breathe underwater
I'm coming up for air
I wanna see another dawn
Coming up for air
Sick of the slaughter
I'm coming up for air
'Cause I've been floating here too long

Take my ego for a ride
'Cause there's nobody by my side
It's getting hard to justify
And it won't be long till I collide
My weakness is laid bare
As people stop and stare
But it's the last time I swear
It's hard to reconcile
What I've become
With the wounded child
Hiding deep inside

Breathe underwater
I'm coming up for air
I wanna see another dawn
Coming up for air
Sick of the slaughter
I'm coming up for air
'Cause I've been floating here too long

Start breathing
Start breathing
Start breathing
Start breathing

Breathe underwater
I'm coming up for air
I wanna see another dawn
Coming up for air
Sick of the slaughter
I'm coming up for air
'Cause I've been floating here too long
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm coming, coming up for air
Coming up for air
Coming up for airEmbed
