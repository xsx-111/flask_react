Come Undone Lyrics
You don't know how you're coming across
You don't know what you're coming across
You don't know who you're coming across
You don't know how you're coming across
So you come undone

You don't know how you're coming across
Acting like you don't give a toss
Walking around like you're on some kind of cross
And it's a shame on you the irony's lost

When you come undone
You come undone
You know, you come undone
You know, you know, you know


You don't know how you're coming across
You don't know how you're coming across
And I don't think that you're aware of the cost
So you come undone
You come, you come undone
You know, you know, you knowEmbed
