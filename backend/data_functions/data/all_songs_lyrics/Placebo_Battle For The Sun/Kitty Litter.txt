Kitty Litter Lyrics
The way you're dancing makes me come alive
Makes me shiver and perspire
Your surreptitious glancing, the way you crack a smile
You really start a fire

So move closer
I wanna feel your touch
So come over, come on

Love of mine, this fortress in our heart
Feels much weaker, now we're apart
Love of mine, this fortress in our heart
Comes crashing down

I need a change of skin
I need a change

The way you're moving hips from side to side
Makes you all that I desire
Bathsheba of my choosing, I'm so unsatisfied
And you've got what I require
So move closer
I gotta feel your touch
So come over, so come on
So move closer
I gotta feel your touch
So come over, come on

Love of mine, this fortress in our heart
Feels much weaker, now we're apart
Love of mine, this fortress in our heart
Comes crashing down

I need a change of skin
I need a change

I need a change, I need a change of skin
I need a change, I need a change of skin
I need a change, I need a change of skin
I need a change, I need a change of skin

Love of mine, this fortress in our heart
Feels much weaker, now we're apart
Love of mine, this fortress in our heart
Comes crashing down1Embed
