Ashtray Heart Lyrics
Mi cenicero, mi cenicero
Mi corazón de cenicero
Mi cenicero, mi cenicero
Mi corazón de cenicero

You are the birth and you are waste
You are the one who took my place
You took a jump into forever
A leap of faith I could not take

And it was
A leap of faith I could not take
A promise that I could not make
A leap of faith I could not take
A promise that I could not make

(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
You were alone before we met
No more forlorn than one could get
How could we know we had found treasure?
How sinister and how correct

And it was
A leap of faith I could not take
A promise that I could not make
A leap of faith I could not take
A promise that I could not make

(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
I tore the muscle from your chest
And used it to stub out cigarettes
I listened to your screams of pleasure
Now watch the bedsheets turn blood red

(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi cenicero, mi cenicero)
My ashtray heart
(Mi corazón de cenicero)2Embed
