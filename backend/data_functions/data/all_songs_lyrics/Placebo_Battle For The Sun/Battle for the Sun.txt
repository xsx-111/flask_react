Battle for the Sun LyricsI, I, I will battle for the sun, sun, sun
And I, I, I won't stop until I'm done, done, done
You, you, you are getting in the way, way, way
And I, I, I have nothing left to say, say, say
I, I, I, I, I will brush off all the dirt
Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt
And I, I, I, I, I will pretend it didn't hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
You, you, you, you, you are a black and heavy weight
Weight, weight, weight, weight, weight, weight
And I, I, I, I, I will not participate pate
Pate, pate, pate, pate, pate, pate

Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
I, I, I will battle for the sun, sun, sun, sun
Cause I, I, I have stared down the barrel of a gun
Gun, gun, gun, gun, gun, gun
No fun if you, you, you, you
You are a cheap and nasty fake
Fake, fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
And I, I, I, I am the bones you couldn't break
Break, break, break, break, break, break, break
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
Dream brother, my killer, my lover
I, I, I will battle for the sun3Embed
