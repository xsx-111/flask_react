Speak in Tongues Lyrics
Kitty came back home from on the island
But kitty came on home without a name
She and me's a history for violence
But I long and burn to touch her just the same

So we both can speak in tongues
So we both can speak in tongues

Every single sense in me is heightened
There's nothing left inside to rearrange
Like a slave to history and science
I long, I burn to touch you just the same

So we both can speak in tongues
So we both can speak in tongues

Until the universe is done
And the course of time has run
So we both can both can speak in tongues

Don't let them have their way
Don't let them have their way
You're beautiful and so blas√©
So please don't let them have their way
Don't fall back into the decay
There is no law we must obey
So please don't let them have their way
Don't give in to yesterday
We can build a new tomorrow, today
We can build a new tomorrow, today
We can build a new tomorrow, today
We can build a new tomorrow, today
Today
Today
