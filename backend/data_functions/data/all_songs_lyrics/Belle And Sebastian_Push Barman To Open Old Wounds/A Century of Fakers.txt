A Century of Fakers Lyrics
There are people going hungry far away
They've got nothing on their plates
And you're filling your fat face with every different kind of cake
If you ever go lardy or go lame
I will drop you straight away
That's the chance you're gonna take
For every stupid thing you say

There are people going lonely and they'll stay
Lonely far into the year
Cause you're making blinkers fashionable
And fashionably you'll say
All is equal in love and war
And I'm sorry but I've got some things to do
And you pretend to read a book
You'll never finish till the day

That the author dedicates it
To a century of fakers
They took your mould
And they burned it on the fire in history today
Yeah, the author dedicates it
To a century of fakers
He was an anarchist, he tried his best
But it wasn't good enough
Did I say I would see you soon
Well I'm sorry, but I just came off my bike
And my face is scarred
And chance has barred me seeing you tonight
I was over the other side of the city
And if the truth be known I'd say
That you looked great from there before you shaved
Your golden hair today

Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
They took your mould
And burned it on the fire of history today
Everybody's trying to make us
Another cool decade of fakers

Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another cool decade of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another cool decade of fakers
Everybody's trying to make us
Another century of fakers1Embed
