Lazy Line Painter Jane Lyrics
You're working the village shop
Putting a poster up
Dreaming of anything
Dreaming of the time
When you are free
From all the trouble you're in
In the mud, on your knees
Trying hard not to please
Anyone, all the time
Being a rebel's fine
And you go all the way
To being brutal

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the first bus out of town
On the first bus out of town

So let's see your kit for games
All the girls look the same
You are challenging styles for running miles
You're running miles in some boys jumper
Boo to the business world
You know a girl who's
Tax free on her back and making
Plenty cash
You are working for the joy of giving
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
In the hope that they will see


You are in two minds
Tossing a coin
To decide whether you should
Tell your folks
About a dose of thrush
You got when licking railings

But you read in a book
That you got free in Boots
There are lotions, there are potions
You can take to hide your shame
From all those prying eyes
Lazy Jane, all the time painting lines
You are sleeping at bus stops
Wondering how you got your name
And what you're going to do about it
You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town

You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
On the last bus out of town
On the last bus out of town

You will have a boy tonight
You will have a boy tonight
And you hope that they will see
And you hope that they will see

You will have a boy tonight
Maybe you will have a girl tonight
And you hope that they will see
Yeah you hope that they will see
