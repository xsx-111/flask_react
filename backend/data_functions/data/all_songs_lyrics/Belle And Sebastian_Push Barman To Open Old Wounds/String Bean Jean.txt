String Bean Jean Lyrics
I got my fingers dirty at the school of rock
I got my fingers dirty so I took a walk
I went up to the country park and hung around till after dark
And the girls got home
Till the girls got home

Did I tell you about the one I know, she's on the rag
And she spent the summer day inside her sleeping bag
Yeah she spent the summer day inside until it's time to go to work
And she works all night
Yeah, the girl's all right

The girls have got a house that's like a caravan
And it's like your holiday whenever you go round
And we always have a laugh and then we all get in the bath
To save on the leccy bill
Me & Jo & Phil

I had to leave them in the morning
I left the keys around the way
I had to go to work
I had to leave them in the morning
I left the keys down in the cafe
I had to catch a bus
When Jo was short of cash I had to give her some
But I didn't really mind cause I was fit for once
So we paid the leccy bill, we got the shopping
And we still had some for the cinema
So we all went out

She asked me, do I need to lose a bit of weight
And I said her, don't be stupid cause you're looking great
And I call her String Bean Jean because the label on her jeans says
Seven to eight years old, well that's pretty small
Seven to eight years old, well that's pretty small
Seven to eight years old, well that's pretty small
Seven to eight years old

I had to leave them in the morning
I left the keys around the way
I had to go to work
I had to leave them in the morning
I left the keys down in the cafe
I had to catch a busEmbed
