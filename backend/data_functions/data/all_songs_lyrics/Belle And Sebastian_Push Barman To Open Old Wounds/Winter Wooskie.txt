Winter Wooskie LyricsWho's that girl?
She must be nearly freezing
Who's that girl out there
All that snow makes it hard so see her
Did she wave to me
And maybe I'm in love
Love love, love love
And maybe that's enough
That stuff, that stuff
Made a film
I made it through the window
Who's that star I cast?
All wrapped up in her winter wardrobe
She hurries by so fast
And maybe I'm in love
Love love, love love
And maybe that's enough
That stuff, that stuff
On summer days when the sun shines
I watch the tape
And through the snow, through the window
I watch her wave to me
Who's that girl?
She must be nearly freezingEmbed
