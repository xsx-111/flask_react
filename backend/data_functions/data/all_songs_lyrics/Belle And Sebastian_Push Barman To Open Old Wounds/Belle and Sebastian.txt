Belle and Sebastian LyricsI left my school, I left my job
You saw me looking like a slob
But when I was young
You were the only fun in town
Everyone thought it was a shame
For Belle and the boy Sebastian
Belle was okay but, oh Sebastian
Went too far again, crashed his car in the rain
He wants to love and he wants to care
But when the girls hear that, they think he's so square
Sebastian for once just leave your troubles home
Sebastian for once just leave your troubles home
He goes to school around the way
The boys are queuing up to tell her she's a star
Poor Sebastian is heading for a fall
Everyone thought it was a shame
For Belle and the boy Sebastian
Everyone thought it was a shame
Belle was okay but, oh Sebastian
Went too far again, crashed his car in the rain
Oh, Sebastian wrote his diary that
He would never be young again
But you will, fellow, you are ill
You'd better take a weight off of your mind and listen
To what other people say
'Cause things are going wrong your own way
Everyone thought it was a shame
For Belle and the boy Sebastian
Everyone thought it was a shame
Belle was okay but, oh Sebastian
Went too far again, crashed his car in the rain
Oh, Sebastian wrote his diary
That he would never be young again
But you will, fellow, you are ill
You'd better take a weight off of your mind and listen
To what other people say
'Cause things are going wrong your own way
Everyone thought it was a shame
For Belle and the boy Sebastian
Everyone thought it was a shame
Belle was okay but, oh Sebastian
Went too far again, crashed his car in the rain
Oh, Sebastian wrote his diary
That he would never be young again
But you will, fellow, you are ill
You'd better take a weight off of your mind and listen
To what other people say
'Cause things are going wrong your own way1Embed
