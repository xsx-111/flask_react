Marx and Engels LyricsThere's misery in all I hear and see
From the people on TV
After their tea when life begins again
They'll be happier than me
There are a thousand meals being made on Saturday
From the view I saw today
I took a bet inside the launderette
With a girl from Wallasey
She spoke in dialect I could not understand
But one thing that she made clear
There was no coming on to her
There was no way
There's misery in all I hear and see
From people on TV
After their tea when life begins again
They'll be happier than me
There are a thousand meals being made on Saturday
From the view I saw today
I took a bet inside the launderette
With a girl from Wallasey
She spoke in dialect I could not understand
But one thing that she made clear
There was no coming on to her
There was no intellect
That she could respect
If it couldn't see
That the girl just wants to be
Left alone with Marx and Engels for a while
She's writing in the style
Of any riot girl

"The bourgeois, historically, has played a revolutionary part to end all feudal idyllic relationships. It has destroyed personal worth and, in place of freedom, is exploitation for profit alone. There is a spectre of the past in my bold assertion; we could learn much from the past."Embed
