The Loneliness of the Middle Distance Runner LyricsI take a second of the day
To think about the things that we have done this year
The dark lies down the pouring rain
I'm underneath the smoker's railway arch again
The future's looking colourful
It's the colour of blood, chaos and corruption of a happy soul
A happy soul
We'll ride in the field
Ride in the field
Ride in the field
Till the rain dies down
The railway ticket states the destination
But it doesn't mean that we will show
There's a fork upon the line
We pay the guard to switch the sign
Off we go
The future's looking wonderful
It's the wonder of a businessman's conspiracy to sell you wares
No one cares
Oh, you care, I know
You care, I know
You care, I know
I forgot for a while
On a soggy afternoon spent in dispute
You give yourself a headache, boy
So I spent the day in stories
And in dreaming of the time when we're on stage
Have you seen The Loneliness of the Middle Distance Runner
When he stops the race and looks around
I've left the stage, you've seen it it now
I walk to the station
Walk to the station
Walk to the station
Won't you follow me down?
Walk to the station
Walk to the station
Walk to the station
Won't you follow me down?Embed
