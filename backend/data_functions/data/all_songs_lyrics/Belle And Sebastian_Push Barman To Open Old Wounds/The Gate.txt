The Gate LyricsIn the hope I’ll forget, I’ll wait
It’s a chance I’ll take, oh yeah
In the hope I’ll forget, I’ll wait
For the time
In the spring I’ll watch my step
While the night-time passes by
When a smile suits me all alone
I’ll be fine
There’s got to be a better song to sing
Before I hang upon your shoulder
Telling the truth it may be bolder this time
There’s got to be a better song to sing
That makes a lonely one less cold, oh
Before I hang upon your shoulder and cry
Watching friends playing in the dirt
Feeling hard but feeling hurt
By the sadness that wastes my time
It’s a crime
Counting acts which I must add
To collect sad memories
From a past I’d soon forget
Swap or leave
There’s got to be a better song to sing
Before I hang upon your shoulder
Telling the truth it may be bolder this time
There’s got to be a better song to sing
That makes a lonely one less cold, oh
Before I hang upon your shoulder and say
At the gate I’ll wave goodbye
To the friends that were my lies
And I’ll see them off at dawn
Feeling wise
Feeling wise
Feeling wiseEmbed
