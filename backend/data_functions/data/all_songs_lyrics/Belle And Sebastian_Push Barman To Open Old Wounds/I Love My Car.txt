I Love My Car LyricsI love my car
I'll admit today I've gone too far
To enamour myself of my little motor car
I love my dog
I love my pussy cat, I love the rat
That lives under the floor and makes his bed from novelettes
I wish I could say the same for you
The day will come soon when I look in your eyes
But I won't see you
I've got a head like a soaking sponge
I've got a tongue like a little slug
I won't be bugged by trivia
I love my Carl
I love my Brian my Dennis and my Al
I could even find it in my heart to love Mike Love
I wish I could say the same for you
The day will come soon when I look in your eyes
To see you smiling
I wish I could say the same for you
The day will come soon when I look in your eyes
But I won't see youEmbed
