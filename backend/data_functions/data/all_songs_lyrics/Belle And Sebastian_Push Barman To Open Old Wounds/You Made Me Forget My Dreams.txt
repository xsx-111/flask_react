You Made Me Forget My Dreams LyricsYou made me forget my dreams
When I woke up to you sleeping
We had peace for a night at least
But the trouble starts today
This morning you'll say
"I'll see you sometime, maybe" and I
Fall back to uneasy sleep
You made me forget my dreams
I was building a space rocket
With the boy who played bass guitar
With the boy who's wearing flares
He didn't care
He lit the fuse and ran for a mile
The space rocket went up in style
The space rocket went up in style
I'll lend you two hundred quid
For a flight across the ocean
Maybe things will look better there
Cause they couldn't seem much worse
Than tears and a curse
For men with guns, maturing in age
Will always pay a shitty wage
They'll always pay a shitty wage
You made me forget my dreams
When I woke up to you sleeping
There was blood on the sheets again
And the view outside the window
Of gardens in bloom
Obscured by all the trouble we had
I think I better make a move
I think I better make a move
I think I better make a move
I think I better make a move1Embed
