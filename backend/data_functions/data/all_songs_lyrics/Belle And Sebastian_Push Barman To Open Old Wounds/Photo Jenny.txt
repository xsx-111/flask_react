Photo Jenny LyricsI’m in a mess, I’m in a dress
There’s nothing from here till tomorrow morning
How will I get there?
How will I get there?
I don’t do drugs
All my friends are on their holidays
I go outside, it’s not so bad
I see my friend and he couldn’t believe that
The girls are holding hands
The girls are holding hands
Don’t be a fool
It’s 1995, the girls are just friends
They got the drugs I could use but then I don’t need any
All that I want is a photograph of Photo Jenny
How will I get one? I don’t know
How will I get one? I don’t know
How will I get her to strike a pose?
It’s getting cold, I’ll catch the bus
I'll see my friend when she’s finished working
Get some fish and chips
La-da-da-da-da
What’s on the box?
‘Man About The House’ with Paula Wilcox
You see the boy/girls at the bar
Now everyone thinks she’s really ugly
But I shut my eyes
Oh, I shut my eyes
I'll make a film
And the star of it is
And the star of it is
And the star of it is Photo Jenny
They got the drugs I could use but then I don’t need any
All that I want is a photograph of Photo Jenny
How will I get one? I don’t know
How will I get one? I don’t know
How will I get her to strike a pose?Embed
