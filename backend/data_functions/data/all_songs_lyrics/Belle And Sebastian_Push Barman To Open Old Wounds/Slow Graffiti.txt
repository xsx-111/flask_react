Slow Graffiti Lyrics
There's a portrait
In a backroom
Which I keep for days upon, which I relent
And gaze for hours on the muscle skin and bone
Of some imaginary friend

So how about it?
Show me please how I will look in twenty years
And let me please
Interpret history in every line and scar that's painted
There in front of me

It doesn't matter what I'm thinking
What I tell myself to do
I'll end up calling

I stay in to defrost the fridge
Now the kid has gone to bed
A feeling of dread
At least when she's around the trouble's there
It's worse to wake up with her falling round the room
Listen Johnny
You're like a mother to the girl you've fallen for
And you're still falling
Listen Johnny
You're like a mother to the girl you've fallen for
And you're still falling

And if they come tonight
You'll roll up tight and take
Whatever's coming to you nextEmbed
