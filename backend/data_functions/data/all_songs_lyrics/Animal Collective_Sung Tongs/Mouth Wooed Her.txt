Mouth Wooed Her LyricsI started playing the game, in like, the game

Good day outside
Tribe of life and mine and yours
You're so good and natural
My arms are peeling
Cause you're so close
Close to I
And eyeing my face
So I can take you out at breakfast time

Yes you're nice
All so violent
All so sure
I figured it out
I think I've figured it out
We be patient
Time for a nap
And now, ah-uh ah-ow
If I could just fix the clock I'd take you out
At breakfast time

I don't want no one of
I don't want none one, obe
I don't want one of the
I don't want none of those
I don't want no one no
I don't want one of those
I don't want no one of
I don't want no one, one
I've been thinking
Better (not) think
Better chance, better hosiery
Words are green
And words are weed
We get dressed
Now lets all go out, oh lets
The dye in my face is topping
All the cakes
At breakfast time

Better drink it all
If I let ya have it
I need mouth water
Better drink up
I need mouth water1Embed
