Who Could Win a Rabbit LyricsHungry bread-and-butter hustle
You've been doing it a while, it is only fair
Where's your relaxation?
Where's the time required for your health?
Been hating on my new perspective
Been hurrying along, no meal is ever done
You could win a rabbit, you could have a rabbit or
If the fast child is going to have a dead hand
We can get him started, yeah
Bad mind, let me put on good habits
Been working to put on good habits
Sometimes I can't find my good habits
Spanish bands use all the echo
Persian kitties better stay out of the train
Glad you brought your food on
Eat it like it's going to get away
Your coffee sure is getting colder
The seats are getting fewer
Place is losing space
You could win a rabbit, you could blow an island through the rib
Rabbit or a habit, habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit, habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit, habit or a rib?
Rabbit or a habit?8Embed
