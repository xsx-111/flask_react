Winters Love Lyrics
I love this life in winter time
There's frost cakes in the carpet
In winter time I have no legs
Two stumps of meat below me
A false snow fall could ruin my day
Its mask hung from the street wire
And winter's love where could she be?
She's warming in my pocket

Just a calm and modern day
In early, early morning
I rush to work and rush to bed
Am I a better person?
In evening, I wonâ€™t give up
The frost was heaven sent
I pulled the boy out of a box
And made that boy a man8Embed
