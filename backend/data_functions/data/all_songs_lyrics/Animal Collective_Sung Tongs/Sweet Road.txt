Sweet Road Lyrics
It started like a stone
I grew it out but then I rested it
I found sweet road
It came announced on the right
I left my purse then found the road

I'm tainted in a patchy problem
None can tell what I can tell ya
Let them eagles have good times
It's a road and not a soda

I found sweet road
I found sweet road

It started like a stone
I grew it out but then I rested it
I found sweet road
It came out of us on the right
I left my purse then found the roadEmbed
