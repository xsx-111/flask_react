Whaddit I Done Lyrics
Oh no
It’s nighttime
A boy goes out
Whaddit I done in the daytime?
Where am I out in the nighttime?

Going crazy here
At the funny bar
There’s a dance scene
At the wrong mall
With the right girl
In a light mind
And they left the stall

And it’s daytime
He’s a leader
Of the bunny god
And a good son
Gets the kids dressed up
In pajamas
And he could sing
And he mentions
Take a fake hand
And go meet him
He’s your leader
Of team bunnies' team
It’s a good day
For a new call
I’ll be glad to say
That I need ya
That I need ya
That I need ya
That I need ya
That I need ya
That I need ya
That I need ya
That I need ya1Embed
