Good Lovin Outside Lyrics
There's a place I know where we can go
Slide on down the wooden staircase
Good lovin' outside
Let's find a good place
And take off your clothing
I stopped wearing a watch
But I've kissed your face twice
Since we left the party
And things were really gettin' going
Things were really gettin' going
We can watch the things we eat
But I need your conf--escape with me
And we can loath in moss all night
You're kind and sweet and I feel your inside
And I'll kiss you in the kitchen but there's lovin' outside
I'll touch you and you'll touch me
The rain won't scare us cause we're lovin' outside
I'm wearing your shirt
So act like a kid don't pretend to hit me
Cause we act in the funniest ways
But it's just like it should be
With good love on the outside2Embed
