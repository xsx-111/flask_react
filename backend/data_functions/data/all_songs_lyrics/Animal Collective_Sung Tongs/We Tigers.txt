We Tigers LyricsMay I bang with this?
I'm like this
And you're like this
I'm like this
And you're like this
I'm like this
And you're like this
I'm like this
And you're like this
(We tigers! We tigers! Whoop!)
Hey kids let's pick up sticks
Let's make out the sounds of our own
All dogs invited- if everything feels wrong
Then we need a little bangin' goin on
One, two, three, arms for the trees
Self-seekers vomiting doubts
I changed all your words but my poltergeist concurs
That words aren't even necessary right now
But I'm a noisy singer
Singing out at a dinner
Dinners are much stranger now
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers!
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
Katydid, katydid
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
Ogres, ogres, ogres, ogres, ogres, ogres!
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
Oauh, auh (Oh ah ahh)
(Christ)
I've felt worse
I feel the curse of knowing what I shouldn't be
(I like you!)
I don't know where we'll go but let's walk around
And pretend we're everything we see
Kiss for a kiss, love change for chips
Rules but I thought you and I
Remember the young duck you crashed
At my apartment, you kept me up and made me smile
Now I'm a noisy singer
Singing out at a dinner
Dinners are much stranger now
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Everybody's morphin', Everybody's morphin'
Tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers!
Tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers!
Tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers!
Tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers, tigers!
Tigers!1Embed
