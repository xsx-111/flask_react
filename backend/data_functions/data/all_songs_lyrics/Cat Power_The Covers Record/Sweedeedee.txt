Sweedeedee LyricsYou wash them clothes
Sweedeedee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way
You wash them clothes
Your cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
Until the break of day
And I know everybody
Has a little hard luck sometimes
I know lately, I've been havin' mine
We used to live
In a fleabag apartment
You know the kind
And he'd come home and he'd say to me
We gotta leave, leave, leave the city
You wash them clothes
Sweedeedee
And hang 'em on the line
I can see by the way you wash them clothes
Your cookin' must be fine
I'm with you in the morning
Until the break of day
I know everybody
Has a little hard luck sometimes
I know lately I've been havin' mineEmbed
