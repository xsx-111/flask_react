Sea of Love Lyrics
Come with me, my love
To the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Do you remember when we met?
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I want to tell you
How much I love you

Come with me, my love
To the sea
The sea of love
I want to tell you
How much I love you7Embed
