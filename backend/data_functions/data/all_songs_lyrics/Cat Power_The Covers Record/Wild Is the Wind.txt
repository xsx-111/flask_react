Wild Is the Wind LyricsLove me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
We are creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
We are creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins, baby
You kiss me
With your kiss, my life begins
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Baby, please cling to me
We are creatures of the wind
Wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
And you kiss me
With your kiss, my life begins
Love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you1Embed
