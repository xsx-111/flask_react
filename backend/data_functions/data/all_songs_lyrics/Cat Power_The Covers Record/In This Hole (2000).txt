In This Hole (2000) LyricsIn this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further and further
Further from what
We must do
We must do
I saw you asleep beside a wall
Your skull inside a ball
My eyes blackened by
All the thoughts of God
One absence of truth
One horrible thing you saw
What you truly wanted to become
And who you thought I was
Who you thought I was
In this hole that we have fixed
We get further and further and further
Further from what
We must do
We must do
I saw you outside that wall
Your skull outside that wall
Your mind finally free
From all thoughts you found
And all the thoughts of GodEmbed
