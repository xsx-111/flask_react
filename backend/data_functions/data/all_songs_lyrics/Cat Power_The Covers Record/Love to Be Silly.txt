Love to Be Silly LyricsApple the sailor girl
She lived in a cabbage world
Along came Annie she pinched her fanny
Apple the sailor girl
Billy was an alley cat
Alone and so afraid
Along came tweety and there he stayed
Eating fish bones from the old fish tray
Billy lived happily ever after
Every single day
Billy and tweety
Love to be silly
Billy and tweety
Love to be silly
Billy billy billy so silly
Billy and tweetyEmbed
