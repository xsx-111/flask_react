Paths of Victory LyricsThe trail is dark and dusty
The road is kinda rough
But the road up yonder
With the cinders on the side
Trails of trouble
And your roads of battle
And your paths of victory
We shall walk
I walked out to the valley
And turned my head up high
Seen that silver linin'
It was hangin' in the sky
Trails of troubles
And your roads of battles
In the paths of victory
We shall walk
The mountain was a-movin'
The hummin' of its wheels
Told me of the new day
It was coming across the fields
Trails of troubles
And roads of battles
They lead paths of victory
We shall walk
The gravel road is bumpy
It's a hard old road to ride
But the good road is waitin'
And boys, it ain't far off
Trails of trouble
And your roads of battle
They lead paths of victory
We shall walkEmbed
