Kingsport Town LyricsThe winter wind is blowing so strong
My hands have got no gloves
Wish to my soul that I could have
The boy I'm dreaming of
Don't you remember me, babe?
I remember you quite well
You caused me to leave all of New York town
With a high sheriff on my tail
A high sheriff on my tail, boys
High sheriff on my trail
All because I'd fallen for
A curly-headed, dark-eyed boy
Who's gonna stroke your coal black hair
And your sandy-colored skin?
Who's gonna walk you side by side
And tell you everything is all right?
Who's gonna look you straight in the eye
And hold your bad luck hand?
Who's gonna walk you? Who's gonna talk to you?
And who's gonna be your woman?
The winter wind is blowing so strong
My hands have got no gloves
Don't you remember me, babe?
I remember you quite wellEmbed
