Troubled Waters LyricsI must be one of the devil's daughters
They look at me with scorn
I'll never hear their horn
Sometimes it's like chains
Sometimes I hang my head in shame
When people see me, they scandalize my name
I'm going down to the devil's water
I'm gonna drown in that troubled water
It's coming 'round my soul
It's way beyond control
I must be one
I must be one
I must be one of the devil's daughters
They look at me with scorn
I'll never hear their horn
Sometimes it's like chains
Sometimes I hang my head in shame
When people see me, they scandalize my name
I'm going down to the devil's water
I'm gonna drown in that troubled water
It's coming 'round my soul
It's way beyond control
I must be one
I must be one
I must beEmbed
