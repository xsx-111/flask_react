I Found a Reason Lyrics
Oh, I do believe
In all the things you see
What comes is better
Than what came before

And you better come come
Come come to me
Better come come come come come to me
Better run run run run run to me
Better come

Oh, I do believe
In all the things you see
What comes is better
Than what came before

And you better
Run run run run to me
Better run run run run run to me
Better come come come come come to me
Better run2Embed
