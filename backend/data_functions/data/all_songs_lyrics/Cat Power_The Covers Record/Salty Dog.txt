Salty Dog LyricsSalty dog, salty dog
I don't wanna be your Annie doll
Honey let me be your salty dog
Candyman
Two old maids sittin' in the sand
One were a she, the other were a man
Salty dog
Candyman
Worst day I ever had in my life
My best friend caught him kissin' his wife
Salty dog
Candyman
Salty dog, salty dog
I don't wanna be your Annie doll
Honey let me be your salty dog
