Red Apples LyricsI went down to the river
To meet the widow
She gave me an apple
And it was red
I slept in her black arms
For a century
She wanted nothing in return
I gave her nothing in return
The ghost of her husband
Beautiful as a horse
Pulled up an apple cart
Full of millions of red apples for us
Full of millions of red apples for us
I went down to the river
To meet the widow
She gave me an apple
And it was red
I slept in her black arms
For a century
She wanted nothing in return
I gave her nothing in return
I went down to the river
To meet the widowEmbed
