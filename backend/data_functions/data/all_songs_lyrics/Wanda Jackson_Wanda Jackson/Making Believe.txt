Making Believe LyricsMaking believe that you still love me
It's leaving me alone and so blue
I'll always dream, but I'll never own you
Making believe is all I can do
I can't hold you close, darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believe
I can't hold you close, darling, when you're not with me
You're somebody's love, you'll never be mine
Making believe I'll spend my lifetime
Loving you and making believeEmbed
