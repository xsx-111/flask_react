Just Call Me Lonesome LyricsWhy must I love a heartless one
Who'll never know the harm he's done?
Though love is blind, I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on
I climb the stairs up to my room
But no one meets me in my gloom
The silence tells me he is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on
I pray these memories at last
Will fade into the distant past
What good is life if you live alone?
Just call me lonesome from now on
These walls will hide me when I cry
And pray that heaven lets me die
If I must live and love alone
Just call me lonesome from now onEmbed
