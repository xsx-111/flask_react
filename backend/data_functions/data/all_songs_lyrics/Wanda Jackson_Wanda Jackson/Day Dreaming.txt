Day Dreaming Lyrics
You're the sweetest daydream that I've ever known
I keep you on my mind the whole day through
If I can't hold you in my arms, I'll hold you in my heart
Until this lovely daydream can come true

Day dreamin' with you on my mind
Thinking 'bout you, waitin' for the time
When my arms can hold you and I'll make you mine
Just day dreamin' all the time

I gazed into my daydreams, a picture came to me
No scene with color splendor could compare
For I was nestled in your arms, a baby on the floor
Sweet music from heaven filled the air

Day dreamin' with you on my mind
Thinking 'bout you, waitin' for the time
When my arms can hold you and I'll make you mine
Just day dreamin' all the timeEmbed
