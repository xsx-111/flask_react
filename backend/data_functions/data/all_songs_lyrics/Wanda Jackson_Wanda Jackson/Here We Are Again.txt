Here We Are Again LyricsJust when I think I've forgotten you
And our cheating love's at an end
I vow to myself I'll see you no more
But here we are again
That dim-lit cafe where I first met you
Slowly has turned into our secret rendezvous
Our vows belong to others, that makes our love unfair
But I just can't seem to find a way to end our love affair
Just when I think I've forgotten you
And our cheating love's at an end
I vow to myself I'll see you no more
But here we are again
Just when I think I've forgotten you
And our cheating love's at an end
I vow to myself I'll see you no more
But here we are againEmbed
