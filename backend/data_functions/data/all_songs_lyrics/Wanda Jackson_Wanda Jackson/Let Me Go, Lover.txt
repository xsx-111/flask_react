Let Me Go, Lover LyricsOh let me go, let me go, let me go, lover
Let me be, set me free from your spell
You made me weak, cut me deep, I can't sleep, lover
I was cursed from the first day I fell
Oh you don't want me, but you want me to go on wanting you
How I pray that you will say that we're through
Oh turn me loose, what's the use, let me go, lover
Let me go, let me go, let me go
Oh you don't want me, but you want me to go on wanting you
How I pray that you will say that we're through
Oh turn me loose, what's the use, let me go, lover
Let me go, let me go, let me goEmbed
