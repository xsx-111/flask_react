Money Honey LyricsYou know, the landlord that rings my front doorbell
I let it ring for a long, long spell
I went to the window, I peeped out the blind
And asked him to tell me what's on his mind
He said, Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me
I screamed and I hollered, I was so hard-pressed
I called the man that I loved the best
I finally got my baby about half-past three
He said, "I'd like to know what you want with me"
I said, Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me
(Money, honey!)
I screamed and I hollered, I was so hard-pressed
I called the man that I loved the best
I said, "Tell me baby, face to face
How could another woman take my place?"
He said, money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with me
Well, I've learned my lesson and now I know
The sun may shine and the winds may blow
The men, they come and the men, they go
But before I say I love you so
I'm gonna say, Money, honey
Money, honey
Money, honey
If you want to get along with meEmbed
