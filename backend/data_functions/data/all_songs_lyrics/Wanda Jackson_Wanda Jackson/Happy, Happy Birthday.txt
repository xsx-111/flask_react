Happy, Happy Birthday LyricsHappy, happy birthday, baby
Although you're with somebody new
Thought I'd drop a line to say
That I wish this happy day would find me beside you
Happy, happy birthday, baby
No, I can't call you my baby
Seems like years ago we met on a day I can't forget
'Cause that's when we fell in love
Do you remember the names we had for each other?
I was your pretty, you were my baby
How could we say goodbye?
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you with good luck and wishes too
Happy, happy birthday, baby
Do you remember the names we had for each other?
I was your pretty, you were my baby
How could we say goodbye?
Hope I didn't spoil your birthday
I'm not acting like a lady
So I'll close this note to you with good luck and wishes too
Happy, happy birthday, babyEmbed
