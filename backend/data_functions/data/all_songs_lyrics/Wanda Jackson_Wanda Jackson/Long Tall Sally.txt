Long Tall Sally LyricsGonna tell Aunt Mary 'bout Uncle John
He claims he got the misery, but he has a lot of fun
Oh baby yea, oh baby ooh baby
We're gonna have some fun tonight, yea
Well long tall Sally, she's big as street
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby yea, oh baby ooh baby
We're gonna have some fun tonight, you betcha!
Now I saw Uncle John with bald-headed Sally
Saw Aunt Mary comin' and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby yea, oh baby ooh baby
We're gonna have some fun tonight, yea
We're gonna have some fun tonight
We're gonna have some fun tonight, ooh
Have some fun tonight, well everything will be alright
Have some fun, baby, have some fun
A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop ba-lop-bam-boom
We're gonna rock and roll tonight
We're gonna rock and roll tonight
Rock and roll tonight, well everything will be alright
Have some fun, baby, have some fun tonightEmbed
