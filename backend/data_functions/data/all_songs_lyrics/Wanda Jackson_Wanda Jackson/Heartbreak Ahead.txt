Heartbreak Ahead LyricsA gypsy fortune-teller in a gay market place
Saw in her crystal ball, a young girl's stricken face
Saw in clouds, another woman and a man who were wed
She said turn back, my child, there's heartbreak ahead
Heartbreak ahead, the roadway is dark
You're paying for what started out as a lark
You're young dreams are broken, your heart is like lead
You can't run away from this heartbreak ahead
The girl cried, "Oh kind gypsy, you have opened my heart
I love him, he loves me, we can't bear to part
I tried to give him up when I found he was wed
There's nothing for me now but heartbreak ahead"
The gypsy said, "My child, give up shame and disgrace
Give him up or the world will soon laugh in your face
You can't break up the home of a man who is wed
Without causing more sorrow and heartbreak ahead"
Heartbreak ahead and you're both to blame
But it's not too late, child, to turn back from shame
For love without honor is love that is dead
And time will soon heal your heartbreak aheadEmbed
