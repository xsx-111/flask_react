I Wanna Waltz Lyrics
Well we used to waltz and go out dancin'
Now you look like a cat a-prancin'
I just stand with you at the floor
While you swing out, I holler for more

I wanna waltz, but I can't waltz
Without you, I'd be so blue

Well, you gotta bop or you ain't happy
Till they play you somethin' snappy
All you wanna do is go cat go
All I wanna do is slow down slow

I wanna waltz, but I can't waltz
Without you, I'd be so blue

I can't understand why the bop keeps a-goin'
When the music stops, you're puffin' and a-blowin'
Looks like something's bitin' you
But you cut loose on the be bop a loo
I wanna waltz, but I can't waltz
Without you, I'd be so blue

Well, you gotta bop or you ain't happy
Till they play you somethin' snappy
All you wanna do is go cat go
All I wanna do is slow down slow

I wanna waltz, but I can't waltz
Without you, I'd be so blueEmbed
