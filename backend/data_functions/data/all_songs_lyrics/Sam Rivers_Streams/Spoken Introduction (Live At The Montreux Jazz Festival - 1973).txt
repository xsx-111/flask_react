Spoken Introduction (Live At The Montreux Jazz Festival / 1973) Lyrics
Those who don't know anything about Sam Rivers, he's gonna be here for a big beautiful surprise
Let me bring with him on the band stand, on bass, Cecil McBee, Cecil, Cecil McBee!

On drums, we have a musician you may have heard on his own albums and on other records with Pharoah Sanders, Norman Connors, Norman Connors!

And now, one of the real giants of the turner saxophone, flute, soprano and piano, Sam Rivers!
