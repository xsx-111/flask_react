Disgusting LyricsYou're the stranger in here, with your stanger face
You know that everyone can see it's false
Something's rotten with you, you show no regret
Like we all know that you're supposed to do
I hope you've changed the way you think
I hope you've changed the clothes you wear
I hope that you regret these things you say
I hope in time that things will change
I think you know that anyway
You've been disgraceful
It's so regretful
You're disgusting
You know you've been disgraceful
It's so regretful
You've been disgusting
You're the outcast here, you're the native of a place
You've moved and been excluded too
You create a tension, when we were the same
There was a pressure that would force you to
I hope you've changed the way you think
I hope you've changed the clothes you wear
I hope that you regret these things you say
I hope in time that things will change
I think you know that anyway
You've been disgraceful
It's so regretful
You're disgusting
You know you've been disgraceful
It's so regretful
You're  disgusting
You're so full of venom that you'll spit into you're own sweet face, oh
I hope you've changed the way you think
I hope you've changed the clothes you wear
I hope that you regret these things you say
I hope in time that things will change
I think you know that anyway
You've been disgraceful
It's so regretful
You're disgusting
You know you've been disgraceful
It's so regretful
You're disgusting
It's so disgraceful
You're disrespectful
You're disgusting
Disgusting
Disgusting
You were disgusting
You know you've been disgusting
You're so regretfulEmbed
