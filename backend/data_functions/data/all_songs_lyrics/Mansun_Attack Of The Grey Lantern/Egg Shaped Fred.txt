Egg Shaped Fred LyricsNa na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
I'm sick of all this scratching around
I'm calling Fred to come and give me a hand
He's the queen of all the shops where he shops
And he's the king of all the scene, to be seen
Skinima nosebreak
Fatima toothpaste
Penelope cheapskate
Claudia farmgate
We're taking egg shaped Fred for tea
We'll make them sit strategically
We'll test their egg-ability
We'll make them meet
He only wants to get in your kecks
So he can carry out his own little test
He only wants to get in your pants
Because he knows that you have played in a band
Skinima nosebreak
Fatima toothpaste
Penelope cheapskate
Claudia farmgate
We're taking egg shaped Fred for tea
We'll make them sit strategically
We'll test their egg-ability
We'll make them meet
Mavis she knows
Mavis she knows
She's got all these things around her
All things to no men
She see you in hell
I'll go shopping instead
He will send his centipede to sort ya'
He stretched it out to make it two foot taller
We're taking egg shaped Fred for tea
We'll make them sit strategically
We'll test their egg-ability
We'll make them meet
