Naked Twister LyricsTo be twisted
To be naked
To be broken
To be free
Tell me stick or twist
Tell me which will it be
I tell you stick or twist
Tell me which do you see
Oh can't you see, oh oh yeah
Where do we go
Who do we trust
Who do we see, yeah now
Who wants to know
Who do we tell
What will we see, yeah
Oh where do we go now, yeah
Who do we see, oh yeah
It will sparkle
It is beauty
It is broken
It is free
Tell me stick or twist
Tell me which will it be
I tell you stick or twist
Tell me which do you see
Oh can't you see, oh oh yeah
Where do we go
Who do we trust
Who do we see, yeah now
Who wants to know
Who do we tell
What will we see, yeah
Oh where do we go now, yeah
Who do we see, oh yeah
Oh, where do we go
Who do we trust
Who do we see, yeah now
Who wants to know
Who do we tell
What will we see, yeah
Oh where do we go now, yeah
Who do we see, yeahEmbed
