You, Who Do You Hate? LyricsYou're a child
You are weak
You are precious
You won't speak
And if I ever lived again
I wish I could be you
If I ever lived again
I wish I could be you
You, I wanna be you
I wanna be you
I wanna be you
How can I
Expect you to believe
When I don't even
Believe in me
And if I ever lived again
I wish I could be you
If I ever loved again
I wish I could be you, yeah
You, I wanna be you
I wanna be you
I wanna be youEmbed
