She Makes My Nose Bleed LyricsShe makes me bleed, oh yeah, she makes my cry
She makes me sneeze, oh yeah, she makes me sigh
So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven, oh yeah
Bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven
My only number must be, must be
Bring her on down by the soles of her feet
Slapping her 'round and making it bleed
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
If he would bring her on down from heaven
She makes me bleed, oh yeah, don't know her name
She makes me freeze, oh yeah, she's in my face
So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven, oh yeah
Bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven
My only number must be, must be
Bring her on down by the soles of her feet
Slapping her 'round and making it bleed
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
If he would bring her on down from heaven
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
So bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven
So, bring her on down, bring her on down from heaven
My only number must be, must be
Bring her on down by the soles of her feet
Slapping her 'round and making it bleed
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
Don't know her name, don't know what she does
Bring her on down by the soles of her feet
Slapping her 'round and making it bleed
I vowed to my god I'd give it all up
If people bring her on down from heavenEmbed
