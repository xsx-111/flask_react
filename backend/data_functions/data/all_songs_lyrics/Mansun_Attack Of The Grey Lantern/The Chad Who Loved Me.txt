The Chad Who Loved Me LyricsAll come crashing down, your desperate icon
Youâ€™ve got a gob on with your desperate icon
You'll all come crashing in, your desperate icon
You've got to gob on your desperate icon
Am I a god, or am I Jesus?
Am I a man, or am I a boy?
Do I feel love, or just possession?
Do I feel holy, or nothing at all?
You can't deny that your shit just tastes as sweet as mine
And you can't deny that your shit just tastes as sweet as mine, sweet JesusEmbed
