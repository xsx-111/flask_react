Dark Mavis LyricsWait around, I'll be walking quite a while
Don't be late
Hard to take, Vicar twists and gets away
His lipstick's running, his dress is stunning
He's got high heels on
And his flock don't care now
Mavis what will he wear
In the path of righteous man
There is rubble where I stand
I'll be the one, you can kiss his vase
Until the end of the month
Vicar stay 'cos your lipstick smeared away
From your face
Vicar twist, grey pajamas in your case
His tights are nylon, his nails by Revlon
He's got high heels on
And his flock don't care now
Mavis what will he wear
In the path of righteous man
There is rubble where I stand
I'll be the one, you can kiss his vase
Until the end of the month
And if u should see me passing by
Do not disturb me as I fly
Though I am walking here
This is where I'll be
In the path of righteous man
There is rubble where I stand
I'll be the one, you can kiss his vase
Until the end of the month
In the path of righteous man
There is rubble where I stand
I'll be the one, you can kiss his vase
Until the end of the month
Until the end of the month
Until the end of the month
Oh yeah yeahEmbed
