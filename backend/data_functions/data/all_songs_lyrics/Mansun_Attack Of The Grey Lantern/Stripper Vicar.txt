Stripper Vicar Lyrics
(Letter, we're going to write this letter)

Dear Mavis I'm compelled to write this letter
In the hope that you may soon be getting better
I've a feeling you should go and see a doctor
If you haven't then you know you really oughta
I was worried so I went to see the vicar
But before I could confess he first confessed to be a stripper

Dear Mavis it was very strange to see him
So I thought I'd write and ask you your opinion
Should I grass on him, report him to the Cardinal?
Or whether I should egg him on to turn professional?
If I dob on him they'll call him plastic scouser
But the only thing the Stripper Vicar wears is plastic trousers

Mavis' opinion is all we really seek
Mavis' opinion is all we...

Should we lie while he's still alive?
Should we lie while he's still alive?
'Cos when the vicar strips he gets away with it
Dear Mavis thought I'd follow up my letter
Drop a line about the fate of our poor vicar
Very tragically his time on Earth is ended
Found him gagged and bound in stockings and suspenders
Dear Mavis if you tell us what your thoughts are
And I hope that they're not biased 'cos you are the vicar's daughter

Mavis's opinion, all we really seek
Mavis's opinion, all we, should we...

Should we lie now that he has died?
Should we lie now that he has died?
'Cos when the vicar strips he gets away with it

And we know him as our vicar
And by night a part-time stripper
And the vicar got suspended
In his stockings and suspenders
And he's making wine from water
While he dresses like his daughter
And we know that he's a rip off
'Cos we've seen him with his kit off
Should we lie now that he has died?
Should we lie now that he has died?
'Cos when the vicar strips he gets away with itEmbed
