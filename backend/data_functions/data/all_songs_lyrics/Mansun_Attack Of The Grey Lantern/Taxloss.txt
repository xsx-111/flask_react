Taxloss LyricsHe'll be your taxloss lover from Liverpool
Taxloss lover if the truth be told
Taxloss lover still lives in the war
Taxloss lover touching 74
Come back to me
We want your money
Taxloss
Come back to me
We want your money
Taxloss
We think you are stupid
We give you money cos our assets are fluid yeah
We'll sell you down the river
Just remember that we said we'd deliver you
Sign on the line and we'll give you the money
And then you'll be mine and we'll fly somewhere sunny
And you'll quibble that our drivel seems unsatisfactory
You're a taxloss
Come back to me
We want your money
Taxloss
