Justice LyricsI wake up every day
And look at my country
This is what the blind man sees
Does it look like justice to you
It doesn't look like justice to me
They've got to protect their property
Better phone up the police
Call up corruption
Who killed Blair Peach?
Political prisoners caught at Southall
And tried by kangaroo courts
A man had to have his balls removed
After being kicked by the S.P.G
It doesn't look like justice to me
Have your heard the rumours
You've got 2 years till conscription
Do you want to go fight Zimbabwe
Do you want to go fight in Ireland
Soon it's got to be you and me
Who guards the guards
Who polices the police
What happened at Red Lion Square
Who killed Kevin Gately
Jimmy Kelly arrested in Liverpool
And later died in custody
And they'll bring in the army
To break up the strikes
And they'll bring the legal terrorists
To control civil disorders
Ireland is their practice ground
To control civil disorders
Our very own Vietnam
Who guards the guards
Who polices the police
