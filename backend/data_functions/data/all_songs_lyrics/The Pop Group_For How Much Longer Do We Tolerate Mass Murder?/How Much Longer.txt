How Much Longer LyricsJust one question
For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?
Tolerance is a mask of apathy
Attrition is a daily policy
There's a hell of a lot of money to be made from wars
What's pathetic is our apathy in the face of the misery of others
Our inaction in the face of their murder and enslavement
Is a violent crime
There is guilt and there is action
All that we ask for is our very own garden of Eden
Nixon and Kissinger should be tried for war crimes for
The secret bombing of Cambodia
P.L.O. spells Plutonium
The Muslims are rising up Jihad!
That means holy war
Every badly paid moment of boredom on the production line
Is a violent crime
For How Much Longer Do We Tolerate Mass Murder?
In our ignorance, people are killed
In your decadence, people die
All that we ask for is our very own garden of Eden
All that we get is a garden of interballistic missiles
Phallic nuclear warheads were born in the hearts of men
Why let sadistic mass murderers control our world
Action to back up belief
Children born with un-acclaimed joy
Children born with un-acclaimed joy
Just heard that President Carter is threatening military intervention
American aircraft carriers are heading for IranEmbed
