There Are No Spectators LyricsThere are no spectators
You participate whether you like it or not
There are no spectators
You are responsible whether you like it or not
There is no neutral
No one is innocent
And no one will be forgiven
Escapism is not freedom
Voyeurs of the armageddon
To wash your hands of the conflict
Between the powerful and the powerless
Means you are taking sides with the oppressors
Watch out for the magicians
Some man see things as they are and ask why?
I dream things that never were and ask why not?
We are all accessories to murder
There is guilt and there is action
Bring the war into the peoples home
Bring the war into the peoples home
Jihad
Only you can prevent the armageddon
Only you can be your own liberator
Only youEmbed
