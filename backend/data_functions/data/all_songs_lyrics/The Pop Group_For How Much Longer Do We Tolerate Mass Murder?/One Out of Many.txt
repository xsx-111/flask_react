One Out of Many LyricsSelfish desires are burning like fires
Among those who hoard the gold
As they continue to keep the people asleep
And the truth from being told
Racism and greed keep the people in need
From getting what's rightfully theirs
Cheating, stealing, and double dealing
As they exploit the people's fears
And for a few dollars more they'd start a war
To exploit some brother's mother
Then there's the pyramid that stands by itself
Created by Black people's knowledge and wealth
And over the pyramid hangs the devil's eye
And tells how they fooled the people
Into thinking paper money was real
Now "THESAUR" means the treasury
Where they store the gold they stole
And "AMER" means to punish
Like the slaves they bought and sold
Then "SEPTENT" means seven
Like 1776
When the thirteen devils gathered
To unleash their bag of tricks
Then "SIGEL" means the images
They've created to fool the world
Like the colors on Old Glory
The flag that they unfurled
Now the red's for the color of the Indian man
White's for the devils who stole the land
Blue's for the eyes that hypnotize
With the tricks and traps they sprung
And even to this very same day
They all speak with forked tongue
And so the power is in the hand of the ruling classes
Playing god with the fate of all the masses
So the people don't get any in the land of the plenty
Because "E PLURIBUS UNUM" means "One out of many"Embed
