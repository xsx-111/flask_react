Blind Faith LyricsBlind Faith
When the crowds cry
Blind Faith
When the crowds cry
Blind Faith
When the crowds cry
We won't play your silly games
Won't follow your leaders
We are lemmings
We are sheep
Contented slaves
Castration
Let's kill their reason
We're controlled heroes
I don't believe
I can't believe
I don't believe
I can't believe
Tongue removed at birth
I had my tongue removed at birth
I had my tongue removed at birth
Life is not blind but we are
I saw stones and men's hooves in the moonlight
(Occult fascist)
Thank you parents
Thank you media
Thank you teachers
Thank you friends for all that I have been taught
Only do what you have been taught
Blind Faith
When the crowds cry
Blind Faith
They say their work is good but I say it's immoral
Prophets are hunted and imprisoned
While uniformed mass murderers become heroesEmbed
