Rob a Bank LyricsRob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Robin Hood Robin Hood
Riding through the glen
Robin Hood Robin Hood
And his merry men
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Steal from the rich
And give to the poor
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank

You have to..????
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Robin Hood
Robin Hood
Riding through the glen
Robin Hood Robin Hood
And his merry men
Robin Hood Robin Hood
Riding through the glen
Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob
We want nothing
????
But those who steal the wealth of the people
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank Rob a bank
I'm Robin Hood
I'm Robin Hood
