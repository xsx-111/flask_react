Forces of Oppression LyricsTraining for us, it's good training for us
Against the forces of oppression
Riots in the Grove, road blocks in Brixton
Vigilantes in St. Paul's, Handsworth and all
And they come with lead in their batons, pretending
Defending the National Front
With their symbol of hate right in our face
Paramilitary exercises in the ghetto....
The rich get richer, and the poor will die
TAPE: "...and I do know of people from the underground who constantly carried weapons, and I could not avoid the impression that to them, they were a boost to their masculinity. The weapons multiplied their virility...."
The armed wing is Column 88, Column 88, the return of the Panthers, Column 88...
It's good training for us against the forces of oppression
Self-defence is no offenceEmbed
