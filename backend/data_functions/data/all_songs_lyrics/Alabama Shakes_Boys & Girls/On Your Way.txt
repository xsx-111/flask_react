On Your Way Lyrics
On your way to God
Did you think of me?
On your way to Heaven
Did you say "I'll see you again"?

It wasn't me, why wasn't it me?

On your way to the promised land
Did you say, "Oh, she was such a friend"?
Then they took you higher
And I don't know if I can follow

It wasn't me, why wasn't it me?

On your way, I said to the air:
"I don't know if I am strong"
So, I climbed to the mountain
And I don't know what I did wrong

And it was just me
Just a little ol' meEmbed
