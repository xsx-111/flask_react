Be Mine Lyrics
All the world can't hold a candle to you
'Cause all the world is in the dark
Well, I'll tell you why I'm so sure
Ooh, I took a shine to you
Oh yeah!

And all them ladies can't change your mind
And all them girls won't turn your head
And all them lions in the jungle at night
I don't worry 'bout my baby
Don't worry 'bout you, baby

'Cause I know why I don't worry
I sing me no sad songs
Happy, never sad for long
Don't you call me anything, doll, but your baby
I know...

All them girls might wanna rip us apart
If they wanna fight, they done started fucking with the wrong heart
They got another thing comin'
Or I'll be a dead woman
Oh, and I would do all that for you
I'd do it for you
'Cause all them girls don't know you like I do
All them girls don't know you like I do
All them ladies don't know you like I do
That's why I call you my baby

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Oooh

So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be mine
So be my baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be my baby
Be my baby, be my baby
Be my... ooh ooh ooh
I said alright, I said alright
I say alright, I say it out loud
Oh baby, I said alright, I said alright
Forever and alright2Embed
