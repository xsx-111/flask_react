Hold On Lyrics
Bless my heart, bless my soul
Didn't think I'd make it to 22 years old
There must be someone up above
Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up

You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"

So, bless my heart and bless yours, too
I don't know where I'm gonna go
Don't know what I'm gonna do
There must be somebody up above
Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up

You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"

"Yeah, you gotta wait
Yeah, you gotta wait"
But I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait
So, bless my heart and bless my mind
I got so much to do, I ain't got much time
So, must be someone up above
Saying "Come on, girl
Yeah, you got to get back up

You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"

"Yeah, you gotta wait"
I don't wanna wait
But I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait

You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on12Embed
