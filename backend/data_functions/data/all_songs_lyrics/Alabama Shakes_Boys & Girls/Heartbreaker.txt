Heartbreaker Lyrics
How was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker?
I didn't know, I couldn't know
Now I'm laying on this killing floor, and I wanna die

Listen
How I was supposed to know?
Was it by your sweet face, or your eyes?
Oh Lord
How was I supposed to know you'd give me my heartache?
Mama couldn't tell me about the feeling
And all them lovesick songs
Well, they got true meaning
Oh why, why did you have to slice me wide, babe?
How was I supposed to know you'd gimme my first heart aching?

How was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker?
Oh I didn't know, I didn't know
Now, I'm on this killing floor and I wanna die

Who ever said that we two were never meant?
I'll tell you how I know you're wrong, I'd fight you all
I know the way things are, I'd fight the planets
Why, why did you have to slice so wide, baby?
How was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker?
Oh, how was I supposed to know you was a heartbreaker?
Oh, oh, I didn't know, I didn't know
Why you gotta go and kill me so that I wanna die
Oh, "I wanted to grow old with you", you told me so
But then, you go
How was I supposed to know?Embed
