Rise to the Sun Lyrics
All I believe in is a dream
I haunt the Earth, though I am fully seen
In all my years, I've never felt more sure than now
Well, I got to get off this rock, somehow

I feel so homesick
Where's my home?
Where I belong, or where I was born
Now I was told to go where the wind would blow
And it blows away
Away

Well, my eyes are full of stars
But I just can't reach 'em
Oh, how high they are
I got to believe what I'm seeing can come true
But in a modern world, that can be so hard to do

I feel so homesick
Where's my home?
Where I belong, or where I was born
Now, I was told to go where the wind would blow
And it blows away
Away
I wake up, rise to the sun
I go to work
And I come back home
I wake up, rise to the sun
I go to work
And I come back home
Come back homeEmbed
