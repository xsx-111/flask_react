World of Pain Lyrics
Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me

And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Is there a reason for today?
Is there a reason for today?
Do you remember?

I can hear all the cries of the city
No time for pity
For a growing tree
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me

Outside my window is a tree
Outside my window is a tree
There only for me

And it stands in the grey of the city
No time for pity
For the tree or me
There is a world of pain
In the falling rain
Around me1Embed
