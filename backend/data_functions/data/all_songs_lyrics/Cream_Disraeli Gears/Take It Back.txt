Take It Back Lyrics
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta here
Right away, far away, take that thing right outta here

Don't let them take me to where streams are red
I want to stay here and sleep in my own bed
Need all your loving, long blonde hair
Don't let them take me 'cause I easily scare

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta here
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta here
Right away, far away, take that thing right outta here

I got this great need, the need to stay alive
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive
So come on, baby, don't go away
Just let them save me for a rainy day

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta here

I got this need, the need to stay alive
Not ashamed of my creed, I've got to survive
So come on, baby, don't go away
Just let them save me for a rainy day

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta here
Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta here
Right away, far away, take that thing right outta here

I got this thing, I've got to keep it sharp
Don't go to places where it won't shine in the dark
So come on, baby, don't go away
Just let them save me for a rainy day

Take it back, take it back, take that thing right outta hereEmbed
