Strange Brew Lyrics

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's a witch of trouble in electric blue
In her own mad mind she's in love with you
With you
Now, what you gonna do?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

She's some kind of demon messin' in the glue
If you don't watch out it'll stick to you
To you
What kind of fool are you?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

On a boat in the middle of a raging sea
She would make a scene for it all to be
Ignored
And wouldn't you be bored?

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you

Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew
Strange brew

Strange brew
Kill what's inside of you6Embed
