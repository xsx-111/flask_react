Taken for a Ride Lyrics
Marvin walked into a helpless land
And wondered lightly, "Am I happy?
Is this happy?"
Following the footsteps left by man
He stepped to reprimand the mystic
So sadistic
Took a step into the elevator
Who said, "Guess I'll see you later
Don't you worry"
Fifteen flights that lasted nights
And days that spent without a cent for creatures
With their beat shirts

Listening to painted whispered
Light on top forgotten hill

Next the stranded senate of the white brick house
With flowers asked some questions
For their story
All feeling now, he took his bow
And left the stage of time with no answers
To no questions
Lonely paperbacks that wanted
Just a taste of feeling to implode them
Before living
Tiptoed to that wooden sign that said
"Now take your place in line for happy
This is lovely"
Listening to painted whispered
Light on top forgotten hill

One secondary smile to go that extra mile
To make me feel today, to make it go away
The chemistry is gone, taken for a ride
Far away from you, no longer left inside

The actor with his world renown
Was thinking 'bout his last real day of silence
Was it over?
Or is it just we all think that our answer
Isn't real, it's just a picture
Of a letter
Bumble mumble, make the rounds
No matter what, you'll seem profound
It's useless just to worry
Something normal happens somewhere
Far away in clouds so please stop thinking
This is happy

Listening to painted whispered
Light on top forgotten hill
One secondary smile to go that extra mile
To make me feel today, to make it go away
The chemistry is gone, taken for a ride
Far away from you, no longer left inside
One secondary smile to go that extra mile
To make me feel today, to make it go away
The chemistry is gone, taken for a ride
Far away from you, no longer left inside

There're no secrets in the door
Just a moment doing chores (don't look so sad)
And there's something, and there's something
And there's something, and there's something
Next to nothing
And there's something, and there's something
But you're gone11Embed
