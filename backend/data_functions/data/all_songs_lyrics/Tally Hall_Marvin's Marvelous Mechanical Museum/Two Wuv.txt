Two Wuv Lyrics
I have this little thing
It's probably just a fling
Two girls I like a lot
I think they're really hot
But I'm not sure if they know
How my love began to grow
It took a lot of time
But right now it's solely mine

(Today!) I drew a mural of
The things I'd like to love
And where my heart resides
Is with two girls with great eyes
If they just gave me a chance
I'd show them what they want and teach 'em what they've got
I'd tickle each and every one of their fancies
And I'd take the key to my heart and open it, and let the love shine through

Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man
And I think that it'd be totally cool
If I hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school
(Mary Kate!)

I saw you on TV
You dressed up like a bee
Reminds me of the time
How it's gone and it's gone and it's gone
It's sadness every day that passes
Without you and I really wanna, really wanna
Really wanna hold you both tight
And tell you you're mine but instead I sing:

Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man
And I think that it'd be totally cool
If I hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school

*Ringing*
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, I'm calling from Tally Hall...
Wait, say that again, slowly
What?
Hello?
Hello?
Hey, I'm calling from Tally Hall, and I just-- *Dial tone*
Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man
And I think that it'd be totally cool
If I hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school

I know that life without you and you would be sad
And I know it'd be bad

Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
That your loveliness blossomed and I wanna hold your hands
And I think that it'd be totally cool
If I hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school
Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man
And I think that it'd be totally cool
If I hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school
Mary-Kate and Ashley, I hope you understand
That I love you a lot and I wanna be your man
And I think that it'd be totally cool
If I hung around your apartments and enrolled in your school

Once you learn to love me, life will be alright
Once you learn to love me, life will be alright
Once you learn to love me, life will be alright...2Embed
