Be Born Lyrics
I suppose you're quite content in your swimming pool
All you pink-skinned babes are the same
And you can't stay forever young, so get out here and see the sun
You're only six inches away from becoming one

I was in your shoes before, or lack thereof
And things worked out for me
There's a dozen people here, and they're waiting for you
It's your party, you can cry if you want to

What if I told you I could show you something?
What if I told you I could make you live?
Follow my instruction, swim in the direction
Of my voice, hear my voice
Of my voice, hear my voice

You think that you've seen it all, in your little ball
But man, you're wrong and she's been waiting
Long and hard to kiss your head and hold your hands
And hold you while you fall asleep, and

What if I told you I could show you something?
What if I told you I could make you live?
Follow my instruction, swim in the direction
Of my voice, hear my voice
Of my voice, hear my voice
Ba ba ba, ba-da-baaa
Baaa, ba-da-ba, ba-ee-ah
Ba ba ba, ba-da-baaa
Baaa, ba-da-ba, ba-ee-ah

What if I told you I could show you something?
What if I told you I could make you live?
Follow my instruction, swim in the direction
Of my voice, hear my voice
Of my voice, hear my voice2Embed
