The Bidding Lyrics
Mm mm mm, mm-mm mm mm
Mm mm mm, mm-mm mm mm
Mm-mm-mm mm mm, mm mm mm
Mm mm mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm...

I've been sleeping in a cardboard box
Spending every dollar at the liquor shop
And even though I know I haven't got a lot
I'll try to give you love until the day you drop

Mm mm mm, mm-mm mm mm
Mm mm mm, mm-mm mm...

I've been training like a Pavlov dog
Let my independence out to take a hike
All you gotta do is activate my bell
And I'll fetch you anything you like!

Going once, going twice
Every man here has a price
Over where? Over there?
Sold (Sold!) to not a single lady in here
I've been here like a thousand times
Dated every woman in the atmosphere
I've been to every continent
Broken all the hearts in every hemisphere
And if I'm not the type of guy you like to circumvent
Just remember not to love me when I disappear

I graduated at the top
I like to take advantage of the bourgeoisie
So if you have a fantasy of being a queen
Maybe you should blow a couple bucks on me

Going once, going twice
Won't these gentlemen suffice?
Any here? Any there?
Any motions anywhere?
Going twice, going thrice
Guess this means we'll go four times a lady

I promise I'll be all you'll need, ever need
You'll never have to shop around (don't shop around)
And I'll give you all you'll ever need, ever need
Don't worry, I will never let you down, let you down
Don't worry, I will never let you down
So many ladies are wanting for mates
And the prospects are good, but the date's never great
Over here, over there, over where? Anywhere
They're too busy with winning the bidding to care
And he's sold31Embed
