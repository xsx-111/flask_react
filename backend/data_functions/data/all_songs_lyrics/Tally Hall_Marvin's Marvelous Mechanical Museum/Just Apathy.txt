Just Apathy Lyrics
I'm too much, or not enough
Maybe everyone else is messed up
Well, anyway, I can't seem to
Stay in just one state of mind
Waiting 'round for something better
I'm the one that wouldn't let her
Now I'm back and forth
I get bored when she's no perfect find

'Cause it's one thing, or another
I don't even know why I bother
One thing just tears her down
'Cause it's one thing, or another
I don't even know why I bother
Something I just can't get around

Consider the possibility that
You've been had but not by me
We're just kids, don't worry about this
My course is run and I'm so tired
Until the next one comes inspired
I feel bad and I should
I made her sad and I knew it would
'Cause it's one thing, or another
I don't even know why I bother
One thing just tears her down
'Cause it's one thing, or another
I don't even know why I bother
Something I just can't get around

I need to learn to wait in turn
'Cause now I just step blindly
And I'm only happy when
I can close my eyes and I just dive in
And forget about acting kindly

('Cause it's always one)

'Cause it's one thing, or another
I don't even know why I bother
One thing just tears her down
'Cause it's one thing, or another
Donâ€™t even know why I bother

Some things I just can't get around
Still I know you won't let me down4Embed
