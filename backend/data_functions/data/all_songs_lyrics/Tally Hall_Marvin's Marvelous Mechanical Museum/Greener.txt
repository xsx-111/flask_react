Greener Lyrics
Here's that part again where everything's more than it should be
And greener seems to fall beneath your feet
Seconds tick like boulders whenever you don't call
Does it seem like that where you are?
Wherever it is you are, does it seem like that where you ah-are?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Time for time together and depending on the weather
We'll either argue in your house or outside
How different I felt, before I got this notch on my belt
'Cause in my plans, you were all for me
Yeah but now it seems that you'd just rather leave

Wherever you go is breaking me slowly
Don't leave it alone, don't leave it alone
You sound so much further on the phone
You fit just right, right next to me
But there's always a reason why it can't be

Telephones make you seem miles away from home
All alone, I get a little meaner
I leave a message at your tone, and miles away from home
You get a little cleaner of me
And I find a little greener shade of envy
Wherever you go is breaking me slowly
Don't leave it alone, don't leave it alone
You sound so much further on the phone
You fit just right, right next to me
But there's always a reason why it can't be

Wherever you are is breaking my heart
Don't leave it alone, don't leave it alone
You fit just right, right next to me8Embed
