Spring and a Storm Lyrics
One time, I tried to sing
About spring and a storm
But you know how it goes
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-blah, blah"
All along
Won't you please stop complaining?
I'm playing a song

But all the rain comes down the same
Falling to from where it came
On the ground and back around up into the sky

I wish you could've heard the music
When the clouds growled overhead
I finally felt enthusiastic, I finally felt alive
"Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah-blah, blah"
So you said
"Would it please you to listen
To thunder instead?"

Man the rain came down that day
And it drained my soul away
And I wondered why I even bothered to try
Mr. Moon?
Yeah?
Tell us about the sky
The sky is deep and dark and eternally high
Many people think that's where you go when you die
Do you?
Well I think you return to obscure
Or wherever you were before you were
But I won't let you lose yourself in the rain

We have so much left to sing
There's a storm for every spring
All you see and you and me, became from a star
You're a star, you're a star
You're a star, you're a star
You're a star, you're a star

Silent explosive and silent explosive
And silent explosive and silent explosive
Create until nothing is left to create
And the universe bursts with an overworked sigh
And pretend to, pretend to recrown the creation
And sing the same thing 'til the clouds start to cry
And then over and over and over again
And then over and over and never again21Embed
