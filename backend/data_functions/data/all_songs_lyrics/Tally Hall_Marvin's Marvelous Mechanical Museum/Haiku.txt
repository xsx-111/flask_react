Haiku Lyrics
I have been trying
To write a haiku for you
Some things I just can't do
Maybe you're beyond
Ancient Asian poetry
Or maybe it's just me

I have been trying
To get this haiku just right
All night for you, alright
I'm through!

Maybe this poem
Was lost in the sauce we spilled
That never got refilled
I've never thought much
Of formulaic verse anyway
And rhymes are not my fortâ€“

I have been trying
To get this haiku just right
All night for you, alright
I'm through!
I'm trying not to try too hard
But you're hard to write down right
So I pen these trite attempts
At haikus for you tonight

La da dee diddum
Lada da dum doo diddle
Dum doo la dee do
There, that's sufficient
I wrote a haiku for you (He wrote a haiku for you)
Well, I tried at least
And that's not so bad, I'm working here
Can that be said for you?

I'm trying not to try too hard
But you're hard to write down right
So I pen these trite attempts
At haikus for you tonight

Words don't work like Webster says
They trip me up all night
I'm just trying to write for you
But you're hard to write down right10Embed
