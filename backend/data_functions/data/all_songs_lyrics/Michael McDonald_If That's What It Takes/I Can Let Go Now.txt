I Can Let Go Now Lyrics
It was so right, it was so wrong
Almost at the same time
The pain and ache a heart can take
No one really knows

When the memories cling and keep you there
'Til you no longer care
And you can let go now

It's wrong for me to cling to you
Somehow I just needed time
From what was to be, it's not like me
To hold somebody down

But I was tossed high by love
I almost never came down
Only to land here
Where love's no longer found
Where I'm no longer bound
And I can let go nowEmbed
