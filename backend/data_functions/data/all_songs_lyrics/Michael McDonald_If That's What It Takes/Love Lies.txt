Love Lies Lyrics(Michael McDonald And Randy Goodrum)
What's that lyin' on her pillow
Folded up so neat
What once was love is now a letter
Lying where she used to sleep
Oh, I thought love was something I could count on
But it took her to show me that

Love lies-right to your face
Love lies-just when I had faith
It would let me down
I know that love lies-right to the end
Love lies-I know the word will never mean the same to me
What's this emptiness inside me
Where her promise used to be
She said she'd be here to guide me
I guess now the joke's on me
Oh, I thought love was something like devotion
But it took her to show me that

Just when you think you know what love is about
Someone takes your place, and you find that
