I Gotta Try Lyrics
Maybe it's true what they say about
Maybe we can't make the ends meet
Maybe we'll all have to do without
Maybe this world's just incomplete

Well, we all look for truth in this life
Searching with hope inside
If it's so hard living in a desperate world
We all do the best that we can

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
Others will live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I gotta try now
Oh, I've got to try, baby

Maybe it's too much to think about
Maybe there ain't nothin' left to say
But if our time is really runnin' out
Then this ain't no time to run away
'Cause we're destined to look
For the truth in this life
Searching with tearful eyes
If it's so hard livin' in a desperate world
Then tell me why was I born

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
Others will live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I gotta try now

Lonely, living so lonely
It ain't too late
To turn it all around

Some people see a change
Some will remain the same
Others will live their lives under the gun
Some see the road as clear
Some say the end is here
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I've gotta try and change
(Someone's tryin')
Others remain the same
(Someone's cryin' out)
Some of us live our lives under the gun
(While we live under the gun)
Some see the road as clear
(Someone's livin')
Some say the end is here
(Someone's givin' up)
They say it's a hopeless fight
But I say I gotta try and changeEmbed
