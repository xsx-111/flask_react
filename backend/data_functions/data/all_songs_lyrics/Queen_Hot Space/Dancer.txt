Dancer Lyrics
I'm not invited to the party
Been sitting here all night
I'm all alone at the party
I don't feel all right
Ain't got no black coat
Ain't got no tie
I gotta shape up now
Come on, baby, you gotta know why
Ha, take off!

Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me ?
Cool

You're the life and soul of the funk-tion
It took me all night
To get hold of the right introduction
Blew me out of sight
I taste your lipstick
I look in your eyes
You feel fantastic
My body cries
Dancer, dancer
I can't live with it I'm gonna die without it
Dancer, dancer
Ain't no doubt about it
Dancer, dancer
Why don't you kick off your dancing shoes
And come and ride with me?
Hot space, let's go

Dancer, dancer
I can't believe you're dancing
Dancer, dancer
Can't take you home, I can't take you dancing
Dancer, dancer
Bring out the funk and dance the night away
Dancer, dancer

Dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer
Dancer, dancer
Dance dance dance dance dance
Guten Morgen, Sie w√ºnschten, geweckt zu werden2Embed
