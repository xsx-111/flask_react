Action This Day Lyrics
Action

This street honey is a mean street
Living in this street honey needs a mean streak
We've got criminals living in this street

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling, this world is using me

This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a let-down
Coming to this town honey is a showdown

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Some sunshine ray through a crack in a shutter
Or a sight of a light at the end of a tunnel
Still, there's a feeling, this world is using me

Action this day
Action this night
Oh, we've gotta learn to learn to love to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day
Action this night
Oh, you've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right
Your mind honey is a bleak place
Living in your mind's living in a blank space
Your mind is coming from a rat race

But there's a heartbeat pulse that keeps on pumping
Like a jukebox playing the same dead record
Or a radio in the corner keeps blaring
I gotta feeling that just won't quit, this world is using me

Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Ooh, we've got to learn to learn to live
You can't say it ain't right
Action this day, yeah
Action this night
Oh, You've got the power, you've got the power
You've got the power to love and to live
You can't say it ain't right

Action (hey)
(Hey hey hey)
Action this day
Action this day (this day, yeah)
Action this day
Action this day
