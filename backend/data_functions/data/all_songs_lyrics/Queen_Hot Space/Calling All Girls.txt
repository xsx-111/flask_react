Calling All Girls Lyrics
Calling all boys (boys)
Calling all girls (girls)
Calling all people on streets
Around the world

Take this message
A message for you
This message is old, yeah
This message is true
This message is
This message is
This message is
This message is

Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear

Some sleepless nights in wait for you
Some foreign presence you feel
Comes creeping through
Some stream of hope
The whole world through
Spread like some silent disease
You'll get yours too
This message is
This message is
This message is
This message is
Love
Take a message of love
Far and near
Take a message of love
For all to hear
For all to hear

Calling all boys
Calling all girls
Calling all boys
Calling all girls
Calling all girls12Embed
