Back Chat Lyrics
Mmm, yeah
Ha!

Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat, Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

Oh yeah, see what you've done to me

Backchat, Backchat, you're driving me insane
It's a battle to the end, knock you down, you come again
Talk back, talk back, you've got me on the rack
Twisting every word I say, you wind me up and get your way
Fat chance I have of making a romance
If I'm ever gonna win, have to get the last word in
Take it from there, twisting every word I say
Huh, wind me up and let me play

Back chat (oh yeah), Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat (hey), Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat (yeah), Back chat, and you always get your way

Wake up, stand up and drag yourself on out
Get down, get ready, scream and shout
Back off, be cool, and learn to change your ways
'Cause you're talking in your sleep and you're walking in a daze
Don't push your luck with me, I'm ready to attack
'Cause when I'm tryna talk to you all you do is just talk back
You stand so tall you don't frighten me at all
Don't talk back, don't talk back, don't talk back
Just leave me alone
Hey

Back chat, Back chat, you burn all my energy
Back chat (huh), Back chat, criticizing all you see
Back chat, Back chat, analyzing what I say
Back chat, Back chat, and you always get your way

Yes, you do, ah
Yes, you do, baby, c'mon!
Back chat, Back chat
Back chat, Back chat (C'mon)
Back chat, Back chat (Hit me!)
Back chat, Back chat (Go for it! Go for it! Go for it! Baby)
Back chat, Back chat5Embed
