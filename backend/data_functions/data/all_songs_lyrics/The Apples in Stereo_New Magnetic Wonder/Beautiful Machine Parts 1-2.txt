Beautiful Machine Parts 1-2 LyricsParanoid in your sleep
And you have no voice
Silently
Paranoid in your sleep
And you try to speak
Paralyzed in your bed
And you close your eyes
Ciphers read
Paralyzed in your bed
And you lose your head
And you know nobody
Knows you better
Leave the light on in your room
Parallels in the past
And the ringing bells
Sirens sound
Parallels in the past
And you try to grasp
Passengers in your mind
And the faces blurred
Visors down
Passengers in your mind
And you see them sigh
And you know nobody
Knows you better
Leave the light on in your room
Girl, you have a beautiful disease
The way you are in this world
As though you were not meant to be
Girl, you're like a beautiful machine
The way you are in this world
Undisturbed by what you seeEmbed
