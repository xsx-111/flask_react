Skyway LyricsForty times you may question your life
Fortified with a hunting knife
Before you find out if you survive
Questioning marks have turned into scars
For the record you remember the few, yeah
Who for a second time you bid adieu
Forty days in the neon haze
Festering dreams are dressed in vagaries
You follow the skyway
You follow your right-of-way
You follow the streets and the cars
And the shadows and the stars
Forty lessons you may hear from the sun, now
You never listened to a single one
Falling leaves whisper like thieves
Not that you mind you live on stolen time
You follow the skyway
You follow your right-of-way
You follow the streets and the cars
And the shadows and the stars
Fists loaded with a furious disdain
Your ferocity will be your shame
Fast motion like a curious flame
The best I can do is to turn my back on you
You follow the skyway
You follow your right-of-way
You follow the streets and the cars
And the shadows and the stars
You follow the skyway
You follow your right-of-way
You follow the streets and the cars
And the shadows and the stars
Streets and the cars and the shadows and the starsEmbed
