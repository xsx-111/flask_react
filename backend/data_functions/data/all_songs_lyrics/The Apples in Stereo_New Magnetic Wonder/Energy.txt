Energy LyricsAnd the world is made of energy
And the world is electricity
And the world is made of energy
And there's a light inside of you
And there's a light inside of me
And the world is made of energy
And the world is synchronicity
And the world is made of energy
And there's a light inside of you
And there's a light inside of me
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright ah huh yeah
We're gonna see sunlight
We're gonna see the sunlight ah huh yeah
And the world is made of energy
And the world is possibility
And the world is made of energy
And there's a light inside of you
And there's a light inside of me
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright ah huh yeah
We're gonna see the sunlight
We're gonna see the sunlight ah huh yeah
And the world is made of energy
And the world is electricity
And the world is made of energy
And there's a light inside of you
And there's a light inside of me
And the world is made of energy
And the world is possibility
And the world is made of energy
And there's a light inside of you
And there's a light inside of me
