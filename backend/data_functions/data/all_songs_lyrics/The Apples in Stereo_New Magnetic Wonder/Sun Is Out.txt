Sun Is Out LyricsCity sounds are floating around
I'm sitting on my doorstep
Watching the world go 'round
When the crowd is dragging you down
I'll give you my street address
We'll take a ride downtown
The sun is out (x2)
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out (x2)
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out (x2)
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out (x2)
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
The sun is out (x2)
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, check it out
Check it outEmbed
