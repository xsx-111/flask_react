Can You Feel It? LyricsUh-oh, uh-oh, turn up your stereo
Uh-oh, uh-oh, I feel electric when the meter starts to glow
Uh-oh, uh-oh, turn up your stereo
Uh-oh, uh-oh, I feel the magic when the speaker starts to blow
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
It makes you feel good
It makes you feel good
Uh-oh, uh-oh, turn up your stereo
Uh-oh, uh-oh, drown out the static on the FM radio
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
It makes you feel good
It makes you feel good
Uh-oh, uh-oh, turn up your stereo
Uh-oh, uh-oh, drown out the bullshit on the FM radio
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
It makes you feel good
It makes you feel goodEmbed
