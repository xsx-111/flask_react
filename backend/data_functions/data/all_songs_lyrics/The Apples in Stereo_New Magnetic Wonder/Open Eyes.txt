Open Eyes LyricsWhat do you see when you are
Inside a star, inside a star?
What do you do when you are young?
Stare at the sun, stare at the sun
Did you perceive at the time
That you were blind, that you were blind?
What do you see when you are
Inside a star, inside a star?
Now you lie there with open eyes
And now you sleep by the phone
Now you lie there with open eyes
And now you weep on your own
Now you lie there with open eyes
You know you're not alone
What do you see when you are
Afraid of the dark, afraid of the dark?
What did you do when you were old?
Hide from the cold, hide from the cold
Did you perceive even then
You'd be back again, that you'd come back again?
What do you see when you are
Inside a star, inside a star?
Now you lie there with open eyes
And now you sleep by the phone
Now you lie there with open eyes
And now you weep on your own
Now you lie there with open eyes
You know you're not aloneEmbed
