Sunndal Song LyricsIn tired paths of light
You circle me and try to pin me down
And all the forward thoughts
Of emptiness are moving to the sound
On such a perfect night
The moonlight lingers softly in the air
And to the moon's delight
It shimmers slightly dancing in your hair
And so when you're down
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
Who's always sure of where you are
And all the things you need to know
And when you're tired and think the moon
Forgot to shine on you you'll see
Just wait for me to show you
The pockets in the air
That float and turn and hold the flecks of light
The sound of happiness
Will show in motions rendered by the night
And dreams of splintered sounds
Which played before you silent as a thought
And you'll remember these
Are better than the reasons you had lost
And so when you're down
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
Who's always sure of where you are
And all the things you need to know
And when you're tired and think the moon
Forgot to shine on you you'll see
Just wait for me to show you
And so when you're down
I'll lift you up I'll be the one
Who's always sure of where you are
And all the things you need to know
And when you're tired and think the moon
Forgot to shine on you you'll see
Just wait for me to show youEmbed
