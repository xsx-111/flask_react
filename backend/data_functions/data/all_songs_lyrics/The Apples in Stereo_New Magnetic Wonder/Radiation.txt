Radiation Lyrics
Too much radiation
You know it gets in your mind
Too much information
You know that it's undefined
Got no concentration
You know that you're in your bed
Too much fluctuation
You know that it's in your head

You gotta get back to the place that you can believe in
You gotta get back to that place that
You know you're gonna see your friends again
You gotta get back to the place that you can be free in
You gotta get back to that place that
You know you're gonna see your friends again

Too many distractions
You know that you can't stand still
Too many reactions
You know that you have no will

You gotta get back to the place that you can believe in
You gotta get back to that place that
You know you're gonna see your friends again
You gotta get back to the place that you can be free in
You gotta get back to that place that
You know you're gonna see your friends again
Too much radiationEmbed
