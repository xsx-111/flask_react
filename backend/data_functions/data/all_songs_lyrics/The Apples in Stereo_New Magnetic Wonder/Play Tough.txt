Play Tough LyricsSaturday you woke me up from a dream
Torn out of the pages of a magazine
You got to play tough my love, whoa
You got to play cool, whoa
You got to play tough, my love
When you play me for a fool
(When you play me for a...)
Saturday you woke me up into a drag
Peaches in the creases of a plastic bag
You got to play tough, my love, whoa
You got to play cool, whoa
You got to play tough, my love
When you play me for a fool
(When you play me for a..)
When you play me for a fool
When you play me for a...
Saturday is not the ideal day to break up
Don't you know it takes a little time to wake up
You got to play tough, my love, whoa
You got to play cool, whoa
You got to play tough, my love
When you play me for a fool
(When you play me for a...)
You got to play tough, my love, whoa
You got to play cool, whoa
You got to play tough, my love
When you play me for a fool
(When you play me for a...)
When you play me for a foolEmbed
