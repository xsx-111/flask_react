7 Stars LyricsSeven stars in the sky, in the sky
You're feeling sociable
Silver stars in your eyes, in your eye
You feel emotional
And you don't even know my name
And I know every constellation
Simple lives we once left behind
We're so distracted now
Secret lives we have lived inside
We're going backwards now
And you don't even know my name
And I know every constellation
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Did you know the seasons in your mind?
Going backwards now
Silver scars in your hand, in your hand
I know it's seasonal
Several times I have heard your demand
You're so unreasonable
And you don't even know my name
And I know every constellation
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Did you know the seasons in your mind?
No, you don't even know my name
And i know every constellation
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Do you know the seasons in your mind?
So you know the rhyme, so you know the rhyme
Do you know the reasons, did you wonder why?
So you know the time, so you know the time
Do you know the seasons in your mind?
Going backwards nowEmbed
