Sunday Sounds LyricsThis city's silence, it screams in ways I never even dreamed
I wanna walk to the other side and feel the breeze
You walk in circles, and every time you come into this town
You fall to pieces remembering the Sunday sound
How could we ever leave here, how could we let it go?
I never learned to sleep there, that's why we let it go
It's not contagious, but people walk around as in a dream
The nights are long, and the hours pass so slow, it seems
Soon comes the summer, so ghosts can leave this city for a while
It comes to life, and the sunlight goes a thousand miles
How could we ever leave here, how could we let it go?
I never learned to sleep there, that's why we let it goEmbed
