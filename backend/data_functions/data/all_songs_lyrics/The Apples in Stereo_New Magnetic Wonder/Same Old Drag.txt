Same Old Drag LyricsJoanie, make your mind up
Use your imagination
You don't want to wind up
State of agitation
Joanie, take some time out
Break communication
You just gotta sign out
Take some medication
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
Old drag
Joanie, I got your message
Psychic oscillations
You're going on a voyage
Got no destination
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
Old drag
Joanie, I got your letter
Skipped the explanation
Hope you're feeling better
Took some medication
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
Old drag
It's the same old drag
Oh you know you don't need none of that
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
It's the same it's the same
Old dragEmbed
