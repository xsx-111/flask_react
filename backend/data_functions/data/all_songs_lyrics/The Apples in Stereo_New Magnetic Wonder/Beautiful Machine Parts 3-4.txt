Beautiful Machine Parts 3-4 LyricsOh, don't you know it's right
To be self-aware and filled with light?
Oh, don't you know it's wrong
We will be forgotten when we're gone
Oh, don't you know it's right
We will live together for a long time
Oh, don't you know it's wrong
We will be forgotten when we're goneEmbed
