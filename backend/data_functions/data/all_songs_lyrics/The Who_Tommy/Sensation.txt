Sensation Lyrics
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside!
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by

You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation
I'm a sensation

They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance

You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation
I'm a sensation
Soon you'll see me, can't you feel me
I'm coming
Send your troubles dancing, I know the answer
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm a sensation

I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerized by just the sight
The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One, I Am the LightEmbed
