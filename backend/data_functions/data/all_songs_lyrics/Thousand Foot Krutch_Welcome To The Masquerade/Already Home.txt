Already Home LyricsThe trouble with truth is it never lies
And the trouble with wrong's that it's never right
So I rest my head under your light
The trouble with peace is it never fights
And the trouble with love's that it's always blind
I want to walk to the edge of it tonight
And I fall down
I am on my knees
'Cause you're everything I need
And I've made a mess of myself
On my own
Now I am on my face
And I'm calling out your name
And I won't run away
'Cause I'm already home
The trouble with tears is that they dry
And the trouble within's made me wanna cry
I've never felt so much like I'm alive
I wanna open my eyes and see your face
If I have to wait a thousand days
I'll still be right here right next to you
And I fall down
I am on my knees
'Cause you're everything I need
And I've made a mess of myself
On my own
Now I am on my face
And I'm calling out your name
And I won't run away
'Cause I'm already home
And I won't run away
I won't run away
And I won't run away
'Cause I'm Already Home
And I know I haven't always been
Where you wanted me
I'm standin' here, arms out
Broken down
Before you
And I know I haven't always been
Where you wanted me
I'm standing here, arms out
Broken down
Before you
I am on my knees
'Cause you're everything I need
And I've made a mess of myself
On my own
Now I am on my face
And I'm calling out your name
And I won't run away
'Cause I'm already home1Embed
