Forward Motion LyricsLet's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closing
If we sort this out would we know how
To live like we were different?
I know we both had some doubts
Whether things would come around
And look at us now
I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life, but...
Let's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closing
Let's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closing
I never thought we'd doubt
It this world would come around
And work itself out
But it's more than a sound
When it moves everyone around
Are you ready now?
And I'm not trying to tell you how to live your life, but...
Let's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closing
Let's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closing
I won't be afraid
Your hands, they cover me
It's so worth it
I can't let it fade
My hands are high and raised
'Cause it's worth it
And I'm not trying to tell you
I'm not trying to tell you
And I'm not trying to tell you
How to live your life, but...
Let's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closing
Let's keep it moving in a forward motion
If we can hang on we can cross this ocean
There's no sense in letting our emotions
Get in the way 'til the door keeps closingEmbed
