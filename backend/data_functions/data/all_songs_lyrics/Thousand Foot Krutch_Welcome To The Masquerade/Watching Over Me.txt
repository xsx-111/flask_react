Watching Over Me LyricsDon't lie to me
I've seen everything I need
And I've heard all the requests
Like a symphony of thieves
Don't cry for me
I don't need your sympathy
I've got everything I need
Right here inside of me
And I know it's not that simple
But I think I'll get it right
'Cause no one else
Is listening tonight
I know you're out there
And I know you care
'Cause I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over me
I know you're out there
And I know you care
'Cause I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over me
Don't shut me out
I'm an arson to myself
Who can't put out the fires
Until there's nothing left
So take my broken glass
And help me make a window
So I can see your face
After all I have been through
And I know it's not that simple
But I think I'll get it right
'Cause no one else
Is listening tonight
I know you're out there
And I know you care
'Cause I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over me
I know you're out there
And I know you care
'Cause I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over me
Watching over me
Like an angel
Watching over me
I know you're out there
And I know you care
I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over me
I know you're out there
And I know you care
I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over me
Watching over me
Watching over me
I feel you
Like an angel
Watching over meEmbed
