Smack Down LyricsGet ready for the smack down!
Get ready for the smack down!
How you gonna react
When you're put on your back now?
'Cause there's no turning back
When you're facing the smack down!
Come on, let's kick it
Let's all get wicked
Put your hands in the sky
For a one-way ticket
Come on!
C-c-c-come on everybody
Gonna start this party
If we turn it to eleven
Then we can't go wrong
And I'm not trying to tell you
There won't a longer road
When it all comes down
You'll know just what to do
We're gonna burn this town
And keep on running
'Til my time here is through
'Cause when it all comes down
I know just what to do
Get ready for the smack down!
Get ready for the smack down!
How you gonna react
When you're put on your back now?
'Cause there's no turning back
When you're facing the smack down!
Come on, let's rip it
Let's push that limit
If you don't feel pain
Then you can't be winning
Come on!
They said I wouldn't be nothin'
I said stop fronting
Put the pedal to the metal
'Cause the storm is comin'
And I'm not trying to tell you
There won't a longer road
When it all comes down
You'll know just what to do
We're gonna burn this town
And keep on running
'Til my time here is through
'Cause when it all comes down
I know just what to do
Come on, let's kick it
Let's all get wicked
Put your hands in the sky
For a one-way ticket
C-c-c-come on everybody
Gonna start this party
If we turn it to eleven
Then we can't go wrong
Come on, let's rip it
Let's push that limit
If you don't feel pain
Then you can't be winning
They said I wouldn't be nothin'
I said stop fronting
Put the pedal to the metal
'Cause the storm is comin'
Get ready for the smack down!
Get ready for the smack down!
How you gonna react
When you're put on your back now?
'Cause there's no turning back
When you're facing the smack down!Embed
