Shook LyricsI feel shook
Everytime I close my eyes and travel into the place in the back of my mind
It's A place where memories hide and my thoughts combine
I see places and thousands of faces all at the same time
Now look
Everybody close your eyes and travel into the place in the back of your mind
And Now run into the place you're afraid to climb
That's where you'll find me
You'll always be two steps behind me
Outside these streets are cold as ice
Never thought I'd have the chance to come alive again
See through your eyes again (it takes me away)
And I've never waited in my life
Like I did when I stand under Your sky again
Try again
I feel shook
Everytime I close my eyes and travel into the place in the back of my mind
It's A place where memories hide and my thoughts combine
I see places and thousands of faces all at the same time
Now look
Everybody close your eyes and travel into the place in the back of your mind
And Now run into the place you're afraid to climb
That's where you'll find me
You'll always be two steps behind me
It all unwinds but gets tangled up in time
When it hits like a train running through my mind again
I can hear those lies again (it takes me away)
And I've never fallen in my life
Like I did when I fell into Your arms again
Sound the alarms again
I feel shook
Everytime I close my eyes and travel into the place in the back of my mind
It's A place where memories hide and my thoughts combine
I see places and thousands of faces all at the same time
Now look
Everybody close your eyes and travel into the place in the back of your mind
And Now run into the place you're afraid to climb
That's where you'll find me
You'll always be two steps behind me
I can see things clearer this time
Won't be long now till everythings alright
Take my hand and lets walk into the light
I'm not dying here tonight we will survive
I feel shook
Everytime I close my eyes and travel into the place in the back of my mind
It's A place where memories hide and my thoughts combine
I see places and thousands of faces all at the same time
Now look
Everybody close your eyes and travel into the place in the back of your mind
And Now run into the place you're afraid to climb
That's where you'll find me
You'll always be two steps behind me
Shook
Everytime I close my eyes and travel into the place in the back of my mind
It's A place where memories hide and my thoughts combine
I see places and thousands of faces all at the same time
Now look
Everybody close your eyes and travel into the place in the back of your mind
And Now run into the place you're afraid to climb
That's where you'll find me
You'll always be two steps behind me1Embed
