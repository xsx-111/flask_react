Anyone Else LyricsI was blown away when you said
"Goodbye I don't wanna go through this."
I'm begging you to work things out
But you still say "I don't wanna do this."
I was blown away when you said
"Goodbye I don't wanna go through this."
Must have called you a million times
But you still say "I don't wanna do this."
Say everything heals in time, but I need Your light
I don't know anyone else
Who can make me feel this way
I don't know anyone else
Who can take the pain away
I don't know anyone else
Who understands me more
I don't know anyone else
I know we've had our things before
But some things are worth fighting for
I was blown away when you said
"We tried but it's just not working."
I know that it hasn't been perfect
But we both know we were just nervous
I was blown away when you said
"I'm sorry and I wanna renew this"
Say everything heals in time, but I need Your light
I don't know anyone else
Who can make me feel this way
I don't know anyone else
Who can take the pain away
I don't know anyone else
Who understands me more
I don't know anyone else
I know we've had our things before
But some things are worth fighting for
I'd give the world for You
If it was mine to give
Cause all the things You do
Make dreams feel so much closer
You gave the world to me
So I'd have a chance to live
Open my eyes to see
You make me feel so much closer
I was lying when I said, "I could"
Cause You're the only way to make this good
If I could turn it all around I would
But I can't change it
I don't know anyone else
Who can make me feel this way
I don't know anyone else
Who can take the pain away
I don't know anyone else
Who understands me more
I don't know anyone else
I know we've had our things before
I don't know anyone else
Who can make me feel this way
I don't know anyone else
Who can take the pain away
I don't know anyone else
Who understands me more
I don't know anyone else
I know we've had our things before
But some things are worth fighting forEmbed
