Look Away LyricsShe's everything to everyone
Wish I could have
Seen it come down
But I heard incorrectly
It seems everything she knows
Is now five minutes 'til close and
That's not a lot of time
When you're nervous
And they say
Daughter, look away
Don't be afraid
When you want to turn back
A million times
And it might get colder
But wait 'til it's over
Darling, you'll find your way
But she said...
I will not look away this time
Take all these cuts
And make them shine
And all this pain I've held inside
So I can find my way home again
I will not look away this time
Take all these cuts
And make them shine
I don't want to be perfect
Just all right
He's on his way to nowhere
'Cause he heard it was safe there
And safe is something valuable here
He's spent half his life searching
And the other half working hard
To find out if Jesus is real
And they said
Son, look away
Don't be afraid
When you want to turn back
A million times
And it might get colder
But wait 'til it's over
Son, you will find your way
But he said...
I will not look away this time
Take all these cuts
And make them shine
And all this pain I've held inside
So I can find my way home again
I will not look away this time
Take all these cuts
And make them shine
I don't want to be perfect
Just alright
And every time, every line
Every time you wanna
Say goodbye, sing...
Every time, every line
Every time you wanna
Say goodbye, sing...
I will not look away this time
Take all these cuts
And make them shine
And all this pain I've held inside
So I can find my way home again
I will not look away this time
Take all these cuts
And make them shine
I don't want to be perfect
Just alright
She's everything to everyone
Wish I could have
Seen it come down
But I heard incorrectly
It seems everything she knows
Is now five minutes 'til close and
That's not a lot of time
When you're nervousEmbed
