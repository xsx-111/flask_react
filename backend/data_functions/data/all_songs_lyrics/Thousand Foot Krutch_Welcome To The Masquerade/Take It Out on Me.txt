Take It Out on Me Lyrics
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know anymore
Thought I had, thought I had it under control
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Here it goes, hear it (1, 2, 3, 4!)

It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control

You try to move, try to move, try, but don't wanna lose
You so afraid, so afraid, you don't want it to fade
Hear my voice, here it goes, hear it louder than most
Let it go, let it (1, 2, 3, 4!)
It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control


(1, 2, 3, 4!)
It's not worth it, it's not workin'
You wanted it to be picture perfect
It's not over, you don't have to throw it away

So scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control, take it out on me
Scream if you wanna, shout if you need
Just let it go, take it out on me
Fight if you need to, smash if it helps to
Get control4Embed
