E for Extinction Lyrics
I'm not the same as yesterday
Ooh... It's hard to explain
How things have changed
But I'm not the same as before
And I know there's so much more ahead
I can barely believe that I'm here
And I won't surrender quietly
Step up and watch me

Break down, ya really want it?
Wanna make a scene?
Show me what ya mean
Let's get it started
Let me see whatcha got
Can ya take it up a notch?
Don't think you got it
Can't handle the pressure?
Get, off, stop talkin' about it
Gotta make this count, let's go

When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created
I can feel the storm
The winds have changed
Ooh... â€˜Cause we're worlds apart
But just the same
But we won't leave the way that we came
And I know there's so much more ahead
I can barely believe that we're here
We won't surrender quietly
Step up and watch it

Break down, ya really want it?
Wanna make a scene?
Show me what ya mean
Let's get it started
Let me see whatcha got
Can ya take it up a knotch?
Don't think you got it
Can't handle the pressure?
Get, off, stop talkin' about it
Gotta make this count, let's go

When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created
Are you ready? Are ya ready?
Are ya ready for me?
Are you ready? Are ya ready?
Are ya ready to see?

We move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created
When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created
When we move
We camouflage ourselves
We stand in the shadows waiting
We live for this and nothing more
We are what you created3Embed
