Welcome to the Masquerade LyricsWe've got the fire, who's got the matches
Take a look around at the sea of masks and
Come one, come all, welcome to the grand ball
Where the strong run for cover and the weak stand tall
I'm not one to scatter ashes
But there's some things that'll melt the plastic
Try and dig down deeper if you can
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
We've got the power, who's got the action
Break it down till there's nothing but a mere fraction
Out of the fire, rise from the ashes
Reject your doubt and release the passion
Let's get on it, believe if you want it
Step into the realm where the real ones flaunt it
Come back, rewind, another time on it
Reach out, take that, but now step on it
I'm not one to scatter ashes
But there's some things that'll melt the plastic
Try and dig down deeper if you can
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not one to scatter ashes
But there's some things that'll melt the plastic
Try and dig down deeper if you can
I'm not afraid
I'm not ashamed
I'm not to blame
Welcome to the masquerade
I'm not ashamed
I'm not afraid
I'm not okay
Welcome to the masquerade
