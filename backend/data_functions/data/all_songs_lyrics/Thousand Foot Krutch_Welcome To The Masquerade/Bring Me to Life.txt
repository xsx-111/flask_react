Bring Me to Life LyricsOpen your mind, don't let it slip
And take you on a midnight ride
That's wicked
Everyone around here
Comes in feeling
Fed up with the way
Their wounds are healing
Take me to a place where
Doors are open
A lovely little place where
No one's broken
Welcome to the world of
No one's listening
Just wanna break out
And escape this prison
Bring me to life
Breathe air into me
It's taken me my whole life
To realize all the things
I've never seen
Bring me to life
Breathe air into me
Take me from the darkness
That I've been in
Cause I just wanna be free
Bring me to life!
Come on, start your engines
Flip that switch
And take it to the limit
If you ride like this
And if you feel alive
Then pump your fist
Cause there's no turnin' back
When the energy hits
Down comes the rain
Like a hurricane, hard to breathe
Like a storm hanging over me
But I don't have to let it in
I stand up, face my fears
Like an enemy
Bring me to life
Breathe air into me
It's taken me my whole life
To realize all the things
I've never seen
Bring me to life
Breathe air into me
Take me from the darkness
That I've been in
Cause I just wanna be free
And...
I've been wanting to break out
You helped me figure out
That I can come to life
And turn this thing around
Been wanting to break out
You helped me figure out
That I can come to life
And turn this thing around
Shut it, if you're talking to me
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
And what you want me to be
Just shut it, if you're talking to me
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
And what you want me to be
Just shut it, if you're talking to me!
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
And what you want me to be!
Shut it, if you're talking to me!
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
And what you want me to be!
Bring me to life
Breathe air into me
It's taken me my whole life
To realize all the things
I've never seen
Bring me to life
Breathe air into me
Take me from the darkness
That I've been in
Cause I just wanna be freeEmbed
