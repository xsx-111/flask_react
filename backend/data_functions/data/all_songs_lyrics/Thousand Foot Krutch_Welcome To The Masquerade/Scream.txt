Scream Lyrics
I can't erase it anymore
It follows me everywhere I go
It's like a mask that I don't want to wear anymore
I think I've found a way to let it go
But it's still too soon to know for sure
I'd give everything I am
To just feel somethin'
Can you feel that?

Scream! When the pressure breaks me
When it's too hard to see
When I feel like I'm at the end of my rope
One more time
Scream! When the fire burns me
When it's hard to break free
When I feel like I'm standin' on the edge
Of it all this time

I can't suppress it anymore
Here it comes like a flood
Just like before, when it rains, it pours
And I don't want to swim anymore
I think I've found a way to let it go
I don't know, I've never felt this way before
But with everything I am, I just let go


You make me wanna scream...
It's not a joke
I've felt as messed up as you do
I've felt the feelings you've been feeling
Been through the same things
You've been through
And I know how hard it is
To feel like you're alone
We've all been given a second chance
But the choice is all our own
