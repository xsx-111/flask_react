Sit and Wonder LyricsI sit and wonder, I often wonder
I sit and wonder about the things she does
I sit and wonder, I often wonder
I've been waiting for this moment to come
And she's the teacher and I'm the pupil
But I ain't learning anything at all
Now I'm falling into the black hole
And I can barely feel the sun
Yeah I sit and wonder, I fall to pieces
I've been waiting for her to come
A bed of roses, her cheeks like peaches
Yeah I ain't going to wait no more
Give me some light
Give me the light
Yeah give me some light
Give me some light
The rites a passage, we are mistaken
Yeah some are going to break into stone
The door is open and I am reaching
Yeah it looks like a prodigal son
Yeah give me some light
Give me the light
Yeah give me some light
Give me some light
God give me the light
Give me the light
Yeah give me some light
Give me some light
I've been having trouble in my head, Lord
Oh oh oh oh
I've been having demons in my mind, Lord
Oh oh oh oh
Lord give me the light
Give me the light
Yeah give me some light
Give me some light
I've been having trouble in my head, Lord
Oh oh oh oh
I've been having demons in my mind, Lord
Oh oh oh oh
Something's going on inside my head, Lord
Oh oh oh oh
Something's going on inside my head, Lord
Oh oh oh oh
I could be searching all my life
Searching all of my life
Keep a candle all night
Candle all night1Embed
