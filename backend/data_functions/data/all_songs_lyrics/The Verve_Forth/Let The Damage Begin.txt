Let The Damage Begin LyricsGot a call from a friend I knew
She found me begging
Just like I always do
There's no room for imagination
Suffocating in my head
I need some liberation
And it feels good
Close the door
And take off those clothes
Dance with me till the morning shows
In your bed and in your skin
I'll be your whole
One whole soul
I need this feeling almost every day
Can't beat this feeling girl
I just gotta say
In your bed and in your skin
I'll be your whole
One whole soul
Turn out the lights
Let the damage
Didn't like pain
Till I lived in sin
Don't you
Don't you come on
Don't you
Do you
In your bed and in your skin
Didn't like pain
Till I lived in sin
So lets go for a ride
Go for a ride
I feel fine
Go for a ride
I'm feeling fine
Let's go for a ride
Go for a ride
Let's go for a ride
We willEmbed
