Columbo Lyrics
Baby why are you wasting time crying
Like it’s the only thing to do?
Baby don't you worry, yourself crying
Your instinct's all that's guiding you
Baby don't you worry, yourself crying
I could see the sadness in your eyes
Baby why are you wasting time crying
Trying to find out the reasons why?
Baby don't believe them when they say it
Love is just a feeling that you give
You’re the universe and you'll know all I need
Tell me all the secrets that I forget
Ooh-yeah-yeah, oooh-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
All right, ooh yeah, all right
Just watch the lights go down over this town
Watch the Thames weave down, wind it's way round
Watch the city boys leave, full of bluster
Oh where are we now?
Ain't it easy for you as a kid
To get yourself so messed up
We don't know, we don't know (oh yeah)
We don't know, we don't know (oh yeah)
We don't know, we don't know
We don't know, we don't know (a-ha)
Fame, a celebrity culture, flash light, flash light
Fame, a bullet proof bathroom
Inside she's fixing up
Fame, a sealing-up number one
Vacuum, a vacuum
Fame, miracle accent
Inside, start it up
Shoot it up, shoot it up, shoot it up, shoot your gun
Fame, the vanity mistress
Fame, the mirror of the wet dream
And I look, and I'm feeling that accent
Dying on the inside, I’m dying on the inside
Love's like oxygenEmbed
