Mover LyricsWell, I read about the soldier
Found dead in his hole
And I read about the future
If I bought and sold
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
And yeah, I know we're strangers
So come on, fill up my holes
Yeah, I read about the soldier
Found dead in his hole
Yeah, And I read about my future
If I bought and sold
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
Oh yeah, I know we're strangers
So come on, fill up my holes
I'm a mover, I'm a mover
I'm a mover, I'm a mover
I'm a mover, I'm a mover
I'm a mover, I'm a mover
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
Oh yeah, I know we're strangers
So come on, fill up my holes
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a mover
I can't sleep at night
I'm a moverEmbed
