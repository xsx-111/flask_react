Love Is Noise Lyrics
Will those feet in modern times
Walk on soles that are made in China?
Through the bright prosaic malls
And the corridors that go on and on and on
Are we blind - can we see?
We are one, incomplete
Are we blind - in the shade?
Waiting for lightning to be saved, yeah

Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again...

Will those feet in modern times
Understand this world's affliction?
Recognize the righteous anger?
Understand this world's addiction?
I was blind - couldn't see
What was here in me
I was blind - insecure
Felt like the road was way too long, yeah
Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again, again...
Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that you singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again
Cause love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again, again, again...

All those feet in modern times
Walk on soles made in China
Will those feet in modern times
See the bright prosaic malls
Will those feet in modern times
Recognize the heavy burden
Will those feet in modern times
Pardon me for my sins?
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm feeling again
Love is noise, love is pain
Love is these blues that I'm singing again, again...4Embed
