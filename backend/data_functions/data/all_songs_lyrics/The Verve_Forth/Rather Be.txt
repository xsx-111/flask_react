Rather Be Lyrics
There's no need for introductions, no dark corridors of fame
You won't find your fortune, you might find some pain
Oh I wanna lie, lie together, feels like our last embrace
In a world full of confusion, yeah the human race

But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here?

Sometimes life seems to tear us apart
I don't wanna let you go
Sometimes these feelings hit me, I start to cry
Cause I won't ever let you go

Oh my my my my we're multiplying
Always living under some cloud
Always on the eve of destruction
Make you wanna scream out loud
And as I watched the birds soar
Mighty lies and wishes spun
Oh mama mama why I'm still crying
Oh now the day is come


But I'd rather be here than be anywhere
Is there anywhere better than here?
You know these feelings I found, they are oh so rare
Is there anywhere better than here? 

Sometimes this feelings hit me 
Oh these feelings are oh so rare2Embed
