Numbness Lyrics
Just breathe in the air
But donâ€™t be afraid
There's a time for us to make
Sense of all this pain
Sense of all this pain
Mama, mama, mama, mama
Mama don't let loose
Before you get tied
Just let the chains loose
Before you really really really
Really let loose
Of all the faded chains

Numbness on my brain, babe
Yeah, numbness on my brain
Yeah, numbness on my brain
Yeah, numbness on my brain

Picture this life embracing
Living life, reminisce, take your time
No secret for a long while
Here comes mother nature's child
Numbness on the brain
Numbness on the brain
Oh, rain
Yeah, numbness on the brain
Yeah, numbness on the brain

Strange times are coming
Hope, yeah you got your bags all there
Oh, you got your cupboard all stocked up
You got your pride just rare, ready

Numbness on my brain, babe
Yeah, numbness on my brain
Yeah, numbness on my brain
Yeah, numbness on my brain

Oh yeah, oh yeah
So these are my days, my days, my days
So these are my crimes
So these are my crimes
So these are my crimes (numbness on my brain)
I lived and I die
I loved and I fall (numbness on my brain)
I fall and I cry
I laughed and I loved (yeah numbness on my brain)
I loved and I lost
Till the victory is ours (yeah numbness on my brain)
The snakes in the grass
Yeah numbness on my brain
Yeah numbness on my brain
Yeah numbness on my brainEmbed
