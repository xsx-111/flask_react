Muhammad Ali LyricsYou gotta want it
Really want it
Gonna paint a picture
So vivid in colour
You'll wanna buy another
You'll wanna buy another
Who feels history?
Who needs history?
You know it's all right, do your thing
I guess it's time for you to spread your wings
Yeah, it's all right to do my thing
Guess it's time for you to spread your wings
Spread your wings
Spread your wings
If I showed you a way, girl
And then a break together
I know the feelings I'm showing
I know where I'll be
And you'll be my witness
My lover and prophet
Who feels history?
Who is history?
Yes, it's all right to do my thing
Guess it's time for you to spread your wings
Yes, it's all right to do my thing (alright to do my thing)
I guess it's time for you to spread your wings (I'm gonna spread your wings)
Spread your wings
Give me, give me, give me
Give me the good love, good love, good love
Give me the good love, good love, good love
Give me the good love, good love, good love
You're trying to haunt me
We're slowly rotting
You know fifty-thousand
Die in one day
Stone Age
Stone Age
Who feels history?
Who hears history?
Yes, it's alright to do my thing
Guess it's time for you to spread your wings
Yes, it's alright, I'll do my thing
I guess it's time for you to spread your wings
Yes, it's alright to do your thing (alright to do my thing)
Guess it's time for you to spread your wings (time to spread your wings)
Yes, it's alright, I'm doing my thing (alright to do my thing)
I guess it's time for you to spread your wings (time for you to spread your wings)
Good love, good love, good love
Yeah, spread your (good love, good love, good love)
Yeah, spread your wings (good love, good love, good love)
Do my (good love, good love, good love)
Yes, it's all right (good love, good love, good love)
Spead your
Do my (spread your)
Yes, it's all right (spread your)
Do myEmbed
