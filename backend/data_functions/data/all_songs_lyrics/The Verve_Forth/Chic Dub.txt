Chic Dub LyricsYou knew your body was strong
You didn't give me your love
Give me your love
When you wasn't sure
Did it come?
When it returns
When it returns
Ah, big cheer to the beat
Ah, big cheer to the beat
When you return
Baby, give me some love
When you return
When you return
Stood out the same
Couldn't see no man
I could see the stars
I could see the stars
I said now, give me your love
Give me your love
Give me your love
You knew your body was strong
You didn't give me your love
Give me your love
When you wasn't sure
Did it come?
When it returns
When it returnsEmbed
