Valium Skies Lyrics
How do you keep yourself from folding?
Seems like the whole world is losing
How do you stop yourself from giving in?
Seems like the whole world is frying

Aaaah oooooh
Aaaah oooooh
She got all I need
Yea, the air I breathe
When it comes to my valium skies
She don't mind if I cry

How did you stop your lover from crying?
Even though you knew she knew you was lying
How do you stop the world from imploding?
Still know nothing with all these cards I'm holding


She don't mind if I cry 

When it comes to my valium skies
She don't mind if I cryEmbed
