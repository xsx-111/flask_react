Appalachian Springs LyricsDoes anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we've got that real soul
You know the thing you cannot trade or ever own
Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we've got that real soul
You know the thing we cannot trade or ever own
The solitude, my sacred mood
The sacred mood
Appalachian Springs
All my things
Took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
I saw myself and I wasn't quite right
Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was looking for answers in a soul
In the feelings that a man can't control
I let the fire burn bright in the dead of night
Disappointed she'd get I told a lie
I said that I would never be on their side
I took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
And I saw myself and it wasn't quite right
Took a step to the left
I took a step to the right
I keep it together, yeah?
And I was waiting for my number come
Like a bingo calling, singing in the sun
You said 'our number's 69', I said 'ok'
The solitude
My sacred mood
Appalachian Springs
All my things
Took a step to the left
Took a step to the right
Yeah, I keep it together
You know I'm not lying
Took a step to the left, yeah
I took a step to the right
I'm gonna keep it together
C'mon
Yeah c'mon
Ah c'mon
Does anybody know where we're really gonna go?
I was wondering if we've got that real soul
You know the thing you cannot trade or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Or ever own
Good luck, I'm coming home
Feel so young
I don't know where I've gone
I took a step to the left
I took a step to the right
And I saw myself and it wasn't quite right
Yeah, a slip into the dreams
Slippin' out, slippin' in and out of dreamsEmbed
