Call Me A Dog Lyrics
You call me a dog, well, that's fair enough
'Cause it ain't no use to pretend you're wrong
When you call me out, I can't hide anymore
I have no disguise you can't see through

You say it's bad luck to have fallen for me
What can I do to make it good for you?
You wore me out like an old winter coat
Tryin' to be safe from the cold

But when it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful, if I call at all
Ooh, you call me a dog

You tell me I'm low 'cause I've slept on the floor
And out in the woods with the badgers and the wolves
You threw me out 'cause I went diggin' for gold
And I came home with a hand of coal

But when it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful, if I call at all
And when its my time to call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone, yeah
You call me a dog
Well that's fair enough
It doesn't bother me as long as you know
The bad luck will follow you
If you keep me on a leash and you drag me along

But when it's my time to throw the next stone
I'll call you beautiful, if I call at all
And when its my time to call your bluff
I'll call you beautiful or leave it alone, yeah
You call me a dog4Embed
