Angel of Fire (Demo) Lyrics
She stands on her suitcase
And looks out her window at me
The smile leaves her face
The mirror don't like what it sees
So she hides all her secrets
She's thinkin' that I'll never know
That she burns like an angel
Into her fire she goes
She don't miss nothin'
Even though she pretends she don't see
Everything she watches
She puts her hand next to me
She says give me one reason
Why I should be here again
But then she blows out the candle
And shows me the reason again

'Cause she loves like an angel
She burns like an angel on fire
On fire

After the movie
She walks in the park with a friend
She tells it to her straight
He don't mean nothin' to me
She says I can't believe him
If I gave him enough rope he'd hang me
But when she turns to him
There's nowhere she'd rather be
'Cause she burns like an angel
She burns like an angel on fire

And she's stuck
When she comes on so hot
You have never felt
A heavenly slow burn
I'm so hot
When I leave her cold
Frying in her room
Like angels always do
And you think I love you
Just 'cause I said so

Butterflies shiver
She lives all the things that I've known
She's thinkin' her diary
Convincing her words as she goes
She says "Heaven forgive me
Am I gonna pay for my sins?"
'Cause she , 'cause she burns like an angel
Every time she lets me in
Yeah, she burns like an angel
She burns like an angel on fire
Angel on fire

Angel on fire
Angel on fire
Angel on fire
Angel on fire
Angel on fire
Angel on fireEmbed
