Your Savior Lyrics
People like you, I know myself
Walk in the shoes of somebody else
Whisper to me my tragic fate
Whisper to me my tragic end

But don't give me your savior
Don't give me your savior
I said, "Hey"

People, I choose life on my own
Burn me your fuse, throw me your stone
Give me your brand, burn on my hand
Whisper to me my tragic end

But don't give me your savior
Don't give me your savior
I said, "Hey"

People I choose, I know myself
Lay my need out, give you my help
But you give me your blues and you whisper my fate
But don't give me, don't give me your savior
Don't give me, don't give me
Whisper high oh fate, fly high oh fate
Whisper high oh fate, fly high oh fate
Whisper high oh fate, fly high oh fate
