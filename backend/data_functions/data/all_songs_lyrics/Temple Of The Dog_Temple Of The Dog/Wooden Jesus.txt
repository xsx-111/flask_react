Wooden Jesus Lyrics
Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan?
But I didn't know it was the holy land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand
I pray

Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in

Yeah, Porcelain Mary, her majesties pure
Looking for virgin territory
Coat-hanger halos that don't come cheap
From television shepherds with livin' room sheep
And I pray

Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in

Wooden Jesus, where are you from?
Korea or Canada or maybe Taiwan?
But I didn't know it was the holy land
But I believed from the minute the check left my hand

Can I be saved?
I spent all my money on a future grave
Wooden Jesus, I'll cut you in
On twenty percent of my future sin
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
I'll cut you in
