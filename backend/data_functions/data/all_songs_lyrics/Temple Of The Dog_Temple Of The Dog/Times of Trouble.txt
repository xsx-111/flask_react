Times of Trouble Lyrics
When the spoon is hot
And the needle's sharp
And you drift away
Ooh, I can hear you say
That the world in black
Is upon your back
And your body shakes
So you ditch away
Yeah, and you close the shades

Don't try to do it
Don't try to kill your time, oh
Yeah, you might do it
Then you can't change your mind, oh
You've gotta hold on to your time
Till you break through these times of trouble

When you try to talk
And the words get hard
And they put you down
Don't you stay
Don't ditch away
I saw you swingin'
Yeah, swingin' your mother's sword, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you're playin'
Oh, sometimes the rules get hard, oh
But if somebody left you out on a ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
You've gotta hold on to your time
And break through these times of trouble


I saw you swingin'
Yeah, swingin' your mother's sword, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you're playin'
Oh, sometimes the rules get hard, oh
But if somebody left you out on the ledge
If somebody pushed you over the edge
If somebody loved you and left you for dead
You've gotta hold on to your time and break
Through these times of trouble1Embed
