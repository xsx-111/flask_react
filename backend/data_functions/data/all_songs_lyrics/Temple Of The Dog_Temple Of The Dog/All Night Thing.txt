All Night Thing Lyrics
She motioned to me
That she wanted to leave
And go somewhere warm
Where we'd be alone
I do not know, what's goin' on
But I'm guessin', ooh, it's an all night thing
Yeah, it's an all night thing

If it's an all night thing
Nobody's gonna make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offense
If it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear fallin'
To the ground
I'll never come around
And you'll never hear a word from me
If it's an all night thing

Well, I walked along, feelin' at ease
And fallin' like rain
Ooh, into her scheme
An' she won't let on what that'll be
Yeah, but I'm guessin'
Ooh, it's an all night thing
Yeah, it's an all night thing
If it's an all night thing
Nobody's gonna make it end
And if it don't begin
Don't worry that I'll take offense
Yeah, if it's an all night thing
And we fall like a tear fallin'
To the ground
I'll never come around
An' you'll never hear a word from me
If it's an all night thing
Yeah, if it's an all night thing
Ooh, if it's an all night thing
Yeah, if it's an all night thing1Embed
