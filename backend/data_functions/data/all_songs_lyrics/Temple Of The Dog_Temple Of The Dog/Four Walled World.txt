Four Walled World Lyrics
Well she cries and she cried
All night to the sound of the freeway hum
And she swears she'll be gone
When the sun hits the ground
And she ain't comin' back to my cell
To my cell
Ooh

Well she's tired and she's tired
Of this life she's been leadin' too long
And the time turns around
Through the walls that surround
To the chimes of a jailer's song

Oh, but in my four
In my four
In my four walled world
In my four
In my four
In my four
My four walled world

Yeah, she tries and she tries
But my feet they just won't leave the ground
And I'm tired and I'm tired
Of this prisoner's life, and these chains
That drag me down
Oh, but in my four
In my four
In my four
In my four walled world
Yeah, in my four
Oh, in my four
In my four
My four walled world

Well she cries and she cried
All night to the sound of the freeway hum
And she swears she'll be gone
When the sun hits the ground
And she ain't, no she ain't comin' back to my cell
To my cell
Ooh

Now the sun is low
These walls try to break my soul
Now the moon is full
And I won't see nothin' tonight
But the tear in her eyes
In my four
Yeah, in my four
In my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world
Yeah in my four
My four, yeah my four
Oh, my four walled world
Yeah, in my four walled world
In my four, in my four walled world
In my four, in my four
In my four walled world, yeah, yeah
In my four world, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, in my four
My four walled world, yeah
Four, in my four, in my four walled world, yeah
In my four walled world2Embed
