Reach Down Lyrics
Well, I had a dream the other night
You were in a bar in the corner on a chair
Wearin' a long white leather coat
Purple glasses and glitter in your hair
And you said, "Hey, this is where I wanna sit
And buy you a drink someday"
Well, you were goin' to the Dog shows
But you kinda lost your way
Now you said, "I got all this room
And no money to decorate it"
So you got some local customer
Put you in touch with the man upstairs

But he said, "Little man
You got no business bein' all frustrated
You gotta rest
You gotta rest
You gotta rest"

You gotta reach down and pick the crowd up
Oh, I wanna reach down and pick the crowd up
Carry back in my hand to the promised land
To the promised land

Ooh, I had an angel shine my wings
She said, "Nothin' but the best for the golden boy"
And she made me promise not to tell
I had her under a spell singin' golden words in a broken voice
Now I caught a blessing on the wind
I'm feelin' lighter than a breath from a dove
I've got no hands to tie behind my back
And I'm sparkin' like a heart attack
And now I got room to spread my wings
And my messages of love, yeah-yeah
Love was my drug, but that's not what I died of

So don't you think of me
Cryin' louder than some billion dollar baby
Ooh, I wanna rest
I wanna rest
I wanna rest

I wanna reach down and pick the crowd up
I wanna reach down and pick the crowd up
Carry back in my hand to the promised land
To the promised land
To the promised land
To the promised land
Oh

Yeah-yeah-yeah, oh-oh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, I wanna reach (Down)
Oh yeah, and pick the crowd up
(I wanna reach down) I wanna reach down
(And pick the crowd up) And pick the crowd up
(Carry back in my hand) Hand
(To the promised land) To the promised land
(To the promised land) Ooh yeah
Ah oh
