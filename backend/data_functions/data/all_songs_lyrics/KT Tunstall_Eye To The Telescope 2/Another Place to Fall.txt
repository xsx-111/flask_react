Another Place to Fall LyricsAre you blind?
Blind to me trying to be kind?
Volunteering for your firing line
Waiting for one precious sign
The flicker of a smile
You should try it just once in a while
Baby, it's not quite your style
It's simply too easy to do
And you might not see it through
See it through
So find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
Are you proud
To have founded a brand new behaviour
With hatred and hurt as your saviour
But nobody's choosing to follow
So you choke back the tears and you swallow
Men who have ruined your life
You consume them with minimum strife
But now you have got indigestion
The antacid comes as a question
So find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
There isn't much more I can say
I don't understand the delay
You're asking for friendly advice
But remaining in permanent crisis
Affection is yours if you ask
First you must take off your mask
When your back's turned I've decided
You'll throw it away just like I did
So find yourself another place to fall
Find yourself up against another brick wall
See yourself as a fallen angel
Well I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
Well I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fall
Well I don't see no holes in the road but you
Find another place to fallEmbed
