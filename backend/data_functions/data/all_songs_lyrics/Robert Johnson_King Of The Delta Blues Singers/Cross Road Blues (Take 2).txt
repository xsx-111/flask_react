Cross Road Blues (Take 2) Lyrics
I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees
I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord above, "Have mercy, save poor Bob if you please"

Mmmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride
Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride
Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by

Mmmm, the sun goin' down boy, dark goin' catch me here
Oooo ooee eeee, boy dark goin' catch me here
I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care

You can run, you can run, tell my friend boy Willie Brown
You can run, tell my friend boy Willie Brown
Lord that I'm standing at the crossroad, babe
I believe I'm sinkin' downEmbed
