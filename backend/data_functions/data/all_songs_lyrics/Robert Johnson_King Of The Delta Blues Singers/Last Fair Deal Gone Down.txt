Last Fair Deal Gone Down Lyrics
It's the last fair deal gone down
Last fair deal gone down
It's the last fair deal gone down, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road

Ida Belle don't cry this time
Ida Belle don't cry this time
If you cry 'bout a nickel, you die 'bout a dime
She wouldn't cry, but the money won't mind

I love the way you do
I love the way you do
I love the way you do, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road

My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road

Take camp, baby, and sing
Camp, baby, and sing
Let's camp, baby, and sing, good Lord
On that Gulfport Island Road
I've the last fair deal gone down
It's the last fair deal gone down
It's the last fair deal gone down, dear Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road

I'm working my way back home
I'm working my way back home
I'm working my way back home, good Lord
On this Gulfport Island Road

And that thing don't keep ringing so soon
That thing don't keep ringing so soon
And that thing don't keep ringing so soon, good Lord
On that Gulf-ed Port Island RoadEmbed
