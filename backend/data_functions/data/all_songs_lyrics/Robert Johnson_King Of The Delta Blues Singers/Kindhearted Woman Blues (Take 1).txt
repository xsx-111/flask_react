Kindhearted Woman Blues (Take 1) Lyrics
I got a kindhearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
I got a kindhearted woman
Do anything in this world for me
But these evil-hearted women
And they will not let me be

I love my baby
My baby don't love me
I love my baby, ooh
My baby don't love me
I really love that woman
Can't stand to leave her be

Ain't but the one thing
Makes Mr. Johnson drink
I get worried about how you'd treat me, baby
I begin to think
Oh babe, my life don't feel the same
You breaks my heart
When you call mister so and so's name

She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
She's a kindhearted woman
She studies evil all the time
You wells to kill me baby
As to have it on your mind
Some day, some day
I would shake your hand goodbye
Some day, some day-ee
I would shake you hand goodbye
I can't give you anymore of my lovin'
â€˜Cause I just ain't satisfiedEmbed
