Love Story LyricsGoing back in the morning time
To see if my love has changed her mind, yeah
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has changed her mind, yeah
I know what I will find
That she is wasting time
She could be picking roses
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has seen the light, yeah
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has seen the light, yeah
Oh, I told her last night
She should improve her sight
She could be painting the roof
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has come around, yeah
Going back in the morning time
To see if my love has come around, yeah
She offered me no sound
Her head is in the ground
She could be calling for winterEmbed
