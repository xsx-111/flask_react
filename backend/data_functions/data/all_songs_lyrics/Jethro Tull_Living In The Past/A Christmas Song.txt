A Christmas Song LyricsOnce in Royal David's City
Stood a lonely cattle shed
Where a mother held her baby
You'd do well to remember the things he later said
When you're stuffing yourselves at the Christmas parties
You'll just laugh when I tell you to take a running jump
You're missing the point I'm sure does not need making
That Christmas spirit is not what you drink
So how can you laugh when your own mother's hungry
And how can you smile when the reasons for smiling are wrong?
And if I just messed up your thoughtless pleasures
Remember, if you wish, this is just a Christmas song
(Hey! Santa! Pass us that bottle, will you?)Embed
