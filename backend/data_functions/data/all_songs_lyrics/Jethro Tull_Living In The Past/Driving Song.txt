Driving Song LyricsWill they ever stop drivin' me?
Have they ever taken time to see
That I need some rest
If I'm to do my best?
Can I please stop workin' so hard?
They just tell me gotta close it hard
Got to think of my health
Can I be by myself?
Oh, they tell me I'll be home someday
Well I doubt it if I continue this way
'Cause this hard life I've led
Is makin' me deadEmbed
