Dr. Bogenbroom LyricsI have one foot in the graveyard and the other on the bus
And the passengers do trample each other in the rush
And the chicken hearted lawman is throwing up his fill
To see the kindly doctor to pass the super pill
Well, I'm going down, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom
Well, I'm on my way, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom
Well I've tried my best to love you all
All you hypocrites and whores
With your eyes on each other and the locks upon your doors
Well you drowned me in the fountain of life and I hated you
For living while I was dying, when we were all just passing through
Well, I'm going down, three cheers for Doctor Bogenbroom
Well, I'm on my way, three cheers for Doctor BogenbroomEmbed
