Living in the Past Lyrics

Happy, and I'm smiling
Walk a mile to drink your water
You know I'd love to love you
And above you there's no other
We'll go walking out
While others shout of war's disa-aa-aster

Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past

Once I used to join in
Every boy an' girl was my friend
Now there's revolution
But they don't know what they're fighting
Let us close our eyes
Outside their lives go on much fa-aa-aster

Oh, we won't give in
We'll keep living in the past

Oh, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
Oh, no, no, we won't give in
Let's go living in the past
