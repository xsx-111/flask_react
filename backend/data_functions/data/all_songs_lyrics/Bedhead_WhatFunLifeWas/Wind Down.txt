Wind Down LyricsWind the wind
Begin to ascend
And reach for anything
As the air has no end
But soon, you'll wind
Down through the air
With only the cold, hard ground
Meeting you there
Feel the soil
Running through your nose
It's a wound down music box
That doesn't know how it goes
It's a simple memory
That falls apart as it grows
It's a simple memory
That falls apart as it grows
Now that picture is cracked
And the color is gone
And the last thing I remember
I can no longer see
There's a tree that grows into
A tree that collapses
But from there, it goes off
Into the sceneryEmbed
