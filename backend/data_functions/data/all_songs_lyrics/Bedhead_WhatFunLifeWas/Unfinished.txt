Unfinished LyricsI told myself to relax
And dipped my fingers in hot candle wax
Then I rolled the wax into a ball
Over an inch wide but one inch tall
It was lopsided like the earth
Or my head right after birth
So I flattened the ball into a pancake
And thought of better things that I might make
Every time god makes a fist
He thinks of better things he's missed
And how he has messed up
The earth is flat or so I made it
Even though the world prevents it
So everybody run to the ends
And jump off, it's safe
We've made space bend like wax
Just float and relaxEmbed
