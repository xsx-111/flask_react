Foaming Love LyricsFloating up to the hole in the sky
To the casual wink of Uranus's wandering eye
I looked down somewhere over Europe
And let down a rope with Zeus on my side
And Cypress was pointing her bony finger
At the hole she'd make in Turkey's belly
And Kithira could hear nothing else but the noise
Of Laconia's engulfing war yell
Is she tartarean again today
With her aphrodisiac, the tarantella sway?
In anagogical vision, I am what I see
In anaclitical remission, there's nothing more to be
And I hit a wall with all I had
A start even with the first kiss
It ended in a scream of pain
I broke every bone in the red fist
And I face it, she makes the world spin
She makes all of us somehow kin
And makes everything the same as it's always been
So I've let down my rope to reel anyone in
And Uranus's scrotum's a totem pole
In the middle of Washington state
It tells the story of what went down in our house
It tells the story of our lust-driven, bearded, beautiful fateEmbed
