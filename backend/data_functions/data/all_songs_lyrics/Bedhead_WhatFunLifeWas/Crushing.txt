Crushing LyricsTo be crushed is not to be hit and then left to recover
It's to be left untouched, unable to pass from one place to another
To be crushed is not to be held down by some minor influence
It's to be left alone with nothing to understand
To be drowned is not to be suffered as some cruel fate
It should be taken as a blessing and maybe even a gift from God
But I've never seen him give anything away
And I've never known him to have anything to say
Which is why I've never felt any real need to prayEmbed
