Powder LyricsWhat was once so real now doesn't even exist
And now the memories are going, so just the feelings persist
And what thoughts come back I sometimes try to resist
The last of your strength fell apart first in your fist
And I had no idea I had any ideas
Sometimes I think I've never thought about anything
It was warm when you held me
When you dropped down beside me
But I saw your face turn to powder in a year
And did it do any good to have anyone tell you
That things weren't as bad as they had actually become?
And did it make things worse when your hand was held
It was the best for everyone but youEmbed
