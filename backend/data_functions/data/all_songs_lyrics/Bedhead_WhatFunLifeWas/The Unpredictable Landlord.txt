The Unpredictable Landlord LyricsYour unhappy accidents want a word with you
Your tenants of contingency want to speak to you
These conditions deserve attention
This place where we live is unhealthy
Everyone deserves decency
This is the kind of place you wouldn't drag you mother into
Even though everyone's mother brought everyone here
But if I had been in her place
I can't say I wouldn't have done things the same
No word's more misused than "absurd"
But no word's more absurd than "misused"
So fix this place, the ceiling's leaking from everywhere
Bricks and beams are falling from the sky
And no one deserves to live hereEmbed
