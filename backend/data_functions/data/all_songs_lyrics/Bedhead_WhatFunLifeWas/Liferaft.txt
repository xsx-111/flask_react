Liferaft LyricsThe bed at night is a life raft
In the ocean of the dark
I hang my hands over the sides
Pray to God knows what
Drifting somewhere in the black air
Feeling only the blanket
And the weight of the mattress
The mistress of the sheets
Too many successive nights of being miserable
Give one the sense to sense the invisible
I know you're in this room but the air is too thick
The bed at night is a life boat
A throne off which you can't be thrown
I hang my hands and feet over the sides
And go into the space of what can never be knownEmbed
