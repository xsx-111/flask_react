Contraflow LyricsI hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much (x2)
Go out little tyke
And meet at crossroads
Early morning
The sick hill near Buxton
Stock reload
I gotta do it
Prefixed about it
Goin' to meet Jim
With a roll
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much (x4)
As a retard I had to do it
I hate the dole
Them keys won't fit
Keys won't fit (the keys won't fit)
The keys won't fit in the socket
Or the controls
Stuck like grids on Pennine mud
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much
(walk snake back pass)
Walk snake back
Walk snake back
Walk snake pass
Walk snake bank
Go out little tyke
Early morning
Sick hills near Buxton
Suffering
I gotta do it
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much
I hate the countryside so much
I hate the contraflow so much (x4)Embed
