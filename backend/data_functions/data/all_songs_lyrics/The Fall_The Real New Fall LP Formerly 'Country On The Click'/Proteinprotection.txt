Proteinprotection LyricsNo protein protection in self-enforced exile
Does everybody talk about the same things
All the time
All the time
Doppel thingy
The chimney is the chief
Can kick and jump out of the mess
Out of the masses
Any time
Any time
Any time
There is something to believe in
No Hubbard (1) or husbandry or freedom or the holy terror
Abstraction
You know it's the smell
A goodbye to people, sincere
In a Billy backhand
Come on! Hey! Way!
Out of the masses
Any time
Any time
Any time
No protein protection or self-enforced exile
Does everybody talk about the same thing
All the time
Doppelganged
The chimney and the chief
Can kick and jump out of the mess
Out of the masses
Any time
Any time
Any time
There is something to believe in
No Hubbard or husband or husband or freedom
Or the holy terror
Abstraction
You know it's the smell
A goodbye to people, sincere
In a rock back Billy rut
Out of the masses
Any time
Any time
Any time
Out of the masses
Any time
Any time
Any timeEmbed
