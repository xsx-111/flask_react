Green Eyed Loco-Man LyricsTo wear Chanel, you have to shave first
And be a man; where do you stand, huh?
A green eyed loco-man
A green eyed loco-man
Where you're standing, I don't see you
Your reflected green eyes take two foot off you
I'm moving fast but you are tight
Your fractured eyes force me through the night
A green eyed loco-man
A green eyed loco-man
G-g-g-g-green eyed loco-man
Green eyed loco-man
And riddle me this, who are you?
Through a helmet your hair grows right to the ground
That will soon enfold you
Green eyed loco-man where do you stand, huh?
A green eyed loco-man
A green eyed loco-man
With a rabbit's skull on my right
You may be shocked but I'll make you late
For your greedy past, cold on a plate
