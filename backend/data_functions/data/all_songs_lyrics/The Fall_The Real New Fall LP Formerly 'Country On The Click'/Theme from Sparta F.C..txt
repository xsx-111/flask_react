Theme from Sparta F.C. Lyrics
Come on I will show you how I will change
When you give me something to slaughter
Shepherd boy (Hey!)
Everybody sing (Hey!)
Better act quick (Hey!)

Be my toy
Come on have a bet
We live on blood
We are Sparta F.C

Ella Na Soo Thixo
Poso tha alaxo
Otan tha moo thosis
Kati na sfaxo
Ella valeh stihima
Yia na kerthiso
Afto then ineh pimma
Yia ta skoopithia

I don't have a jack knife it went up the hill
I don't know if I'll get it back
But by hook or by crook I will
Hey! Hey!
Be my toy
Come on have a bet
We live on blood
We are Sparta F.C
Hey! Hey!

We have to pay for everything (Hey!)
But some things are for free (Hey!)
We live on blood (Hey!)
We are Sparta F.C. (Hey!)
English Chelsea fan this is your last game (Hey!)
We're not Galatasaray, we're Sparta F.C. (Hey!)

And take your fleecy jumper you won't need it anymore
It is in the car boot moving away
'Cause where you are going clothes won't help
Stay at home with TV set

Be my toy
Come on have a bet
We live on blood
We are Sparta F.C
Cheap English man in the paper shop
You mug old women in your bobble hat
Better go spot a place to rest
No more ground boutique at match in Chelsea
We are Sparta F.C.!

Come on have a bet
We live on blood
We are Sparta F.C
Hey! Hey!

Shepherd boy (Hey!)
Everybody sing (Hey!)
Better act quick (Hey!)
Be my toy (Hey!)
Come on have a bet (Hey!)
So I can win (Hey!)
This is not a poem (Hey!)
For the bin (Hey!)
I don't have a jack knife (Hey!)
It went up the hill (Hey!)
I don't know if I'll get it back (Hey!)
By hook or crook I will (Hey!)
English Chelsea fan (Hey!)
This is your last game (Hey!)
We're not Galatasaray (Hey!)
We're Sparta F.C. (Hey!)
