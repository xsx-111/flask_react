Last Commands of Xyralothep via M.E.S. LyricsLocus
Beware characters connected with car adverts
Real, assumed or imaginary
The vocal testament of M.E.S
Coming from the little town of Speck Marsden
1. Cash - the eternal fork out
To keep everything normal is well beyond the capacity
All monies will try and escape thee
Beware of thy lazy right hand
This is the focal of M.E.S. locus and Xyralothep
Avoid respectable television and respectable newspapers
They have neither the talent of art
Nor the instinctive snout of the media
2. Deploreth thy real god
He mutters incomprehensibly
Still on job one
With alloys
The calibrator
In a cave not yet invented or constructed
This is your vessel M.E.S
From he to you
This one M.E.S. procured
Mountain's waters blocked by dormant tree
See later on this LP
6. Avoid fat aggressive men and handsome aggressive men
In conflict they disappear overnight with bad backs
7. Cod-science/cod-psychology is to be avoided
But do not make your enig-noise public
As it will bring the wrath of the drude quartersEmbed
