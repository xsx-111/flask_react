Recovery Kit LyricsHow can you have
Your house and your land
How can you leave
How can you leave
Your new land guilded
What I gave I bought
How can you leave
Your house
How can you leave
Your money and guilded land
Your head explodes
If you try on it
You go out try, it is yours
There were three
At the old hall door
Complete recovery kit
The four parts of it
It's always free
What can I...
Your head explodes
Ah...
What I gave I bought
Was late that night it came on
It was quite steep in the middle
Speak speak speak
Come out the exit
Complete recovery kit
Four parts of it
If you want
It's free
You open itEmbed
