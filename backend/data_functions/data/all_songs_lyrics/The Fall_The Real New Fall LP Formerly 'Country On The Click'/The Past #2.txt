The Past #2 LyricsWhat you put in the mouth
A lot of things that weren't there
Pre-assumptions don't bring a harvest
But I love the justice and melancholy
(Band vox:)
Don't speak, just think
Look down, shut up
Don't frown, you fucked up
The truth, the lie
(M.E.S. vox:)
The feeling that makes you intelligence specie
Truth, the invention of a layer
Captivated in ha-ha juice injustice
The lie-down liar strikes back
Your neck is growing, oh
Only humans carry their past around
Their past around
Implode into realit...
(Band vox:)
Don't drive, don't sleep
Don't laugh, just vibe
The blood, the good
The bad, ha ha
(M.E.S. vox:)
Collaging your memories fast
I'll be good when I'm still but while meek
Pictureless memories dissolve in a panic
Motif: the one can see oneself
In the mould
It can be different
With all boys and girls dead
2: The one can see oneself in the world
It can be different
(Band vox:)
Don't speak, just think
Look down, shut up
Don't frown, you fucked up
The truth, the lie
(M.E.S. vox:)
And the fatal, and the up
And the down
And the fatal, and the up
And the down
Boys and the dead too are armed
Like the abdominisers and private investigators
Looking for a cheap coffee
Hunting out limeys
Or I'm just buying a drink
Wanna be my one, laddie?Embed
