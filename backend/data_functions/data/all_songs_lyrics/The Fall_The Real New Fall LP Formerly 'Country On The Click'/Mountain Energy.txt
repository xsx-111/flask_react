Mountain Energy LyricsMr Blairstowe and Mr Partridge
They said to me
To get a mortgage
You need an income letter
I thought it was free
Dolly Parton and Lord Byron
They said patriotism is the last refuge
But now its me
And water's flowing down the mountain
But a tree is blocking the water flowing
So I went fishing
A note from a fish said:
Dear dope, if you wanna catch us
You need a rod and a line
Signed the fish
Water is flowing down the mountain
But a tree is blocking the water flowing
Went to the car rental
They said to me
You need a log book and licence, son
Water's flowing down the mountain
But a tree is blocking the water coming
Mountain energy
And water's flowing down the mountain1Embed
