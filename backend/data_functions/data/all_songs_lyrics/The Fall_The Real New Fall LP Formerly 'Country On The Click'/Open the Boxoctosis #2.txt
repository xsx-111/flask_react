Open the Boxoctosis #2 LyricsLand of bounty
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
I opened the box
Of imperial stuff
And to my surprise
I found twenty five warriors
Warriors
With shields
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
I opened the box
Of imperial love
And to my surprise
I found twenty five warriors
With ribbons
Land of tolerance
Saints like me
With good word for everybody
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
Everybody
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
I found imperious ribbons
I opened the box
And to my surprise
I found love
Imperial stuff
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!
I opened the box
I was well perplexed
I opened the box
It was orthodox
It was looking at me
With imperial love
I opened the box
I opened the b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b...
Land of return to seat
Land of bounty
Land of dope cake
I opened the box
(Open the box, open the box
Open the goddamn box!)
I opened the box
And to my surprise
I found twenty five warriors
At the (?)
At the
At the
