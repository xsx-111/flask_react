Janet, Johnny & James LyricsWhat if the world crashed in
Refolding behind your eyelids
Cracked your mind
Cracked your mind
Janet and Johnny and James
Crash your mind
Behind your eyelids
The people behind you
With nepotism
Explodes
All that rubbish you create
In the 
Suddenly 
Nepotism
Janet and Johnny and James
Janet and Johnny and James
Dearest Lord, hear me now
Janet and Johnny
Coming over the mountain
From New Guinea
They see the star
From you, our creator
A startling vision of a future that didn't happen
Ian and Eric
The stars trace
Over Janet and Judy
And James
And Susan and Johnny
The skies reflect
Dear Lord, help them in their abject search
From Guineas and the bearded man
From the hills
Never seen again
Janet and Johnny and James
Reflect on your lifeEmbed
