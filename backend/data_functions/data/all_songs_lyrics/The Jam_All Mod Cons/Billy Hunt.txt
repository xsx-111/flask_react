Billy Hunt LyricsIf it's not you moaning, then it's someone else
Jumping down my throat every chance you get
If it's not you crying, then it's probably me
You're a little dog messing up my tree
Billy Hunt is a magical world
Full of strippers and long-legged girls
Clark Kent's got nothing on me
I'll spy like James Bond and die like King Kong
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt
I remember the first day at my job
I didn't get on too well with the foreman, Bob
Do this, do that, don't even stop for a cough
He used to be a sergeant in the R.A.F
No one pushes Billy Hunt around
Well they do, but not for long
'Cause when I get fit and grow bionic arms
The whole world's gonna wish it weren't born
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt
I could be a Superman
Satisfy any whim that I wanted to
I could be a human machine
I could show Steve Austin a thing or two
If it's not you moaning, then it's someone else
Jumping down my throat every chance you get
If it's not you crying, then it's probably me
You're a little dog messing up my tree
No one pushes Billy Hunt around
Well they do, but not for long
'Cause when I get fit and grow bionic arms
The whole world's gonna wish it weren't born
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy, Billy
Billy Hunt
Look out
Billy, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy Hunt
Billy, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy Hunt, Billy, Billy HuntEmbed
