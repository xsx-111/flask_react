Fly LyricsThe way that sunlight flits across your skirt
Makes me feel I'm from another world
To touch your face in the morning light
I hope you're always gonna be around
The times I struggle to understand why
The ancient proverbs like Who am I?
Why am I here and What have I done?
I see the answer's place my trust in you
Trust in you love, be with me then
That's when I want you, that's when I need you the most
I want us to be like Peter Pan
But dreams it seems are weightless as sand
And man's supposedly is made of sand
It seems that man cannot survive at all
Let's disappear love, let's fly away
Into the demi-monde, into the twilight zone
The times inside I spent screaming at you
Release me please from this mortal jail
One shrug or smile can determine my fate
I'm lost for days and have myself to blame
Something I'm giving, is yours for the taking
Something like sunlight, Love is a spotlight
Love is all sorrow, still I'll meet you tomorrow
And look forward to see you, now I can't live without youEmbed
