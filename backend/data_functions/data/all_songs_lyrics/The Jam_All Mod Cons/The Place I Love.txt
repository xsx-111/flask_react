The Place I Love LyricsThe place I love is a million miles away
It's too far for the eye to see
Still it's me at least and you can't come there
No one is allowed at all
Only animals that love me
Will always only ever could-be
Still it's always at the back of my mind
The place I love is overgrown now
With beautiful moss and colourful flowers
And goldfish that swim in a pool, there's a small brick wall
With neon lighting controlled by lightning
I'm making a stand against the world
There's those who would hurt us if they heard
And it's always in the back of my mind
The place I love is nowhere near here
Not within a yard of those trendy do's
Where dogsbodies pick you up and graciously give you a lift
With cherished thoughts and bitterness
I'm making a stand against the world
There's those who would hurt us if they heard
And that's always in the back of my mindEmbed
