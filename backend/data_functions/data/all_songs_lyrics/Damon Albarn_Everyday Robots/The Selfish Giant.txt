The Selfish Giant Lyrics
Celebrate the passing drug
Put 'em on the back seat while they're coursing in your blood
It's there amongst us all
Walking down Argyll Street when the evening colours call
It's true

I had a dream that you were leaving
It's hard to be a lover when the TV's on
And nothing is in your eyes
I had a dream that you were leaving
Where every atom falling in the universe
Is passing through our lives

Press yourself to me right now
Push yourself deep down now, to the dark hills, I must go
Where the shadows hide
Waiting for the final call, it's coming down the line
Retain

I had a dream that you were leaving
It's hard to be a lover when the TV's on
And nothing is in your eyes
I had a dream that you were leaving
Where every atom falling in the universe
Is passing through our lives
I had a dream that you were leaving
Retain

I had a dream that you were leaving
It's hard to be a lover when the TV's on
And nothing is in your eyes
It's true
I had a dream that you were leaving
Where every atom falling in the universe
Is passing through our lives

I had a dream that you were leaving
I had a dream that you were leaving9Embed
