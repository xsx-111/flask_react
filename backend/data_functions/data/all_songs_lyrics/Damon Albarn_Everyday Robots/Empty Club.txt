Empty Club Lyrics
I turned up late on a Saturday night
You had your headphones on and the only light
Came from the slow-deleting history
I dropped my guard, you can do the same
We can go hard, then ease the pain
With tomorrow's DVDs

Would you do that for me?
Would you do that for me?
Would you just turn and walk away?
In an empty club
Song is the sun
In the dim light of deleting histories
Never to be seen again

Now the pylon stance in a tug of war
In every town, feel the chemical roar
Of a congregation leaving in their drawers
As the lights go down on Saturday night
And the fifes of Sunday begin their fight
With tomorrow's personnel

Would you do that for me?
Would you do that for me?
Would you just turn and walk away?
In an empty club
Song is the sun
In the dim light of deleting histories
Never to be seen againEmbed
