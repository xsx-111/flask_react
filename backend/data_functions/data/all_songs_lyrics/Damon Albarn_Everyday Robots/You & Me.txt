You & Me Lyrics

I met Moko Jumbie
He walks on stilts through All Saints Road
Looking over the Brunel, for a procession loss
People sound, no days off
In September, when the sun sets sooner

In you
It radiates on you (On you)
Seven high, they're rising (I saw seven high-rising buildings)
(On you) (Sunsets in September)
Over on the other side (On you)
Of September, when the sun sets sooner (On you)

Jab Jab
Digging out a hole in Westbourne Grove
Tin foil and a lighter, the ship across
Five days on, two days off
In September, when the sun sets sooner

In you
It radiates on you (On you)
Seven high, they're rising (I saw seven high-rising buildings)
(On you) (Sunsets in September)
Over on the other side (On you)
Of September, when the sun sets sooner (On you)
In you
It radiates on you (On you)
Seven high, they're rising (I saw seven high-rising buildings)
(On you) (Sunsets in September)
Over on the other side (On you)
Of September (On you)

You can blame me, blame me, blame me, blame me
When the twilight comes, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
You can blame me, blame me, blame me, blame me
When the twilight comes, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again

Some days I look at the morning
Trying to work out how I got here
'Cause the distance between us is the glamourâ€™s cost
Late night on the shop floor
What language was I speaking?
Not sure I remember the thrill and fall
Always in me
Let it go

You can blame me, blame me, blame me, blame me (Let it go)
When the twilight comes, all goes 'round again (Let it go)
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
You can blame me, blame me, blame me, blame me
When the twilight comes, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
On you
Put my predilections on you
On you, it's on you
It's on you

You can blame me, blame me, blame me, blame me (On you)
When the twilight comes, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again (On you)
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
You can blame me, blame me, blame me, blame me (On you)
When the twilight comes (Let it go), all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again (On you)
All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again

All goes 'round again, all goes 'round again
All goes 'round again13Embed
