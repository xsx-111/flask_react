Electric Fences Lyrics
I am not taking sides
Anymore, anymore
I am waiting for the light
To come again, just once more

Electric fences
Divide us all

I have flown out of the storm
Over the trees, breathe for me
Over homes so manicured
Of the one per cent who own the soil

Electric fences
Divide us all

Oh, it's the darkest thing a man will ever know

I am not taking sides
Anymore, anymore
I am waiting for the light
To come again, just once more
Electric fences
Divide us all

Do-do-do, la-do-da-do
La-do-da-do, do
It's the darkest thing
Do-do-do, la-do-da-do
La-do-da-do, do
It's the darkest thing
Do-do-do, la-do-da-do
La-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
It's the darkest thingEmbed
