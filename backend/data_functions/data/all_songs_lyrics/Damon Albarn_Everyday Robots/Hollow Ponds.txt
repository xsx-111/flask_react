Hollow Ponds Lyrics
Ship on the Hollow Ponds
Set sail by a kid
In the heat wave that hit us all
1976
I felt the percussion
The green man had gone
Half my road was now a motorway
1991
I was by the Black Sea
Two hours in time
Spiny urchins and a new school bell
1979
Changed into lakeside
In January (Hollow Ponds)
Modern life was sprayed onto a wall
In 1993

Where the horses and passing trains (Horses and the passing trains)
A pentangle revealed
In the green woods where you walked with me
Ship on Hollow Ponds was filled
(Thirteen) Up with the dreams (That turned into a dream)
(Thirteen) We share on LCDs (We watched on LCDs)
Every moment now in every day
Every moment now in every day4Embed
