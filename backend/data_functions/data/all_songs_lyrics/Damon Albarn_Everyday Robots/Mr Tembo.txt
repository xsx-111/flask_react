Mr Tembo Lyrics
Injili, injili, can I sing with you?
'Bout Mr Tembo and what he's got to do
But first I'm going back to the Colworth Road
To find the mission and help him with his load

Mr Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there, he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned

Injili, injili, we will sing with you
Just like the TV in Mr Tembo's room
Off the emphatic night, he checked in on his own
At Mkombozi Inn and made it his home

Mr Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there, he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned

Injili, injili, we will sing to you
'Bout Mr Tembo and what he's going through
He gets up early while you are still in bed
Mr Tembo, green blanket by his head
Mr Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there, he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned

Hey, you keep those lions off the front of the boat!
Good god, man! Have you some cotton in your ears?!
I'm trying to run this expedition in a decent manner!
Logistics, haulage, gulf, bungalow
Spice, canals, cows, hay bales
Telegraph wires, pylon power
Farmhouse oak, the chimney's still used
Domes, satellites, football pitches
Faded flags and lots of dogs
Neon cross on top of a block of flats
And a church, not as usual

Mr Tembo is on his way up the hill
With only this song to tell you how he feels
But to get there, he will need a helping hand
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned
It's where he is now, but it wasn't what he planned8Embed
