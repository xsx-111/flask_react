Hostiles Lyrics
Hostiles

When the service done
And the parish have all sung
And the mid frequencies come
To keep you away
When your body aches
From the unresolved dreams you keep
And the hours passed by
Just left on repeat

It'll be a silent day
I share with you
Fighting off the hostiles
With whom we collude
Hoping to
Find the key
To this play of communications
Between you and me

When the LCDs
Are all the player ones you can be
Put your foot down in the right-hand lane
If you are with me
'Til the trains re-run
And the rush hour has come
And the mid frequencies sung
Have sent you to sleep
It'll be a silent day
I share with you
Fighting off the hostiles
With whom we collude
Hoping to
Find the key
To this play of communications
Between you and me

Don't burn so, don't burn so
Don't burn so late
Don't burn so, don't burn
Don't burn so late

It'll be a silent day
I share with you
Fighting off the hostiles
With whom we collude
Hoping to
Find the key
To this play of communications
Between you and me
