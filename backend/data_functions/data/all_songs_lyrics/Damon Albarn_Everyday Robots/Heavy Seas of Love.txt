Heavy Seas of Love Lyrics
When your soul isn’t right and it’s raw to the night
It’s in your hands
When the traces of dark come to fade in the light
You’re in safe hands

Heavy seas of love, radiance is in you
As above, so below on the heavy seas of love
Heavy seas of love, we come together in you
Counting out the new moons on the heavy seas of love

When the world is too tall, you can jump, you won’t fall
You’re in safe hands
What the day will now give, how those seeds will now live
It’s in your hands

Heavy seeds of love, radiance is in you
As above, so below on the heavy seas of love
Heavy seas of love, we come together in you
Counting out the new moons on the heavy seas of love
Heavy seeds of love, radiance is in you
As above, so below on the heavy seas of love
Heavy seas of love, radiance is in you
Counting out the new moons on the heavy seas of love
They-they-they-they didn’t know where they was going
But they knew where they was, wasn’t it?1Embed
