Lonely Press Play Lyrics
Arrhythmia
Accepting that you live with uncertainty
If you're lonely, press play
Dilated time
The aspects that you pass on while traveling
When you're lonely, press play

'Cause you're not resolved in your heart
You're waiting for me
To improve
Right here
When I'm lonely, I press play

Swimming in blue
After New Year, into the mirror she flew
When I'm lonely, I press play
Can I get any closer?
What antidote can I bring to you?
When I'm lonely, I press play

'Cause you're not resolved in your heart
You're waiting for me
To improve
Right here
When I'm lonely, I press play
Arrhythmia
Accepting that you live with uncertainty
If you're lonely, press play
Can I get any closer? (Can I get closer?)
What antidote can I bring to you?
When I'm lonely, I press play

'Cause you're not resolved in your heart
You're waiting for me
