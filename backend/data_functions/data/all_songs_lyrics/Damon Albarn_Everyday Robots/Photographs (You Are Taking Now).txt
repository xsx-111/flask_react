Photographs (You Are Taking Now) Lyrics
When the photographs you're taking now
Are taken down again
When the heavy clouds that hide the sun
Have gone
The millions of us on the hill
From the start to Land's End
When photographs you're taking now
Are taken now, press send (Press send)

This is a precious opportunity
Beware of the photographs you are taking now

We are flying over black sands
In a glass aeroplane
Crashing in slow motion
In another cityscape game (Now)
Where the feeling is supernatural (Now)
Like passing into other worlds
That end in dissolution when (Now)
The mothership, it explodes

When the photographs you're taking now
Are taken down again
When the heavy clouds that hide the sun
Have gone
The millions of us on the hill
From the start to Land's End
When photographs you're taking now
Are taken now, press send (Press send)
We were walking like zombies on over (6706560)
To the church of John Coltrane
Eight hours on the bus from sunset (Now)
With freedom, taking cocaine
In the patent courts of nature (Now)
All is but a vanity
And the metronome that defeats you is (Now)
The monochrome that you see

When the photographs you're taking now
Are taken down again
When the heavy clouds that hide the sun
Have gone
The millions of us on the hill
From the start to Land's End
When photographs you're taking now
Are taken now, press send (Press send)

This is a precious opportunity
Beware of the photographs you are taking now
(Now) Photographs you are taking now
(Now) Photographs you are taking now
Photographs you are taking now8Embed
