Everyday Robots Lyrics
"They-they-they-they didn’t know where they was going
But they knew where they was, wasn’t it?"

We are everyday robots on our phones
In the process of getting home (Autonomous)
Looking like standing stones
Out there on our own
We're everyday robots in control
Or in the process of being sold (Autonomous)
Driving in adjacent cars
'Til you press restart

"They-they-they-they didn’t know where they was going
But they knew where they was, wasn’t it?" (Autonomous)

Everyday robots just touch thumbs
Swimmin’ in lingo they become (Autonomous)
Stricken in a status sea
One more vacancy
For everyday robots getting old
When our lips are cold (Autonomous)
Lookin’ like standing stones
Out there on our own
Little robots in ringback tones
In the process of getting home (Autonomous)
(Autonomous)13Embed
