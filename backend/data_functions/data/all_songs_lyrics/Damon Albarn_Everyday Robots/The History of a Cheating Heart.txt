The History of a Cheating Heart Lyrics
More than you know
More than you know
When the river shallows
I always go

Back to the moment
I feel the most
I carry this upon my back, always
If you fall, then I will put you back, I do
Love you, but it's just a fact
The history of the cheating heart
Is always more than you know

More than you know
More than you know
When the white owl flies over
I always go

Back to the moment
I feel the most
I carry this upon my back, always
If you fall, then I will put you back, I do
Love you, but it's just a fact
The history of the cheating heart
Is always more than you know
More than you know, I am beside you
Under the tango tree, I grow
With my consort of forever
The history of my heart will show
It's more than you know4Embed
