Alone, Omen 3 Lyrics
Take a dip, if you're alone, take your time
Take a ticket, take the train to the end of the line
See where you can go, you spent it, it's plastic, no do or die
Better flip it, think about it, you'll do just fine, well

These things will come and go
Deep in the metropole

Throw a stone, see it land, forget its flight
Draw a line in the sand between your thighs
Just to see which way you go
So you got this, you're the lead, feel your own
Battle through it, consume it, then let it go, girl

But don't forget you're not alone
Deep in the metropole

The ache and thunder in the storms of your mind
Soak it in, for the rain will pass in time
Nothing wrong in sinking low
You're the omen of paradise
You're the ghost they put aside
But don't forget you're not alone
Sometimes you're stretched
But don't forget you're not alone
Sometimes you're stretched

Every minute, every second, you're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, you're not alone
You're not alone, my girl (Sometimes you're stretched)
Sometimes you're stretched, sometimes you're stretched, ooh15Embed
