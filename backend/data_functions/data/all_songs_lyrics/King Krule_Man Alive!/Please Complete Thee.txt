Please Complete Thee Lyrics
Please complete me
It must be the answer
Everything just seems to be numbness around
Why aren't you near me?
What stars are you under?
If only I could hear from you right now
Did your mind ever clear me?
Has your faith found a pastor?
Or am I still in shapes in the clouds?
Did you see me on TV?
Have you seen the disasters?
We don't have long 'til this earth is drowned
If only I had seen clearly as we lay beneath thunder
Feeling the feeling of pride
The pride that brought me down
When they all stood and cheered me
What made your departure?
I still remember you walking off in the crowd


Yours sincerely
Eros' bow has no archer
Icarus still soars above the ground
The moon appears freely but arose to a structure
And our days and nights have been constantly letting me down
This place doesn't move me
Everything just seems to be numbness around
This place doesn't move me
Everything just constantly letting me down
Girl
