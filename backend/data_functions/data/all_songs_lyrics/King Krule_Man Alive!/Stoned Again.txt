Stoned Again Lyrics
Yeah, she's my sweet
My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to my mummy
Ain't allowed in the park
Exiled, couldn't even do one keepie uppie
The cars on my road almost hit me in a hurry
The cars are just a sign of another yuppie
Down in the dirt
I used to surf with my bucket from Kentucky
I had a scratch card, I scratched so hard
'Cause I'm feelin' fuckin' lucky, boy, I'm feelin' so lucky
On my tenth birthday, got a puppy
Now I'm back in the park with the middle class yobs
Tryna get lucky
I was little once more
Weed smoke made me feel so yucky
Pullin' on my brain, born
Another fuckin' junkie, born
Another fuckin' scum, torn apart
I was little once more, weed smoke, agh

Oh, I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm high again, boy
Oh, I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm low again
Yeah, she's my sweet
My sweet and sour, my lemon honey
I ran all the way home that night
Ran all the way home right back to her, back to her
Down in a high
I used to pick up all the pieces and I went home
I used to pick her up
I used to pick it up

I'm stoned again
I'm stoned again
I'm high again, boy9Embed
