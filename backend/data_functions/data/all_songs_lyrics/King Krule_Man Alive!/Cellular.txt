Cellular LyricsThere's a television
There's a television speaking to me
There's a French girl
On my television
She's crying in the palm of my hand
In moving metal
I read the paper, or just the photos
I rip one out with my hand
There's a massacre
Across the o-, across the o-
Across the ocean
I can see it in the palm of my hands
Me hundo cada vez más hondo
Below the ground floor
We're losing signal, we've lost connection
I left her dying, she was still crying
And now she's lying in my head
Above the third rail, shrapnel flying
Next door's wobbling
But I'm riding to the end
What am I good for? (What am I good for?)
I've got no signal
Abandoned to the voice in my head
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I-
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
I phone my ex
