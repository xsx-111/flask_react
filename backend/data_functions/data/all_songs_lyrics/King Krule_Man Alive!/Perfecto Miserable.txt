Perfecto Miserable LyricsThe person you're calling... is on another line
Just leave your message after the tone
And when you're done, press hash, or just hang up
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
You're the only thing
That makes me feel alright
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
And you're the only thing
I never feel alright
I guess I have to go
And in my silence
It's so menacing
And when I'm left alone
It's so damaging
And in this violence
The walls cave in
I'm not able
To escape it all
'Cause you're my everything, I have no worth
And you're the only thing that makes life work
Thought I hated everything, but it's not worth
Thought I hated everything
Another lonely night
Another lonely night
You're my everything
You make me feel alright
You're the only thing
That makes me feel alright
You're my everything
You make me feel just fine
And you're the only thing
I never feel alright
I guess I have to go
I guess I have to go1Embed
