The Dream Lyrics
Start making sense of things
I saw pylons stretch to the east
I wasn't sure at all why our love
Becomes sorrow and withers free
Ran a firework of dogs to walk with me
Felt this warm
Marching forth
I felt their warmth
Marching forth
We could be

The dream
The dream
The dream
The dream
The dream
