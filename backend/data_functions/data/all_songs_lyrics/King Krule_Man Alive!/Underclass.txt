Underclass LyricsThe moon hangs above
Makes judgement of all of us
I've had enough, lover of what you think of me
I weren't sure at all of what I was supposed to be
The demon's key showing me up in times of need
By setting me through
She was like
"Nothing ever made me feel the way you do"
Is it real?
You came at last
Lock the door and run the bath
I was doing some good
I was keeping clean
Kept my head up above your intimacy or steadily
Your putrid ooze would swallow me
Is it meant to be?
And find me those big sad eyes
I lay down on the empty streets
The roads seem to lead me to you
Under the underclass
Deep in society's hole
That's where I saw you, love
And we're beneath it all
I had this feeling I was coming back
But little did I know
But little did I know
I had this feeling
The numb, it gonna spread through me, girl
Let the fire grow cold
And prepare that bed for me, yeah
I'm under your control
Under the underclass
Deep beneath it all
I had this feeling I was coming back
But little did I know
