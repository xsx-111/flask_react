Energy Fleets Lyrics
Where are you going?
The day's about to end
Such a funny life I lead
I'm sittin', soakin' in the times
I bleed
Watch it flow right out of me

Why stop reading?
When the page is 'bout to turn
Such a funny life I lead
I think about it all the time
I sleep
Yeah, someone told me it gets worse, I disbelieve
Thought I'd be overseas
Curing disease but
Now it's part of me

She's alright
Such a funny life I lead
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
Such a funny life
(Such a funny life, such a funny life)2Embed
