Chewing Gum Lyrics
My man Rico MDB in the house
My dog C-9 with the date
My dog TC over here, grinnin' all golden
And he finna come up
Street smart-
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me

Switchin' up your style, but you've waited too long
Funny until now so it's wrong
Pacing yourself, and racing yourself in the name of truth
But what's true?
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, so, what you want from me?
Grinnin' all gold
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Looking for the chewin', for the chewin'
Tell me what you want from me

Nothing can replace me if you're not taking my lead
Better to be broken than in need

Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, uh, so what you want from me?
Tell me what you want from me
(What you want from me baby)
Tell me what you want from me (Grill on froze)
Tell me what you want from me (Want from me)
Tell me what you want from me

Lookin' for the chewin', for the jaw
Blowing like the time, word of mouth
Shawty told me that this world is ours
Selfish with that pussy like it's mine
Peppermint, double-mint, spearmint type of shit
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no license and shit
No relatives, sentimental
It's detrimental, still compared to this relevance
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no license and shit, oh
Back and forth, wall to wall, use the jaw
Losin' drawers in the sauce, now
On the job, never off
That pussy got, won't let her on, and it's so good
Shout out my ex though, she was the best though
Got on my damn nerves, hella fresh though
I bought that Guess shirt
She had that mesh shirt, I turned it to a sweatshirt
Throw on that sweatshirt, she fuck with Earl too
She fuck with girls too, I fuck with her too
Tell her quit the chattin', jaws made for chewin'
If you fuckin' with me, bet you know what you doin', like
Vavet, get the new CD, "Feel Me Before They Kill Me"
Right now, fear me in person
Buy "Feel Me, Before They Kill Me"! You heard me?
Patta, I like the dirty, dirty, I love to beat it, beat it
Tell her lies and and I promise whole lot of shit
She'll never get, bend over let me hit
A North Memphis nigga bitch, he is very slick
Ho, don't beat a bih, and they see you break
That ho love a rich nigga, I got plenty cake
She get it like she do, 'cause she pretty freak
Pretty hate, I got choppas, call me pretty Drake
