Holy Will Lyrics
Lord, I just wanna be
Rooted and grounded in thee
Lord, place me
Lord Jesus, place me, yeah
I wanna be centered in thy will

In thy holy will
In thy holy will
In thy holy, holy, holy, holy, holy will

Lord, I just wanna be
Highly favored in thee
Lord, make me in
Lord Jesus, place me
I wanna be centered in thy will

In thy holy will (Holy will)
In thy holy will (Center me)
In thy holy, holy, holy, holy, holy will (Holy will)
In thy holy will (Center me)
In thy holy will (Center me)
In thy holy, holy, holy, holy, holy will
Something you see
And it's all that you know to be true
Something you need
It's all that I know to be true
Something you see
All that I know to be true
Something you need
It's all that I know to be true

Be true
Lord, place me
Lord, place meEmbed
