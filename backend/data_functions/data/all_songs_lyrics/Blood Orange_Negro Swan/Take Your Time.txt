Take Your Time Lyrics
Take your time, it's all you've ever known
And nothing gets complete when you're home
I pull you up so far
You can't keep placing yourself below
Waiting for your headache to go
What do I know so far?

So far
So far
So far
So far
So far
So far

Cruise your phone, make sure your body's warm
Let's link up, tell me when you are home
What do you know so far?
You can't keep placing yourself above
Touch is something short of true love (Oh, true love)
What do I know, know, so far?

So far
So far
So far
