Orlando Lyrics
Dreaming Orlando, get it?
Give it time
Walked these steps before
Sixteen-year-old boy
Confused and knowing that he’s different he wants to give in
After school, sucker punched down
Down and out

First kiss was the floor
First kiss was the floor

Thinking it won't make a difference if you don't get up
Timing is all
I don't know, tell us more
What do you want me to think?
I’m changing anyway
All that I know was taught to me young, lesson one, when I cried in front of you all
Seen it all before

First kiss the floor
First kiss the floor
First kiss the floor
Shoot, baby, shoot
Life on the floor
You know, it's an insult we often put onto
Beneath the world
A lot of folk is, like, oh, you're doing too much
So like, a couple years ago I was like
You know what? My resolution, my internal resolution will be to
Sand in your pearls
To do too much
Yes, I love it4Embed
