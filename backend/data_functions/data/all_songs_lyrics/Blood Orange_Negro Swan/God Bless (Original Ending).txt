God Bless (Original Ending) Lyrics
There are so many times when I just need a hug
When I need way more than a listening ear of a friend
Being in hospital after I was raped, and I had no one
No one to call, beaten and robbed, beaten on the streets
And have no one to even ask me if I’m okay after
Being homeless, to being diagnosed with HIV
Not even being able to sleep at night
I can’t sleep at night
Birthdays, Christmas, you see, I chose to be here
I chose to understand the strength
And there’s so much beauty in that
There’s so much beauty in that
You see, it’s not who you are, or what we are
But it’s the journey, and for me
It’s always been about the journey
This body, my blackness and my transness
Seems to be a beacon of violence
Just in existence alone
I gave up everything, just to exist
To be honest, I wouldn’t have it any other way
There’s so much beauty in that
And that’s just unquantifiable3Embed
