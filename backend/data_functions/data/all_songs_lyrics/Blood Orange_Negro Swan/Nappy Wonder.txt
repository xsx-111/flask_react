Nappy Wonder Lyrics
Dreaming of the place
Bring myself away
Like in Barking days

Scared my fears away
No one to complain
Baby, what's the grade?

I'm riding switch, I can't escape
Future back into the gate
I bust it up on Ilford Lane
A pleasure flip up to my grade
I'm riding switch, I can't escape
Future back into the gate
I bust it up on Ilford Lane

Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics (Always feeling)
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Dreaming of the place
Bring myself away
Like in Barking days

I'm riding switch, I can't escape
I bust it up on Ilford Lane
A pleasure flip up to my grade

Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics (Always feeling)
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical (Always feeling)

Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics (Always feeling)
Feelings never have been ethical
Feelings never had no ethics
Feelings never have been ethical3Embed
