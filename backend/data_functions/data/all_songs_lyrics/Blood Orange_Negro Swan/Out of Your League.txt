Out of Your League Lyrics
Follow me under and never to be too unique
Definitely a trap, she'll get ya body and you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all that you need
Don't have to fill no expectation that aren't the thoughts that you conceive

Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing with time
Promises, promises, promises left that you know
Changing with time

Follow me under and never to be too unique
Definitely a trap, she'll get ya body and you're starting to feel weak
Maybe a thing that you wanted is all that you need
Don't have to fill no expectation that aren't the thoughts that you conceive3Embed
