Minetta Creek Lyrics
Choose your hair and choose to get off
Waste your time and pretty the thoughts
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost
Find a means to drive away grief
Choose your sex to find a relief
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost


Choose your hair and choose to get off
Waste your time and pretty the thoughts
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost
Find a means to drive away grief
Choose your sex to find a relief
Nothing is forgiven, black skin and my rhythm
And you know that it's all at a cost1Embed
