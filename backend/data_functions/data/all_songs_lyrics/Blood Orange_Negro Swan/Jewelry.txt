Jewelry Lyrics
So, like, my favorite images are the ones where
Someone who isn't supposed to be there
Who's like in a space, a space where
We were not ever welcomed in, where we were not invited
Yet we walk in and we show all the way up
People try to put us down by saying
"She's doing the most," or "He's way too much."
But, like, why would we want to do the least?

Cheap on your skin, smooth
Jewels that ring
Shine hit your eyes, black kiss the ring
Ruby ebony sides, it's time
Change my eyes for something, cool

A dream never leaving my sight
A sun never leaving my side
A feeling, a door starts to close
I'm feeling the burn in my eyes
The eyes of a heavy basset
Suited to staying indoors like a good nigga
I treated the hope like my home
And destroyed it, go figure
Still proud, best of my abilities
Still I think about an exit
No one ever will appreciate
The way you bare your soul for them too
I'm through
I'm through
Cheap on your skin, smooth
Jewels that ring
Shine hit your eyes
Black kiss the ring
Ruby ebony sides

Nigga, I'm feeling myself
(Nigga, I'm feeling myself)
Nigga, I'm still in my zone
(I'm still in my zone)
Got big books but I'm broke, (I'm broke)
Nigga, I'm feeling myself
(Nigga, I'm feeling myself)
One time for the help
(One time, one time)
Two times 'fore I fell
Three times for the hopeless feeling
Look at how I'm spending my wealth
(Look at how I'm spending my wealth)
And I'm feeling myself looking up
But then the thoughts start filling me up, me up
Nigga, I'm feeling my, nigga, I'm feeling myself
(Nigga, I'm feeling myself)
One time for the help
When the news is way too fi'
And a man get shot on the passenger side
Too bad 'cos a nigga went live, (went live)
Nigga, I'm feeling my, nigga, I'm feeling myself
Seek what you need to get by
Awake with one eye closed
In dark black clothes
Red and blue lights on my stone
Go back to being unknown
Relax your hair
Tuck your shirt
Put your glasses on
Play your guitar5Embed
