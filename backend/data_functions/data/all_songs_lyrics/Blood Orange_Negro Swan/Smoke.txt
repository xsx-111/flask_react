Smoke Lyrics
See, on me

Balance in my hair, I'm pretty as fuck, ay, ay
Choosing what you wear and getting this far
Tricking on my own time, what is it worth?
Got throat on my neck, neck, shatter your first
I'm waiting for the smoke to clear

It's a long time, long time
See 
See..

Pretty woke, I'm pretty as fuck
Trick coat
Choosing what you wear and getting this far
Waiting for the smoke to clear

It's a long time, long time
See 
See..

The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills within (My heart and my soul)
The Sun comes in, my heart fulfills withinEmbed
