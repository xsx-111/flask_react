So-Called Chaos Lyrics
Deadlines and meetings and contracts all breached
D-days and structure, responsibility
Have to's and need to's and get to's by three
Eleventh hours and upset employees

I wanna be naked running through the streets
I wanna invite this so-called chaos that you'd think I dare not be
I wanna be weightless flying through the air
I wanna drop all these limitations but the shoes upon my feet

Heartburn and headaches
And soon-to-be ulcers
Compulsive yearnings
Non stop to please others

I wanna be naked running through the streets
I wanna invite this so-called chaos that you'd think I dare not be
I wanna be weightless flying through the air
I wanna drop all these limitations but the shoes upon my feet

All won't be lost if I'm governed by my own innate-ness
Stoplights won't work I'll get home sound and safe regardless
And won't be mayhem if I'm ruled by my own rule-lessness
My fire won't quell and I'll be harm free and distressless
Trust me
Line-towing and helping
Expectations up to living
Inside-box-obeying
Inside-line-coloring

I wanna be naked running through the streets
I wanna invite this so-called chaos that you'd think I dare not be
I wanna be weightless flying through the air
I wanna drop all these limitations but the shoes upon my feet

I wanna be naked running through the streets
I wanna invite this so-called chaos that you'd think I dare not be
I wanna be weightless flying through the air
I wanna drop all these limitations and return to what I was born to beEmbed
