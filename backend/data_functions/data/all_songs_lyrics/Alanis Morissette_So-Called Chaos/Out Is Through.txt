Out Is Through Lyrics
Every time you raise your voice, I see the greener grass
Every time you run for cover, I see this pasture
Every time we're in a funk, I picture a different choice
Anytime we're in a rut, this distant grandeur

My tendency to want to do away feels natural and
My urgency to dream of softer places feels understandable
But I know

The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately

Every time that I'm confused, I think there must be easier ways
Every time our horns are locked on towel throwing
Every time we're at a loss, we've bolted from difficulty
Anytime we're in stalemate, a final bowing

My tendency to want to hide away feels easier and
The immediacy is picturing another place comforting to go
The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately

We could just walk away and hide our heads in the sand
We could just call it quits, only to start all over again
With somebody else

Every time we're stuck in struggle, I'm down for the count that day
Every time I dream of quick fix, I'm swaged
Now I know it's hard when it's through and I'm damned if I don't know quick fix way
But formerly mistreat me silence now outdated

My tendency to want to run feels unnatural now
The urgency to want to give to you I don't want most feels good
And I know

The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll feel better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The faster we're in, the better
The only way out is through ultimately
The only way out is through
The only way we'll get better
The only way out is through ultimately2Embed
