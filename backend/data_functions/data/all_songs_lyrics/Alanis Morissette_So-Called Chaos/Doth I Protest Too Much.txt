Doth I Protest Too Much Lyrics
I'm not threatened by every pair of legs you watch go by
I don't cringe when you stare at women
It's just a thing called guy
I don't notice your sideways glances
Or where your loyalty lies
I'm secure, and out of me, it's hard to get a rise

I'm not jealous, I don't get moved by much
I'm not enraged, not insecure as such
Not going insane, rational stays in touch
And doth I protest too much?

I'm not tortured by how oft you're busy
'Cause I've got things to do
I'm not disappointed, about how you don't miss me
'Cause I don't need you to

I'm not needy, I don't get clingy much
I am not scared, I am not afraid as such
I'm not dependent, rock solid stays in touch
And doth I protest too much?
So much energy to prove to you
Who I can't possibly be
So much energy to prove to you, I am not
Who you aim for me to be

I'm not saddened and I don't miss you
'Cause I have moved on too
I'm not concerned about your new lover
'Cause I have a new lover too

I am not depressed, I don't get down that much
I am not despondent, I am not dark as such
I'm never sad, keep chin up, stays in touch
And doth I protest too much?

I am not jealous, I don't get moved by much
I'm not enraged, not insecure as such
Not going insane, rational stays in touch
And doth I protest too much?Embed
