Offer Lyrics
Who
Who am I to be blue?
Look at my family and fortune
Look at my friends and my house
Who
Who am I to feel dead end?
Who am I to feel spent?
Look at my health and my money
And where
Where do I go to feel good?
Why do I still look outside me?
When clearly I've seen it won't work

Is it my calling to keep on when I'm unable?
And is it my job to be selfless extraordinaire?
And my generosity has me disabled
By this my sense of duty to offer

And why
Why do I feel so ungrateful?
Me who is far beyond survival
Me who see life as an oyster
Is it my calling to keep on when I'm unable?
And is it my job to be selfless extraordinaire?
And my generosity has me disabled
By this my sense of duty to offer

And how
How dare I rest on my laurels
How dare I ignore an outstretched hand
How dare I ignore a third world country

Is it my calling to keep on when I'm unable?
And is it my job to be selfless extraordinaire?
And my generosity has me disabled
By this my sense of duty to offer

Who
Who am I to be, woo1Embed
