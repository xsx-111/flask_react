Beat Up Car LyricsYou can lie to those white coats
But you can't lie to me
There's a difference between
What you want and what you need
Over the rainbow with no end in sight
A rest easy stockpile
The rest of your life in plain sight
It just don't feel right

So if you're interested
I'll take you anywhere
I'll buy some beat up car and we could get out of here
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere if you want to go
I could lie to most anyone
But I can't lie to you
Stalled at the gates and that simply won't do
Under artificial light I drink myself blind
I won't watch you kill yourself
Or leave you here to rot to death of loneliness

So if you're interested
I'll take you anywhere
I'll buy some beat up car and we could get out of here
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere if you want to go
A dotted line you'll sign for me
We'll get to work, we'll work for cheap
We'll work for us, we'll work for free
And pray for job security
Show them how it feels to be together
To admit defeat
To revel in the irony
Some place we can be ourself
Won't watch you kill yourself
Or leave you here to rot to death

So if you're interested
I'll take you anywhere
I'll buy some beat up car and we could get out of here
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere if you want to go
So if you're interested
I'll take you anywhere
I'll buy some beat up car and we could get out of here
Some place we can be ourselves
Won't watch you kill yourself
Or leave you here to rot to death
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere that you want to go
I'll take you anywhere  you want to go2Embed
