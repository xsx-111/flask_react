It Takes More LyricsCompact enhancement in your hand
You were lifted from your mind
Floating like a ghost
No sense of self
No sense of time
Smiling slow and steady
You were young and you were free
It used to come so easily

Now it takes more, and more
It takes more just to feel like it used to
(I knew right then I’d do it all again, I’d do it all again)
It takes more, and more to feel anything at all
(I knew right then I’d do it all again, I’d do it all again)
Holy connection, so unexplained, so past control
We spoke all night in a language only we could know
Smiling slow and steady
We were young and we were free
It used to come so easily

Seems like every time you’ve got it figured out
You're just figuring out you're wrong
Seems like every time you get to where you’re going
You're wishing you were gone
