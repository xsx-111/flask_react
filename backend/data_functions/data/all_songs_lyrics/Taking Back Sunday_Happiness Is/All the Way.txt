All the Way LyricsHeaven sent the perfect gift
Five feet eight inches tall
That jealous boy inside me
I done taught him how to crawl
Heaven sent the perfect gift
Five feet eight inches tall
All the way you take me, take it
All the way
(You take it all the way)
Never met a stranger, yeah, she always stays on call
All the way you take me, take it
All the way
(You take it all the way)
I ain't the first man you've been with, still
I don't care at all
Yeah, that jealous boy inside me
I done taught him how to crawl

All the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way
And all I want is more
All I want is more
Oh behind your green mean go eyes
Your instincts know not to trust
Anything too complicated
You look both ways before you cross
But accidents do happen
Knock you back and off your feet
And when that push comes to a shove
We've got a headfirst kind of love

All the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way
All the way you take me, take it
All the way you take me, take it
All the way
(You take me all the way)
All the way you take me, take it
All I want is more, you take me
All the way
All the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way you take me, all the way
All the way1Embed
