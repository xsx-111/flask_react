Nothing at All LyricsAnd you wait in the dark for the music to soothe you to sleep
You swallow your fears and become them eventually
You sit like King David watching women through windows and walls
You chase your desires until you find nothing at all
Until you find nothing at all
I shake my heavy head and find ways to shift the blame
I hate the rules but I still play the game
I got an eye on the prize and another on the clock on the wall
And I get what I want until I want nothing at all
Until I want nothing at all1Embed
