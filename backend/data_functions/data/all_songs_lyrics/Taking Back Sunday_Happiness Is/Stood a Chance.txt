Stood a Chance LyricsIt takes so long
You’re going forward looking back
A body like a welcome mat
You never even stood a chance (On your own)
A body like a welcome mat (On your own)
You’re going forward looking back
You never even stood a chance
You don’t want to know
You don’t want to know

You feel so safe, safe, safe being kept in the dark
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
‘Cause it's that same dark place where you'll get torn apart
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
On your own
On your own
("Hot damn! Tell me that don't feel good!")
It takes so long
You were never one for looking back
A body like a punching bag
You never even stood a chance
You don’t want to know (body like a punching bag)
You don’t want to know (you're never one for looking back)
You never even stood a chance on your own
You feel so safe, safe, safe being kept in the dark
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
‘Cause it's that same dark place where you'll get torn apart
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
You feel so safe, safe, safe being kept in the dark
You know you never stood a chance
You don't wanna know
Fat and happy straight to hell
In a body like a prison cell
Fat and happy straight to hell
In a body like a prison cell
Straight to hell
You know you never stood a chance

You feel so safe, safe, safe being kept in the dark
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
‘Cause it's that same dark place where you'll get torn apart
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance
And in that same dark place
I will tear you apart
You know you never stood a chance
You know you never stood a chance on your own
I am going to tear you apart1Embed
