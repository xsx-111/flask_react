Like You Do Lyrics
Came as a surprise
Whistles and bells
And although I was not asking
You offered up your help
And I ain't ever gonna find another one
I ain't ever gonna find another one

That does me like you did
Like you do
Like you've done
I was keeping to myself
Waiting on some train
When your heels click clacked the platform
To my heart they did the same
I ain't ever gonna find another one
I ain't ever gonna find another one

I may not always be the best man
But I'm going to always walk that line
I don't even know what I was saying
You went and changed your mind
As it wouldn't be the first time
You went and changed your mind
I ain't ever gonna find another one
I ain't ever gonna find another one
