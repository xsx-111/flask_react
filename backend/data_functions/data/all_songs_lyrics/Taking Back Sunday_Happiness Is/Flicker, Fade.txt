Flicker, Fade Lyrics
If you should change your name
I'd love you just the same
And if you should run away
I would save your place
Oh, you can go, go, go
If you want to
I wouldn't try and stop you
I couldn't say I blame you

Flicker, flicker, fade
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same
You wonder why it always ends the same

When I said I hate that song
About fire and sex you love
I couldn't tell you why
Why I did it, why I lied
I know it's wrong, wrong, wrong
(Wrong, wrong, wrong)
It's evil but true
That's what I want to make you
So I could say I blame you
So I could say I blame you
Flicker, flicker, fade
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same
Flicker, flicker, fade
Destroy what you create
And wonder why it always ends the same
You wonder why it always ends
You wonder why it always ends the same

You live your life
Like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role
You live your life
Like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role (Convince me)
You wonder why it always ends the same (Convince me)
You wonder why it always ends
Destroy what you create
You wonder why it always ends, it always ends the same
You live your life
Like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role
But since you live your life
Like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role (Playing a role)
(LIke you're not in control like you're-)
Flicker, flicker, fade
Destroy what you create
(Like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role
But since you live your life
Like you're not in control
Like you're playing a role)
And wonder why it always ends the same2Embed
