Better Homes and Gardens Lyrics
When you took that ring off, balled it in your fist
Eyes like a smoking gun
Surprised at what you did
Said "Don’t even think for a second you’re following me in
My parents are home, and so is my kid"
Just go on
That house that you hate
That house that we bought, and failed to make
When you took that ring off
I sat there stunned
Parked out in my car
Surprised by what you'd done
The courage that that must have took left me utterly speechless
And though it came as no surprise I still couldn’t believe it
You’ll never be happy
You’ll never be happy

But it was all for nothing
Yeah, it was all a waste
You held on tight and for dear life
But it was all for nothing

When you took that ring off
Threw it at your feet
You didn’t say a word
Much less look at me
The courage that that must have took
I just could not believe it
In that moment you were perfect
It made all that bullshit seem worth it
But it was all for nothing
Yeah, it was all a waste
You held on tight and for dear life
But it was all for nothing
Yeah, it was all a waste
You held on tight and for dear life
(Held on tight and for dear life)
But it was all for nothing
(Held on tight and for dear life
We held on tight and for dear life
We held on tight)

So just go on, that house that you hate
That house that we bought and failed to make
It was all for nothing, it was all a waste
And now you’ll never be happy
Oh, you’ll never be happy

'Cause it was all for nothing
Yeah, it was all a waste
You held on tight and for dear life
But it was all for nothing
Yeah, it was all a waste
You held on tight and for dear life
(Held on tight and for dear life)
But it was all for nothing
(Held on tight and for dear life
We held on tight and for dear life)
When you took off that ring
When you took off that ring
(Held on tight)2Embed
