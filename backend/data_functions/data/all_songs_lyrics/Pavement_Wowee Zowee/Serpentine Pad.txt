Serpentine Pad Lyrics
Frequently called numbers
Snoring when you slumber
Everyone knows you do
Why won't you admit it?
Screw you
And take it all
Force-fed integration
From the corporation
I don't need this
Corporation attitude

I believe I will never leave
Your serpentine pad

Darling, when you wake up
Better ask the grown-ups
If they have posed 'em twice
Leave them and they lead other lives
Think it might be another thing
That I would want to know
But I don't know if I should
If I could and if I would anyway
Well I believe I will never leave
Your serpentine padEmbed
