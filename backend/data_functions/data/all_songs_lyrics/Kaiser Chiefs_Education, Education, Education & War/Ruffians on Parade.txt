Ruffians on Parade Lyrics
I chew imaginary gum
I own a replica gun
When we play away from home
We send in the drones
I study military maps
It helps me relax
What an ending
With 'em sending in the droh-oh-oh-oh-ohns…
… oh-oh-oh-oh-ohns…

Ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa…
Ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa…oh-oh…
And at the last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
At weekly meetings, we go on parade

I write on the walls
Of urinals and stalls
When we play away from home
We send in the drones
I got the head of a stag
And a confederate flag
What an ending
With 'em sending in the droh-oh-oh-oh-ohns…
Ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa…
The ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa, oh-oh…
And at the last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
At weekly meetings, we go on parade…

We're never backing down
We'll never be alone again
We are never backing down
Even a million miles away from home

Ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa…
The ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa, oh-oh…
And at the last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
At weekly meetings, we go on parade…

Ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa…
The ruffians are on parade, whoa, whoa, oh-oh…
And at the last stand of the day
We lost more than we saved
And in the dark of the arcades
We spend more than we made
At weekly meetings, early evenings
After eating, we go on parade1Embed
