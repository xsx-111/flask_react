One More Last Song Lyrics
Roll the dice
Keep 'em guessing, asking questions
One more time!
Close the vice
Keep on pressing, teach 'em a lesson
Hold the line!

Don't let 'em through the door
Open any doors, I promise officer
We haven't broken any laws
(Well not the bad ones!)

More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more unto the breach

Cold as ice
Heavy heels, see through shields
Hold the line!
Shoulders high, seal the deal, spin the wheel
One more time!
Don't let 'em through the door
Open any doors, I promise officer
We haven't broken any laws
(Well not the bad ones!)

More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody taken to the streets
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more unto the breach
When every song is like the one more last song
Every song is like the one more last song
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
One more last song!

Don't let 'em through the door
Open any doors, I promise officer
We haven't broken any laws
(Well not the bad ones!)

More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more unto the breach
Where every song is like the one more last song
Every song is like the one more last song
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Ðžne more last song
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody take it to the streets
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
Everybody once more unto the breach
Where every song is like the one more last song
Every song is like the one more last song
More gimme more, I want more, ay, ay, ay
One more last song!
One more last song!
One more last song!
One more last song!1Embed
