The Factory Gates Lyrics
So this is the age of the train
All aboard for the labour exchange
My mind is running away with me
I'm a shop worn sales campaign
Trapped behind yellow cellophane
My mind is running away with

Everything I ever learned
Comes knocking at my head
What you thought was way too much is not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Til they can't break your will anymore
You are contractually tied to death's door

I never left the town I was made in
Whicker's World, I'm Michael Palin
My mind is running away with me
I record every one of my failings
By tying bread bags onto the railings
My mind is running away with
Everyone you ever loved
Comes knocking down your door
What you thought was way too much is not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Til they can't break your will anymore
You are contractually tied to death's door

Not enough, not enough
I want wider than this island
Not enough, not enough
I want brighter than a diamond
Everything you've ever known
Is in these city walls
What you thought was way too much, is not enough, it's not enough
And when you thought it's way too much it's not enough

They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
What you make on the factory floor
You take straight to the company store
They tell you day after day
To make your way through the factory gates
'Til they can't break your will anymore
You are contractually tied to death's doorEmbed
