My Life Lyrics
Sometimes you wanna get away from your life
Sometimes you wanna get away from the horizon
In your eyes
I've fallen off the bottom of your timeline
I know you've found a better way of spending your life
Well it's your life

I never want it, I didn't need it
Now it feels like this is my life
I never want it, I didn't need it
Now it feels like this is my life

I can work it out, I can live without the night
This is my life, this is my life
I can work it out, I can live without the night
This is my life, this is my life

I woke up in my clothes before the sunrise
I walk along the sand with my shoes in my hand to the daylight
And I realise
The fishermen are heading out to ocean
The caf√© owner turns on the urn, flips the sign round to open
And it goes on
I never want it, I didn't need it
Now it feels like this is my life
I never want it, I didn't need it
Now it feels like this is my life

I can work it out, I can live without the night
This is my life, this is my life
I can work it out, I can live without the night
This is my life, this is my life

You can tell we had a hell of a life
You can tell we had one hell of a time
You can see we had a colourful one from our eyes
You can tell there is another to come in our eyes
You can tell we had a hell of a life
You can tell we had one hell of a time
You can see we had a colourful one from our eyes
You can tell there is another to come

I can work it out, I can live without the night
This is my life, this is my life
I can work it out, I can live without the night
This is my life, this is my life1Embed
