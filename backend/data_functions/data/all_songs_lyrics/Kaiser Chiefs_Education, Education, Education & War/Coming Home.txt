Coming Home Lyrics
Do you wish you hadn't stayed all night?
Do you wish you hadn't gotten so high?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no
Gotta go

Do you wish it wasn't half past gone?
Do you wish you didn't last that long?
Do you wish you hadn't come?
Oh no
Gotta go
Gotta run

May I remind you, may I remind you
That you've got nowhere to go?
So I'm staying beside you
Standing beside you
'Til you find a way back home

We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down
And we're dancing on the finest line
Between the chance of the time of our lives
Wishing you were done
Oh no
Gotta run

And we're choosing not to make that choice
And we lose our shoes and voice
But we have alot of fun on the way
Wanna play?
Gotta come

May I remind you, may I remind you
That you got nowhere to go?
So I'm standing beside you, standing beside you
'Til you find our way back home

We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down
We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down

Then it all comes flooding back to me
Like a forgotten melody from a dream
Then it all comes flooding back to me
Like a forgotten melody from a dream
Then it all comes flooding back to me
Like a forgotten melody

We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down
We're coming home
We're coming home
Light a fire
We're coming home
We'll write it down
We'll write it all down1Embed
