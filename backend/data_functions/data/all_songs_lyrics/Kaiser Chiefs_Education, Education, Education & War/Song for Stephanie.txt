Song for Stephanie LyricsThere's signs of life in the generator
Fairy lights, but they're on for a second
Rattles come from the refrigerator
Static crackles on the record player
Song for Stephanie
You're the melody
Hold on to yesterday
Keep dancing with the one who brought you
Keep dancing with the ones that you both know
Keep dancing with the one who taught you to dance
Sing along with the ones you used to know
There's blood all up the radiators
My blood is scratched into chairs and tables
We Left our hats behind the leisure centre
Song for Stephanie
You're the melody
Hold on to yesterday
Keep dancing with the one who brought you
Keep dancing with the ones that you both know
Keep dancing with the one who taught you to dance
Sing along with the ones you used to know
Hold on together tightly
Hold on and promise you won't let go
Keep dancing when they bring the house lights on
Sing along with the ones you used to know
Keep dancing with the one who brought you
Keep dancing with the ones that you both know
Keep dancing with the one who taught you to dance
Sing along with the ones you used to know
Hold on together tightly
Hold on and promise you won't let go
Keep dancing when they bring the house lights on
Sing along with the ones you used to know
Keep dancing with the one who brought you
Keep dancing with the ones who you both know
Keep dancing with the one who taught you to dance
Sing along with the ones you used to know
Hold on together tightly
Hold on and promise you won't let go
Keep dancing when they bring the house lights on
Sing along with the ones you used to knowEmbed
