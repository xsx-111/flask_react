The Nerve LyricsYou've got the nerve, that's one thing
You've got the nerve, that's one thing, take it from me
Did you ever like it?
Did you ever really like it, like it?
I'll make the time, that's nothing
I'll make the time, that's nothing, I'll give it you
If you really want it
Tell me, do you really want it, want it?
(I don't mind) I didn't notice
(I don't find) I didn't know that
You did it on your own
I said you did it on your own
Have you got the balls to say that?
Have you got the balls to think that it's over to you
To decide when it's over?
I'll tell you when I think that it's over, over
I got in line and I'm waiting
I got in line and I'm waiting, I'm waiting for you
To pretend that you like me
To go outside and make believe that you like me, like me
(I don't mind) I didn't notice
(I don't find) I didn't know that
You did it on your own
You never did it on your own
I won't dance, not in these shoes
You got nerve
I can't dance, not in your shoes
You got the nerve
I won't dance, not in my work shoes
You got nerve
I can't dance, not in your shoes
You got the nerve
You've got the nerve, that's one thing
You've got the nerve, that's one thing, I'm thirty-five
And I really like it
I'm still alive and I really like it, like it
(I don't mind) I didn't notice
(I don't find) I didn't know that
You did it on your own
You never did it on your own
I won't dance, not in these shoes
You got nerve
I can't dance, not in your shoes
You got the nerve
I won't dance, not in my work shoes
You got nerve
I can't dance, not in your shoes
You got the nerve
You got nerve
You got the nerve
You got nerve
I won't dance, not in these shoes
You got nerve
I can't dance, not in your shoes
You got the nerve
I won't dance, not in my work shoes
You got nerve
I can't dance, not in your shoes
You got the nerveEmbed
