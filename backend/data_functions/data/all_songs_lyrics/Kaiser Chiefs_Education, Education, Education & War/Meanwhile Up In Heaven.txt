Meanwhile Up In Heaven Lyrics
Picture yourself by a rocket
Picture yourself in a glittering silver suit
Picture yourself getting on it
Saluting the news crews, you're the new recruit

Do you remember the numbers
Hung on the door of the house where you grew up?
Do you remember the colours
Tied round the handles of last year's FA cup?

Meanwhile up in Heaven
They're waiting for you, they're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you are ready to

Guided by love and a flashlight
Led by consuming desire for a good idea
The light in the clock on the dashboard
Has not worked in years but I know that it's still there

Meanwhile up in Heaven
They're waiting for you, they're waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Meanwhile up in Heaven
They're waiting for you, waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you
Are ready to
And your mind is the key
It is the key that sets you free
Oh your mind is the key
It is the key that sets you free

Meanwhile up in Heaven
They're waiting for you, waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you are ready to
Meanwhile up in Heaven
They're waiting for you, waiting for you
And if you believe them, you will see them when you are ready to1Embed
