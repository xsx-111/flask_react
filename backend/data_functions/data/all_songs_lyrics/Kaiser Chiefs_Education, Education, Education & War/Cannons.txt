Cannons Lyrics
Look alive
Pick a side
Draw a line in the sand
You're just the band

They treat us like we're extras in an epic
They treat us like we're mud on their boots
They leave us on the stretchers when the credits roll
Retreating safely to institutes
Where dinner party military forces
Toast themselves with the blood of us all
Smashing regimes between courses
Chanting "education, education, and war"

We're gonna need a lot more cannons
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas

I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there
They're making all the difficult decisions
Politicians and children first
Followed by their personal physicians who say
You will be happy if you expect the worse
Armed with paper straws and a bible
Lamps are going out across department stores
You will be issued with a rifle on arrival chaps
For education, education, and war

We're gonna need a lot more cannons
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas

I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there

I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there
Oh oh oh oh oh
Show us the way to go
Hell or Heaven help us
Show us the way to go
Save our souls
Show us the way back home
Save our souls
Show us the way to go

Quick time
Get in Line
Get behind the man in front
You're the grunts
Look alive
Pick a side
Draw a line in the sand
You're just the band

We're gonna need a lot more cannons
We're gonna need a lot more cannons
If you wanna be home by Christmas
If we're gonna be home by Christmas
I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there
I know there is another way
If you wanna see their face again
I know they feel the same way over there
Hello Heaven help us

The Occupation
The Occupation
The occupation of Damnation Eternal
Decreed by Commander in Chief
Won by the infantry, led by the Colonel
Came at costs that would beggar belief
As they marched upon the inferno
And the inﬁdels dropped to their knees
Millions of civilians crammed in pavilions
Came to watch it on big screen TVs
The population of Damnation Eternal
Went from millions to thousands to one
The survivor then wrote in his journal
"Why on Earth did it take them so long?"
Within weeks we constructed a pipeline
Within years we'll have run the place dry
It'll just about last us our lifetime
So it's hip hip hoorays and high ﬁves
On the factory ﬂoor there's a whisper
We built cannons before it began
But the engines still pumping its piston
And the turbine still whirring its fan
The assembly line spits out the surplus
Into purpose built lead lined white vans
Rockets stockpile as ministry workers
Fill their pockets with all that they can
Secret meetings are held in the senate
What to do with this excess supply
There's a plan to abandon the planet
One V.I.P at a time
So we get up each day and have breakfast
Read the news and the weather forecast
As we sit and we open our letters
And we pray that it won't be our last2Embed
