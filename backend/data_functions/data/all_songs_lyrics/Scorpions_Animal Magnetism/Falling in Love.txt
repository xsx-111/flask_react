Falling in Love LyricsI look in your eyes, I really think you're fooling me
You're pretty and nice, it doesn't matter don't you see
'cause I falling in love, it happens to me every day
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away
I'm falling in love
Ooh, oooh
I'm falling in love
Ooh, oooh
I'm falling in love
Ooh, oooh
Don't tell me your lies, I don't believe a word you say
You do realize, I move around from day to day
And I'm falling in love, it happens to me every day
I'm falling in love, love just seems to slip away
I'm falling in love
Ooh, oooh
I'm falling in love
Ooh, oooh
I'm falling in love
Ooh, oooh
I'm falling in loveEmbed
