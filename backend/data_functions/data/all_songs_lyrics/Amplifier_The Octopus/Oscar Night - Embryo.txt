Oscar Night / Embryo LyricsBig fuck off Hollywood
And the paradox of tolerance
The engineering of consent
An America for Americans
Preserved in amber
Like genes for dinosaurs
The dreams of the powerless
Death to Hollywood
Death to Hollywood
To Hollywood
There's a big fuck off Hollywood
In a church built by slaves
Where all glitters and twinkles
And hungry are all the poors* that you made
Where the weather's fine
And dark clouds all gather
For oscars and facelifts
Death to Hollywood
Death to Hollywood
Death to Hollywood
Let's put at an end to Hollywood
To HollywoodEmbed
