Bloodtest LyricsCrimson velvet from my arm
Slowly seeping, swirling down
A voice is speaking, please be calm
So deeply sleeping
'Cause ignorance is bliss
Your ignorance is bliss
From a hole I'm leaking, with a red alarm
My heart is slowly beating
God keeps us safe from harm
And just look I'm leaking moments
My blackest darkest moments
Secrets I'm releasing outwards
Please, don't become my dirty traitors
Everyone's made errors of judgement
Everyone's gone and made mistakes
Everyone's got a hidden secret
Everyone's done things they later regret
Symptoms include malaise, discomfort, and fatigue
Loss of appetite, loss of weight, sore throat, headache
Joint or muscle pain, night sweats, sores in the mouth, swollen lymph nodes
Diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, and nausea
Everyone's made errors of judgement
Everyone's gone and made mistakes
Everyone's got a hidden secret
Everyone's done things they later regret
Crimson velvet from my arm
Slowly seeping, swirling downEmbed
