Trading Dark Matter On The Stock Exchange LyricsHungry eyes all alone
In rainbow skies of glass and stone
Dipped into the acid test
So sharply dressed
Well, I would turn disciple
And testify in the whore crucible
Zeroed and hungry for more
Gotta get some
Only the sharpest of claws gets to hold on
With leisure times and bonuses
Cruising over the horizon
Well, that ship is never late
Chastisement with a velvet touch
Don’t hurt too much
Well, I would turn disciple
And testify in the diamond spyhole
Always still hungry for more
Gonna get some
Only the sharpest of claws gets to hold on
To no-one
So hold on
Just hold on
When one man bleeds on another man’s throne
And one man reaps what another has sown
On unknown seas
Would the business sink you down
Down to an all time low
To an all time low
To an all time low
To an all time low
To an all time low
An all time low
An all time low
An all time lowEmbed
