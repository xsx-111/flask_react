The Emperor LyricsFrom out of the vortex and into the big time
Gonna get me a facefull of oblivion
From under the wheels of the movers and shakers
Well, this could be your lucky day
Oh, this could be your lucky day
Impatient, impatient boys down
Impatient, impatient girls down
To keep searching on
Better go get a gun, go get a gun
To stay afloat on an ocean of sex and money
Well, this could be your lucky day
Impatient, impatient boys down
Impatient, impatient girls down
Impatient, step, well, you'd better bow down
Over the edge of devotion, the edge of devotion
Keep searching on
Keep searching
Keep searching
Keep searching
Keep searching
This could be your lucky day
This could be your lucky day
This could be your lucky day
This could be your lucky day
Keep searching onEmbed
