Interstellar LyricsGonna take a trip to a distant sun
And leave this planet far behind
And travel the road to kingdom come
Got a universe to sail across and across, now we’ve just begun
Now we’ve just begun
And stretching out ahead of me
Promised to eternal skies
To travel distant galaxies
Got a universe to sail across and across, like a jet black sea
Travelling faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Is the only way to be
Is the only way to be
We’ll go somewhere you may have been
Kick the engine to overdrive
Run faster than a laser beam
Got a universe to sail across and across, ’till the day I die
And riding high
’Cause I’ve got a universe to sail across and across, ’till the day I die
Travelling faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Is the only way to be
Is the only way to be
Travelling faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Is the only way to be
And the only possibility
To be truly free
Well, I know that you seek the control for the heart and the soulEmbed
