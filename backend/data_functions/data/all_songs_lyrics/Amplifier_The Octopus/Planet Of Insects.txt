Planet Of Insects LyricsJagged and broken
Look at your pieces
Splitting every nation
Of insect colonies
Save one to be destroyed
And one to be begun
Let the weaker bend
To the will of the strong
Well, you followed the swarm right out into space
And let all the buzz right out of this place
Send some to the south
You know you'll want to send one to the north
You'll send one to each house
Of hand to mouth and of humans and spawn
To be born
And all I know and ever see are insects crawling over me
Predating on their magic powers that radiate before their fingers
And though they'll try to suck me dry
They'll never manage to consume my feeling of overjoy, overjoy
Come let the masters feed in the fullness of time
And all I know and ever see are insects crawling over me
Predating on their magic powers that radiate before their fingers
And all I know and ever see are insects crawling over me
Predating on their magic powers that radiate before their fingers
Let the fuckers come and never come again
They're hunting everyone left from the planet of men
And all I know and ever see are insects crawling over me
Predating on their magic powers that radiate before their fingers
And though they try to suck me dry
They'll never manage to confuse my meaning of overjoy, overjoy
Come let the masters feed in the fullness of timeEmbed
