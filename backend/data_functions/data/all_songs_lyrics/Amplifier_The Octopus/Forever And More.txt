Forever And More LyricsI came alive in a burst of heavenly light
Climbed up the ropes to the stars
Cascaded in their fiery blast
Lost in the vast wilderness, drifting and alone
Naively in ignorance of woe and born running through infinite skies
Hold on
I’m coming from fire and ice burn strong in the devil inside of you
Well, what's new?
Now is the time to decide
Just who do you want to become?
Hold your head up to the sky, to the chapel on high
Down to your bone, to your core
Would you stand for
For forever and more
For forever and more
For forever and more
For forever and more
Is an open door
To step right through
To where have you gone
Have you found yourself where you once started from?
And rising your fist at the sun, you said, don’t make me come up there, my fiery one
With gunships and valkyries all geared up to go
Well, I know that shangri-la's not so far from here
So reach for the stars and you might grab one
There's supernovas left to ride on
They all dive right into you
Just like you
Well, now is the time to decide
Just who do you want to become?
Hold your head up to the sky, to the chapel on high
Down to your bone, to your core
Would you stand for
For forever and more
For forever and more
For forever and more
For forever and more
Is an open door
To step right through
To step right throughEmbed
