Interglacial Spell LyricsIce age cometh
Well, let the fanfares bloweth
Can't shake the feeling, been living on borrowed time
Today's revealing, right before my very eyes
And off to the cold icy palace, with the church and the office
I'm just a helpless apprentice, and I'm lost in the darkness, yes
Well, can't you tell that you've been hypnotized by a magic spell?
We did a runner from the diner. Now, who will pay the tithe?
So dry your eyes. Well, why the surprise?
Can't shake the feeling, been living on borrowed time
Today's revealing, right before my very eyes
Well, can't you tell that you've been hypnotized by a magic spell?
We did a runner from the diner. Now, who will pay the tithe?
So dry your eyes. Well, why the surprise?
With the lathe and the prism
In the frozen museum
Iâ€™m just a helpless apprentice
And it's cold in the darkness
It's cold in the darkness
It's cold in the darkness
It's cold in the darknessEmbed
