The Octopus LyricsIn the sinews of eternity
That fortune spins
Entwined within the DNA
That throbs beneath its skin
You'll fit so perfectly in
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go
Well, I dressed you in your uniform
You'll understand
Right from the moment you were born
A minion at my command
And when you hold my hand
I'll never let you go
From my arms
I'll never let you go
On a drip feed of euphoria
That's laid to waste
And feeding on the emptiness
Abiding in the human race
And when we embrace
I'll never let you go
From my arms
I'll never let you go
And once you hold my hand
I'll never let you go
From my arms
I'll never let you goEmbed
