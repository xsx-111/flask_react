Golden Ratio LyricsSome men would seek of all the treasures untold
Crave things that gleamed and all the riches and gold that a man could need
More than money to choke on, consumed by greed, and a hungry man must feed
They'd hunt you down, down, down
They'd hunt you down, down, down, down
They'd hunt you down
So run
Just run
Well, ha, fucking ha!
How did we end up here?
Some women who need opulence in this world
Whore themselves through for all the diamonds and pearls that a woman needs
More than honour to choke on, in word and deed, to let their animal feed
They'd hunt you down, down, down
They'd hunt you down, down, down, down
They'd hunt you down
So run
Just run
Well, ha, fucking ha!
Where do we go from here?
Well ha, fucking ha! Yeah!
Just where do we go from here?Embed
