Fall Of The Empire LyricsThesis and anthitesis
Go destroy your opposite
Dividing and conquering
Worked your fingers to the bone
Bring the creatures two by two
Money makers to the sword
Raised an empire there to leave
Standing for a thousand years
A thousand years
But who put the willing in their armies?
Who put the bloodlust in their servitude?
Who let the flame throwers on the playground?
Who turned the children to soldiers to follow you?
Are you waiting for the fall?
Well, isn't it about time?
It's so inevitable
You've come here with nothing at all
Fire and brimstone preacher man
Know that holy scriptures say
Eat alive the children and
Sail their souls away
Into the wilderness
Into virgin skulls and bones
Master of the unknown world
Until the day you die
The day you die
But who put the willing in their armies?
Who put the bloodlust in their servitude?
Who let the flame throwers on the playground?
Who turned the children into soldiers?
Who let corruption in the heartland?
And who are the killers in sheep's clothing?
Who wait to proclaim each new conversion?
Hail each seizure and those that follow you
Well, are you waiting for the fall?
Now isn't it about time?
It's so inevitable
You'll leave here with nothing at allEmbed
