Loveland LyricsLoveland, Loveland
I got a searchlight, I got a lovelight
Loveland
Beauteous isles of Loveland
Hey, hey I got it
I'm talkin' about love, whoa
Love, love power is the power of the hour, ho
Love power is the power of the hour, ho no hoa
I will show you all the shortcuts to Loveland
The Lovelake can get rough
Hey, hey I got it
I'm talkin' about love
Love, love power is the power of the hour, ho
Love power is the power of the hour, ho no hoa
Give me, give me your hand
And we'll steer a course to Loveland
The Lovelake can get rough
Air gets tense so waves get choppy
Embraces cold and kisses sloppy
Oh baby I got it, and you got it, love
I'm gonna take you to a place where
But tonight we'll make (wooo)
Oh, aw, man, man, man
Woo, say, ha, ha, woo
We got it, Love we got hoo
You wait, I'll open the gateEmbed
