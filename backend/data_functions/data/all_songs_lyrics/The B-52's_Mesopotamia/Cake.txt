Cake LyricsTake a little, take a little nip
Take a little sip, take a little more
Spread icing nice and thick between the layers
Ooh let it drip down the sides. Who cares
Done with the batter
I am watching it drip down the sides
(If you want a better batter better beat it harder.)
I am watching it drip down the sides
I said according to my recipe, you put it on a slow bake
According to my recipe, you put it on a slow bake
I am watching it drip down the sides
(If you want a better batter better beat it harder.)
I am watching it drip down the sides
I said according to my recipe, you put it on a slow bake
(Takes a long time for it to rise)
According to my recipe, you put it on a slow bake
(Let it drip right down the sides)
According to my recipe
(Who cares)
I can't wait to put the icing on the cake
I-I can't wait to put the icing on the cake
Caaaake
Hey, you know what I'd really like to do?
Say wha'?
I feel like makin' a cake
Ooh wah what kind of cake do you want?
Umm, how about ... pineapple upside-down cake?
Maybe a chocolate devil's food cake
Wah, nothin' like a chocolate devil's food cake
Ooh, how about an angel cake?
Umm, some cinnamon?
Yea, sure
Sugar?
Yea, uh huh. I swear
You got a pan the right size?
A pan?
It says in this cookbook it takes a long time to rise
I read that. Now, beware
Let's get this thing in the oven
Take a little, take a little nip
Take a little sip, take a little more
Spread icing nice and thick between the layers
Ooh let it drip down the sides. Who cares
Done with the batter
I am watching it drip down the sides
(If you want a better batter better beat it harder.)
I am watching it drip down the sides
I said according to my recipe, you put it on a slow bake
According to my recipe, you put it on a slow bake
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah ...
I can't wait to put the icing on the cake
Hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah ...
250 strokes to beat it, I just can't wait to eat itEmbed
