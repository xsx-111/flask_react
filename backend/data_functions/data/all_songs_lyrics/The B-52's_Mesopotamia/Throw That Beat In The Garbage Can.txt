Throw That Beat In The Garbage Can LyricsHere it comes again, drivin' me nuts
Can't control my feet or stop shakin' my butt
The neighbours are complaining, it's getting out of hand
Throw that beat in the garbage can
Toss that beat, beat, beat, beat
Toss that beat, beat, beat, beat
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
It's drivin' me crazy Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Stop that beat, it makes me apprehensive
Sweat ruins my clothes, they are very expensive
The neighbours are complaining, it's getting out of hand
Throw that beat in the garbage can
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop
It's drivin' me crazy Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Toss that beat, beat, beat, beat (repeat)Embed
