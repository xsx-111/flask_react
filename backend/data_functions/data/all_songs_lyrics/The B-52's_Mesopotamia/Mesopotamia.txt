Mesopotamia Lyrics
Turn your watch, turn your watch back
About a hundred thousand years
A hundred thousand years
I'll meet you by the third pyramid
I'll meet you by the third pyramid
Ah come on, that's what I want
We'll meet in Mesopotamia, oh oh-oh

(We're goin' down to meet) I ain't no student
(Feel those vibrations) Of ancient culture
(I know a neat excavation) Before I talk
I should read a book
But there's one thing I do know
There's a lot of ruins in Mesopotamia

Six or eight thousand years ago
They laid down the law
Six or eight thousand years ago (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha)
They laid down the law (Ha-ha ha)

I'll meet you by the third pyramid
I'll meet you by the third pyramid
Ah come on, that's what I want, we'll meet
In Mesopotamia, oh oh-oh
(We're goin' down to meet) Now I ain't no student
(Feel those vibrations) Of ancient culture
(I know a neat excavation) Before I talk
I should read a book (Mesopotamia, that's where I wanna go)
But there's one thing that I do know (Mesopotamia, that's where I wanna go)
There's a lot of ruins in Mesopotamia

Six or eight thousand years ago (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha)
They laid down the law (Ha-ha ha)
Six or eight thousand years ago (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha)
They laid down the law (Ha-ha ha)
In Mesopotamia (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha)
They laid down the law (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha)
In Mesopotamia (Ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha-ha ha)Embed
