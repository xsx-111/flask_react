Nip It In The Bud LyricsOh Wo Oh Nip it in the bud
No Wo Oh Nip it in the bud
Oh Wo Oh I say 'Froze you'
No Wo Oh Nothin' I can do
Can't, oh oh, can't give it in Ho Oh Oh Woooah
Wo Oh Oh Nip it in the bud
Wo Oh Oh Nip it in the bud
You lock me out, you lock me out, huh
Lock me out, ah, lock me out
Nip it in the bud, I don't know
Give it a shove, hey hey
Head 'em up, head 'em up
Move 'em out, move 'em out, hooah
I'm no fool!
Ain't got no place to go
I don't know, I don't care
If you just go on and get me there
Oh, I don't want to ruffle your feathers
I don't care if you don't go
I'll just go do and beware ho oh ho oh
Nip it in the bud Wo Oh Oh
Give it a shove
Hey you gotta head 'em up, move 'em out hooah
Ahhhh, come take me away
Say, come take me away
Nip it in the bud...Embed
