Burning Inside LyricsWill these dreams still follow me
Out of dark obscurity?
Can't you see it up in the sky
As it kicks you in the face and sucks you dry
You never had the answers
And now you tell me the facts of life
I really couldn't be bothered with you
Get out of my face and watch me die
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Absolution and a frozen room
Are the dreams of men below
I try to grab it but the touch is hot
The mirror collapses, but the image can not
I'm scared of the darkness in light
I scare myself because I know I'm right
I see the evil in your savage eye
As it cuts right through the sky
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Calling a mantra with a blade in the skin
For the demons within
I feel the pain is the death and decay
But the lesson never fades away
Too little shadows, turn them away
You throw the man through the window pane
Another slave and a victim of fate
Another lesson in hate
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!
Burning inside! Burning inside!1Embed
