Thieves LyricsThieves, thieves and liars, murderers
Hypocrites and bastards
In laughter (get up!)
(Get up! get on your feet!)
Hey, thanks for nothing!
Morals in the dust (morals in the dust)
Two-faced (two-faced) bastards and sycophants
No trust
(We are fighting for the liberation of minds, not for the liberation of this pig, and racist society)
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
Which side today? Which side today?
Which side of the mouth do you spread your decay?
Which side today? Which side today?
Which side of the grass is greener?
Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
You're like a great big fucking gun
Just waiting to get squeezed!
(We're gonna rip this motherfucker off
We're gonna tear this motherfucker down)
(Get up!)
(Get up, get on your feet!)
Breathe, forfeit erection!
Toxic load injection
Geriatric fuck-face
With syphilitic mind
(I hope they realize that this is their last goddamn chance)
(Kill him!)
(Kill, kill, kill)
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Thieves! Liar!
Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, we don't know
Which side today? Which side today?
Which side of the mouth do you spread your decay?
Which side today? Which side today?
Which side of the grass is greener?
Inside, outside, which side, you don't know
My side, your side, their side, no one knows
You're like a great big hit of acid
Waiting to be taken!
(Power to the people)
(Power to the people)
(Police officer!)
(Kill, kill, kill!)
(You will not kill!)
(I want peace)
(Do you want peace?)
(I can't hear you!)
(I still can't hear you!)3Embed
