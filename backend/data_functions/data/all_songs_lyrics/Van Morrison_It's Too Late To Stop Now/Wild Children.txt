Wild Children LyricsWe were the wild children
1945
When all the soldiers came marching home from war
With love looks in their eyes, in their eyes
Tennessee, Tennessee Williams
Let your inspiration flow
Let it be around when we hear the sound
Of the springtime rivers flow, rivers flow
Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando
Standing with their heads bowed on the side
Cryin' like a baby thinkin' 'bout the time
James Dean took that fatal ride, took that ride
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Tennessee Williams
Let your inspiration flow
Let it be around to hear the sound
When the springtime, springtime rivers flow, rivers flow
And Steiger and Marlon Brando
With their heads bowed on the side
Cryin' like babies thinkin' 'bout the time
James Dean took that fatal ride, took that ride
And we were the wild children
19, 1945
When all the soldiers came marching home from war
With love looks, love looks in their eyes, in their eyes, in their eyes
In their eyesEmbed
