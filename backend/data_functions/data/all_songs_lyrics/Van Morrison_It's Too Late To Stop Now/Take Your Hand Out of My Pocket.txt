Take Your Hand Out of My Pocket LyricsTake your hand outta my pocket, baby
I ain't got nothin' left to loan to you
Take your hand outta my pocket
I ain't got nothin' left to loan to you
If you don't take your hand out
I'm gonna call the police on you
I got hip to your record
The first thirty-five seconds I got in town, now
I got hip, hip to your record
The first thirty-five seconds that I got in town
If you don't take your fingers off my wallet
I believe the man, is gonna take you down, now
Whoa, yeah
Play the blues, n' blow
Jack Schroer on the saxaphone
Applause
I don't mean anybody no harm
I just want what belong to me
I don't mean no one, no harm, no-no
I just want, just want what belong to me
So, if ya take your hand outta my pocket, hu!
I'll ask the judge to set you free
Oh yeah
Yeah, thank you very much
