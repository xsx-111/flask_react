Here Comes the Night LyricsOooh, here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh-yeah
I can see right out my window
Walkin' down the street my girl with another guy
Arms around her like it used to be with me
Oh, it makes me wanna die
Hey, well here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa-oh-oh-yeah
I can see him turning down the lights
Now he's holdin' her the way I used to do
Used to do, used to do
I can see her talkin' 'round an' tellin' them lies
Exactly like she told me, too
Whoa, here it comes
Here comes the night
Here comes the night
Whoa-oh-oh-yeah
Well
Oh, there they go
It's funny how they look so good together
Wonder what is wrong with me?
Why can't I accept the fact
She's chosen him and simply let them be?
Let them be
Well, here it comes
Good God, here comes the night
Here comes the night
Lonely, lonely, lonely, night
Give it to me lonely
Give it to me lonely
Give it to me lonely
Give it to me lonely
Tellin' me I'm lonely
Tellin' me the lone
The lonely, lonely night
Give it to me lonely
Give it to me lone
Give it to me lone
Give it to me lonely
I will be alone
Give it to me lone
Tell in me the lonely nights
Here comes the night
Oh-whoa-whoa-oh, yeah-yeah
Thank you very muchEmbed
