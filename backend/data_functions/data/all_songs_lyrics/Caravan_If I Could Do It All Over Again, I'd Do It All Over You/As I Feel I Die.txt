As I Feel I Die Lyrics
-----
With a song on my mind
I'm thinking of you
Through the dreams of a million eyes
I'll stand still with you
And wait till I find
The world that you're searching for
A cloud-coloured blind
Has entered my eyes
And everything's going
A slight shade of purple
But me, I don't mind
Today is my day
I'm living the life that I choose
I've found a way

-----

I can see a noser
Sit there all alone
And dream I'm sitting here
While magic fires the moon
I turn around my mind
And bid farewell to fear

Swimming through a wish
That I know I'm in a dream
I'm changing the music by ear

I'll have to leave behind
To re-ensure them in
And wanting oh so clear
Deep inside of time
I catch my breath to find
I've got so far to go
Howlin' through the trees
A cry which is my ears
I turn around and go

Following the dream
Is not the easiest thing
Out of the shadows I see
And blackened till the moon
A magic creature moves
And says belongs to me
