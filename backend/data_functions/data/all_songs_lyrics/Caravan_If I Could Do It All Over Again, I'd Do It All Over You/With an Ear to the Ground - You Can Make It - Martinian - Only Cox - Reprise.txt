With an Ear to the Ground / You Can Make It / Martinian / Only Cox / Reprise Lyrics
Would you like to ride with me
While you're waiting for the band to come?
Can tell me all you'd like to see
While you're waiting for the band to come
Would you make me take me slightly for you
If we talked about your pride and swollen gladness too?

You and I our only need
Waiting for the band to come
Searching for someone to see
And hoping that the band will come
Chemistries attention taste in your mind
And the thought that puzzled me you may be left behind
Would you like to ride with me
While you're waiting for the band to come?
Searching for someone to see
And hoping that the band will come
Would you make me take me slightly for you
If we talked about your pride and swollen gladness too?

Would you believe it possible
To leave yourself behind?
Turning upside down inside out
Now someone else my mind
Help me, someone
Someone please help me
So, where but for you would I
Dreaming, make your face my eyes
Turning so slow, taking care
Just a smile I do for you
So wipe away all those fears
I'm longing to feel the years go slipping by
While you stand, mind in hand with me, with me

Would you like to ride with me
(Would you like to ride with me?)
While you're waiting for the band to come?
(We're waiting for the band)
Can tell me all you'd like to see
(You can tell me what to see)
While you're waiting for the band to come?
Would you make me take me slightly for you
If we talked about your pride and swollen gladness too?Embed
