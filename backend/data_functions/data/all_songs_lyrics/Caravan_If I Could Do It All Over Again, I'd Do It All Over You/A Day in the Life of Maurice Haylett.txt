A Day in the Life of Maurice Haylett LyricsThe little man who rang
And danced while he sang
Sits in the back of my head
He wears Navy Blue
And he knows what to do
When he meets with his lady friend
He came home yesterday
From a trip far away
Tells me I've got a new face
And it wasn't my fault
The day he got caught
Speeding on mind's highwayEmbed
