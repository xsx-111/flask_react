Lost in a Lost World LyricsI woke up today
I was crying
Lost in a lost world
So many people are dying
Lost in a lost world
Some of them are living an illusion
Bounded by the darkness of their minds
In their eyes
It's nation against nation against nation
With racial pride
Sad hearts they hide
Thinking only of themselves
They shun the light
(Shun the light)
They think they're right
(Think they're right)
Living in their empty shells
Oh, can you see their world is crashing
(So many people, so many people)
Crashing down around their feet
Angry people in the street
Telling them they've had their fill
Of politics that wound and kill
Grow
The seeds of evolution
(So many people, so many people)
Revolution never won
It's just another form of gun
To do again what they have done
With all our brothers' youngest sons
(So many people, so many people)
Everywhere you go you'll see them searching
Everywhere you turn you'll feel the pain
Everyone is looking for the answers
We'll look again, come on my friend
Love will find us in the end
Come on my friend
(On my friend)
We've got to bend
(Got to bend)
On our knees and say a prayer
Oh, can you feel the world is pining
(So many people, so many people)
Pining for someone
Who really cares enough to share his love
With all of us so we can be
An ever loving family
Have we forgotten we're all children
(So many people, so many people)
Children from a family tree
That's longer than a centipede
Started long ago when you and I
Were only love
(So many people, so many people)
I woke up today
I was crying
Lost in a lost world
So many people are dying
Lost in a lost world
So many people, so many people
People lost in a lost world
So many people, so many people
People lost in a lost world. . Embed
