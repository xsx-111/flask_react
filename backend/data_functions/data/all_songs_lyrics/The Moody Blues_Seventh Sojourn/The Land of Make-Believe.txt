The Land of Make-Believe LyricsWe're living in a land of make believe
And trying not to let it show
Maybe in that land of make believe
Heartaches can turn into joy
We're breathing in the smoke of high and low
We're taking up a lot of room
Somewhere in the dark and silent night
Our prayer will be heard
Make it soon
So fly little bird
Up into the clear blue sky
And carry the word
Love's the only reason why
Open all the shutters on your windows
Unlock all the locks upon your doors
Brush away the cobwebs from your day-dreams
No secrets come between us anymore
Oh, say it's true
Only love can see you through
You know what love can do to you
We're living in a land of make believe
And trying not to let it show...
Maybe in that land of make believe
Heartaches can turn into joy
We're breathing in the smoke of high and low
We're taking up a lot of room
Somewhere in the dark and lonely night
Our prayer will be heard
Make it soon
So fly little bird
Up into the clear blue sky
And carry the word
Love's the only reason why...
Open all the shutters on your windows
Unlock all the locks upon your doors
Brush away the cobwebs from your day-dreams
No secrets come between us anymore
Oh, say it's true
Only love can see you through
You know what love can do to youEmbed
