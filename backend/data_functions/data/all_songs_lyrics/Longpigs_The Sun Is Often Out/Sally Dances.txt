Sally Dances LyricsBaby
Sometimes
I coulda turned you on
Honey
This time
With your big strong hands
Baby
Somehow
If I could chop them off
Honey
I'm stuck
But you could clear me out
But I needed
A summertime
Saw you falling
Saw you drown
Sally dances but she don't know no
Sally dances but she don't grow no
She can't show me
If
Somehow
I could make you feel clean
In my arms
If I could stop you shaking
Baby
Till then
I'll keep it in my hand
Cause you needed
A summertime
Saw you falling Saw you down
Sally dances but she don't grow no
Takes her chances but she don't grow no
Sally dances but she don't know no
She don't show me how
Baby
Somehow
If I could find the point
Honey
I'm too fat
To get up off my ass
And I'm jealous want to feel her fuck
Give me presents and glisten
Sally dances but she don't know no
Sally dances but she don't blow
Sally prances but she don't grow no
Sally chances but she don't know no
She don't blow no, no
Baby
With your big strong hands
I can feel the sun
You make me understandEmbed
