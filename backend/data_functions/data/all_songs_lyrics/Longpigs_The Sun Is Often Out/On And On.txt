On And On LyricsAll the songs that I've sung you
More often than you know
'Cause you're the love that I've clung to
More often than I've let it show
And then I wish you would leave me
And then I wish you would go
And then I wish you didn't need me
And I wish I didn't love you so
'Cause I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No, I won't do you harm
My love for you goes on and on
There's no one else I want beside you
Give me your coldest shoulder to cry upon
You're never anywhere I find you
You're never anything I rely upon
And then I wish you would leave me
And then I wish you would go
And then I wish you didn't need me
And then I wish I didn't know
That I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No, I won't do you harm
My love for you goes on and on and on and on
No, I just can't go on
So please don't do me wrong
No, I won't do you harm
'Cause my love
Goes on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And onEmbed
