Sleep LyricsGood to watch you sleep at night
Rushing all your life
Nice to have you near to me
Good to feel your sighs
But one of these days
You're sure to be gone
And I'll have to carry on
Without you
It's nice to watch you sleep so deep
Damp and gentle there
And I'd almost call you baby now
Lick and smell your hair
But how can I trust
You're really in love
And I have to carry on
Without you
So shut off your mind
And sleep my love
Driftingless and dream
Tomorrow is too near my dove
Tell me where you've been
'Cause one of these days
You're sure to be gone
And I'll have to carry on
Without you
Without youEmbed
