Dozen Wicked Words LyricsTry not to need her I'm not a believer
A look in your eye makes me satisfied
Stare at this head lies asleep on my shoulder
Opens her eyes as I start to cry
A larger part the need to be burnt
Justify this excellent girl
One dozen wicked words to find
I know we'll start again sometimes
Peace with my stomach the sky is inside her
Open the window to let her breathe
Patch up the scars with some cardboard and karma
Trust this is far beyond what I need
Turn around to eat for I will
Blind myself to joyfully kill
One dozen wicked words to find
I know we'll start again sometimes
I'm starting to fall
This is starting to break me down
Turn around to eat for I will
Blind myself to joyfully thrill
These dozen wicked words to find
I know we'll start again
A larger part the need to be burnt
Justify this excellent girl
One dozen wicked words to find
I know we'll start again sometime
One dozen wicked words to find
I know we'll start again sometimeEmbed
