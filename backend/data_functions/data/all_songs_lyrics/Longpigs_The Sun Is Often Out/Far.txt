Far LyricsI never had a moment anybody waits in line
But I'd kill for this feeling better than sin
Seen you drenched in rubber pushing at your clothes so frightening
You made for the day you're getting out
Far, and I'm in love again
Far, cause I'm going to wear it out
Far, and I'm in love again
Far cause I know no-ones going to show you how, but I found out
I never thought to question leather in a wholesome way
But it's growing in my brain now put it away
Dressed you in cardboard box to suit the time of day
But I never get the chance to wear it out
Far, and I'm in love again
Far, cause I'm going to wear it out
Far, and I'm in love again
Far cause I know no-ones going to show you how, but I found out
No ones going to tell you why, but I've got my skin to hold me up
Completely disgraceful, your crying is watering something
Far, and I'm in love again
Far, cause I'm going to wear it out
Far, and I'm in love again
Far cause I know no-ones going to show you how, but I found out
Far, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your crying is watering someting
Your crying is watering itEmbed
