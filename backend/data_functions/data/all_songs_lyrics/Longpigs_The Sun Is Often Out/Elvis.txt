Elvis LyricsCrawled out of the park to eat her took a
Stairwell would I fall to please her
Just to tear this out of my belly forever
Cause I'm still hooked to the light forever
I can do it if you're there
And it's only when you're there
Bless them with the arrogant brandos
Leave your heart stitched in a hundred pieces
If it's not wet then you shouldn't be doing it
She's no bitch she's far too rich
And I can do it when you're there
And it's only when you're there
All these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said a sensations
Are as perfect as sturbation
Hardly needs to be nailed as frustration
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be soiled
You wash yourself
You wash yourself
And I wash myself
You wash yourself
End up in a young hair
Curled round with a finger
I can't excuse this
It's all fucked
But if you're there
I can screw it when she's here
I can rule the world six times over
With my head burned out
And my body on hold
I can do it if you're there
And it's only when she's there
All these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said
All these amazing sensations
Such a virgin celebration
Never needs to be soiled
You wash yourself
You wash yourself
And I wash myself
You wash yourself
The whole world joins the French foreign legion
Get a new suit for the man who discovered Elvis
Was so fat when he died and ascend to heaven
I live here in my watered down Disney baby
With ten million attic clad genius
Abort me cos I have to compete
And maybe one man will eventually spit on mars
Save us
If you're there
Only if she's there
I can do it if you're there
I can do it when she's there
You can screw when she's there
You can screw when she's there
All these amazing frustrations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said
(Ooh these amazing frustrations)
(Such a perfect celebration)
(Hardly need to be said)
Ooh these amazing frustrations
You're a virgin celebration
Hardly needs to be dead
(All these amazing frustration)
(Such a perfect celebration)
(Only needs to be said)
All these amazing sensations
Such a perfect celebration
Hardly needs to be said
(All these amazing frustration)
(Such a perfect celebration)
(Only needs to be said)Embed
