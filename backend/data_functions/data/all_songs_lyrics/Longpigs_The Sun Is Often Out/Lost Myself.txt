Lost Myself Lyrics
She sold herself on the one love
The one that most of us live without
And dressed for the occasion day after day
Forgives herself when it don't come

I have always found it easier to dream about it
Careful of the stitches, insisted there was more than this

And I lost myself, I cannot speak
To live by myself I am far too weak
I have lost myself and I cannot sleep
To live by myself I am far too weak

Went bold as hell for the one love
The one that most of us read about
And caressed all the persuaders day after day
Relieves herself when it don't come

By the things you're saying, it's easier to turn the blame in
Careful of the stitches, insisted there was more than this
But I lost myself, I cannot speak
To live by myself I am far too weak
I have lost myself and I cannot sleep
To live by myself I am far too weak

Sold again on the one love
The one that all of them scream about
She's broke her wings on the one love
Her heart's so warm but it's burn she wants

I have always found it easier to skirt around it
Careful of the stitches, she insisted there was more than this

But I lost myself, I cannot speak
To live by myself I'm far too weak
I have lost myself and I cannot sleep
To live by myself I am far too weak3Embed
