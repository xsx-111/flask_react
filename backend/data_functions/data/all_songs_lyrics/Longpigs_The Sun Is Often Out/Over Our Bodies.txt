Over Our Bodies Lyrics
Nobody matters and this is depressing me
I know a strange one could change all of this
But they two are lovers
They carry each other, and
No one on earth would explain

But she's found another
Some fool she claims who will love her

So come on and rain
Take these and fall
Over our bodies
Come on and rain

I count my losses 'cause all stars are horses, and
How such a weak friend could soften her heart
But they two are lovers, they
Carry each other, and
No one earth could complain, it is

That she's found another
Some fool she claims who will love her
So come on and rain
Take these and fall
Over our bodies
Please, come on and rain
Come on and rain
Take this and form
Over our bodies
Please, come on and rain
I shot myself down
I shot myself down, oh
It tears me apart
She laps it all up
It's all done with mirrors
It's all done before
And good comes from everything
Bob Dylan's a Christian, Yeah

No one's succeeded
To pull the stars out of the skies
The way you did
No one preceded
In pulling lives out of my arms
The way it is now

Paint her with flowers
Fill her with fluff
Hope you make her shine
Hope she shines for you
Where I failed myself
If he loves you moreEmbed
