All Hype Lyrics
And I am living
Without the love of Jesus in my eyes
But it's easier to swallow than collide
Your way above the lows and sold your highs
(All hype)
When suddenly they strip it when you try
(All height)
I still don't get the joke but never mind
(All hype)
(All height)

But you're gonna fall down
Yeah, you're gonna fall down
And you're gonna be round
And you're gonna see

That I am leaving
The light of baby Jesus far behind
For one with history leaking from her eyes
As always things get tense when things are taught
Twisted and distort

But you're gonna fall down
Yeah, you're gonna fall down
And you're gonna be round
And you're gonna see
And oh, for heaven's sake
I needed you today
And never having been
The country side's obscene
I understood the part
But only, only one
You've given up the choice
Why don't she dig my voice

And I believe in
The biggest touted answer to the lie
But always when it's caught you in the eye
'Cause otherwise it is that I don't mind
(All hype)
