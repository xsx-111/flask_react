Happy Again LyricsI have got no money - I'm prostituting
This situation is a mess
And I get this feeling I'm turning trendy
I can't stand the sight of my face
Be realistic - just think it over
Cause I'm sure you'll make the right move
I think its better - come from the inside
I'm sure there is room to improve
And it seems kinda hard thinking like I am
Seems like it is started again - oh no
I better get my head between these knees
Just as fast as I can - seems like a comfortable end
And I wanna be happy again
And then your stinking bout of lies you lie in
And the why's you need and you better believe
Your gonna walk fast, walk thro' the middle
Try yourself then your gonna find out
That you've tried it all before and it don't work
You try a little more and it all works out
And it seems kinda hard thinking like I am
Seems like its started again - oh no
I better get my head between my knees
Just as fast as I can - seems like a comfortable end
And I wanna be a hippy again
To take away the end is over turn and run to me
Because you need a spastic taxi for the cow milk
I don't get the joke, I don't get the joke
I don't get the joke, I don't get the joke
And it's all fine
That makes me think so beautiful wake upEmbed
