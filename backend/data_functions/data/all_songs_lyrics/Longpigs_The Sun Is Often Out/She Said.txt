She Said LyricsAnd there's no clothes I can buy make me feel like myself, she said
So I put on clothes to make me look like someone else, instead
And as a matter of fact, I don't like to be seen
'Cause I'm not satisfied with myself, she said (You'd better hit her)
She said (She said)
She said (She said)
She said (She said)
She's dead
There's no perfume I can buy make me smell like myself, she said
So I put on perfume to make me smell like someone else in bed
And as a matter of fact, I don't like to be scented
'Cause I don't like to smell myself, she said (You'd better hit her)
She said (She said)
She said (She said)
She dead (She's dead)
She said
I'm not afraid of being more than pretty
But you're getting paid
To wind yourselves up until you drop
Yeah
There's no one I can talk to like I talk to myself, she said
So I play games to make them think I'm someone else, it's inbred
And as a matter of fact, I don't like to be seen
'Cause I'm not satisfied with myself, she said (You'd better hit her)
I'm not afraid of being more than pretty
While you're getting paid
To wind yourselves up until you drop
She said (She said)
She said (She said)
She's dead (She's dead)
She's dead
And it's ingrained (She said)
She said (She said)
She's trade (She said)
She's played (She said)
I've fucked up inside my own head
What the fuck am I doing in a place like this?
I know exactly why I'm here
Rape meEmbed
