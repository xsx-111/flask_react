September Gurls LyricsSeptember gurls do so much
And for so long, 'til we touched
I loved you, boy, never mind
I've been crying all the time
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad, woo
September gurls, I don't know why
How can I deny what's inside?
Even though I keep away
They will love all our days
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
When I get to bed, late at night
That's the time he makes things right
Ooh, when he makes love to me, ooh
September gurls do so much
And for so long, 'til we touched
I loved you, boy, never mind
I've been crying all the time
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad
December boys got it bad, woo
Ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
