Not Like You LyricsBusted down and broken all in two
But you never thought
This would happen to you
Wake up and stumble, trip and fall
You had so much
And now you've lost it all
How could you do it
It's not like you
To be the one to lose
Why did you do it
It's not like you
But I'll be around for you
Such a sad and sorry twist of faith
You tried to change but it's too late
If you ever find out what you'll do
Well, then it'll all come back to you
How could you do it
It's not like you
To be the one to lose
Why did you do it
It's not like you
But I'll be around for you
Busted down and broken all in two
But you never thought
This could happen to you
Wake up and stumble, trip and fall
You had so much
And now you've lost it all
How could you do it
It's not like you
To be the one to lose
Why did you do it
It's not like you
But I'll be around for youEmbed
