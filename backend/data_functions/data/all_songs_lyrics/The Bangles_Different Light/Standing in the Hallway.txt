Standing in the Hallway LyricsStanding in the hallway
Trouble coming my way
He called me on the telephone
Guess I'm gonna be alone
Where did our love go, where did it go
Love is such a puzzle in this great big world
I'm good to you, but you're bad to me
Gotta try to lose, gotta try
Gotta lose this misery
Tried to do it your way
You wouldn't meet me half way there
You used to say you love me
Now you just sit and stare
Where did our love go, where did it go
Love is such a pain in this great big world
I'm good to you, but you're bad to me
Gotta try to lose, gotta try
Gotta lose this misery
If you wanna keep me here
You better try to make it clear
'Cause I'm half way out the door
I can't take it anymore
Where did our love go, where did it go
Love is such a gamble in this great big world
I'm good to you, but you're bad to me
Gotta try to lose, gotta try
Gotta lose this miseryEmbed
