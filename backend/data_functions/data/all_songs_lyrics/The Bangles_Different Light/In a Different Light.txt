In a Different Light LyricsI see you in a different light
I wanna make a movie
I wanna put you on the silver screen
Sit in a darkened room
And look at you from the distance
Wanna write a novel
Freeze all your expressions into words
I come back later
And read about what I should have heard
I see you in a different light
I wanna paint your portrait
And hang on your colors on my wall
Discussing form and content
With my friends and drinks
And noone thinks at all
I see you in a different lightEmbed
