Following LyricsYou think I'm crazy or something
Always following you around
You say I'm a hopeless case
Run an obsession into the ground
You call me a loser
You call me a shadowing fool
Look over your shoulder
And you say I'm haunting you
So, why do you call me?
Why do you look for me?
Why do your eyes follow me the way they do?
You hold me responsible
Yes, so I stand accused
Of causing all the trouble after highschool
Between him and you
Yeah, you call me a loser
You call me a shadowing fool
But I was a good girl
Yeah, till you taught me
What it means to be true
So, why do you call me?
Why do you look for me
Why do your eyes follow me the way they do?
Why do you call me?
I know you look for me
Why do your eyes follow me the way they do?Embed
