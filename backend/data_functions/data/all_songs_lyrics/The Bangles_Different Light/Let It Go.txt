Let It Go LyricsOne thing or another
Your head is filled with questions
Sights and sounds
Distractions always gets you down
Turn around
Trying to remember
Where you were the day before
North and south and east and west
Where to go
When it's over, when it's done
Let it go
Frightened by the numbers
All the possibilities
Changing minds you hope to find
One more dream to remind you
What is lost can always be regained
When it's over, when it's done
Let it goEmbed
