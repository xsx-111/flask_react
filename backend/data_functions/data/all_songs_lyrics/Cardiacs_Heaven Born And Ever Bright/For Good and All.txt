For Good and All LyricsLost my chance and lost my home
Lost my energies hole
Leaves me bod and leaves me soul
Leaves me lingering whole
Leaves me lingering whole
She sustains cruel delicate care
For all her daughters feathers and fur
Unite as one to march at our side
To find the place where is to lie
Leaf and bark bone and hair
Turn to seed 'neath her stare
Seed to burst soar and rise
Ours for love is the care
Tending each everywhere
And she turns her water slow
Across her face all creatures glow
Heaven holds her breath to dear
To shake the shade from all of our fear
And put to rest another year
Timelike pulse shakes fierce through chain
With banks spread calm to reach her flame
And all is hushed through foul and din
Save for the whir and chime within
Prying eyes it's what you need
A friend that hides is friend indeed
It leaves me bod It leaves me soul
And leaves me lingering whole
Lost my chance and lost my home
Lost my energies hole
Leaves me bod and leaves me soul
Leaves me lingering whole
Leaves me lingering whole
She sustains cruel delicate care
For all her daughters feathers and fur
Unite as one to march at our side
To find the place where is to lie
Leaf and bark bone and hair
Turn to seed 'neath her stare
Seed to burst soar and rise
Ours for love is the care
Tending each everywhere
Thoughts and things devoid of soul
Unwind all creatures from the coil
We cast our coals to star the sky
And rake our ashes heaven high
All species come to bring her near
Above and below the horizon
Hung rich with dreams to wreath her brow
For good and all to recall
All species come to bring her near
Above and below the horizon
Hung rich with dreams to wreath her brow
For good and all to recallEmbed
