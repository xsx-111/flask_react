Goodbye Grace LyricsOnce in a day
Put a hand to a heart and a heart beats a path for a soul
Driving me mad
A love of a life goes it snap and I'm glad
And I say I'll have it here for just a harmless faker
Though mass hysteria here even affects me
Funny feeling you say and shown me
And I want it to be mine
And if it's not someone else's it's bound to be mine and I...
You wanted it too didn't you dear?
Yes say goodbye, yes say goodbye, say goodbye
And then I can't settle down
'S like if you park down grace like standing
Appeal to a dog
Never he mind
Stick it up grace like, a bother he minds
And I want it to be mine
And if it's not someone else's, well then it's bound to be mine
Happy to take
I say hello and I snap and I break it
And it's because it is there with all the flies sink my hand
Like it floating it stand and it
Stinks the blood out comes his eyes
Out comes his nose and...
You wanted it too didn't you dear? You know we say you tear
Then he broke it up and he snap it ribbons AY! AY! AY! AY!
Burn it in the bin in the kitchen
Say goodbye yes, say goodbye say
Goodbye grace, lost my face, 
Burn it shrivelled in the human waste
And then I can't settle down and all the flies from the dog
Stinks the blood comes his eyes, comes his eyes, comes the fur
Comes the ugly dog, HIDE!
Other skills in the hands of me
And I'm in like I am
And catch as just can
And kind as ever
Put a hand to a heart and a heart beats a path for a soul
A solitary cloud, a love of a life in a world of its own
And I want it to be mine
And if it's not someone else's it's bound to be mine and I...
You wanted it too didn't you dear? You know we say you tear
Then he broke it up and he snap it ribbons AY! AY! AY! AY!
Burn it in the bin in the kitchen
Say goodbye yes, say goodbye say goodbye
Stinks the blood out comes his eyes
Out comes his nose and...
AY! AY! AY! AY!
Burn it in the bin in the kitchen
Say goodbye yes, say goodbye say goodbye
AY! AY! AY! AY!
You wanted it too didn't you dear?
Yes say goodbye, yes say goodbye, say
Goodbye grace, lost my face, 
Burn it shrivelled in the human waste
And then I can't settle down and all the flies from the dog
Stinks the blood comes his eyes, comes his eyes, comes the fur
Comes the ugly dog, HIDE!Embed
