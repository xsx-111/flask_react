The Alphabet Business Concern (Home of Fadeless Splendour) Lyrics(there be dragons)
Hail majestic corporate light
Heaven born and ever bright
How our spirit like the waves
At the breath of thine awakes
And now the night of weeping shall be
The morn of song
Ah! we are those whose thunder
Shakes the skies - the thin spun life.
Home of fadeless splendour, 
Of flowers that bear no thorn
Here may the blind and hungry come
And light and food receive
Here mighty springs of consolation rise
To cheer the fainting mind
And re-creation find. 
So overcome thy fear and burst into sudden blaze
Come the blind fury with th' abhorred shears
And slit the thin spun life
Ah! sobbing with their human sort of wail
Thy justice fear. 
Walk in shadow, walk in dread
Loosefish walk as like one dead
One drop in a winter sea no more to rise forever.
Anything down there about your soul
Will smash the sun alight
Ah! yield week in, weak out from morn to night
Feelers from across the sea come crawling over thee. 
One drop in a winter sea no more to rise forever
One drop in a winter sea no more to rise forever
Come the blind fury with th' abhorred shears
And slit the thin spun life. 
Ah! sobbing with their human sort of wail
The thin spun life
We are those whose thunder shakes the skies
Whose eyes this atom globe surveys
Thy justice fear
Hooray!Embed
