Helen and Heaven LyricsHelen and Heaven, Earth sea and shore
Says even less than, says even more than is
Hearable anyway, even for Sandy
Life in my ankles lives in my hands
Own minds for nothing 'cept laying of
Sandy's pit lies in a field that is
Nearer than handy
Space for approval, plenty of room
Join me in closedown, sink into gloom
Watching window, see all of the news of the day and
Life without anger, life without fear
Own minds for nothing helped with ideas but the
Mouth I was feeding was sick on my hand
Waters voice and wind as one
Quake their call to Moon and Sun
Sovereign stars and throws of light
Pale before her queenly mighty ankles
Life in her ankles lives in my hands
Says even less than what even can stands in
Bold in my eyes, finally accepting deterioration
Strange men and women
Allowing themselves to be shot at
The same time
All hope and fear by night and day forever pine away
And every leaf that plumes her touch
Sails from branch to sink in dust
Hooray!Embed
