Bodysbad LyricsBody's feelie like I'm mad
How long it has been, more than I can count by far
And my body's feeling bad
And it's the only one I have and it's in my car
It's in my car
Better to swallow a bitter pill
If they can cut it off they will
If they can cut it off, take a pills cut it off they will
Brushing everything aside
With everything that's alive
Push the thing inside
Body's bad and it's sad
As going out to find a partner
You'd do anything for
Beware you'll soon find out
What lies about
Shrieking it shouts
Ah!
Bestest ever, what a saviour
Cherish is the word
Not really I'm too old
It'll break up my bones
Fiery furnace flew an angel in
Had to take her out and wash her down
Let's act strong like the old days
A Rizla will fix her wing
That is the best
Hallelujah
What a saviour
What a saviour
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Ah!
What a saviour
Hallelujah
Is the best ever
And saviour twice as ever
Shaking the feeling
Something's missing shake the feeling
Cherish is the word
Not really I'm too old
It'll break up my bones
Better to swallow a bitter pill
If they can cut it off they will
If they can cut it off
Take a pill cut it off
Once in my car
Once round my head
That is the best
Swallow the rest
Cherish is the word
Not really it's too old
It'll break up my old bones
It's saviour's the breaker
That's life in my shaky feeling
No not really I was lying
Was lying
Was lying
Once in my car
Once round my head
That is the best
Swallow the rest
Cherish is the word
Not really it's too old
It'll break up my old bones
It's saviour's the breaker
That's life in my shaky feeling
No not really
I was lyingEmbed
