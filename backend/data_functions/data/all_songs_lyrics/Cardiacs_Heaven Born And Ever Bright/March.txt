March LyricsEverything I fear forever coming here to
Bless my heart and bless my soul
Leaving nerves for shot, 's only my lot
'S only my heart, 's only my hole
Everything I fear forever coming here to
Bless my heart and bless my soul
Bless my front and rear and touch my part, yes
That's my heart, yes that's my hole
Happier when head is high
Nearer sky 'cos high says I
Only one thing left inside
Pandora's box arrived inside and
Every dancing kind in me left
Leaving me
Happier when head is high
Nearer sky 'cos high says I
Only one thing left inside
Then Pandora's box arrived and
Every dancing kind in me left
Leaving me
It's only all my lot leaving my nerves for shot
'S only one thing left in th' insides
No-one free from fear leaving my parties uninvited
Anyway
Everything was fine inside
Then Pandora's box arrived
Soft and mellow sadness rised
Probed the bush like march
Except that fearful mind of mine
Packs up and carts off my fears
Treats like this, no-one lives, all babies born like babies
Happier when head is high like is. Nearer sky 'cos high is mizz
Only one thing left in this, every dancing kind in me left leaving me
Many are the same things, people invite would-be raiders
One more then back must fly for casting out by neighbours
Grubs and insects all carry on with their capersEmbed
