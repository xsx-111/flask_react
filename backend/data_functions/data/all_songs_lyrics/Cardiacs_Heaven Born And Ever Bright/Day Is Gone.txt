Day Is Gone LyricsTelling familiar stories
Invited us to our home for some soup
Bothered by steam
We clipped our wing, so we can't fly
Better than better than what?
Some dying off
A rocket ship
Looks as if a day is gone
Looks as if a day is missing
Everyone's trying to leave
Lorries driving to the sea
Who is that who slammed the door?
Looks as if a day has gone away
More active than scraps alive
Sleep for weeks but often stirring
More alive than anyone swears
As born were we from hollow trees
Telling familiar stories
Invited us to our home for some soup
Bothered by steam
We clip our wing, so we can't fly away
Looks as if a day is gone
Looks as if the day is playing
Looks as if a day is gone
Looks as if a day has gone awayEmbed
