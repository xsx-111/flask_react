Snakes-a-Sleeping LyricsWatched after by angels
And soft as moths watch on like
Beetles around me head
Multi-minded sleeper, sticky with dreams
And slept as snakes-a-sleeping and turning to tears
Soft as moths, spike all dreams inside
They're giving fear inside her aching belly
They have left in there inside
Tiny world, hell sinks me
And sinks my floating isle
Sails down
Whatever you do, let it go
And she bloods, her mouth is red, she bleeds
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Snakes-a-sleeping, mouth is red bleeds her bed
Waiting and aching and all green with life
Her mouth is red, make us remember well
And see how strange it sounds
Strange as the word, no it's not the world is strange
Not as strange as the word
Soft as moths, spike all dreams in head
Blood her mouth is red, she bleeds her bed
I'm here, that is clear and left is you
So with swim we'll froth with limbs the blueEmbed
