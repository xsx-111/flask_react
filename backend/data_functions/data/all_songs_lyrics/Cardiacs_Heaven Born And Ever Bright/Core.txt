Core LyricsCrazy lover like mad
And it cakes walls with sun
I shall be a sky and a hill of good
And it keeps my mind happy
Sucking breath shrieking
From my belly doing no favours
And fluid like the waves and fouling glass
And it keeps my mind happy
I've been white clean
And I taste in my mouth a worry
Everyone falls I feel fine
And I and I feel fine
Air is thin and it is hurting you
Beast of field, fowl of air
Heart of stone, man of metal
Shakes loose his core
Crazy lover like mad
And it cakes walls with sun
I shall be a sky and a hill of good
And it keeps my mind happy
I've been white clean
And I taste in my mouth a worry
Everyone falls I feel fine
And I and I feel fine
Air is thin and it is hurting you
Lost Jim, I held his fat hand
Needed to be looked after
I saw the vapours
Saw the vapours
Saw the vapours
I tried but could only think of meEmbed
