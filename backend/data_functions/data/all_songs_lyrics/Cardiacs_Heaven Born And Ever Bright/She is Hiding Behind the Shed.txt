She is Hiding Behind the Shed LyricsTuesday and what's happening now
It's not real life, it's not fantasy-by-side
The sea-by-side
Back the shed that's where she hides from me
Dear everyone, axe in me
Hoping I don't get lost in heaven
Nevermind I'll see you there
Goodbye my favourite and I don't care
You don't have to live in there
But some of us can who dare
Here comes the never
And I can't even find my shoes
Back the shed that's where she moves from me
And everyone before, leaving me inside my floor
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
Nevermind I'll see you there
Goodbye my favourite I don't care
And I really don't and I'll see you there
Leaved me in, with no definite right to leave
Me inside my floor
Tuesday and what's happening now
It's not real life, it's not fantasy-by-side
The sea-by-side
Back the shed that's where she hides from me
You don't have to live in there
But some of us can who dare
Here comes the never
And I can't even find my shoes
Back the shed that's where she moves from me
'sy-by-side
The sea-by-side
Back the shed that's where she hides from me
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well"
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well", I said
You're right she said, she nods her head
I thought we'd be alright, instead
I think she hides behind the shed
"Thank you, I taught you well"Embed
