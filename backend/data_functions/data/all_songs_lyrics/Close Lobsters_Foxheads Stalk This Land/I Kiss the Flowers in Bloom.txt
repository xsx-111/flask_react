I Kiss the Flowers in Bloom LyricsEvery night I wake up 3 or 4 times
And walk in circles just to clear my head
All along the lines
I've been double-crossed
Across the lines I've been double-crossed
All of my creations have been purged
It's the first rule of profits and it hurts
Everything is fine
I don't know what's to re-kiss
Divided the numbers
Only one thing counts
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower
Every year I wake up a thousand times
And walk in circles just to ease the strain
Everything is fine
I don't know what's to re-kiss
Everything is fine
I don't know what's to re-kiss
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloom
I kiss the flower in bloomEmbed
