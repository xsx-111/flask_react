Just Too Bloody Stupid LyricsOne, one
Slip-up, mess up
One, two, three
Some examples:
Her mind is small
His motives crooked
K.V. said, "Too bloody stupid."
Not too slow that he said it(?)
One, one
Blinkered, blinkered
One, one
Slip-up, slip-up
Gravity was just taken from you with it
Don't pretend to comprehend that much
From this point I'll say exactly
These backwards spineless selfish swine
They come between us every time
One, one
Pop like that!
They always pop like that
One, two, three
These examples
Her mind is small
His motives crooked
K.V. said, "Too bloody stupid."
K.V. said, "She's too bloody stupid."
These backwards spineless selfish swine
They come between us every time
One! One!
Pop like that!
Pop like that!
These backwards spineless selfish swine
They come between us every time
One!Embed
