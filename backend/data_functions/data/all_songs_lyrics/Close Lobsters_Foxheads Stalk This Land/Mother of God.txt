Mother of God LyricsNever
Repeat those words!
Never
Repeat those words!
I am the lonely man of lonely men
I am the young man
Now to embrace the plague of everyday
Now to embrace the plague of everyday
It was never really like that
It was never really like that
It was never really like that
Never really like that
Right now, what I know is sin
Right now, all what I know is sin
And who spoke to me in blue flashes of lightning
Dynamic
Never
Repeat those words!
