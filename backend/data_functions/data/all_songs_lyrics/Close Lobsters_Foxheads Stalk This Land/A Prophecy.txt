A Prophecy LyricsAnd I can see it like a prophecy
I have a crystal ball head
You can reach for
The stars of heaven
It doesn't mean
You'll ever get there
'Cause you don't know
Where you're going
It's not surprising since you don't know where to go
And it's just like the sunshine
To make my eyes go riverlike
And it's typical of the weather
To pour in on an off day
But you don't know what you're doing
It's not surprising since you don't know what to do
And you don't know what you're saying
It's not surprising since
You don't know what to say
And most things are hard to remember
I probably didn't pick you up right
And it's typical of the weather
To make my eyes go riverlike
But you don't know where you're going
It's not surprising since you don't know where to goEmbed
