In Spite of These Times LyricsForce me back, I can't sleep when
You won't let the moon get you down
As it may sound 
The walls of the world just gave way
It's not like you to be so great
Maybe you picked up that trait from me
From your window
I asked the sky
"When can you fit me in?"
Promise me that
Never forget in spite of these times
Promise me that
Never forget in spite of these times
My line in sight of everything
A hand held me in from the maelstrom
A warm hand, a sticky hand
Held me from the mob
It just like me to get so gone
I don't recall where I picked up that trait from
From your window
I asked the sky
'When can you fit me in?'
Promise me that
Never forget in spite of these times
Promise me that
Never forget in spite of these times
Don't let it slip through your hands
Don't let it slip through your hands
Force me back, I can't sleep when
You won't let the moon get you down
The walls of the world just gave way
Problems and maelstrom and pestilence and plague
From your window
I asked the sky
"When can you fit me in?"
Promise me that I'd never forget in spite of these times
Promise me that I'd never forget in spite of these times
Don't let it slip through your hands
Don't let it slip through your hands
Don't let it slip through your fingersEmbed
