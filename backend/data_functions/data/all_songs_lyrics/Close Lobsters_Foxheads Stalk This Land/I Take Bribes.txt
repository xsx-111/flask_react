I Take Bribes LyricsHow is business?
Barely work
Sold my soul, I employ myself
Just steal my soul, you understand
Just steal my soul, you understand
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I'm thinking of theft
You see what no doin's done to my relatives
They don't vote conservative
Touch things, you understand
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
I take, I don't take bribes
I like, don't like my soul
I take, I don't take bribes
I like, like, like myself
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, YeahEmbed
