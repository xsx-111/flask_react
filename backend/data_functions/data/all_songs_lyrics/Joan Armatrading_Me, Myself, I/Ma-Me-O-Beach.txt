Ma-Me-O-Beach LyricsMa-Me-O-beach
The kind of place I like to be
Running on the sand
Or just lying in my baby's arms
I can't swim
But I like the sea
So I'm going down
To Ma-Me-O-beach
I'm taking my babe
Gone in the water
While I'm sunning on the floor
I hear you call me in
But I'd drown for sure
Don't mean maybe
Some like the tan
But they don't like the sun
Me I'm brown enough
In fact I'm overdone
Turn me over
Pretty girls are there
If you're good with the chat
All kinds of games
If you fancy that
Some like to swim
Some like to watch
Some come to make up the crowd
And that's a factEmbed
