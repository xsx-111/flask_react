Is It Tomorrow Yet? LyricsMy baby say that the time is a
Coming soon
But did not say if it was in the morning or the
Afternoon
If we don't meet today
I think tomorrow may
Bring a surprise
Before my eyes
Is it tomorrow yet
I've got to do my best
For my baby
I've been losing time
Has the clock spun 'round
Did I sleep too late
Have I missed too much
Have I missed much
Have I missed much
I wanna see my baby
I wanna see my baby
Is it tomorrow yet
Can't count the times we've met and we've been going our
Different ways
Tomorrow I know we'll be going
The same way
Don't know 'bout yesterday
And we may not meet today
Under this sky
But I'd like a surprise
Is it tomorrow yet
I've got to look my best
For my baby
This time I'm keeping track
There'll be no looking back
No more maybe
Must be tomorrow today
Must be tomorrow today
Here's my babyEmbed
