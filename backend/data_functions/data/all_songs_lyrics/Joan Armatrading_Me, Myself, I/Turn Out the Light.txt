Turn Out the Light LyricsUp and down
And all around
I've been looking for you
In and out
And all about
I've been reaching for you
I've got to tell you baby
Now my mind is made up
Things have looked bad
But now some years later
We still
Turn out the light
I'm gonna love you
Tonight
Many lover
Have come and gone
Some I miss
And some I don't
Some were handsome
But none were plain
My good fortune I suppose
I wanna tell you baby
Since I took up with you
I mostly think of love and
That means you
Let's turn out the light
I'm wanna hold you
So tightEmbed
