When You Kisses Me LyricsI'm trying to set
Your heart on fire
I wanna be
Your one desire
'Cos when you kisses me
Make me feel so nice inside
Make me feel so good
I wanna tell the world
I'm glad I found you
I'm a lucky girl
With you to hold me
'Cos when you kisses me
Make me feel so nice inside
Make me feel so good
Like my baby
There's no other
You can tempt me but
You won't hold me
Oh my darlin'
Don't you worry
No false promise
Ain't no lie
I may look over my shoulder
But I'll never leave your side
Both day and night
You fill my dreams
Who should I thank
For all you bring me
'Cos when you kisses me
Make me feel so nice insideEmbed
