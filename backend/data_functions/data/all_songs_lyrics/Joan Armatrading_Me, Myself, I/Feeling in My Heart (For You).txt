Feeling in My Heart (For You) LyricsI have lost in love
I have lost in love
That's twice today
Now you're on my mind
What will I find
Will you be kind to me
I won't be afraid
I won't be afraid
To love this time
Gentle yet firm
Darling I'm yours
Hold me tonight
'Cos I
Got a feeling in my heart
For you
I
Got a feeling in my heart
For you
I got a feeling in my heart for you
I got a feeling in my heart that's true
Oh I
Got a feeling in my heart
For you
Never leave your side
I will never turn my back on you
This feeling's no lie
It's just you and I
Hold me tonight
'Cos I
Got a feeling in my heart
For you
I
Got a feeling in my heart
For youEmbed
