Me Myself I LyricsI sit here by myself
And you know I love it
You know I don't want someone
To come pay a visit
I wanna be by myself
I came in this world alone
Me myself I
I wanna go to China
And to see Japan
I'd like to sail the oceans
Before the seas run dry
I wanna go by myself
I've just room enough for one
Me myself I
I wanna be a bigshot
And have ninety cars
I wanna have a boyfriend
And a girl for laughs
But only on Saturdays
Six days to be alone
Just me myself I
Me myself and I
Just me myself I
Don't wanna be the bad guy
Don't wanna make a soul cry
It's not that I love my self
I just don't want company
Except me myself I
Me myself and I
Just me myself I
I sit here by myself
And you know I love it
You know I don't want someone
To come pay a visit
I wanna be by myself
I came in this world alone
Me myself IEmbed
