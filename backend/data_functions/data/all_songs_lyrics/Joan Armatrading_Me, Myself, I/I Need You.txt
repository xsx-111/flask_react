I Need You LyricsLate
At night
I feel so lonely
Here's a body next to mine but I'm feeling cold
And baby in the morning light
When I look in some stranger's eyes
It's then I know that the need in me
Is really for your paradise
I dance
I sing
But there's something missing
Every night a different name to call
But you know when I hold 'em tight
I always give the game away
I try so hard to make it right
But it always ends up the same
You know I need you
I need you
Like I needed you
The first time we kissed
I need you
And I need you now
And I can't resist
Standing by your door in case you leave
I miss you mostly in the night
And I miss you through the day
I hate myself for hurting you
Yes I know I drove you clean away
You know I need you
But now I need you1Embed
