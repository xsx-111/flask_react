Transform Lyrics
If a leopard never changes its spots
How can I change what I've got?
Transform, transform, transform, transform
We don't punish the tiger for catching its prey
So how am I the one to blame
If it's in my nature?
Transform, transform, transform

And I don't know why I fight it
The least I could do is try
But ego's in the way
I know that you feel mad today
But that anger will fade away
And you'll wish she was here

It's never over until life ends
Lay down beside me, do it again
It's never over until life ends, yeah
Lay down beside

Don't be a fool, baby I know you've changed
It's in my nature and it's okay (it's okay)
And I'll be your goddess and you a part of me
Lay down your pride, lay down with me
So ugly but you love me
Keep nobody else above me
And that's why I keep you around
Ain't it funny, now you're money
Act like you don't know nobody
What goes round gon' come back around

It's never over until life ends
Lay down beside me, do it again
It's never over until life ends, yeah
Lay down beside me

You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one
You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one
You're my violet in the sun
You're the chosen one

Can't quit you, you're like drugs
Swear I tried to clean up
Too much shared between us
Saved my soul like Jesus
Can't quit you, you're like drugs
Swear I tried to clean up
Too much shared between us
Saved my soul like Jesus12Embed
