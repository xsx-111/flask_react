Get You Lyrics
Through drought and famine, natural disasters
My baby has been around for me
Kingdoms have fallen, angels be callin'
None of that could ever make me leave

Every time I look into your eyes, I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

And when we're making love, uh
Your cries, they can be heard from far and wide
It's only the two of us
Everything I need between those thighs

Every time I look into your eyes, I see it
You're all I need
Every time I get a bit inside, I feel it
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?

And I'll take some time
Just to be thankful
That I had days full of you, you
Before it winds down into
The memories, it's all just memories
Now

(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I take you down
(If you've got someone you like)
Don't you love when I come around
(Feel something that's right
Somebody just tell somebody)
Build you up then I takeâ€”

Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
Oh yeah, oh yeah, babe
Ooh, who would've thought I'd get you?
This feels like summer
Boy, you make me feel so alive
Just be my lover
Boy, you'll lead me to paradise125Embed
