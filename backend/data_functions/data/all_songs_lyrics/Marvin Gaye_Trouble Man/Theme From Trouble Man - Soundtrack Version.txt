Theme From Trouble Man - Soundtrack Version LyricsI__come up hard, baby, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it baby, playin' by the rules
I've come of heart, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the line
I__come up hard baby, but that's OK
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way
I___come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
Gonna keep movin', gonna roll to town
I___come up hard, I come up, getting down
There's only 3 things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know, baby, this I know, child
Yeah, let the sweat through you, baby
Get me singin', yeah, yeah, ooo
I __come up hard, baby, I had to fight
Took care of business with all my might
I__come up hard, I had to win
Then start all over and win again
I__come up hard, but that's OK
'Cause Trouble Man don't get in my way
I've heard some places and I've seen some places
I've never had tensions, I give my directions
When people say; that's OK, they don't bother me
I'm ready to make it, don't care 'bout the weather
Don't care 'bout no trouble, got myself together
No laughin', no cryin', protection's all around me
I come up hard, baby
I've been for real, baby
With the Trouble Man
Movin', goin' tight
I__come hard, come up, get down
There's only 3 things for sure:
Taxes, death and trouble
This I know, baby, baby
This I know, baby, baby
Hey now, let it sweat, baby
I__come up hard, but now I'm cool
I didn't make it, baby, playin' by the rules
I__come up hard, baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble, sure movin' down the lineEmbed
