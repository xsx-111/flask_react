Lamb To The Slaughter LyricsI went down to the water
Like a lamb to the slaughter
Didn't know what was waiting for me there
Nobody warned me
Nobody told me
My excuse is I wasn't prepared
I drank deep from the river
And sealed up my fate
I should have seen the trap, baby
Before it was too late
We go down
We go down
Go down is the only way out
Who is the fool
Who believed all the stories
I wish I could say it's not me
You polluted my head
With the things you said
I became what you wanted to see
All of these years
I've built up this hate
I had my chance coming
But now it's too late
We go down
We go down
Go down is the only way out
We go down
We go down
Go down is the only way out
I drank deep from the river
And sealed up my fate
I had my chance coming
But now it's too late
We go down
We go down
Go down is the only way out
We go down
We go down
Go down is the only way out
Down is the only way out
Down is the only way out
Down
Down is the only way out
Down is the only way out
Down is the only way out
Down is the only way outEmbed
