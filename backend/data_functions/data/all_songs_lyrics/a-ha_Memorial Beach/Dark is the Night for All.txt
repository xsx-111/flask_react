Dark is the Night for All LyricsIt's time we said goodbye
Time now to decide
Oh, don't you feel so small
Dark is the night for all
It's time we moved out west
This time will be the best
And when your evenings fall
Dark is the night for all
It's time, yeah, to break free
It's time to pull away for you and me
Come on now, to break free
It's time, yeah, to break free
We need to celebrate the mystery
It's time we said goodbye
Time now to decide
Oh, don't you feel so small
Dark is the night for all
Time
