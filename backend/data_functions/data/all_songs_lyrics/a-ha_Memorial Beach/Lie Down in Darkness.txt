Lie Down in Darkness LyricsWith all your goals and destinations
Everything must be this way
Vague are hopes that try our patience
Listen now to what I say
Oh, lie down in darkness
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Here with me
With all our trials and tribulations
Will it ever make much sense
All these years, they disappear
They leave me here without defence
Oh, lie down in darkness
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Here with me
Next to me
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Here with me
Oh, lie down in darkness
I want you next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Next to me
Oh, lie down in darkness
Next to me
With me
With meEmbed
