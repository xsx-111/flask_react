Move to Memphis LyricsWalked around, no one around
You were the one who taught me better
This old town brings me down
You were the one who told me you've got to
Move to Memphis, that's what I'll do
Going to move to Memphis and follow you
Trace that highway down to your doorway
Going to move to Memphis and be with you
On the day you walked away
I was the one who said you'd better
Stick around, stay in town
You were the one who told me you've got to
Move to Memphis, that's what I'll do
Chase the shadow that follows you
Take the highway down to your doorway
Going to move to Memphis and be with you
I'm going to be with you
I'm going to be with you
Going to move to Memphis
I'm going to be with you
I'm going to be with you
Going to move to Memphis
Move to Memphis, that's what I'll do
Chase the shadow that follows you
Take the highway down to your doorway
Going to move to Memphis, to be with you
That's what I'll do
Chase the shadow that follows you
Take the highway down to your doorway
Going to move to Memphis and follow you
That's what I'll do
Take the highway to your doorway
Going to move to Memphis and be with you
Move to Memphis, babyEmbed
