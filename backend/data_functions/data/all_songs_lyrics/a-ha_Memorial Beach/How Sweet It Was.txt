How Sweet It Was LyricsUh yeah, that's all right
Lend us a voice in this howling night
Just about a month ago
You made a promise, babe, not to go
Yes, you did now
You were the heart and soul
One to the nightfall
One to the stars
One to the haunted
Fools we are
One to remember
One to recall
One to acknowledge
Just how sweet it was, yeah
Just about a month ago
You made a promise, babe, ain't that so
Yes, you did now
Into this howling night
You got
You got
You got
You got me so
You got me so low
I wouldn't lie, babe
Not again
It's such a crime
To while away my time
One to remember
One to recall
One to acknowledge
Just how sweet it was
We were so happy
We were okay
We let our good thing, honey
Just slip away
Lend us a voice in this howling night
One to the nightfall
One to the stars
One to the haunted
Fools we are
One to remember
One to recall
One to acknowledge
Just how sweet it was, yeah
We were so happy now
We were okay
We let our good thing
Slip away
One to acknowledge
Just how sweet it was, yeah
