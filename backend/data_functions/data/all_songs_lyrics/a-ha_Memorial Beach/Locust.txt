Locust LyricsDon't be afraid
It's a harmless moon
All we can do
Is to assume
Our lives must change
A change is due
I hear you say
What are we going to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
What are you want to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
Oh, weeping night
Oh, grieving sky
Oh, rabbit wind
You just flew by
Grant me this
Some small reward
Don't announce
The time of the final call
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
What are you want to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
My dream was this
Across the sky
A slate-grey cloud
That filled the eye
A slate-grey cloud
Comes through the dust
Locust
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
What are you want to do
I don't know, make it
I don't know, shake it
I don't know, break it down
Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moon
Don't be afraid
It's a harmless moonEmbed
