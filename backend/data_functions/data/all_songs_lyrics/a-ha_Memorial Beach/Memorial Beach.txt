Memorial Beach LyricsI pace the length of my unmade room
In times of change
My bags are packed, guess I'm leaving the womb
Into the rain
We never found
A place to hide
Some place of mind
God knows we tried
Toes in the sand, the seductive way
Ooh, nothing better, babe
Across the bay, Sarasota Way
We held together
We never found
A place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried, yeah
Into the rain
The summer rain
So we walk down to Memorial Beach
Where things began
Honey days and nights without sleep
Lost in the sand
We never found
A place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried, yeah
We never found
A place to hide
Some peace of mind
God knows we tried, yeah
God knows we tried
So we walk down to Memorial BeachEmbed
