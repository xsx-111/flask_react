The Woman That Loves You Lyrics
You're embarrassing me
With a postponed marriage and a stalled-out car
Then you leave me in the back with half a window rolled down
Like a dog, like a dog in the summer heat

Don't you think, don't you think
You should try to do as little harm as you can
To the woman that loves you?

Oh, we'll stay
Oh, we'll stay together
For the weekend, honey
The weekend, babe
Me and you, frosted blue
But we're gazing out for better things

You should try to do as little harm as you can
To the woman that loves you
You should try to do as little harm as you can
To the woman that loves you3Embed
