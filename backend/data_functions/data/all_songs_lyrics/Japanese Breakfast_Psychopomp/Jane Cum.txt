Jane Cum Lyrics
Jane Cum
In a year, I'll say, "Your hair got long"
And you'll tell me how the band got good
Like dust kicked up from a tire

Full force through the high beams
I was rushing from phantom pain
Sweat away our clothes hatching

Jane Cum, you swallow me whole
Jane Cum, swallow

Soulless animal, keep feeding on my meat
All my tiny bones between your teeth

Jane Cum, you swallow me whole
Jane Cum, swallow

Jane, Jane5Embed
