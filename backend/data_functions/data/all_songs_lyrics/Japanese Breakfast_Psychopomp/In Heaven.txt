In Heaven Lyrics
The dog's confused
She just paces around all day
She's sniffing at your empty room
I'm trying to believe
When I sleep, it's really you
Visiting my dreams
Like they say that angels do

I came here for the long haul
Now I leave here as an empty fucking hole

Oh, do you believe in heaven
Like you believed in me?
Oh, it could be such heaven
If you believed it was real

Is there something you can do with yourself?
As I sift through the debris
While I empty every shelf
And flounder in the muck that I'll be drowning in so soon
You can't watch me from the banks then
Turn to say you're swimming too
Come here for the long haul
Now I leave here just an empty goddamn hole

How do you believe in heaven
Like you believe in me?
Oh, it could be such heaven
If you believed it was real

How?2Embed
