Everybody Wants to Love You Lyrics
Can I get your number?
Can I get you into bed?
When we wake up in the morning
Will you give me lots of head?

Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you

Will you lend me your toothbrush?
Will you make me breakfast in bed?
Ask me to get married
And then make me breakfast again

Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you

Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you
Everybody wants to love you3Embed
