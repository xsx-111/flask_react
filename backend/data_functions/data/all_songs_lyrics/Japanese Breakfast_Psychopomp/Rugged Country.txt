Rugged Country Lyrics
666 sixteen-year-old kids huddled around the grocery lot
"He punched out my teeth", so you said, so did the evidence
The blood and the dent on the car door from your head

And this is where I bring you
With every laurel I've hung from your neck
It will be the noose that hangs you
Yes, it will be the noose that hangs you

'Cause I was lonely here and it's lonely still
In the rugged country where the weeds grow fierce
Quicker than the crop I keep running from
In this rugged country

I'm the rugged one
I'm the rugged one
I'm the rugged one
I'm the rugged one

And this is where we lost you
Despite every effort to bring you back
Yeah, the hope's the one that haunts you
And the home's the rope that's wrapped around your neck
And it will be the noose that hangs you
Yes, it will be the noose that hangs you
And it's a heavy hand where I wear your death
As a wedding ring in the rugged country
I tend to your man in the home you had
Oh, in this rugged country

I'm the rugged one
I'm the rugged one
I'm the rugged one
I'm the rugged one1Embed
