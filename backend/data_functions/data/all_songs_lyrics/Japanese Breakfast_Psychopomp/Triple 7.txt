Triple 7 Lyrics
Don't you know I've always been this way?
I look to you through the work week
And I love a man in uniform
'Cause he loves me like a slot machine
From the valley of loose women in the cruel light of morning

Call out my name like something from the bottom of a well
Oh, how I want, how I need
How I cling to your sleeves 'til they're like lacerated sails
But in the night, I am someone else

Don't you know it's always been the same?
A pure woman is hard to find, to come by these days
And I know the looks of urge and scorn
And I know the role I'm meant to play
The role of the other woman who will spend her life longing

Call out my name like something from the bottom of a well
Oh, how I want, how I need
How I cling to your sleeves 'til they're all fucked beyond repair
But in the night, I am someone else
Yes, in the night, I am someone else
Oh, in the night, I am someone elseEmbed
