South Of The Border LyricsSouth of the border, down Mexico way
That's where I fell in love when the stars above came out to play
And now as I wander, my thoughts ever stray
South of the border, down Mexico way
She was a picture in old Spanish lace
Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile apon her face
'Cause it was fiesta and we were so gay
South of the border, Mexico way
Then she sighed as she whispered "mañana"
Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered "mañana"
'Cause our tomorrow never came
South of the border, I jumped back one day
There in a veil of white by the candlelight, she knelt to pray
The mission bells told me that I mustn't stay
South of the border, Mexico way
The mission bells told me, ding-dong, that I must not stay
Stay south of the border, down Mexico way
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)
Aye, aye, aye, aye (aye, aye, aye, aye)Embed
