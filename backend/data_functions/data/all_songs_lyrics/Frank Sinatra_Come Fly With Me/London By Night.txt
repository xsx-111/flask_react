London By Night LyricsLondon by night is a wonderful sight
There is magic abroad in the air
I'm often told that the streets turn into gold
When the moon shines on Circus and Square
Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There's romance in each cigarette's glow
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau
Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He's not alone, for it seems
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep
Her watch while each Londoner dreams
My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast-fading light
Most people say they love London by day
But lovers love London by nightEmbed
