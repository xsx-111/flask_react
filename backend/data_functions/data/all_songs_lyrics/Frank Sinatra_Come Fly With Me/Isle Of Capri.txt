Isle Of Capri Lyrics'Twas on the Isle of Capri that I found her
Beneath the shade of an old walnut tree
Oh, I can still see the flowers bloomin' 'round her
Where we met on the Isle of Capri
She was as sweet as a rose at the dawning
But somehow fate hadn't meant her for me
And though I sailed with the tide in the morning
Still my heart's on the Isle of Capri
Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian sky above
I said "Lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare a sweet word o'love?"
She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"
And then as I kissed her hand I could see
She wore a lovely meatball on her finger
'Twas goodbye at the Villa Capri
Instrumental-horns with mandolin
Summertime was nearly over
Blue Italian sky above
I said "Lady, I'm a rover
Can you spare a fine word o'love?"
She whispered softly "It's best not to linger"
And then as I kissed her hand I could see
She wore a plain golden ring on her finger
'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri
'Twas goodbye on the Isle of Capri
'Twas goodbye on the Isle of CapriEmbed
