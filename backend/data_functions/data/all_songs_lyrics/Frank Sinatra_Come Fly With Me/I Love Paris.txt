I Love Paris LyricsI love Paris in the springtime
I love Paris in the fall
I love Paris in the winter when it drizzles
I love Paris in the summer when it sizzles
I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why oh why do I love Paris
Because my love is here
I love Paris every moment
Every moment of the year
I love Paris, why oh why do I love Paris
Because my love is here
She's there
She's everywhere
But she's really hereEmbed
