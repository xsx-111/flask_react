The Hitcher LyricsYou're never far away from my mind
Always too far away to see
Controlled explosions wreck the train line
Just can't believe the coast is clear
I get this feelin'
It's such an itch, itch
You're somewhere out there in a landslide
All hope just slippin' through like sand
Telephone lines down in a rainstorm
And I'm like a ship moored on dry land
I get this feelin'
It's such a bitch
You're always far out in the midrange
All around the state boundary spillage signs
Somebody burnt down all the pylons
And your my passport past these mines
I get this feelin'
I wanna hitch
Hitch a ride on your smile
Hitch a ride on your smile
Hitch a ride away from here
Hitch a ride on your smile
Hitch a ride away from here
I get this feelin'
End of the tunnel light just blinds me
While you weep like a willow tree
Send out distress signals to find me
They shine so hard so why can't we?
I get this feelin'
Wanna hitch
Hitch a ride on your smile
Hitch a ride on your smile
Hitch a ride away from here
Hitch a ride on your smile
Hitch a ride away
I get this feelin'Embed
