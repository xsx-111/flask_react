You Find It Everywhere LyricsYou find it here
You find it everywhere
It's always there
I'm drivin' everywhere
Beyond the glare
There's burnin' everywhere
We stop and stare
I'm falling every stair
So take me there
I really just don't care
Down at the fair
We'll find them everywhere
The clothes you wear
You find them everywhere
The profit's there
They're buyin' every share
You find it here
You find it everywhere
It's always there
I'm striving every stairEmbed
