Never Lose That Feeling/Never Learn LyricsYou can see for miles you say
I'm not watchin' anyway
Hold on tight to the sides you say
I can't mind 'cause I'm not right
So far reaching
Never lose that feeling
Past believing
Never lose that feeling
I'll sweep up the streets today
Take your leave then look away
You need something more today
I don't mind and it's always this way
So deceiving
Never lose that feeling
So revealing
Never lose that feeling
So far reaching
Never lose that feeling
So deceiving
Never lose that feeling Feeling
Past believing
Never lose that feeling
So revealing
Never lose that feelingEmbed
