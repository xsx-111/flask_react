Planes Over the Skyline LyricsPlanes over the skylight
Planes over the skylight
Planes over the skylight
Walking through the Haight
Along a loud and crowded street
Disarray
The vender's broke again
It drives me 'round the bend
Disarray
Planes over the skyline
The east pavement opens up
And I'm left looking up
You say you just can't try anymore
To find what you've been fighting for
Planes over the skyline
Walking through the rain
To a loud and crowded place alone
Grounded to a halt
In a city built on a fault
Disarray
Planes over the skylineEmbed
