Last Train to Satansville LyricsYou look like you've been losin' sleep
Said a stranger on a train
I fixed him with an ice cold stare and said
I've been havin' those dreams again
In one dream there's this girl I love
And we dance every wakin' breath
And in the other they've thrown me in a cell
And they're tryin' me for her death
I'm only young and young in love
As I hold that girl today
But I'm old and tired and in the cell
And I've nigh on withered away
Y'see my baby' gone away too long
And I'm chokin' back the tears
Disheveled star in a burnt out bar
And I'm talkin' in my drink
She promised me the world and more
How could she do this to me?
And now mine's tumblin' down around
But at least my eyes can see
And those stars in the sky are for me
So as this fagged-out tinsel town
Waves so-long to the sun
I lay here calmly on my bed
And the trigger of my gun
And should that no good woman show up
Dancin' from a dream
I'll squeeze it twice and not think twice
And relish every screamEmbed
