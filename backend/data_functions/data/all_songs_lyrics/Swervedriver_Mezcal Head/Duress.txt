Duress LyricsAnd when the dawn begins to creep
Sunlight finds you in a heap
And how you wish that you could sleep
Forget the lies that you've been told
You think you're settin' free your soul
But you're really gettin' old
You've dreamt of divin' in the sea
Your outstretched arms in front of me
And how you wished that you could breathe
In the grip of ecstasy
When the shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
You wish someone could love you less
Longing for that one caress
I see you sink under Duress
And when you wanna kill it dead
You let it throttle you insteadEmbed
