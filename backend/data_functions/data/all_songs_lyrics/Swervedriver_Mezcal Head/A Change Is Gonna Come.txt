A Change Is Gonna Come LyricsI keep on thinkin' it's wrong
So I'm chiding you in a song
It's comin' your way
You shouldn't feel this way
And yeah you think it's a sin
I ain't your color of skin
It's comin' your way
You shouldn't feel this way
I keep on losin' my feet
When I walk down the street
I keep on thinkin' it's you
Guess it makes me feel blue
You say it's broken your dreams
They fall apart at the seams
It's comin' our way
You shouldn't feel this way
You shouldn't feel this way
I shouldn't feel this way
You shouldn't feel this way
We shouldn't feel this wayEmbed
