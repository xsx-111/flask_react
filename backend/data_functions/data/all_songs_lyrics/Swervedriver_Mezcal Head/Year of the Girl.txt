Year of the Girl LyricsDoes she wanna burn a field of four-leaf clovers?
Does she wanna find herself in need of one more?
Does she wanna subvert her own expectations?
She screams Who the hell do they think
They're catering for?
Take a while to find the route I'm meant to be takin'
Take a while to find a way to ride it for free
Force a smile and hope to God I'm not mistakin'
The way things are for the way things should be
Does she wanna sell a field of four-leaf clovers?
Does she wanna find herself in need of one more?
Does she wanna subvert her own expectations?
She screams Who the hell do they think
They're catering for?Embed
