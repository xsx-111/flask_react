For Seeking Heat LyricsYou seem to circle miles above me
Never hearing any word that I say
Eyes reeling from deadly pleasure
The last second don't count anyway
Without this safety net you're freed
To find serene pleasure of speed
A blur of beauty, intoxicating
Existence outstripped, outshined
Head clear cold chassis shaking
Encounter of body and mind
The world's a violent machine
Precise exultance so serene
Poised, risk and calculation
Caught up wide awake in a daze
Pretty pirouette accelerating
Beyond living in so many ways
Without this safety net you're freed
To find serene pleasure of speed
The world's a violent machine
Precise exultance so sereneEmbed
