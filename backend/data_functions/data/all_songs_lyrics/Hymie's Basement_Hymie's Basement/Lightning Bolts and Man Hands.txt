Lightning Bolts and Man Hands Lyrics
You can spend your time trying to not think about certain things
Hoping no one challenges your wonderful lie of the wisdom of daydreams
You can pluck the spot right off a ladybug's back
Put it on the ground and crawl right in

Most men resent their left hand
The bony knuckles, the second rate superhero thumb so broad and masculine
Overshadowed and rendered sedentary by its more active opposite companion
But I've got my mother's hands, and...

You can stumble through the stars
You can choke on a snow flake
You can slip on a banana peel to death
So spake the hopeless ape
You can get struck by a lightning bolt
A lightning bolt doesn't know its own strength
You'll pull a purr out of her if it kills you
Just you wait

Aren't babies born with creases in their palms
Way before you think the hand's most frequent movements have been established?
Have humans evolved to be born to hold hammers and swords?
In the years to come, will we see the emergence of a strong computer key finger?
In the years to come, will we see a flattened mouse pad palm?Embed
