21st Century Pop Song Lyrics
"Heheh"

The one true resolve of the flame and the bullet
Is a pile of flesh like an unmanned puppet
A set of bones gone suddenly still
And in a lab under every flag right now
Someone's splitting atoms, and inventing new breakfast cereals
In the shape of their nations borders
And drawing brand new maps
Discreetly expanding their nations borders

It's root root root for the home team
Shout like your dad at the TV screen
Tie a dollar bill around a circus flea
The fee to flee what you can't see
Well, it's root root root for the home team
Shout like your dad at the TV screen
Tie a dollar bill around a circus flea
The fee to flee what you can't see
Yo, I agree with glee with me

Somebody told me when the bomb hits
Everybody in a 2-mile radius will be instantly sublimated
But if you lay face down on the ground for some time
Avoiding the residual ripples of heat, you might survive
Permantly fucked up and twisted like you're always underwater refracted
Oh, but if you do go gas, there's nothing you can do if the air that was once you
Is mingled and mashed with the kicked-up molecules of the enemys former body
Big-kid-tested, motherfucker approved
Well, root root root for the home team
Shout like your dad at the TV screen
Tie a dollar bill around a circus flea
Yo, I agree with glee with me

You put your life in the hands of the highway designers
Your stride an unforeseen side effect
Of the urban planners realized blueprint dream
You put your life in the hands of the highway designers
Your stride an unforeseen side effect
Of the urban planners realized blueprint dream

Our font's bigger than your font. Our font- so straight, so legible, and tall and impenetrable, like a fortress, like a column, a skyscraper
Our font will crush your font. We like our font just fine. One font under god under god under god

Root root root for the home team
Shout like your dad at the TV screen
Tie a dollar bill around a circus flea
The fee to flee what you can't see

You put your life in the hands of the highway designers
Your stride an unforeseen side effect
Of the urban planners realized blueprint dream
Well, it's root root root for the home team
Shout like your dad at the TV screen
Tie a dollar bill around a circus flea
Yo, I agree with glee with me

You put your life in the hands of the highway designers
Your stride an unforseen side effect
Of the urban planner realized blueprint dream3Embed
