Ben and Joey Lyrics
People make sure their hair looks good before they walk in a room
Airplane blankets smell like brand new baseball uniforms
(and they don't keep you warm)
Ivy and moss are highly successful organisms
Hitchhikers stay hitchhikers by turning down rides
When we were kids, my friend ben told me
That when I was with a girl
I should think about how close she was to me
Occupying the same air
Only seperated by our shirtsEmbed
