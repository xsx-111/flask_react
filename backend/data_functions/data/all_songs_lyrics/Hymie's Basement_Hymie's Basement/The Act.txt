The Act LyricsIt makes perfect sense for children to practice having love affairs at summer camp
It's practical evolution
The perfect chance to pollenate another city with blanks
Only seeming more intentional than the seeds of a dead dandelion
Getting caught in the breeze and the act that follows
You'd like to think of as a passive fertilization
Well it might be as dodgy deliberate as the bar scene or date rape
It makes perfect sense for children to practice making sex at summer campEmbed
