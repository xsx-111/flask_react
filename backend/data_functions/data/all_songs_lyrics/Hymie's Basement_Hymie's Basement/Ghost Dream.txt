Ghost Dream Lyrics
After salvaging a good but rotting wood bass guitar
On a late night trip to the city dump
The man with the dirty disco twelve inch hands
Got in his light blue van
And heading to the school dance
He noticed cold water creeping up the cuffs of his pants
He swerved to dodge two people
Planting flowers in the middle of the on-ramp
And as the water level in the van, it began to rise
He attributed the water to the bass guitar
(and that's probably why it was in the trash in the first place)
And as the water got to the bottom of his ribcage
He thought about his laundry in the back
And the brand new dress shirt
And how the water'd sog the starch right out of the collar
He probably should have pulled right over to the shoulder
But he was late for the dance
And he couldn't reach the bass from where he sat
To throw it out the window
He was five minutes from where the function was
And he could hold his breath for two or so minutes if he must

Brand new skinny ghost
I don't trust tall dudes as far as I can throw 'em â€” that isn't far
Meet your brand new angel monster
Microwave, meet your maker
But if i could, I'd throw 'em head first into the ground like a javelin. And leave 'em there. Feet protruding out of the dirt like his headstone: here lies tall dude
Brand new skinny ghost
Meet your brand new angel monster
Microwave, meet your maker
Brand new skinny ghost
Meet your brand new angel monster
Microwave, meet your makerEmbed
