America Won Lyrics
America's a blinding place for nightlife
The highlights: America's a binding place
And I might tangle you in your own fists
Like two hundred feet of blank tape in a tree
And I might pound you
Put it on you like a sweater
With the sleeve holes sewed shut
When you're trying to swim
And I might treat you like a wall I walk by
With my headphones on and my eyes all gone
Or polish you, shine your ego
Like windexing a mirrorEmbed
