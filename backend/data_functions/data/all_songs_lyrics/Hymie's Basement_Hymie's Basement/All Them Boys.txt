All Them Boys Lyrics
Spit that gum into the sun
Walk in a circle, a perfect gun
All them boys and all they noise
All them boys and all they noise

Right now, I am not installing a carborator in my uncle's minibus
I guess I could be enclosing the porch
I could be applying for a job at the Provident Bank
Or having my cuticles cut by Asian women for twenty bucks

Spit that gum into the sun
Walk in a circle, a perfect gun
All them boys and all they noise
All them boys and all they noise
Spit that gum into the sun
Walk in a circle, a perfect gun
All them boys and all they noise
All them boys and all they noise

Right now, I'm not clearing land in a Costa Rican rain forest for American logging companies, chainsaw in hand (what are my options?)
I guess that I could chaperone the boys' choir's field trip to Busch Gardens
Atlantic City, fist full of beach sand, bucket, dead jellyfish ventnor Ocracoke Island
I guess I could
Spit that gum into the sun
Walk in a circle a perfect gun
All them boys and all they noise
All them boys and all they noiseEmbed
