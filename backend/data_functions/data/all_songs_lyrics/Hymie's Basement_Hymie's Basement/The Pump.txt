The Pump Lyrics
Your heart, the pump, a pop-up bubble
Sending the tiny blood men
To every little limb that loves me
Your heart, the pump, a pop-up bubble
Sending the tiny blood men
To every little place they can
Sending the tiny blood men
To flush another unfertilized egg
And when you're gone, I nibble at your lip-space
And when you're gone, I press for the wet pocket
And when you're gone, all I find is air
And when you're gone, all I find is air
If I turned your pills to sugar
Head first reverse ocean falling
If I switched your pills with sugar
Head first reverse ocean falling
If I swapped your pills for sugar
Head first reverse ocean falling
If I changed your pills to sugar
Head first reverse ocean falling

Head first reverse ocean falling apart
Your heart, the pump, a pop-up bubble
Sending the tiny blood menEmbed
