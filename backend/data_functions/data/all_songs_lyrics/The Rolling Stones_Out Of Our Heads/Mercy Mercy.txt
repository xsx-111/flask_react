Mercy Mercy Lyrics
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

Well I went to see the gypsy
To have my fortune read
She said, "Man, your baby going to leave you
Her bags are packed up under the bed"
That's right

Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

But if you leave me baby
Girl, if you put me down
I'm going to make it to the nearest river child
And jump overboard and drown
That's right
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

I said hey hey baby, hey hey now
What you trying to do?
Hey hey baby, hey hey now
Please don't say we're through
Yeah yeah yeah

Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me

But if you stay baby
I tell you what I'm going to do
I'm going to work two jobs, seven days a week
And bring my money home to you
That's right
Have mercy, please
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on me
Yeah
Have mercy
Have mercy, baby
Have mercy
Have mercy on meEmbed
