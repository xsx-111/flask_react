The Last Time Lyrics
Well I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

Well, I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
Guess I'll feel the same tomorrow

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know. Oh no. Oh no

Well I told you once and I told you twice
That someone will have to pay the price
But here's a chance to change your mind
Because I'll be gone a long, long time

Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
Oh no. Oh no

Last time, baby
To see you no more
(Baby the last time)
Not no more
(Baby the last time)
Well not no more
(Baby the last time)
Well not no more
(Baby the last time)
Ah, not no more
(Baby the last time)
Not no more
(Baby the last time)
No, not no more
(Baby the last time)
No, not no more
(Baby the last time)
No, no I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)
I don't know
(Baby the last time)2Embed
