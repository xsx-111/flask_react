Cry to Me Lyrics
When your baby leaves you all alone
And nobody calls you on the phone
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

When you're all alone in your lonely room
And there's nothing but the smell of her perfume
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me

Nothing could be sadder than a glass of wine alone
Loneliness, loneliness, it just a waste of your time
But you don't ever, you don't ever have to walk alone, you see
So come on, take my hand, come on walk with me

When you're waiting for a voice to come
In the night there is no one
Don’t you feel like crying?
Don’t you feel like crying, like crying, like crying?
Come on baby, cry to me
Come on baby, that's right, cry to me
Yes, I want you to come on, baby, come on, come on cry to me
I want you to come on, baby, Come on, come on and cry to me
Yeah, come on baby, come on I want you to cry, cry, cry to me
Yeah I want you to cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
I want you to cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
I want you to come on, shed those tears, shed those tears for me1Embed
