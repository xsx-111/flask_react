Hitch Hike Lyrics
I'm going to Chicago that's the last place my baby stayed
(Hitch hike, hitch hike baby)
I'm packing up my bags, I'm going to leave this town right away
(Hitch hike, hitch hike baby)
I'm going to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby

"Chicago City", that's what the sign on the freeway read
(Hitch hike, hitch hike baby)
I'm going to keep on going till I get to that street's called 6th and Main
(Hitch hike, hitch hike baby)
I've got to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, baby

Come on, hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, children (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike)
Now c'mon hitch hike  (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, darlin'
Hitch hike baby, hitch hike children
Hitch hike baby, hitch hike children
Hitch hike baby

I'm going to St. Louis but my next stop just might be L.A. (Hitch hike)
That's what I say (Hitch hike, baby)
I got no money in my pocket so I'm going to have to hitch hike all the way
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, children (Hitch hike, baby)
I'm going to find that girl if I have to hitch hike around the world
(Hitch hike) Hitch hike, children

Now c'mon hitch hike  (Hitch hike)
Now hitch hike, children (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, baby (Hitch hike)
Now c'mon hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, children
Now c'mon, c'mon hitch hike, baby  (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, children (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, darling (Hitch hike)
C'mon hitch hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, children (Hitch hike)
Hitchin', hitchin' hike (Hitch hike)
Hitch hike, baby
Mm, mm, mm (Hitch hike)
Mm mm, mm mm (Hitch hike)
Mm, mm (Hitch hike)
Mm mm, mm mm (Hitch hike)Embed
