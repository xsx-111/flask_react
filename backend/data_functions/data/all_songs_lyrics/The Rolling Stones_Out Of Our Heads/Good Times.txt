Good Times Lyrics
Whoa la la ta ta
Whoa la la ta ta
La la la all night long
Wanna tell you
Whoa la la ta ta
Whoa la la ta ta
La la la all night long

Come on and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long

The evening sun is sinking low
The clock on the wall says it's time to go
I've got my plans, I don't know about you
I tell you exactly what I'm a-gonna do

Get in the groove and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night long

It might be one o'clock and it might be three
Time don't mean that much to me
Ain't felt this good since I don't know when
I might not feel this good again
So come on and let the good times roll
We gonna stay here to soothe our souls
If it take all night long

All night (All night)
And all night (All night)
And all night (All night)
All night long (All night)
Somebody said it might  (All night) take all night long (All night)
And all night (All night)
And all night (All night)
Oh

C'mon let the good times roll
We gonna stay here till we soothe our souls
If it take all night longEmbed
