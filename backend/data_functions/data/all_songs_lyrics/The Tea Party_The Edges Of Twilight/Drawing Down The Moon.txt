Drawing Down The Moon LyricsYou're holding on
Once again
Take the time to look around
Is it all in vain?
Can't you see?
Stay with me
I need you now
To stop the rains, baby
But you can't see how it feels
Until you've felt the same
Stay with me
Can't you see?
Can't you see?
Don't let me down
You stay with me
Don't let me down
Stay with me
Don't leave me now
Stay with me
When darkness descends
It's all you see
Don't leave me now
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Please, please
You tell me what you want
You got to tell me what you want
She's drawing down the moon
I can see it in her eyes
I think it's too soon
I think she's going to cry
She's drawing down the moon
She better turn away
I think it's too soon
Can't she hear me when I say
You tell me what you want
You got to tell me what you want
Don't let me down
Stay with me
Don't leave me now
Stay with me
When darkness descends
It's all you see
Don't leave me now
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Please, pleaseEmbed
