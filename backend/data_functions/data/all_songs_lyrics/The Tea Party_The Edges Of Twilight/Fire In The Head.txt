Fire In The Head LyricsYou stay
Silent, knowing, always in time
See how this love stays divine
See how this love stays divine
You stay
Silent, knowing, always in time
See how this love stays divine
See how this love stays divine
Sleep here
Hoping, knowing, always in time
See how the love stays divine
See how the love stays divine
This is the way, step inside
And I'm waiting
When I return to her I find
And I'm waiting
Flowers of evil in my mind
And I'm waiting
Dancing with fire on the edge
And I'm waiting
Remembering all of what she said
And I'm waiting
Hoping the rains will wash away
And I'm waiting
Hoping a guide will show the way
And I'm waiting
Dancing with fire on the edge
And I'm waiting
Remembering all of what she said
With this fire in the head
You stay
Silent, knowing, always in time
See how this love stays divine
See how this love stays divine
This is the way, step inside
And I'm waiting
When I return to her I find
And I'm waiting
Flowers of evil in my mind
And I'm waiting
Dancing with fire on the edge
And I'm waiting
Remembering all of what she said
And I'm waiting
Hoping the rains will wash away
And I'm waiting
Hoping a guide will show the way
And I'm waiting
Dancing with fire on the edge
And I'm waiting
Remembering all of what she said
With this fire in the head
Yeah
Sleep here
Hoping, knowing, always in time
See how the love stays divine
See how the love stays divine
This is the way, step insideEmbed
