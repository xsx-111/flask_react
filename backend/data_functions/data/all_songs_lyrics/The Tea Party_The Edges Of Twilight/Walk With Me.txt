Walk With Me LyricsTell me, lady, shining sun
To feel the warmth that comes undone
Do you sleep in sympathy?
And if it's true, walk with me
All of the while you were here
All of this time you were near
And, oh, my dear
Come on, lady, walk with me
Come on, lady, talk to me
Can't you see I'm all alone?
Loneliness I can't condone
Come on, lady, hold my hand
Take me to your shadowland
Sleep a while in sympathy
Come on, lady, walk with me
In the twilight the idols speak
And in the twilight you'll always seek
A sentimental forgotten friend
Who's going to love you until the end
All of the while you were here
All of this time you were near
And, oh, my dear
Come on, lady, walk with me
Come on, lady, talk to me
Can't you see I'm all alone?
Loneliness I can't condone
Come on, lady, hold my hand
Take me to your shadowland
Sleep a while in sympathy
Come on, lady, walk with me
And now you search for the ideals
You'll find a vice that always heals
The open wounds, the bleeding hearts
Yet still they'll say you're torn apart
All of the while I was here
All of this time I was near
And, oh, my dear
Come on, lady, walk with me
Come on, lady, talk to me
Can't you see I'm all alone?
Loneliness I can't condone
Come on, lady, hold my hand
Take me to your shadowland
Sleep a while in sympathy
Come on, lady, you walk
Come on, lady, walk with me
Come on, lady, talk to me
Can't you see I'm all alone?
Loneliness I can't condone
Come on, lady, hold my hand
Take me to your shadowland
Sleep a while in sympathy
Come on, lady, walk with me, yeah
Me, yeah
Me, rightEmbed
