Coming Home LyricsWhen frightened by change
Serenity clings to my sleep
And wonders remain
Their world will inherit its meek
So wicked's the taste
You feel when the mysteries arise
I've fallen from grace
Because of her treacherous eyes
You don't know
So alone
So alone
So alone
And that's why I
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
She's so alone
I'm coming home
And beauty's disdain
Attends to these virtuous lies
She tries to restrain
The ardent and amorous eyes
So wicked's the taste
You feel when mysteries arise
I've fallen from grace
Because of her treacherous eyes
You don't know
So alone
So alone
So alone
And that's why I
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
She's so alone
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
She needs me now
She needs me now
She's so alone
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
So alone
She's so alone
So alone
She's so alone
And that's why I
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
She's so alone
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
She needs me now
She's so alone
I'm coming home
Yeah, I'm coming home
I'm coming home
She's so alone
I'm coming homeEmbed
