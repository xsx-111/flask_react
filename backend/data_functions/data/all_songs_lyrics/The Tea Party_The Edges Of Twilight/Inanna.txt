Inanna LyricsOver the skies and sea, my love
Over the sky and sea
Riding the crest of winds above
Bringing her back to me
Into the starlit sea, my love
Into the moonlit sea
Riding the crest of winds above
I'm begging you stay with me
Would you walk ten miles with me, my love
Would you walk the skies with me?
Would you walk ten miles with me, my love
Inanna
Would you walk ten miles with me, my love
Would you walk the skies with me?
Would you walk ten miles with me?
Inanna, Inanna, Inanna, Inanna
Inanna, InannaEmbed
