The Bazaar LyricsSilence swimming in a pool of dreams
Beneath its depths the forgotten streams
Above the city of the evening star
Behind its walls the grand bazaar
As she walks through its endless maze
Cursing those who mistrust her ways
Please, my friend, no matter what she sees
Tell my lover come back to me
Doorways spilling out their sombre light
Casting shadows that will raid the night
Along the alleys of her ruling fears
Walk the visions that'll cause her tears
Lying still as she wills her glance
Through the eyes of a charmer's trance
Please, my friend, no matter what she sees
Tell my lover come back to me
To me
To me
To me
And on the walls shadows play
Twilight souls, anguished ways
Lost adrift severed seas
I await you, come to me
Silence swimming in a pool of dreams
Beneath its depths the forgotten streams
Above the city of the evening star
Behind its walls the grand bazaar
As she walks through its endless maze
Cursing those who mistrust her ways
Please, my friend, no matter what she sees
Tell my lover come back to me
To me
To me
To meEmbed
