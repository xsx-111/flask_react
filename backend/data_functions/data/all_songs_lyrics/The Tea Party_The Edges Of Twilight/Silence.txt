Silence LyricsSilent spirit walks before me
With her beauty, with her eyes
Heaven help me, I feel I'm fading
I should rest here for a while
In the dreamtime I'm awakened
As my senses seize the night
Heaven help me, I'm forsaken
I should rest here for a while
And lie in the bed you've made, Ophelia
Dry are the lips that lost their taste of love
Drown in the waters that would give you life
Cry as this lamentation thrusts its knife
In silence
In silence
Silence
Silent spirit walks before me
With her beauty and with her eyes
Heaven help me, I feel I'm fading
I should rest here for a while
In silence
In silence
