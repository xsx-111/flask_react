Turn The Lamp Down Low LyricsTurn the lamp down low
Baby, shelter me
Turn the lamp down low
Rising up to see
Turn the lamp down low
Baby, please don't go
Turn the lamp down low
Do you feel a flame that's burning
As the candle dies?
Do you see the spirits stirring
As you close your eyes?
Do you sense the slow advancement
As the twilight thins?
Do you see the serpent dancing
As it sheds its skin?
Turn the lamp down low
Baby, please don't go
Turn the lamp down low
Baby, please
Does the sun renounce its kingdom
As the shadows fall?
Does a fool rejoice in wisdom
When the raven calls?
Do you embrace the dancing clayman
As he tears your flesh?
Do you hear the souls a-screaming
In the serpent's mesh?
Turn the lamp down low
Baby, please don't go
Turn the lamp down low
Baby, please don't go
Oh, yeah, babe, babe, babe, don't go, yeah
Do you need the consolation
Of a dead man's hand?
As the tears of desolation
Flood a dead man's land?
Do you seek your soul's redemption
Under fervent skies?
Don't you see your own reflection
In the serpent's eye?
Turn the lamp down low
Baby, please don't go
Turn the lamp down low, yeah
Don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Oh, yeah, babe, babe, oh, yeah
Oh, baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Don't leave me here
Please
Please
Don't leave me here
Don't leave me here
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go, don't go, don't go, yeah
All right, all rightEmbed
