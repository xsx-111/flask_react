Foreign Affair Lyrics
Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair

Drifting and free
On a mystical sea
A wishful emotion
A drop in the ocean
A hush in the air
You can feel anywhere
In the cool twilight
On a tropical night

Floating on air
Foreign affair
A magical potion
Cool locomotion
(Magical potion)
A dream
(Cool locomotion)
A prayer
(It's a foreign affair!)
Floating on air
Foreign affair
A magical potion
A cool locomotion
(Magical potion)
A dream
(Cool locomotion)
A prayer
(It's a foreign affair!)

Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair
Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair
Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair
Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair
Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair
Foreign affair
Take a trip in the air
To a tropical beach
An island to reach
A new territory
For an intimate story
A lagoon by la mer
It's a foreign affair
