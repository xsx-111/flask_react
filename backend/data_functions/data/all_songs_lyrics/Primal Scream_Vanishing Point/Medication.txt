Medication Lyrics
I get sick of living in the city
Everyone's a liar and a thief
If the cancer don't, the taxman's gonna get you
If the women don't, the doctors let you bleed

I don't wanna hang around with you
Don't wanna see you burn
I don't wanna see you turn blue
I wanna see the sun

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole

Everyone's stepping on each other
Shooting, snorting, smoking all they can
I wish that blood was thicker than water
'Cause drinking dirty water kills a man

I don't wanna hang around with you
Don't wanna see you burn
I don't wanna see you turn blue
I wanna see the sun
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole

I get sick of living in the city
Everyone's a liar and a thief
If the cancer don't, the taxman's gonna get you
If the women don't, the doctors let you bleed

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this hole

Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this hole
Gimme, gimme, gimme medication
Gimme medication to cure this, cure this holeEmbed
