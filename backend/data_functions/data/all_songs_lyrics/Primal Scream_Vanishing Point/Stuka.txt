Stuka Lyrics
I got Jesus in my head like a stinger
He moves from tree to tree in the back of my mind
A ragged shadowy figure, I got him

I got original sin
I got original sin
I got original sin
I got original sin

I got a demon in my head, likes stinger
He moves from tree to tree in the back of my mind
I got a bad seed I gotta feed, I got him

I got original sin
I got original sin
I got original sin
I got original sin

If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned
Some of my friends are gonna die young
If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned
Some of my friends are gonna die young
If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned
Some of my friends are gonna die young
If you play with fire, you're gonna get burned
Some of my friends are gonna die youngEmbed
