Out of the Void Lyrics
I can't slip my skin
I'm full of dust, I'm chemically imbalanced
I'm cancer, bad astrology's the answer

If I were a child again
I'd be holy and not insane
I've got the fear I can't get out of the void
Into the light
Out of the void
Into the light

I'm a scarecrow man
I'm made of rags and straw, I'm paranoid
I can't see or feel or speak, I just hang

I'm so tired, I can't sleep
I'm so hungry, I can't eat
I've got the fear I can't get out of the void
Into the light
Out of the void
Into the light
If I were a child again
I'd be holy and not insane
I've got the fear I can't get out of the void
Into the light
Out of the void
Into the lightEmbed
