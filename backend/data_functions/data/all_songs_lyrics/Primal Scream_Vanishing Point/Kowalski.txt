Kowalski Lyrics
This radio station was named Kowalski
In honor of the last American hero
To whom speed means freedom of the soul
The question is not when he's gonna stop
But who is gonna stop him
Kowalski, vanishing point
Kowalski, vanishing point
Kowalski, vanishing point
Vanishing point, vanishing point, vanishing point
Like a butterfly on a pin
Like a butterfly on a pin
Soul on ice, soul on ice
Soul on ice, soul on ice

There goes the Challenger
Being chased by the blue, blue meanies on wheels
The vicious traffic squad cars are after our lone driver
The last American hero, the, the electric centaur, the demigod
The super driver of the golden west
Two nasty Nazi cars are close behind the beautiful, lone driver
The police know that they're getting closer, closer
Closer to our soul hero in his soul mobile
Yeah, baby, they're about to strike
They're gonna get him, smash him, rape
The last beautiful, free soul on this planet
Vanishing point, vanishing point
Vanishing point, vanishing point
Soul on ice, soul on ice
Soul on ice, soul on ice
Soul on ice, soul on ice, soul on ice

Hello, Kowalski?
Hello, Kowalski?
Hello, Kowalski?
