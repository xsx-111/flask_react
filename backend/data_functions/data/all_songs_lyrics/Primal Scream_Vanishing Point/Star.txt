Star Lyrics
Are you solid, are you solid as a rock?
Have you a strong foundation or can your soul be bought?
It ain't true that everybody's got a price
I sing this song for everyone who stands up for their rights

Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star

Sister Rose, Malcom X and Dr. King
Showed us we got power, showed what changes we could bring
To change society, you have gotta change the law
Their bodies may be gone, but their spirits still live on

Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star

Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
(Rebel souls)

For the dreamers, rebel souls and future days
Be brave and strong, keep keeping on, be conscious in the chaos
The queen of England, there's no greater anarchist
One man's freedom fighter is another's terrorist

Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
Every brother is a star
Every sister is a star
Every brother is a star
Every sister is a starEmbed
