Burning Wheel Lyrics
Through my diseased eyes
I'm sinful, sly, I can't stop stealing
I will pay the price of
Being a thief when I stop breathing

If you could see what I can see
Feel what I feel
When my head is on fire
When I'm a burning wheel

Through my bleeding eyes
I'm filthy, fly, I crawl with insects
I'm anesthetized
I'm demonized, caught in the vortex

If you could see what I can see
Feel what I feel
When my head is on fire
When I'm a burning wheel

I see, I feel
I see, I feel
I see, I feel
I see, I feel
If you could see what I can see
Feel what I feel
When my head is on fire
When I'm a burning wheelEmbed
