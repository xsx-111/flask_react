Funky Big Band Lyrics
And the band plays
And the band plays
And the band plays
And the band plays
And the band plays
And the, and the, and the band plays

People gather 'round at the Lennox Lounge
To hear the funky sounds, baby
The beat hits so hard
There's no cover charge
You have to feel the groove

One thing is, you've got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
He who knows it feels it, got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
We who know it feel it

Harlem is the place, where you'll find the face
Of those, who feel the groove, yeah
It's not taught to thee
But it's born to we
Aww and I feel the groove
One thing is, you've got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
He who knows it feels it, got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
We who know it feel it

And the band plays, from the big band
And the band plays, funky big band

Funky, can you feel it? Oh funky, to be real
Funky, can you feel it? Oh funky, to be real

Got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
He who knows it feels it, got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
We who know it feel it
We who know it
We who know it, feel it
We who know it, we who know it, feel this
Got to be real, we who know it, feel this
We who know it, feel this
We who know it, feel this
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays, and the band plays
And the band plays, and the band plays

Got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
He who knows it feels it, got to be real
If you wanna hear the funky big band
We who know it, feel it, we who know it
We who know it, feel this
We who know it, we who know it, feel this
Got to be real, we who know it, feel this
We who know it, feel this
We who know it, feel this2Embed
