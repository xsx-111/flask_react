Where Are You Now? Lyrics
Love, my love
I regret the day you went away
I was too young to understand my love
But now I realise my mistakes

Where, where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then
Where are you now?
Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else's

Love, oh my love
I wonder if sometimes were you just a dream
I sit in the dark wondering if our paths will ever cross again
Oh Lord, I need to know
I sit and wonder

Where, where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then
Where are you now?
Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else's
If I close my eyes and make a wish
When they open
Will you be right here with me?
Where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then

Could it be that two people were meant to be, yeah, yeah
In my dreams that's what I feel
Could it be that I'll never see you again?
My love that was so true
Still I sit here waiting all alone by the phone for you
Now I understand, now I understand
You said I love you
I sit and wonder

Where? Where are you now?
Now that I'm ready to
Ready to love you
The way you loved me then
Where are you now?
Do you still think of me?
Or does your heart belong to someone else's
(If I close my eyes)
If I close my eyes, (If I make a wish)
And I make a wish
(Tell me baby, Tell me baby)
When they open will you be right here with me
(Where are you now?)
Where are you now? (Where are you now?)
Now that I'm ready to, (ready to, ready to)
Ready to love you the way you loved me then
(I came looking for you)
Where are you now?
(Making exception for you)
Do you still think of me?
(I came looking for you)
Or does your heart belong to someone else's
(well, my baby you know what you do to me)
Where are you now?
(...you now?)2Embed
