Whoops Now Lyrics
Friday morning and all my work is done
I've packed my bags, I'm on the run
I got a feeling that I'm gonna have some
Fun in the sun with my friends
And he's got me going

Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Sorry I can't go, sorry I can't go now

Friday noon and my boss is on the phone
He's telling me that I can't leave home
An extra hand at work is what he called for
He said we need you here
Tell my friends I'm going

Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
I don't know why the job is callin' me in
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
I don't know why the job is callin' me
It makes no difference if you love work or not
If you dream of your weekend
Hand on the doorknob
Out with your friends and fun in the sun
Now that's when the phone rings

Friday evening and I'm all alone at home
I bet my friends are having fun
I'll plan my weekend, dammit, leave the machine on
Next time he calls he'll hear my voice saying loud and clear

Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
I'm out having fun in the sun with my friends
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
Whoops now, sorry I can't go
I'm out having fun in the sun with my friends

With my friends
With my friends
With my friends
With my friends
With Ann and Rusty
Tina and Yuri
Ken and Nancy
Lynette and Tony oh oh oh
Lisa and Jimmy
Gwen and Julie
Kimble and Josie
Tish and Michael oh oh oh
Karyn and Terry
Betta and Katie
Don and Kevin
Ricardo and Puffy oh oh oh
Come on you guys
Anguilla here we come!
Here we come now
To the restaurants
(I'm starving! let's go)
For some lobster
And some sleeping
(Some sleeping?)
And some you know what else
(What else?)
You know!
(No we don't know! Like what else?)
Tiddlywinks
(Tiddlywinks? I thought you were talking about you know what)
What?
(You know!)
I like that part too
