One More Chance Lyrics
Just remember everything I told you
Sorry for the pain that I have caused you
You know it's true, I want to stay
I know you tried to make it what I should have been
You were there to help me when I couldn't have been
I don't know whatever came over me

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me

I just wanna do half of what you do
And I know it seems so strange of me to say this
If there is a hundred ways to say it
All in one, it means, "don't go away"
Everybody's going round tellin' you lies
They don't know how hard that I've tried
You know it takes the pressure, for me to see
Whoo
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me

If you could read my mind, how wonderful it'd be
Heaven's hard to find, and what it means to me is so divine

Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me
Gimme that one more chance
Remember all that we've planned
Gimme that one more chance, for me

I'm gonna prove it
I know we can do this
Whoo
Love's not a playground
I think I let you down
