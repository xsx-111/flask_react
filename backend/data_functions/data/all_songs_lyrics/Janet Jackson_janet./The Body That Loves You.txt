The Body That Loves You Lyrics
Love, sensual physical love
Is waiting here for you
When you unleash my desire

These are the hands that'll touch you
These are the lips that'll kiss you
These are the arms that'll hold you
So come get this body that loves you
Oh, how my heart does miss you

Love, stroke me so gently my love
I love it when you mmm
When you release my desire

These are the hands that'll touch you
These are the lips that'll kiss you
These are the arms that'll hold you
So come get this body that loves you
Oh, how my heart does miss you

Baby my heart is aching
My body longs for you
Candle light and wine are waiting
Create the mood for
Love, sensual physical love
Is waiting here for you
When you unleash my desire

These are the hands that'll touch you
These are the lips that'll kiss you
These are the arms that'll hold you
So come get this body that loves you
Oh, how my heart does miss you

As I behold you with my eyes
They'll undress you and
You'll undress me too
I want to feel you move inside
Oh, how I long for your

Love, sensual physical love
Is waiting here for you
When you unleash my desire

These are the hands that'll touch you
These are the lips that'll kiss you
These are the arms that'll hold you
So come get this body that loves you
Oh, how my heart does miss you
Love, stroke me so gently my love
I love it when you mmm
When you release my desire (desire)

These are the hands that'll touch you
These are the lips that'll kiss you
These are the arms that'll hold you
So come get this body that loves you
Oh, how my heart does miss you

"Undress me, oh, slowly"
These are the hands that'll touch you
"I want to kiss you all over, is that okay?"
These are the lips that'll kiss you
"We embrace skin to skin"
These are the arms that'll hold you
"Hold me, oh baby, my body's arched for you"
So come get this body that loves you
"Come here, I missed you so much
I forgot how good it could feel"
Oh, how my heart does miss you
"Please make love to me"
Come get the body that loves you1Embed
