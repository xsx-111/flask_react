Sacrificial Bonfire Lyrics
Fire they cried
So evil must die
And yields are good
So men pull back hoods
And smile
The scapegoat blood spilled
Spittled and grilled
It crackled and spat
And children grew fat
On the meat
Change must be earned

Sacrificial bonfire
Must burn
Burn up the old
Ring in the new
Burn up the old
Ring in the new

Assembled on high
Silhouette against the sky
The smoke prayed and pranced
And sparks did their dance
In the wind
It's disguises wore thin
With less and less skin
And the clothes that were draped
Was all that told man
From ape
Change must be earned

Sacrificial bonfire
Must reign
Reign over good
Banish the bad
Reign over good
Banish the bad
