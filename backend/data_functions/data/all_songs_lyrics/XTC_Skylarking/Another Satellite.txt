Another Satellite Lyrics
My heart is taken, it's not lost in space
And I don't want to see your mooney, mooney face
I say, "Why on Earth do you revolve around me?
Aren't you aware of the gravity?"
Don't need another satellite

I'm happy standing on my feet of clay
I have no wish to swim your Milky, Milky Way
I say, "Why on Earth do you send your letters 'round here
Only to gum up the atmosphere?"
Don't need another satellite

So circling we'll orbit another year
Two worlds that won't collide
So circling we'll orbit another year
Moon still tries to steal the tide away

Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satellite
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satellite
Abort your mission let's just say you tried
Before you glimpse I have a darker, darker side
I say, "Why in Heaven's name do you come on these trips
Only to freeze in a total eclipse?"
Don't need another satellite

So circling we'll orbit another year
Two worlds that won't collide
So circling we'll orbit another year
Moon still tries to steal the tide away
Don't need another satellite

Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satellite
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satellite
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satellite
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satellite
Fa-fa-fa, fa-fa-fa, ta-ta-ta
Don't need another satelliteEmbed
