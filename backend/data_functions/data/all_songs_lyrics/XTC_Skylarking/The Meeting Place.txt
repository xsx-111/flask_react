The Meeting Place Lyrics
Meet you in the secret place
Scuffling in the dirt, I wait
Whistle will blow
Whistle will blow

Share a joke, the laugh's on me
When I get you on your own, we'll see
Someone might hear
Someone might hear

You're a working girl, now
You've got money of your own

Hm, hm, the meeting place
Hm, hm, the meeting place

Strolling under grimy skies
(Feel the smoke get in your eyes)
Machines that make you kiss in time
Smoke on your breath (Hm)
Smoke on your breath
Chimney never looked so good
(Never looked the way it should)
From lying in the bracken wood
Coat on the ground (Hm)
Coat on the ground

(Hm) Take a walk down the lane
(Hm) We'll be late back again

Hm, hm, the meeting place
Hm, hm, the meeting place
Hm, hm, the meeting place
Hm, hm, the meeting place
Hm, hmEmbed
