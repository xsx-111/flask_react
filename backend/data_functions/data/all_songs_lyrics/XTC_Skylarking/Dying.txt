Dying Lyrics
It frightens me when you come to mind
The day you dropped in the shopping line
And my heart beats faster when I think of all the signs
All the signs

When they carried you out your mouth was open wide
The cat went astray and the dog did pine for days and days
And I felt so guilty when we played you up
When you were ill, so ill

What sticks in my mind
Is the sweet jar on the sideboard
And your multicoloured tea cozy
What sticks in my mind
Is the dew-drop hanging off your nose
Shrivelled up and blue

And I'm getting older, too
But I don't want to die like you
Don't want to die like you
Don't want to die like you
(Don't want to die like you)
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die like you
Don't want to die like youEmbed
