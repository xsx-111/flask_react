Dear God Lyrics
Dear God, hope you got the letter and...
I pray you can make it better down
Here
I don't mean a big reduction in the
Price of beer
But all the people that you made in your image, see them
Starving on their feet
'Cause they don't get enough to eat
From God
Can't believe in
You

Dear God, sorry to disturb you but...
I feel that I should be heard loud and
Clear
We all need a big reduction in amount
Of tears
And all the people that you made in your image, see them
Fighting in the street
'Cause they can't make opinions meet
About God
I can't believe in
You
Did you make
Disease
And the diamond blue?
Did you make man-
Kind
After we made you?
And the devil
Too!

Dear God, don't know if you noticed but...
Your name is on a lot of quotes in
This book
And us crazy humans wrote it, you should take a
Look
And all the people that you made in your image
Still believing that junk is true
Well, I know it ain't, and so do you
Dear God
I can't believe in
I don't believe in

I won't believe in Heaven and Hell
No saints, no sinners, no devil as well
The pearly gates, no thorny crown
You're always letting us humans down
The wars you bring, the babes you drown
Those lost at sea and never found
And it's the same the whole world round
The hurt I see helps to compound
That Father, Son and Holy Ghost
Is just somebody's unholy hoax
And if you're up there you'd perceive
That my heart's here upon my sleeve
If there's one thing, I don't believe in
It's you
