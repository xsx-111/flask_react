Season Cycle Lyrics
Season cycle moving round and round
Pushing life up from a cold dead ground
It's growing green
It's growing green, well

Darling, don't you ever stop to wonder (Ooh)
About the clouds about the hail and thunder (Ooh)
'Bout the baby and its umbilical
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?

(Summer chased by Autumn)
(Autumn chased by Winter)

Season cycle go from death to life (Winter chased by Springtime)
Bring a harvest or a man his wife (Springtime's turning)
It's growing green
It's growing green, well

Darling, don't you ever sit and ponder
(Darling did you ever think?)
About the building of the hills a yonder
(All this life stuff's closely linked)
Where we're going in this verdant spiral?
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?
Round and round and round and round
I really get confused on who would make all this
(Is there a God in Heaven?)
Everybody says join our religion get to heaven
I say, "No thanks," why bless my soul?
I'm already there
Autumn is royal
As Spring is clown
(But to repaint summer) To repaint Summer
They're closing winter down
(Ooh)

Darling, don't you ever stop to wonder
(Darling, did you ever think?)
About the clouds about the hail and thunder?
(All this life stuff's closely linked)
About the baby and its umbilical?
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle? (Season cycle)
Darling, don't you ever sit and ponder
(Darling did you ever think?)
About the building of the hills a yonder?
(All this life stuff's closely linked)
Where we're going in this verdant spiral
Who's pushing the pedals on the season cycle?
Push it, push it, push it, yeah
Darling, don't you ever stop to wonder
(Darling, did you ever think?)
About the clouds about the hail and thunder?
(All this life stuff's closely linked)
About the baby and its umbilical?
Push itEmbed
