1000 Umbrellas Lyrics
One thousand umbrellas upturned couldn't catch all the rain
That drained out of my head when you said we were
Over and over I cried 'til I floated downstream
To a town they call misery, oh-oh, misery
Misery, oh-oh, misery
And one million teacups I bet couldn't hold all the wet
That fell out of my eyes when you fell out with me
Now I'm crawling the wallpaper that's looking more like a roadmap
To misery, oh-oh, misery

How can you smile and forecast?
Weather's getting better
And you'll soon forget her if you let the sunshine come through
How can you smile and forecast?
Weather's getting better
If you never let a girl rain all over you
And just when I thought that my vista was golden in hue
One thousand umbrellas opened to spoil the view

One million salt seas recalled from school atlas
Alas, would be filled to the brim, Sunny Jim couldn't jump it
How can I be pleased when I'm handed the keys
To a town they call Misery?
Oh-oh, Misery
So with a mop and a bucketI'll just say forget her and carry on sweeping up
Where I've been weeping, the Jesters will creep in
To strike down the newly crowned Monarch
Of Misery, oh-oh, Misery
How can you smile and forecast?
Weather's getting better
And you'll soon forget her if you let the sunshine come through
How can you smile and forecast?
Weather's getting better
If you never let a girl rain all over you
Just when I thought that my skies were a June-July blue

One thousand umbrellas opened (Oh)
Two thousand umbrellas opened (Oh)
Ten thousand umbrellas opened to spoil the viewEmbed
