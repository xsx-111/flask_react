Movie (Never Made) LyricsOn silver Mount Zion
All buried in ruins
We was dancing the hora
Until we vomited blood
Spinning like crazy
Shoshana was jonesing
The towers had fallen
And the wind called out my grandfather's name
Let's kill first the banker
With his professional demeanor
Let's televise and broadcast
The raping of kings
Let our crowds be fed on
Teargas and plate-glass
Cause a people united
Is a wonderful thing
I know that you're dying
And I know I'm unwell
And together we sashay
Through variations of hell
And as you walk through valleys of fear
The lure of my bed is ever near
Oh, don't be afraid, though the parade
Will not pass our way
It's nobler to never get paid
Than to bank on shit and dismay1Embed
