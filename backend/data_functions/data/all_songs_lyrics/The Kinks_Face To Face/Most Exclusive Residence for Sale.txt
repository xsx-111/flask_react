Most Exclusive Residence for Sale Lyrics
The biggest house in the neighborhood
He went and bought this house when he made good
Ten bedrooms and a swimming pool
Where he entertained all the people that he knew

But he hit the hard times, had to sell out
Most exclusive residence for sale

He went and spent all the money that he had (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
He had a heart and not a head (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
He spent it all on girls and fancy jewelry (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
Then he found himself in front of a judge and jury (Ba, ba-ba, ba)

And the judge said to pay up, or you must sell out
Most exclusive residence for sale

He had to tell all the servants to go away (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
Couldn't even afford to pay their way (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
He took to the bottle and drunk himself down (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
Then he soaked away all the troubles and let them drown (Ba, ba-ba, ba)
Then he saw a notice on the wall
Most exclusive residence for sale
Most exclusive residence for sale
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la, la
La, la-la, la, la-la, la, la, laEmbed
