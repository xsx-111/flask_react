We Walk the Same Line Lyrics
If you lose your faith, babe, you can have mine
And if you're lost I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line

Now I don't have to tell you
How slow the night can go
I know you've watched for the light
And I bet you could tell me
How slowly four follows three
And you're most forlorn just before dawn

So if you loose your faith babe
You can have mine
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line
When it's dark baby
There's a light I'll shine
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line

And I don't need reminding
How loud the phone can ring
When you're waiting for news
And that big old moon
Lights every corner of the room
Your back aches from lying
And your headaches from crying
So if you lose your faith babe
You can have mine
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line
When it's dark baby
There's a light I'll shine
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line

And if these troubles
Should vanish like rain on midday
Well I've no doubt there'll be more
And we can't run and we can't cheat
Cause babe when we meet
What we're afraid of
We find out what we're made of

So if you lose your faith babe
You can have mine
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line
When it's dark baby
There's a light I'll shine
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line, yeah
Can walk the same line
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line, yeah
And if you're lost, I'm right behind
Cause we walk the same line, yeah
Walk the same line, yeahEmbed
