Disenchanted Lyrics
Look at you now, you're disenchanted
Can't believe how things can change
Take a little out of life and things get strange
And now you find the wishes you were granted
Things you thought were in your hands
Have slipped away
How much can you withstand?

The wasted time, the money spent
A sign that reads 'For Sale or Rent'
And everything is at a standstill
And where's someone who'll be on hand till
You're no longer disenchanted
Thinking everything is wrong?
You know you're not the only one to wait so long
I wonder, can you try again?
Are you that strong?Embed
