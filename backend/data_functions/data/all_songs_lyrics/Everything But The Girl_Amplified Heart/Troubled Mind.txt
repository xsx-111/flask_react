Troubled Mind Lyrics
Don't say one thing one day
Then something else the next day
I'm trying to keep up with you
It's hard enough when you speak clearly
But when you're confused
It's like a goods train running through these rooms

And I'm reading more into your words than you have put into them
And that's my problem, but you tied these knots
Now you undo them, you undo them
Oh think before you speak my darling

Cause with your troubled mind
You're like a goods train running through my life
Cause with your troubled mind
You're like a goods train running through my life

We all walk through these world alone
We keep ourselves untouched unknown
You look up to the sky above you, read this there
I love you...Oh its written there you know I love you
Love you...love you...love you
But with your trouble mind
You're like a goods train running through my life
Cause with your troubled mind
You're like a goods train running through my life

And when you're down your bring me down too
And, babe, that's something I would not do
I know its hard yeah I know its hard
And, babe, that's something I don't disregard
I said, I don't disregard

With your troubled mind
You're like a goods train running through my life
Cause with your troubled mind
You're like a goods train running through my life

With your troubled mind
You know I love you
Love you...love you...love you
With your troubled mind
You know I love you
Love you...love you...love you
With your troubled mind
You're like a goods train running through my life
With your troubled mind
You know I love you
Love you...love you...love youEmbed
