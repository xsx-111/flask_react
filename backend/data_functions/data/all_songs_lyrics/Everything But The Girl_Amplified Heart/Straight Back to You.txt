Straight Back to You Lyrics
I was sixteen when the story began
And you used to say come as soon as you can
And I'd leave right away with the stars up above
The karma stopped and I was in love

And I'd come straight back to you
At the sound of your name
Straight back to you
To see you again
And you'd leave me a light
And I'd find my way
Straight back to you to stay...

When I was eighteen
There's the story unfolds
And I moved away though the house was unsold
And the day that I left, you gave me a ring
We weren't engaged but it meant something

For I'd have gone straight back to you
If I felt that I could
Straight back to you
To your neighborhood
And you'd leave me a light
And I'd find my way
Straight back to you to stay...
When I was twenty things gradually turned bad
And I should have left then and I wish that I had
But you say to yourself that things will improve
And they never do and it's then that you lose

For I'd have gone straight back to you
If I thought things would change
Straight back to you
The past you exchanged
And you'd leave me a light
And I'd find my way
Straight back to you to stay...hey

When I turned twenty-one things came to an end
And you live with someone who was once just a friend
And before I left I did one last thing
I came to your house and brought out the ring

And gave it straight back to you
Though I felt no remorse
Straight back to you
And then love ran its course
And you left me alive
And I found my way
Straight out of there and away
Straight out of there and away
Straight out of there and awayEmbed
