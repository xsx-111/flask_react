Two Star Lyrics
Well it's not for me to say
But I can't see what you see in him anyway
But such righteousness in me
Is not a nice thing to display
And who am I for chrissakes anyway
To judge a life this way

When my own's in disarray?
My own's in disarray?
My own's in disarray?

I watch Saturday kid's TV with the sound turned down
I leave food on the eiderdown
All my thoughts pushed underground
Maybe you're happy - everyone says you are
You drive around on Two Star
You leave your life ajar, and God knows
You deserve it
Bad luck follows everyone

So go on, and stop listening to me
Stop listening to me
And don't ask me how I feel
Don't ask me how I feel
So it's not for me to say
Because I change my mind from day to day
And when I look at you
I only see bits of myself anyway

So go on, and stop listening to me
Stop listening to me
And don't ask me what to say, or to judge a life this way

When my own's in disarray?
My own's in disarray?
My own's in disarray?Embed
