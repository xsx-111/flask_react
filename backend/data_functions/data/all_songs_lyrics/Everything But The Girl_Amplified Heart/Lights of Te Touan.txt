Lights of Te Touan Lyrics
Imagine waking unaware
The light of heaven touched your hair
Morning struggled sun was here and gone
Born into empty air the signals changed the engines flared
There's a place you know I'm always there

Ride on the early train past the wedding in the rain
They closed the opened door and the white smoke blew away
And never made a dumb mistake
To eat your orange and your cake
But never say your good luck isn't there

If i could speak with you about a hundred things I'd say
Dear friend it's true all that you say

And these days that passed through time
You closed your eyes you could see the lights of te touan shine
In the morning you were drinking again
And born into wealth and care
Imagine waking unaware and there's a place you know i never dare

If i could speak with you it sure a hundred years away
Dear friend it's true all that you say
And never made a dumb mistake
So eat your orange and your cake
But never say your good luck isn't there
Hey...never say your good luck isn't thereEmbed
