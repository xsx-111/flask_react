Rollercoaster Lyrics
I still haven't got over it even now
I want to spend huge amounts of time on my own
I don't want to cause any serious damage
I want to make sure that I can manage

Because I'm not really in your head
I'm not really in your head

And I see love and disaffection
And the clouds build up and won't pass over
This is my road to my redemption
And my life is just an image of a rollercoaster anyway

I still haven't got over it even now
I want to spend huge amounts of time in my room
And I'm not coming out until I feel I'm ready
I'm not running out while my heart's unsteady

And I'm not really in your head
I'm not really in your head
When your sky falls to minus zero
Well some things must disappear
Oh this is my road to my redemption
And my life is just an image of a rollercoaster anyway
And the names may have been changed but the faces are the same
And the names may have been changed but as people we're not the same

And I'm not, no I'm not, no I'm not
Really in your head

And my life is just an image of a rollercoaster anyway
Yeah, my life is just an image of a rollercoaster anyway1Embed
