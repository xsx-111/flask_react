Walking to You Lyrics
I met your boyfriend on St. Martin's Lane
And he said, "Fancy running into you again"
We talked a minute or so, then he turned to go
And I walked into the crowd again

And the morning was a different place
In every passerby I saw your face
Love leaves a lonely ghost
With one thought uppermost
- is this the case in every case?

Am I walking to you?
Am I walking to you?
In everything that I do
Am I just walking to you?

It was seven years ago to the day
You rang my house and we met halfway
We walked 'round Leicester Square and
Sat through 'Being There' and every moment of it I replay

And I was desperate for love to be pure
Though what that meant, I never was sure
You spent your time on me
I took it willingly
And I made you trust in literature
Am I walking to you?
Am I walking to you?
In everything that I do
Am I just walking to you?
I just don't know what to do

I just don't know what to do
I just don't know what to do
In everything that I do
Am I just walking to you?
I just don't know what to do
I just don't know what to do
In everything that I do
Am I just walking to you?

I just don't know what to do
Am I walking to you?
I just don't know what to do
Am I walking to you?
I just don't know what to do
Am I walking to you?
I just don't know what to do
Am I walking to you?Embed
