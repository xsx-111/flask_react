Get Me Lyrics
I never thought I'd grow up so fast, so far
To know yourself is to let yourself be loved

And I wanna be addicted
I wanna be secure
I wanna wake up after the night before
But do you get me?
Do you ever get me?

And I'll press your hand against my face
Weaken my resistance
And I'll pull the sheets over our heads
Let the broken sky break above our heads

And I wanna be addicted
I wanna be secure
I wanna wake up after the night before
But do you get me?
Do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?

Shower me with affection and I'll return in kind
I have no hidden motive, I am blind
I'm a stone inside a box
I'm a spring inside a clock
You can wear me on your wrist
And I'll tell you things ten thousand times
But do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?
Do you ever get me?Embed
