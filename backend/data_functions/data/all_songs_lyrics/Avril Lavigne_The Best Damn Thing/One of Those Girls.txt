One of Those Girls Lyrics
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

I know your kind of girl
You only care about one thing
Who you seen or where you been
Who's got money
I see that look in your eyes
It tells a million lies
But deep inside, I know why
You're talkin' to him

I know what you're all about
I really hope he figures it out

She's one of those girls, nothing but trouble
Just one look, and now you're seein' double
Before you know it, she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it comin'
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothin'
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one
Oh, oh, oh
Off to the next one
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh-oh

She's gonna be the end of you
At least that's what they say
It's been a while, you're in denial
And now it's too late
The way she looks
It makes you hide all the warning signs
'Cause her blonde hair, her blue eyes
It makes you wanna die

I know what she's all about
I really hope you figure it out

She's one of those girls, nothing but trouble
Just one look, and now you're seein' double
Before you know it, she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it comin'
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothin'
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one
You know it's a game, you know it's a game (Yeah, yeah)
She keeps playin' around with your head (Your head)
Playin' around with your head (Head)
She's so insane, so insane (Yeah, yeah)
She's the one to blame (To blame)
She's the one to blame

She's one of those girls, nothing but trouble
Just one look, and now you're seein' double
Before you know it, she'll be gone
Off to the next one
She's so good that you won't see it comin'
She'll take you for a ride and you'll be left with nothin'
You'll be broken, she'll be gone
Off to the next one

Oh, oh, oh
Off to the next one
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Off to the next oneEmbed
