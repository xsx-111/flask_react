Morning Dessert (Intro) Lyrics
Good morning
Time to get ready for work (Ha ha)
I've been waiting (Ha ha)
Get up, morning love, time to get ready for work
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

You might be a little late, I donâ€™t think an hour will hurt
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Touch me here, touch me there
Let me give you morning dessert
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm not hungry for food, all I want is you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) All I want, baby

Time to get ready for work
Are you ready for me?
Let's go2Embed
