Bobblehead Lyrics
When you talk, all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk, all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah

Girls like you give girls a bad name
Tryna get a boy, but you sound so lame
Thinking it's cute to act real dumb
But the jokes on you, you're stupid hun
Hold up, hold up, you're making no sense
You're talking out your ass like a wobblehead
You bobblehead
Just keep your trap shut like your Mama said

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead?

When you talk, all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk, all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
But wait, like, I don't get it
He, he, ha, I don't care what you looking at
Body so skinny, but your head's so fat
Talky, talky, talky, but you don't say shit
Got a way with words, you give me nothing, bitch
Banging on the door, nobody else there
You're nightmare on Elm Street, got everybody scared
Make me wanna run when you coming around
Because (Oh, wait what?), it's a frightening sound

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead?

When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
But wait, like, like, what, like, like what?
I don't get it, like, what, what, really?
Hanging with the girls, makes you feel unsure
So you hang with the boys, makes you feel secure
Act all catty because you hate competition
Rather like a sheep on your airhead mission
Laugh in you face, but behind your back
They say, "I kind of like her booty, but the girl is whack"
You see the boys, the boys, they love me
Think you're a pain in your butt? Know what? You're crazy

Why, oh, why pretend?
I know you got a brain, why don't you use it?
Why, oh, why pretend?
If you so smart, why you act brain dead?

When you talk, all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
When you talk, all I hear is
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah
But wait like, I don't get it
And the real girls say...
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top
I never play dumb to get what I want
And always come out the one that's on top

I donâ€™t get it2Embed
