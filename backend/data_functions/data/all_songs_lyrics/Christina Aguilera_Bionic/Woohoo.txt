Woohoo

You know you really wanna (Hey), wanna taste my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna get a peek, wanna see my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are (Woohoo)
Kiss on my (Woohoo), all over my (Woohoo)
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my (Woohoo)
You don't even need a plate, just your face, ha (Woohoo)
Licky-licky yum-yum, what a great guy (Woohoo)
Now kiss on my (Woohoo) all over my (Woohoo)
Kiss on my, all over my
Kiss on my, all over my

Feel lights on me everywhere I go (Woohoo)
Like a little boy up in the candy store (Woohoo)
C-c-craving to get ya hands on (Woohoo)
Give it up before Mama says 'no' (Woohoo)
I'mma let you get a little closer (Woohoo)
Even though I ain't supposed to (Woohoo)
I like it strong when it's longer
I'm a little tipsy, play along with me (Woohoo)
You know you really wanna (Hey), wanna taste my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna get a peek, wanna see my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are (Woohoo)
Kiss on my (Woohoo), all over my (Woohoo)
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my (Woohoo)
You don't even need a plate, just your face, ha (Woohoo)
Licky-licky yum-yum, what a great guy (Woohoo)
Now kiss on my (Woohoo) all over my (Woohoo)
Kiss on my, all over my
Kiss on my, all over my

Pick your glass up, you're sippin' kinda slow
Wanna see just how you take it down low
Hurry up, I wanna see a bit more
Take it off before mama gets bored
I know that you love me long time, yeah
You wanna take it for a ride, yeah
I'm feelin' bad and I like it
I'm a little tipsy, play along with me, hey

You know you really wanna (Hey), wanna taste my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna get a peek, wanna see my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are (Woohoo)
Kiss on my (Woohoo), all over my (Yeah) (Woohoo)
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my (Woohoo)
You don't even need a plate, just your face, ha (Woohoo)
Licky-licky yum-yum, what a great guy (Woohoo)
Now kiss on my (Woohoo) all over my (Woohoo)
Kiss on my, all over my
Kiss on my, all over my
All the ladies up in the place (Yeah), it's your turn (Come on now)
Give the fellas a little taste (Yeah) of how it works
I know I probably shouldn't but, uh, I'm feeling good (Oh)
I'm a little tipsy, play along with me (Woohoo)

Okay, guess who got that mhm-mhm nani-nani (Woohoo)
In the Mondrian, mhm-mhm, in Miami (Woohoo)
Who's Galliano, whip-whip the Armani (Woohoo)
When it drip-drip, lick-lick like a lolly (Woohoo)
Or, left from Jamaica, go a foreign pan tour (Woohoo)
Jimmy Iovine, Tom Whalley and Lyor (Woohoo)
Keep me and Chrissy in Christian Dior (Woohoo)
But that was before (Woohoo), or, for you
My name Nicki, little daddy, and you? (Woohoo)
You can do anything you put your mind to (Woohoo)
Way you French kiss it, "Fran√ßais, parlez-vous?" (Woohoo)
Way you work your tongue, can I hire you? (Woohoo)

You know you really wanna (Hey), wanna taste my (Yeah)
You know you want to get a peek, wanna see my (Woohoo)
You know you wanna put your lips where my hips are (Woohoo)
Kiss on my (Woohoo) all over my (Woohoo)
All the boys think it's cake when they taste my (Woohoo)
You don't even need a plate, just your face, ha (Woohoo)
Licky-licky yum-yum, what a great guy (Woohoo)
Now kiss on my (Woohoo) all over my (Woohoo)
Kiss on my, all over my
Kiss on my, all over my
You wanna taste my (Woohoo)
You wanna taste my (Woohoo)
You wanna see my (Woohoo)
(You ready?) (Woohoo)
All my ladies say (Woohoo)
If you gotta great (Woohoo)
Let him get a peek (Woohoo)
If you gotta sweet (Woohoo)
Let me hear you scream (Woohoo)
But bitches keep it clean (Woohoo)
