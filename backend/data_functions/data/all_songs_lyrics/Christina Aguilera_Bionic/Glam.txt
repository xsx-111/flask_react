Glam Lyrics
Let's get glam
Glam (Glam, glam, glam)
Let's get glam
Glam (Glam, glam)

Walk, turn, pose, stop
Give 'em what you got (What you got, what you got)
Work those hips, side to side
Get that angle right (Right)
Paint your face like a movie queen
A naughty dream or a fantasy
Anything goes, gotta be the scene
Create your look, out a fashion book
Ready, set, now go

Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all in how you move
Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all an attitude
Now snap
Now snap
Here we go
Blush on, lashes long
Mascara strong (Strong, strong)
Lips, eyes, cheeks, face
Give it style, grace (Grace, grace)
Better be ready for your photo op (Op, op)
Step in the light for your perfect close up (Close up)
Be superficial, it's your one shot (Shot, shot)
Unleash the diva deep inside
Ready, set, now go (Bitches)

Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all in how you move
Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all an attitude
Now snap
Now snap
Here we go

Runway on fire, fashion Gods inspire
Lose control, inhibitions run wild
Get on the floor in your best couture
Come on and take me higher
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam (Oh)
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam (Oh)
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam (Oh)
Live it, love it, breathe it, work it, glam (Oh)
Now snap
Now clap
Now dance
Now stop
Let's get glam
Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all in how you move
Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all an attitude (Fashion is a lifestyle)
Let's get glam (Glam), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Glam), it's all in how you move
Let's get glam (Whoa), don't let the clothes wear you
Let's get glam (Whoa), it's all an attitude (Fashion is a lifestyle)

Glam
Let's get glam, it's all in how you move
Let's get glam
Let's get glam, it's all an attitude
(Attitude, attitude, attitude...)5Embed
