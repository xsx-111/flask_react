I Am (Stripped) Lyrics
I am timid
And I am oversensitive
I am a lioness
I am tired and defensive
You take me in your arms
And I fall into you
I have insecurities
You show me I am beautiful

Love me or leave me
Just take it or leave it
It's not that I'm needy
Just need you to see me

Take me, free me, see through to the core of me
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending
Mmmm

I am temperamental
And I have imperfections
And I am emotional
I am unpredictable
I am naked
I am vulnerable
I am a woman
I am opening up to you
Love me or leave me
Just take it or leave it
It's not that I'm needy
Just need you to see me

Take me, free me, see through to the core of me
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending

Now I stand before you with my heart in my hands
I'm asking you to take me just the way that I am
Please lay down your arms
Do you know me? Make me feel safe from harm

Oh, just take me, free me, see through to the core of me
(See through)
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending

(Take me, free me) I am temperamental
(See through to the core of me) And I have imperfections
(Take me, free me) And I am emotional
There'll be no more pretending
Mmhmm1Embed
