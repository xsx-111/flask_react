My Girls Lyrics
My girls wear lipstick while they're making my beats
They got guitar picks in their purses, Louboutins on their feet
They got no time for waiting in lines
They got sex and 808s running through their dirty minds

My girls, we're running the show
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go
My girls, 'cause that's the way that we roll
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control
Now shout, my girls, we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun (Come on!)

My girls headed to the city, y'all
We got Cosmo on the dash and tickets on the floor
We got Sia, and Rola, and Peaches too
We got Johanna and JD and we're coming for you, my girls
(My girls)

My girls, we're running the show
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go
My girls, 'cause that's the way that we roll
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control
Now shout, my girls, we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes we got to have fun (Come on!)
My girls are screaming, and yelling, and gettin' loud
My girls are shaking up the party while you're gettin' down
My girls are singin', and dancin' and havin' fun
My girls are cooking up a beat, and they want you to come

You ready, Christina?
I like my girls hot, sweet, tough, or playmate
808, trainable primate
Self-reliant, giant, death-defiant
No Kobe Bryant
I'll take a bullet for you
If you give me a taste
I rock a mullet or two
Yeah, below the waist
You're my BFF, you're my 606, 303
I'ma swing and handle my fix

My girls stay close when there's some trouble around
They got jewels on their fingers, it's about to go down
We got no time for haters you know, we just came to party
Come on, now here we go

My girls, we're running the show
My girls, we're teasing all the boys on the go
My girls, 'cause that's the way that we roll
My girls, so ladies step it up and take control
Now shout, my girls we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes we gotta have fun
My girls we're stronger than one
Now shout, and sometimes, now shout, we gotta have fun1Embed
