Lift Me Up Lyrics
So the pain begins
As the music fades
And I'm left here with
With more than I can take

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try

When the static clears
And all is said and done
I will realize
That we all need someone

If you lift me up
Just get me through this night
I know I'll rest tomorrow
And I'll be strong enough to try

So when you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all?
If you lift me up (Oh, oh)
If you lift me up
Oh, oh
Ooh, oh
Higher
Oh
Higher
Ooh, yeah
Higher

Said if you lift me up
When you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all?
Will you lift me even higher? (Whoa, oh)
If you see me crashing and there's nowhere left to fall
(When you see me crashing)
Will you lift me even higher?
To rise above this all? (Will you lift me even higher?)
When you see me crashing
And there's nowhere left to fall
Will you lift me even higher
To rise above this all?

If you lift me up
Said if you lift me up
If you lift me up
Just get me through this night4Embed
