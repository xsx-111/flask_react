Bionic Lyrics
This is the moment that I take over your mind frame
Step into the picture that I paint using my brain game
I'll elevate you so high I'll give you a migraine
Over and over, put it on replay, till you're insane
This is a roller coaster that's about to be long gone
Once you jump in, won't wanna get off, buckle up and hold on
Just let it go, give it up, allow yourself to transform
Follow me, follow me to a place unknown of no return

Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?
Are you ready, ready, ready to go-g-g-go?

Bionic, take ya supersonic, eh
I'm bionic; hit ya like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh
Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh
Bionic, take ya supersonic, eh
I'm bionic; hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh
Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh

I-I-I-I-I am the future, put it on you like a hurricane
Call me the supernova that's taking over all time and space
I'm testing your dimension, can't keep up with what I create
I'll break your concentration, imagination with what I make
Many times imitated, not duplicated; can't be replaced
N-n-now, let me spell it out
Everybody come shout my name
X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-N-A (Say)
X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A-(Say)-A-A-(Say)
Are you ready, ready, ready to go, g-g-go?

Bionic, take ya supersonic, eh
I'm bionic; hit ya like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh
(Bi-on-ic)

Bionic, take ya supersonic, eh
I'm bionic, hit ya like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh
Bionic, take ya supersonic, eh
I'm bionic; hit ya like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh
Bionic, so damn bionic
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh

Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh
Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh
Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh
Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh
Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh
Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh
Eh-ay-yeh, oh oh oh, eh-ay-yeh4Embed
