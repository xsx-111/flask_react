Sex for Breakfast Lyrics
Tossin' and turnin' makes my appetite keep growing stronger
All night long
Anticipating mornin' light and I can't wait much longer
Feels so strong

Our bodies touchin', I just can't get enough
I wanna love ya (Love ya), love you (Love you), love you, eh
Won't let you sleep, I gotta satisfy my needs
I need to love you (Love you), love you (Love you), love you, eh

And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right

Might be late for work
But I promise that it's worth it, baby, don't go
So hungry for you, taste me and I'll taste you
There's no stopping what I'll do to get you in the mood

Our bodies touchin', I just can't get enough
I wanna love ya (Love ya), love you (Love you), love you, eh
Won't let you sleep, I want you deep inside of me
So I can love ya (Love you), love you (Love you), love you, eh
And when the sun rises (When it rises, baby)
There's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside
And even though we made sweet love all night
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right

And I can see break of day begin through the curtains
And I'm so certain
Soon I'm gonna feel your honey drip, my juices start to flow
A strawberry cream is like a dream, my fantasy is reality
When the morning comes, I know that I will too

And when the sun rises (Sun rises)
There's one thing on my mind (I need it)
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside (Stay inside me, baby)
And even though we made sweet love all night (We made sweet love)
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right (Oh, it feels so good inside)
And when the sun rises, there's one thing on my mind
I want sex for breakfast, stay inside (I need it, I want it when the morning comes)
And even though that we made sweet love all night (We made love all night)
I need sex for breakfast, it feels so right

So hungry for you
Taste me, and I'll taste you
Alright
Sex for breakfast
All done
Sex for breakfast (Feels so right)7Embed
