Prima Donna Lyrics
Tonight it's on, play my song, it's a celebration
I worked a long week and now there is no hesitation
I need a drink or two, make that a few, I ain't waitin'
Yes, yes, I'm grown and you know I got no time for wastin'

Gonna forget my troubles 'cause it's a special night
Not gonna stress for nothing, I'm feelin' quite alright
If it's your birthday, baby, I'm gonna grant your wish
This is a private party, V-I-P in this bitch, let's go

I'm a prima donna, I can rule the world
Don't care who's around me, I can rule the world
So hands up, catch this feeling, there's no stopping this
Right now in this moment, I can't rule the world

So ladies, pop, pop, pop
Blow it up, make it pop, pop, pop
Turn it up, speakers pop, pop, pop
'Til I'm drunk, bottles pop, pop, pop
(Take it back to the verse right now)

A little fun, never killed, never hurt nobody
So grab a glass and raise it up, baby, work your body
Ain't nothing wrong, just go on if you're feeling naughty
Yes, yes, I'm grown and I don't need no judgment on me
Gonna forget my troubles 'cause it's a special night
Not gonna stress for nothing, I'm feeling quite alright
If it's your birthday, baby, I'm gonna grant your wish
This is a private party, V-I-P in this bitch (Let's go)

I'm a prima donna, I can rule the world
Don't care who's around me, I can rule the world
So hands up, catch this feeling, there's no stopping this
Right now in this moment, I can't rule the world

So ladies, pop, pop, pop
Blow it up, make it pop, pop, pop
Turn it up, speakers pop, pop, pop
'Til I'm drunk, bottles pop, pop, pop
(Break it down)

I'm a prima donna, I'm a
A prima donna, I
I'm a prima donna, I'm a
A prima donna, I
I'm a prima donna, I'm a
A prima donna, I
I'm a prima donna, I'm a
A prima donna, I
I'm a prima donna, I'm a
A prima donna, I
I'm a prima donna (Okay, okay)
I'm a prima donna, I can rule the world
Don't care who's around me, I can rule the world
So hands up, catch this feeling, there's no stopping this
Right now in this moment, I can't rule the world

So ladies, pop, pop, pop
Blow it up, make it pop, pop, pop
Turn it up, speakers pop, pop, pop
'Til I'm drunk, bottles pop, pop, pop

Work your body
Work your body (Body, body, body)2Embed
