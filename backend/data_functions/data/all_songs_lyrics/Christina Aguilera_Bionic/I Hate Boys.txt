I Hate Boys Lyrics
No, I'm not bitter, I'm not mad
Well, maybe just a little, just a tad
I know every apple here ain't bad
But I found a worm in every single one I had
(Boys) They're only good for fruit, I mean bananas
(Boys) Them boys are nuts, they're driving me bananas
(Oh boys) We should pack 'em up and ship 'em out
The boys, the boys, the boys, the boys, I hate 'em

I hate boys, but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I hate boys

If you hate them boys, shake it (Now shake it)
If you hate them boys, shake it (Now shake it)

We would all be happy, all be glad
If sweet mama nature never had
All these dirty little boys that think that the girls
Were only made for toys
Boys are so immature
They rarely turn to men but
Then again, all men are dogs (Roof!)
All men are dogs
I hate boys, but boys love me (Boys love me)
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys (Yeah), but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I hate boys

If you hate them boys, shake it (Now shake it)
If you hate them boys, shake it (Now shake it)
Let's go

Boys suck, make me sick
Inflated egos, little dicks
Use 'em up, spit 'em out
I H-A-T-E boys

I hate boys, but boys love me (Boys love me, oh yeah)
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I hate boys
I hate boys, but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Eh yeah, eh yeah, eh yeah
I hate boys1Embed
