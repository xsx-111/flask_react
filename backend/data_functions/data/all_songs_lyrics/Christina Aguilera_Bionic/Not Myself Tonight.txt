Not Myself Tonight Lyrics
You know
Tonight I'm feeling a little out of control
Is this me?
You wanna get crazy?
'Cause I don't give a... (Ow!)

I'm out of character
I'm in rare form
And if you really knew me
You know it's not the norm
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone, I feel brand new
And if you don't like it, fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing (Hey)
I'm normally in the corner just standing (Hey)
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl
I'm dancing a lot, I'm taking shots and I'm feeling fine
I'm kissing all the boys and the girls
Someone call the doctor 'cause I lost my mind
'Cause I'm doing things that I normally won't do
The old me's gone, I feel brand new
And if you don't like it, fuck you

The music's on and I'm dancing (Hey)
I'm normally in the corner just standing (Hey)
I'm feeling unusual
I don't care 'cause this my night

I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl (Oh)
I'm not myself tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Tonight I'm not the same girl (One, two, three, four!)

In the morning (Oh)
When I wake up (Oh)
I'll go back to the girl I used to be
But, baby, not tonight
I'm not myself tonight
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl (Oh)
I'm not myself tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Tonight I'm not the same girl, same girl

Yeah, that feels good
I needed that, yeah
Get crazy
Let's go, yeah
That's right, come on
Uhh, yeah
Give it to me now
Don't stop
Uh, yeah
Ah, ah, ah13Embed
