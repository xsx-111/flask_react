Written on the Forehead Lyrics
People throwing dinars at the bellydancers
In a sad circus by a trench of burning oil
People throw belongings, a lifetime's earnings
Amongst the scattered rubbish and suitcases on the sidewalk

Date palms and orange and tangerine trees
And eyes are crying for everything
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire

So I talked to an old man by the generator
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
He was standing on the gravel by the fetid river
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
He turned to me and then surveyed the scene
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Said "War is here in our beloved city"
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Some dove in the river and tried to swim away
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Through tons of sewage, fate written on their foreheads
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Date palms and orange and tangerine trees
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
And eyes are crying for everything
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood and fire

Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burn
Blood, blood, blood, blood and fire
Let it burn, let it burn, let it burn, burn, burnEmbed
