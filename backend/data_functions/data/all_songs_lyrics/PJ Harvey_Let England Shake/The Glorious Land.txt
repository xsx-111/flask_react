The Glorious Land Lyrics
How is our glorious country ploughed?
Not by iron ploughs
How is our glorious country ploughed?
Not by iron ploughs
Our land is ploughed by tanks and feet
Feet marching
Our land is ploughed by tanks and feet
Feet marching

Oh America, oh England
Oh America, oh England

How is our glorious country sown?
Not with wheat and corn
How is our glorious country sown?
Not with wheat and corn
How is our glorious land bestowed?
How is our glorious land bestowed?

Oh America, oh England
Oh America, oh England
Oh America, oh England
Oh America, oh England
What is the glorious fruit of our land?
Its fruit is deformed children
What is the glorious fruit of our land?
Its fruit is deformed children
What is the glorious fruit of our land?
Its fruit is orphaned children
What is the glorious fruit of our land?
Its fruit is deformed children1Embed
