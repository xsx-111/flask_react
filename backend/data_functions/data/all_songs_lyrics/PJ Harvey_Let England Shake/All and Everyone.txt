All and Everyone Lyrics
Death was everywhere
In the air and in the sounds
Coming off the mounds of Bolton's Ridge
Ooh, death's anchorage

When you rolled a smoke or told a joke
It was in the laughter and drinking water
It approached the beach as strings of cutters
Dropped into the sea and lay around us

Death was in the ancient fortress
Shelled by a million bullets
From gunners waiting in the copses
With hearts that threatened to pop their boxes

As we advanced into the sun
Death was all and everyone
Death was all and everyone

As we, advancing in the sun
As we, advancing every man
As we, advancing in the sun
Death hung in the smoke and clung
To 400 acres of useless beach front
A bank of red earth, dripping down
Death is now, and now, and now

Death was everywhere
In the air and in the sounds
Coming off the mounds of Bolton's Ridge
Ooh, death's anchorage

Death was in the staring sun
Fixing its eyes on everyone
It rattled the bones of the Light Horsemen
Still lying out there in the open

As we, advancing in the sun
As we, advancing every man
As we, advancing in the sun
Sing, "Death to all and everyone"1Embed
