The Nightingale LyricsI have heard the sound of your call
I have chosen your path
I joined your caravan
We called you the nightingale
I remember how excited we were
The best of life lay ahead for us
We marched on, wrapped in your song
For you I gave my five-year-old son
I felt him behind me
I felt him helping me
Every one of us will go to Paradise
He sang to the soldiers day and night
We called him the nightingale
Get ready, get ready, get ready
Heads on top of sticks were angels around me
Heads on top of sticks became angels around me
Heads on top of sticks, crashed veins, angels around me
Heads on top of sticks were like angels around meEmbed
