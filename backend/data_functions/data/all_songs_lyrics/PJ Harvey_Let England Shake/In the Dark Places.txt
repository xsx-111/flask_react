In the Dark Places Lyrics
We got up early, washed our faces
Walked the fields and put up crosses
Passed through the damned mountains

Went hellwards
And some of us returned
And some of us did not

In the fields and in the forests
Under the moon and under the sun
Another summer has passed before us

And not one man has
And not one woman has
Revealed the secrets of this world

So our young men hid with guns in the dirt
And in the dark places
Our young men hid with guns in the dirt
And in the dark places
Our young men hid with guns in the forests
And in the dark places
And not one man has
And not one woman has
Revealed the secrets of this worldEmbed
