Let England Shake Lyrics
The west's asleep, let England shake
Weighted down with silent dead
I fear our blood won't rise again
Won't rise again

England's dancing days are done
Another day, Bobby, for you to come
Home and tell me indifference
Is won, won, won

Smile, smile Bobby, with your lovely mouth
Pack up your troubles and let's head out
To the fountain of death and splash about
Swim back, forth, back, back, laugh out loud

Until the day is ending
And the birds are silent
And the insects are courting
And by the shores, heavy stones are falling

Smile, smile Bobby, with your lovely mouth
Pack up your troubles and let's head out
To the fountain of death and splash about
Swim back, forth, back, back, laugh out loud3Embed
