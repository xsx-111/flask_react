The Words That Maketh Murder Lyrics
I've seen and done things I want to forget;
I've seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat
Blown and shot out beyond belief
Arms and legs were in the trees
I've seen and done things I want to forget;
Coming from an unearthly place
Longing to see a woman's face
Instead of the words that gather pace

The words that maketh murder
These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder
These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder
These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder
These, these, these are the words
Murder

(These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder
These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder)
I've seen and done things I want to forget;
(These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder)
I've seen a corporal whose nerves were shot
(These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder)
Climbing behind the fierce, gone sun
(These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder)
I've seen flies swarming everyone
(These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder)
Soldiers fell like lumps of meat
(These, these, these are the words
The words that maketh murder)
These are the words, the words are these

Death lingering, stunk
Flies swarming everyone
Over the whole summit peak
Flesh quivering in the heat
This was something else again
I fear it cannot explain
The words that make, the words that make
Murder
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my problem to the United Nations?
What if I take my, what if I take my problem to the United
Nations?1Embed
