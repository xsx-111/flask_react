The Big Guns Called Me Back Again Lyrics
Shadows lengthening
Ninety five steps I'm taking
With every step I'm longing
For the luck to keep on living

The drum calls me back again
To my senses, filled with shame

Oh, that this night
Would never end
And on no-man's-land
The sun would not rise again

There was laughing, and I could not laugh
There was singing, and I could not sing

The big guns called me back again
The big guns called me back again
The big guns called me back again

I hear voices singing
I hear the guns beginning
Far off, far away
I hear the guns again
I hear the guns again
I hear the guns againEmbed
