With You, Friends (Long Drive) Lyrics
All my love, all my love

Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you, oh, how I love you, you, you, you
All my love, All I love, All my love
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you, oh, how I love you, you, you, you
All my love, All I love, All my love
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you, oh, how I love you, you, you, you
All my love, All I love, All my love


All my love, all my love

All my love, all my love

Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you, oh, how I love you, you, you, you
All my love, All I love, All my love
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you, oh, how I love you, you, you, you
All my love, All I love, All my love
Please tell my mother I'm down on my knees
And I really miss you, oh, how I love you, you, you, you
All my love, All I love, All my love
