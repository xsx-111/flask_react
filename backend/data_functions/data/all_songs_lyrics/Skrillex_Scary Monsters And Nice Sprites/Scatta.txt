Scatta Lyrics
Yeah, that's right
Skrillex, Bare Noize, Foreign Beggars
L.A., London, Dubai
'Bout to get rowdy right now

Yeah. I'm an all time factor
I make the next guy look like an actor
This sort of mandem 'gwan like they matter
When I touch mic, I see the man scatter
And they wanna talk big
But when it comes to big it they bout to get splatter
So I tell them "relax yourself
Go home to your mum and stop being a catta"
Many guys wanna par
Many guys looking to take this thing far
Many guys looking to be some big stars
But soon enough them man about to get slappa
So there's no need for chatter
No need for anything cheap and that's that
Anybody making a ting to get smacked up, back up
Fam, and meet us 'round back

When I touch mics I see the man scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum
You're just another pawn in my game
And I'm the god figure pouring the rain
I'm a raw one, too much of a force to contain
When I'm forced to repay all the thoughts of the brain
By any means I ain't putting pure spits to shame
What depict and script's too much for the mandem
Man, I keep calm with more shit to spray
And when I'm letting off since I had a clutch on the magnum
So you're making that P in the fashion?
Most of these MC's are straight gassin'
Yeah they getting paid on the JSA
Think they're something like the guy Don Draper from Mad Men
Bagging up while I'm racking hits by the minute
I'm sick with the lyrics, so you best be backin' up
Chatta with a little more flex
Doesn't matter cause when I ratatat bars watch a bare man scatta

When I touch mics I see the man scatta
Scatta, as if I had a clutch on a magnum5Embed
