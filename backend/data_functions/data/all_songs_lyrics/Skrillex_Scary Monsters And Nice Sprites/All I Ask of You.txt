All I Ask of You Lyrics
In comes the dawn
I've fallen asleep with my head pressed against your flaws
Oh my love (Oh my love)
And something got in the way
And your soul turned black as the sun grows somber
Took my heart, and my love

All I ask of you, all I ask of you
Just open up a little bit more
All I ask of you, all I ask of you
Just open up a little bit more

Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more (A little bit more)

All I ask of you, all I ask of you
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more
All I ask of you, all I ask of you

Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more (A little bit more)
All I ask of you, all I ask of you
Just open up a little bit more
Just open up a little bit more
All I ask of you, all I ask of you5Embed
