Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites (Zedd Remix) Lyrics(backwards) I'm just like you... you don't need to hide... I just like you
Yes, oh my gosh! (Oh no, who's there?)
(backwards) I'm just like you... you don't need to hide... I just like you
Yes, oh my go-! (Oh no, who's there?)
(backwards) I'm just like you... you don't need to hide... I just like you
Look at this... I'm a coward too
You don't need to hide, my friend, for I'm just like youEmbed
