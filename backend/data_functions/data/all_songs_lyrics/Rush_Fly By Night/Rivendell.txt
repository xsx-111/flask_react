Rivendell Lyrics
Sunlight dances through the leaves
Soft winds stir the sighing trees
Lying in the warm grass
Feel the sun upon your face
Elven songs and endless nights
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights
Time will never touch you
Here in this enchanted place

I've traveled now for many miles
It feels so good to see the smiles of
Friends who never left your mind
When you were far away
From the golden light of coming dawn
Till the twilight when the sun is gone
We treasure every season
And every passing day

You feel there's something calling you, you're wanting to return
To where the Misty Mountains rise and friendly fires burn
A place you can escape the world, where the dark lord cannot go
Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow
We feel the coming of a new day
Dark gives way to light a new way
Stop here for a while until the world
The world calls you away
Yet you know I've had the feeling
Standing with my senses reeling
This is the place to grow old 'til
I reach my final day

You feel there's something calling you, you're wanting to return
To where the Misty Mountains rise and friendly fires burn
A place you can escape the world, where the dark lord cannot go
Peace of mind and sanctuary by Loudwater's flow4Embed
