In the End Lyrics
Well, I can see what you mean
It just takes me longer
And I can feel what you feel
It just makes you stronger

Well, you can take me for a little while
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end
Yes, you can, ooh

Well, I can see what you mean
It just takes me longer
And I can feel what you feel
It just makes you stronger

I know, I know, I know
Whoa, the feeling grows
I see, I see, I see
It's got to be
Whoa yeah, whoa Yeah

Well, I can do what you do
You just do it better
I can cry like you cry
It just makes me sadder
I know, I know, I know
Whoa, the feeling grows
I see, I see, I see
Ooh, It's got to be
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah
Whoa yeah, yeah!


Whoa, you can take me for a little while
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end
Whoa yeah!

Well, I can shine like you shine
It don't make me brighter
But if I think, oh, like you think
It don't make my load much lighter, whoa
Whoa, oh

Well, I can see what you mean
It just takes me longer
And I can feel what you feel
It just makes me stronger, whoa yeah, yeah
Oh yeah1Embed
