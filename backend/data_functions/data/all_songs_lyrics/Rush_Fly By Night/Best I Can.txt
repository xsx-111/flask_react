Best I Can Lyrics
I've got a livin' that's rough, a future that's tough
You know what I mean
Blankers and boasters, all the bluffers and posers
I'm not into that scene

You can tell me that I got no class
Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last
Don't give me speeches cause they're oh so droll
Leave me alone, let me rock and roll

Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk
I'm funny that way
Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far
But I'll try anyway

I just like to please, I don't like to tease
I'm easy like that
Don't like long rests, I must confess
I'm an impatient cat

You can tell me that I got no class
Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last
Don't give me speeches cause they're oh so droll
Leave me alone, let me rock and roll
I do the best that I can
I'm just what I am
I do the best that I can
Well, I know what I am


I do the best that I can
I'm just what I am
I do the best that I can
Well, I know what I am

Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk
I'm funny that way
Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far
But I'll try anyway

Rock and rollin's a scream, makin' millions my dream
Well, I do that a lot
I'll just give it a try, won't let good times pass me by
They're all I've got2Embed
