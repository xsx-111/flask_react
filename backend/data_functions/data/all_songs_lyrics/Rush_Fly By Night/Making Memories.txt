Making Memories Lyrics
There's a time for feelin' as good as we can
The time is now and there's no stoppin' us
There's a time for livin' as high as we can
Behind us you will only see our dust

So we just keep smilin', move onward every day
And try to keep our thoughts away from home
We're travelin' all around, no time to settle down
And satisfy our wanderlust to roam

You know we're havin' good days and we hope they're gonna last
Our future still looks brighter than our past
We feel no need to worry, no reason to be sad
Our memories remind us maybe road life's not so bad

Well, from sea to shining sea and a hundred points between
Still we go on diggin' every show
The cities in the land all extend a welcome hand
Till the morning when it's time for us to go

Well, you know we're havin' good days
And we hope they're gonna last
Our future still looks brighter than our past
We feel no need to worry, no reason to be sad
Our memories remind us maybe road life's not so bad

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Maybe road life's not so bad
Road life's not so bad
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
