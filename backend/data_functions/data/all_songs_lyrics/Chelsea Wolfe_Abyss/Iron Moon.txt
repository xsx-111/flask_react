Iron Moon Lyrics
A dead sun, a pale glow
Upon the walls I feign to know
We bear no fruit, no flowers, no life
And we get sick but never die

Become an echo
Resounding "let go"

My heart is a tomb
My heart is an empty room
I've given it away
I never want to see it again

I go to him in paths of dreams
In bed awake with shadow beings
They crawl inside and wait with me
The creatures here become machines

Walk with me to a place of trust
Death will no longer silence us
My heart is a tomb
My heart is an empty room
I've given it away
I never want to see it again

And all your words could save me
But keep your love away from me
In all the world's decaying
Is there a place that's safe for us?

My heart is a tomb
My heart is an empty room
I've given it away
I've swallowed the iron moon
Moon, moon4Embed
