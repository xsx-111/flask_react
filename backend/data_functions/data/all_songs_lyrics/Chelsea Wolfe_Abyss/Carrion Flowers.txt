Carrion Flowers Lyrics
We learned how on our own
Never needing help from you
Reaching out with eyes closed
We felt the light, it taught us to grow

Hold, hold, hold on
Hold, hold, hold on

Creatures of habit, carrion flowers
Growing from repeated crimes
The afterglow in full bloom
Slow and relentless, we're after you

Hold on to the pain
Of love taken from you
A plague
Hold on to the pain (hold on, hold on)
Of love taken from you (hold on, hold on)
A plague (hold on)2Embed
