Color of Blood LyricsA hunger never satisfied
I can't keep you off my mind
Dancing, moving, passing time
Lost worlds and endless nights
I held you at a distance then
So I could keep you sacred now
I watched the veins under my skin
Moving, changing from blue to red
Those colours battle to repent
Fighting some kind of punishment
For loving you
The deathless tell me
"Go on, stay low
Grow old and let your hair grow"
In sleep there is no sorrow
Slowly prolonging a cruel fate
For loving you
They hear everything
They glow with their own light
They sing out your name
A thousand times at night
Generations of sadness
Inbred and under fire
In a thousand languages
A word for this desire
For loving you1Embed
