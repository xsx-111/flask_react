After the Fall Lyrics
Nothing will keep us apart
I said, nothing will keep us apart

I know that you'll find me, there
After the fall, I know that you're waiting
I know that you'll find me, there
After the fall, I know that you're waiting
Ready to run

Chasing the sun, I can't wake up
Scream and run, don't let them win

Nothing will keep us apart

I know that you'll find me, there
After the fall, I know that you're waiting
I know that you'll find me there
After the fall, I know that you're waiting
Ready to run

Chasing the sun, I can't wake up
Scream and run, don't let them win
Nothing will keep us apart
Go on, drive into the morning
Never give up, never give in1Embed
