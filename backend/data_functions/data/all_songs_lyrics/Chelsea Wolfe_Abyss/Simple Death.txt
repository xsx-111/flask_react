Simple Death LyricsSimple death feels infinite
Compared to the end of it all
Dark, dark world
Dangerous religion
And all we have left to learn
Empty within, empty without
Surrounded and estranged
Sometimes I don't know
If I'll find the answer
Or if I've ever asked the question
Some nights I know
I'll find the answer in silence
I hear it cry
Lost and alone in confusion
I'm screaming
But I can't wake up
We looked around
And all was dead
Our rotting bodies so deeply in love
Empty within, empty without
But a voice keeps on whispering:
Blue haze, white light
A desert storm, midnight
Blue haze, white light
A desert storm, midnight
The roads become rivers
The water starts to rise
Let me swim
I'm so scared to find...
Sometimes I don't know
If I'll find the answer
Or if I've ever asked the question
Some nights I know
I'll find the answer in silence
And I hear it cry
Lost and alone in confusion
I'm screaming
But I can't wake up
The end of the beauty of it all1Embed
