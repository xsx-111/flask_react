Crazy Love Lyrics
Crazy love, it's not you I fear
You let the devil in, you hold him near
Crazy love, when did the war begin?
When will it end? When will it end?
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love

And I don’t want to live without you
I don’t want to live without you

Crazy love, where is our home?
Look at the place we're in, the hell we left it in
Can we forget ourselves? Can we forgive?
Can we afford the years, my lovely friend?
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love
Crazy love
And I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna live without you3Embed
