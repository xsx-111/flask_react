The Abyss LyricsWatch your thoughts in the dark
Theyâ€™ll drag you down to the deep blue sea
Stare it down, the abyss
Run away, run away from it
Snuff it out at the wick
Run away, run away from it
With broken hearts, how could we fear
Anything for a thousand years
When I move it pulls me closer
When I swim it drags me under
When I dream it steals my wonder
Set me free from my slumber
Stare it down, the abyss
Run away, run away from it
It hurts to love when I remember
We were born unto chaos
When I move it pulls me closer
When I swim it drags me under
When I dream it steals my wonder
Then sets me free from my slumberEmbed
