Maw Lyrics
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

In the maw, shattered teeth
Underneath a dripping tongue

I've been waiting in this silence
While you're sleeping, until you believe

Where are you?
Where are you?

In the maw, in a world so dirty
Intoxicated, a life of tears
In the maw, a world in a daze
None can be trusted in the mouth of the beast

I've been waiting in this silence
While you're sleeping, until you believe
I've been waiting in this silence
I'm on fire, I'm on fire2Embed
