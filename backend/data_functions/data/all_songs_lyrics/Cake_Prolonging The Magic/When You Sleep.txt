When You Sleep LyricsWhen you sleep
Where do your fingers go?
What do your fingers know?
What do your fingers show?
Where do your fingers go?
When you sleep
Do they tremble on the edge of the bed
Or do you fold them neatly by your head
Do they clench like claws against your own skin
When you're living your day all over again
When you sleep
(When you sleep)
Where do your fingers go?
(When you sleep)
What do your fingers know?
(When you sleep)
What do your fingers show?
(When you sleep)
Where do your fingers go?
(When you sleep)
Do they play guitar in a Latin bar
Are they strangers or lovers
Do they drive your car
Are they swimming submissively
Sex acts of life
Or just cutting through jello with a very sharp knife
Now Zeus was a womanizer
Always on the make
But Hera usually punished her that Zeus was one to take
When you sleep where do your fingers go?
Are they pulling out weeds from the dusty soil
But then never rewarded with the fruits of their toil
Are they scratching their nails on the chalkboards of death
Only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left
(When you sleep)
Where do your fingers go?
(When you sleep)
What do your fingers know?
(When you sleep)
What do your fingers show?
(When you sleep)
Where do your fingers go?
(When you sleep)
When you sleep
Do they tremble on the edge of the bed
Or do you fold them neatly by your headEmbed
