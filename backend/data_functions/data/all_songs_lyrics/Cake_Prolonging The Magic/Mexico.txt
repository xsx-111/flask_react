Mexico LyricsI had a match, but she had a lighter
I had a flame, but she had a fire
I was bright, but she was much brighter
I was high, but she was the sky
Oh baby, I was bound for mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go
Ha ha ha, la da da
I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo
I'm never sure what it's all about
But I say I want you and you don't believe me
You say you want me but I've got my doubts
Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go
I had a match, but she had a lighter
I had a flame, but she had a fire
I was bright, but she was much brighter
I was high, but she was the sky
Oh baby, I was bound for Mexico
Oh baby, I was bound to let you go3Embed
