Walk On By LyricsWalk on by
The house where you still live
Walk on by
The place where we would kiss
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight, I must walk on by
Walk on by
The room where you still sleep
Walk on by
The company that you keep
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight, I must walk on by
Somehow i know
I won't forget you no no no no no, i won't
You won't forget me no no no no no, you won't
I'll keep on walking away from here
I'll forget you when I reach the other side
Walk on by the house where you still live
Walk on by the place where we would kiss
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight, I must walk on by
And the room where I held you tight
Tonight, I must walk on byEmbed
