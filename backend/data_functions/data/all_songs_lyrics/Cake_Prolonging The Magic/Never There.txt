Never There Lyrics
I need your arms around me
I need to feel your touch
I need your understanding
I need your love so much

You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (Baby)
Baby, you're never there

On the phone long, long distance
Always through such strong resistence
And first you say you're too busy
I wonder if you even miss me

Never there
You're never there
You're never ever, ever, ever there
Hey!

A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game
A golden bird that flies away
A candle's fickle flame
To think I held you yesterday
Your love was just a game
You tell me that you love me so
You tell me that you care
But when I need you (Baby)
Baby

Take the time to get to know me
If you want why can't you just show me?
We're always on this roller coaster
If you want me why can't you get closer?

Never there
You're never there
You're never ever, ever, ever there
Never there
You're never there
You're never ever, ever, ever there
Hey!

Oooh, hey!
Yeah!
Hey!4Embed
