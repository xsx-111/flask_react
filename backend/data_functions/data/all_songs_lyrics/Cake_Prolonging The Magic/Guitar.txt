Guitar LyricsI'm sitting by the
Window of your
Thirty-second
Floor apartment
Waiting
For your
Phone calls
All to End
I'm sitting
Watching, wind blow
Watching time go
Watching cars go by
I'm
Waiting for these
Memories to
Begin
If I
Threw my guitar
Out the window
So far down
Would I
Start to regret it
Or would I smile
And watch it slowly fall, fall, fall
Garbage trucks
And taxi cabs
Don't seem like they can
Reach me here
The clamor
Of jackhammers
Seems so faint
Well, the way you treat me
Lightly only
Slightly brings me down
A lot
I don't think that I'll
Ever be the same
Yeah, If I
Threw my guitar
Out the window
So far down
Would I
Start to regret it
Or would I smile
And watch it slowly fall, fall, fall
Fall, fall, fall
Fall, fall, fall
Fall, fall, fall...Embed
