Hem of Your Garment Lyrics
I am intrinsically no good
I have a heart that's made of wood
I am only biding time
Only reciting memorized lines

And I'm not fit to touch
The hem of your garment
No, no I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment

I have no love, but only goals
How very empty is my soul
It is a soul that feels no thrill
A soul that could easily kill

And I'm not fit to touch
The hem of your garment
No, no I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment

I am intrinsically no good
I have a heart that's made of wood
I am only biding time
Only reciting memorized lines
And I'm not fit to touch
The hem of your garment
No, no I'm not fit to touch the hem of your garment
The hem of your garmentEmbed
