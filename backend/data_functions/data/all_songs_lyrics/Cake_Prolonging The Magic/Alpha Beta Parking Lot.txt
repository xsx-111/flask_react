Alpha Beta Parking Lot LyricsStanding in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sunset- I'll never forget
Watching all the reds, and oranges slip away-
Letting go of yet, another dirty day
Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down--
Watching the sun go down--
Watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching you leave me- not quite believing
Standing in the Alpha Beta parking lot
Watching the sunset- I'll never forget
Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down--
Watching the sun go down--
Watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down--
(guitar and trumpet break)
Breathing in the fumes from so many ideling cars
Right beneath the sign with the dusty yellow stars
Watching the sun go down--
Watching the sun go down--
Watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down--
Watching (the sun) the sun (watching the sun) go down--
Watching the sun go down-----Embed
