Where Would I Be? Lyrics
I've been waiting for so long
I've been hoping your love's not gone
Houses are sliding in the mud
Rivers are raging in your blood

Where would I be without your love?
Where would I be without your arms around me?

You want to be the only one
If I knew you I would not run
You have been cloudy, distant, dark
I'm thinking of Noah and the ark
