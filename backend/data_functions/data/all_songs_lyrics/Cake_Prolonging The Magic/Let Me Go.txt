Let Me Go LyricsWhen she walks, she swings her arms
Instead of her hips
When she talks, she moves her mouth
Instead of her lips
And I've waited for her for so long
I've waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on, yeah
Let me go she said, let me go she said
Let me go and I will want you more
Let me go she said
Let me go
Let me go and I will want you
When she wants, she wants the sun
Instead of the moon
When she sees, she see the stars
Inside of her room
And I've waited for her for so long
I've waited for her for so long
I've wondered if I could hang on
I wonder if I could hang on
Let me go she said (x3) and I will want you more
Let me go she said
Let me go
Let me go and I will want you
Let me go she said (x2)
Let me go, let me go she said
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let let me go
Let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me goEmbed
