Sheep Go to Heaven Lyrics
I'm not feeling alright today
I'm not feeling that great
I'm not catching on fire today
Love has started to fade
I'm not going to smile today
I'm not gonna laugh
You're out living it up today
I've got dues to pay

And the grave-digger puts on the forceps
The stonemason does all the work
The barber can give you a haircut
The carpenter can take you out to lunch
Now, but, I just want to play on my pan-pipes
I just want to drink me some wine
As soon as you're born you start dying
So you might as well have a good time, oh no

Sheep go to Heaven
Goats go to Hell
Sheep go to Heaven
Goats go to Hell
Oh no, oh yeah, alright
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip
I don't wanna feel the emptiness
Bold marquees with stupid band names
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip
I don't wanna feel the emptiness
Bold marquees with stupid band names
I don't wanna go to Sunset Strip

And the grave-digger puts on the forceps
The stonemason does all the work
The barber can give you a haircut
The carpenter can take you out to lunch
Now, but, I just want to play on my pan-pipes
I just want to drink me some wine
As soon as you're born you start dying
So you might as well have a good time, oh no

Sheep go to Heaven
Goats go to Hell
Sheep go to Heaven
Goats go to Hell
Oh
Sheep go to Heaven
Goats go to Hell
Sheep go to Heaven
Goats go to Hell (Go to Hell)
Sheep go to Heaven (Go to Hell)
Goats go to Hell (Go to Hell)
Sheep go to Heaven (Go to Hell)
Goats go to Hell (Go to Hell)
Oh no, go to Hell
(repeat until fade)2Embed
