Dracula Moon LyricsWhere are the bones on that one?
What if the cure is worse than the disease?
Serve me up some pretty, pretty people
Serve me up somebody I can believe
Don't feel sorry for me
I hate that look on your face
You say, "Just let go"
You say, "come back home"
I say, "I'm just fallin' from grace"
I'm naked in a hotel room
My station comin' in, comin' in loud and clear
I'm makin' out with my one true love
I'm makin' this hotel room disappear
Stop feelin' sorry for me
I hate that look on your face
You say, "Just let go"
You say, "come back home"
I say, "I'm just fallin' from grace"
Said that I'm like fallin' from grace
You'd never know it to look at me
Under the Dracula moon
Love comes down any way it wants to
Doesn't ask for your permission
Open up your arms or it will break you in two
Stop feelin' sorry for me
I hate that look on your face
You say, "Just let go"
You say, "Come back home"
I say, "I'm just fallin' from grace"
Said that I'm just fallin' from grace
Just fallin'
Just fallin'...
(I'm smooth and heavy all over the world
I'm smooth and heavy all over the world?)Embed
