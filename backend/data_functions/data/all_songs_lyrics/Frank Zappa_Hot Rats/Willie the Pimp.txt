Willie the Pimp Lyrics
I'm a little pimp with my hair gassed back
Pair a khaki pants with my shoe shined black
Got a little lady, walk that street
Tellin' all the boys that she can't be beat
Twenty dollar bill, I can set you straight
Meet me on the corner boy and don't be late
Man in a suit with a bow-tie neck
Wanna buy a grunt with a third party check
Standin' on the porch of the Lido Hotel
Floozies in the lobby love the way I sell:

Hot meat, hot rats
Hot cats, hot rits
Hot roots, hot soots


Hot meat, hot rats
Hot cats, hot rits
Hot roots, hot soots
