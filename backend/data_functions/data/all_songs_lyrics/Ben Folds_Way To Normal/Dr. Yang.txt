Dr. Yang LyricsUh-oh!
Hey, Dr. Yin
Chain-smoking Chinese centenarian
Deck my back with pins
Connect the wires and plug me in
Uh-oh!
Hey, Love Master Z
Sexy online psychic overseas
When my bank card clears (yeah)
Tell me things I want to hear
Yeah, yeah
Well I might be dyin'
Or maybe I got too much time
I can't stop my mind
It's runnin' right
And these false teeth
And these plastic knees
It goes squeak, squeak, squeak
From the porch to the street
Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
Hey Dr. Jack
Bend me like a pretzel till I crack
All my joints and bones
Beat me up and send me home
Hey!
I've got too much time
Baby may I might be dyin'
Got to help me fallin', doctor
Got to help me fallin', fallin'
Hey, Dr. Yang!Embed
