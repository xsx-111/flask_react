Kylie from Connecticut LyricsIt's just a thought
But where did it come from?
What does she do with it
If it comes back?
A note from his assistant
There by the telephone
She sees it again
As she turns out the light
Kylie is calling from Connecticut
She says you've got the number
It said Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's there, on her mind
As she closes her eyes
She believes there are things you should know about
When you've been married for 35 years
And her heart belongs
To a man that she hadn't seen
Since a magical night when the children were small
Kylie is calling from Connecticut
She says you got the number
It said Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's back, on her mind
As she closes her eyes
Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's probably nothing, yeah, nothing at all
But Kylie is calling from Connecticut
It's all coming back
As she's reading old letters
That she'd hid in the closet
With her pictures she'd cherished
That she kept to herself
For a good 30 years 
Now she closes her eyesEmbed
