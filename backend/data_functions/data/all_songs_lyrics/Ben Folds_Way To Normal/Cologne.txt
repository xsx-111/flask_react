Cologne LyricsHere in Cologne
I know I said it wrong
I walked you to the train and back across alone
To my hotel room and ordered me some food
And now I'm wondering
Why the floor has suddenly
Become a moving target?
Chorus:
Four, three, two, one
I'm letting you go
I will let go if you will let go
Four, three, two
Says here an astronaut put on a pair of diapers
Drove eighteen hours to kill her boyfriend
And in my hotel room I'm wondering
If you read that story too and if we both might
Be having the same imaginary conversation
Chorus:
Four, three, two, one
I'm letting you go
I will let go if you will let go
Four, three, two
Oh why?
Weightless as I close my eyes
Oh why?
The ceiling opens in disguise
Such a painful trip
To find out this is it
And as I go to sleep
You'll be waking up
Four, three, two, one
I'm letting you go
I will let go if you will let go
Oh why? Oh why?
Oh why? Oh why?Embed
