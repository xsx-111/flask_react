Free Coffee Town LyricsI want to live in a land where there's free coffee
And the beer flows out of the ground
The women are nice and they don't think twice
About kissing you and fooling around
I wanna live in a place where there's lots of diamonds
And the parties last till dawn
The fights don't hurt and there's chocolate dirt
And the weed is grown instead of the lawn
Is there such a place
Well I guess there could be
If we all could be so gentle
If we call could be so free
Coffee
Is there such a place
Well I guess there could be
If we all could be so gentle
If we all could be so free
Coffee
I wanna live in a place where there's free coffee
When they bury me in the ground
I'll have a smile on my face
I love life
In this free coffee town
Is there such a place
Well I guess there could be
If we all could be so gentle
If we all could be so free
