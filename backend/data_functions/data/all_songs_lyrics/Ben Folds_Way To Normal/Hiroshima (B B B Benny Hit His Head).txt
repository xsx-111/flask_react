Hiroshima (B B B Benny Hit His Head) LyricsOh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Start of the show Hiroshima
And the people were shouting my name
As the house lights came down and the spotlight followed me out
I waved hello to the crowd as I busted ass off the front of the stage
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They're watching me, watching me fall
Maybe it was a rush of adrenaline
As the concrete rose to meet face
Maybe it was the sheer embarrassment
That kept me conscious and standing
As I crawled back up onto the stage
And started pounding out the first song
There was blood on the keyboard
Oh my God
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They're watching me, watching me fall
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They're watching me, watching me fall
You wanna see what's in my head?
You wanna see what's in my head?
You wanna see what's in my head?
Check it out cause
I got pictures of what's in my head
I got pictures of what's in my head
They took 'em in Tokyo
And I brought 'em back with me to the USA
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They're watching me, watching me fall
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They're watching me, watching me fall
It's true I fell then I hit my, hit my head you know
I mean my head, my ankle, my ankle was black
But my head got a concussion
They took x-rays and I asked the doctor
If he could tell whether I was
I don't speak Japanese but I was talking to him
Does this song end?Embed
