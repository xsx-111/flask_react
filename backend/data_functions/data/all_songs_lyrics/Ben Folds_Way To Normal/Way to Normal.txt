Way to Normal LyricsIs this the way to normal
Is this the way to normal
Show me the way to normal
Show me the way to normal
Show me the way to normal
Is this the way to normal
You can blame it on the President
But what if it was you
Who was the White House resident
Or could you save the starving children
When there's so much else to do
With all the problems of the world
Coming down on you
So this is the way
This is the way to normal
Show me the way
Show me the way to normal
Alright
You can say my music's bullshit
In your uppity review
But if it was you here at this keyboard
With all the people waiting
To hear your next CD
And throw you in the garbage
Or hail your masterpiece
So show me the way
Show me the way to normal
This is the way
This is the way to normal
Alright
All these corporations poisoning our air
The children sad and hungry but they don't even care
Let's get together people
We've got problems here to solve
Let's make this world a better place
Before there is no world at -
Is this is the way to normal
Is this is the way to normal
Sh- Show me the way to normal
Show me the way to normal
Show me the way to normal
Show me the way to normal
