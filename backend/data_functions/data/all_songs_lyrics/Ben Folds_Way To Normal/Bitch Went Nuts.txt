Bitch Went Nuts LyricsThe bitch went nuts
She stabbed my basketball
And the speakers to my stereo
She called me 'cunt'
But nothing prepared me for
What I found when I came home
Oh and I made my own bed. I lie in it
You lie in yours. You lie, you lie, in yours
But they want more, they're at my door with torches
Please leave me alone, you know
Just shut it. Just shut it. Just shut it
The bitch went nuts
She photoshopped my face
Onto every boy who'd done her wrong
And then she burned them telepathically onto the brains of all her embittered drones
Oh, now, now they want more. They're at my door with torches
Scores, and scores, and scores to settle with themselves
You would have thought I'd scorned them all
They've got a doll of me, they're burnin', they're burnin', they're burnin', they're burnin', they're burnin' their own memories
Why do they all go?
Why do they all go?
The bitch went nuts, y'all
But everyone said she might
Holy fucking shit
Seriously now
Now they want more. They're at my door with torches
Scores and scores
You would have thought I'd scorned them all
They've got a doll of me, they're
Why do they all go?2Embed
