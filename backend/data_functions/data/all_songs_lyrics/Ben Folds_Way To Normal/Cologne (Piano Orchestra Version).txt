Cologne (Piano Orchestra Version) LyricsHere in Cologne
I know I said it wrong
I walked you to the train
And back across alone
To my hotel room
And ordered me some food
And now I'm wondering
Why the floor has suddenly become a moving target
Four, three, two, one
I'm letting you go
I will let go
If you will let go
(Four, three, two)
Says here an astronaut
Put on a pair of diapers
Drove eighteen hours
To kill her boyfriend
And in my hotel room - I'm wondering
If you read that story too
And if we both might
Be having the same imaginary conversation
Four, three, two, one
I'm letting you go
I will let go
If you will let go
(Four, three, two)
Weightless as I close my eyes
The ceiling opens into skies
Such a painful trip
To find out this is it
And when I go to sleep
You'll be waking up
Four, three, two, one
I'm letting you go
I will let go
If you will let goEmbed
