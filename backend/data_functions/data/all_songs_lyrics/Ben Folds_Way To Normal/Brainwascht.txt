Brainwascht Lyrics1, 2, 3
If you want to write a letter, write a letter
If you'd rather make a phone call, pick the phone up, call me
But if you had to say it all with a pop song
Couldn't you at least have written me a good one?
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
Was it just a simple rewind and erase?
Was your mind squeaky-clean in the first place?
If you gotta write an essay, do your research
If you got to
Stick your nose in a boy-and-girl fight, hear both sides first
There's something wrong being copied on a memo
In the form of a bad country demo
She's brainwascht you, brainwascht you, brainwascht you, brainwascht you too
She's brainwascht you, brainwascht you, brainwascht you, brainwashed you too
Is there a funnel from her mind to your mouth now?
Cause you don't edit anything; it just comes out
I gotta say (gotta say)
It's pretty gay, trading jabs with pop song
So maybe next time we should just have a dance-off
A dance-off
Isn't there something in the Bible about forgiveness and love?
And more importantly, about throwing stones and what your house is made of?
You might reflect upon your own arrangement
In '94, getting blown in your basement
(While your wife slept!)
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
She's brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you, brainwashed you too
She's brainwascht you (Integrity)
She's brainwascht you (Family)
She's b-b-brainwascht you (Online rhyming dictionary)Embed
