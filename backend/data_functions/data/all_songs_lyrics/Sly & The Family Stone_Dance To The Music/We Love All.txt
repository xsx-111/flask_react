We Love All LyricsI am a believer that love is a deceiver
People don’t like what they don’t understand
We love all y’all
We love all…we love all y’all, yes we do
Unlike the fuzz and his gun
Unlike the judge and his son
Unlike the local meter ma’am
Unlike the very latest scam
We love all y’all
We love all…we love all y’all, yeah, yes we do
Unlike the Colonel and his plan
Unlike the landlady’s new old man
Unlike society’s addiction
Unlike the town with its restriction
We love all y’all
We love all…we love all y’all, yes we doEmbed
