Color Me True LyricsAre you earning all of your money?
Do you laugh at the boss’s jokes when they are funny?
Color me true
Color, color me true
Do you know what makes you tick?
Do you know how to avoid what makes you sick?
You might think and talk just like a player
Would you know how to talk to your city mayor?
Color me true
Color, color me true
Do you take credit for somebody else’s cooking?
Do you look at the park when you think nobody’s looking?
Color me true
Color, color, color me true, oh yeah
Do you know how to treat your brother?
Do y’all know how to get along with one another?
When you retire, do you go right to sleep?
Do toss and turn when fear starts to creep?
Color me true
Hey hey hey, color, color me true
Look’a here…boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-boo
Boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-boo
Boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-boo
Boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-boo
Boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-boo
Boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-boo
Boo-boo-buh-boo-boo, boo-boo-buh-boo-booEmbed
