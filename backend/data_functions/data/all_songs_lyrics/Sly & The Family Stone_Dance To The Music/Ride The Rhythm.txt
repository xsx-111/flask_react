Ride The Rhythm LyricsDon’t let the silence space your mind
Make you start your thing on time
Snap your fingers and everything’s fine
Look at our drummer keeping time
Sweet thang
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
You might start with the boogaloo
Or you could do anything you want to do
You don’t have to have a partner, you can dance by yourself
Or you might be better off if you dance with somebody else
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Said I’m gonna try to do it, ay now
Boogie, stomp for you right on time
Sweet thing; talkin’ ‘bout a sweet thing, alright
Don’t get hung up and move too fast
Slow down ‘til you have time to make sure you last
If the floor’s too crowded, just be still
Dance to unite, you know I will
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Ride the rhythm
Said I might try to boogaloo
Going through the air now, baby, just for you
Talkin’ ‘bout my sweet thing
Sock it to me, sweet thing, now
Talkin’ ‘bout my sweet thing, yeah
Sweet thing, oh
Sweet thing, sweet thing, sweet thingEmbed
