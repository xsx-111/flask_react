Are You Ready LyricsAre you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Don't hate the black
Don't hate the white
If you get bit
Just hate the bite
Make sure your heart is beatin' right
How's your backbone?
How's your eye?
Ask about him, I'm right on time
Groovy people, how do you do?
Let me dedicate my fuzz to you
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)
Are you ready? (Are you ready?)Embed
