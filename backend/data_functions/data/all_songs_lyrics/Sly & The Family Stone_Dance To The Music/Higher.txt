Higher LyricsWhen you’re through with what you think you have to do
Hot pursuit
When you’ve gone where you have to go
Let me know
Wanna take you higher (You think you’re into something but you’re wrong)
Take you higher (Hold my hand)
Let me take you higher (I wanna turn you out)
Let me take you higher (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Higher
When you’ve gone through all the guys
I’ll be there
When you’ve lost all of your friends
What a scare
I want to take you higher
I want to take you higher
I want to take you higher
Gon’ be alright, let me take you higher
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, higher, ooh, higher
You will see that all that’s right is not what’s right
Look around
Very often, we just get too out of sight
We go down
Want to take you higher
I wanna take you higher
Let me take you higher
Higher
Higher, yeah yeah, higher
Want to take you higher, higher
Have you ever been higher, higherEmbed
