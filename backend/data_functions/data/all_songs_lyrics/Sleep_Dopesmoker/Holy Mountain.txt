Holy Mountain LyricsSlumber killed by rays of the new red sun arising
Dreamer wakens to the spectral gaze of light rays shining
Black steed carries him across the astral sand
Rides alone is the man from the magic caravan
I believe the signs of the reptile master
Sunbound spacepod rising faster
Earth drenched in black under starless sky above
Man on the mountain sets free the holy dove
Look onto the rays of the new stoner sun rising
Sonic Titan rides out on clouds of new horizon
Look onto the rays of the new stoner sun rising
Sonic Titan rides out on clouds of new horizonEmbed
