Dopesmoker LyricsDrop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff filled land
Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff filled land
Proceeds the weedian - Nazareth
Proceeds the weedian - Nazareth
Creedsmen roll out across the dying dawn
Sacred Israel holy mountain Zion
Sun beams down on to the sandsea reigns
Caravan migrates through deep sandscape
Lungsmen unearth the creed of Hasheeshian
Procession of the weed-priests to cross the sands
Desert legion smoke-covenant is complete
Herb bails retied on to backs of beasts
Arise, arise, arise - The Son of the God of Israel
Jordan river flows on evermore
Bathe in glow of sunlight's beating rays
They feel the serpent's standard rule our days
Stoner caravan emerge from sandsea
Earthling inserts to chalice the green cutchie
Groundation soul finds trust upon smoking hose
Assembled creedsmen rises prayer-filled smoke
Raise up seer's holy prophecy
Plants down on upon years of the sun now feeds
Seed of Eden fall on nurtured soil
Onward caravan prepare new bong
Weed-priests creedsman chant the right
Judgment soon come to mankind
Green herbsmen serve rightful king
Hemp seed caravan carries
The molten fire flowed up toward Zion
Flight of the Nazarene to seek the cheribum
Rides out believer with the spliff aflame
Marijuanaut escapes earth to cultivate
Grow-room is church temple of the new stoner breed
Chants loud-robed priest down on to the freedom seed
Burnt offering redeems, completes smoked deliverance
Caravan's stoned deliverance
The caravan holds to eastern creed, now smokes believer
The chronicle of the sinsemillian
Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke toward the riff-filled land
Drop out of life with bong in hand
Follow the smoke - Jerusalem12Embed
