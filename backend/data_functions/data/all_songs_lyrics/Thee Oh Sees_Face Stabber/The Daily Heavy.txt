The Daily Heavy Lyrics
A new stop, baby, torn asunder
I shoved you down and you went under
I don't see us living on the stuff you plunder
You’re coming on strong with the rolling thunder

I'm an easy guy with a rifle under
An easy time in a world of thunder
The moves you're doing with the world asunder
A glue dude with a gun-look of wonder

A greasy man the moment you’re under
TC cracked down the walls of wonder
Bye-bye man, I know it's a blunder
Bye-bye man, I holler from under
Awful daddy but I bet he's a fun one
Easy running when the world's gone under
Bye-bye daddy, did you move the young ones?
Leave your ratty ratty world, now it's over

A new stop, baby, torn asunder
I shoved you down and you went under
I don't see us living on the stuff you plunder
You're coming on strong with the rolling thunderEmbed
