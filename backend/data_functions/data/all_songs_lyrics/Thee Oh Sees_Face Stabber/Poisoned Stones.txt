Poisoned Stones Lyrics
Hey
A big operation
Every night
It really suits you
In my eyes
Hey
Laying in the basement
Awake at night
Nobody with you
You'll be alright

Hey
Baking in the wasteland
Every night
It really suits you
In my eyes
Hey
Standing on the corner
Every night
Be who you want to
It's alright

Hey
Fix in the bathroom
It's all right
Maybe come and shoot you
But you can't die
Hey
Silent on the ceiling
Puddle on the floor
Who's that knocking
On your door?Embed
