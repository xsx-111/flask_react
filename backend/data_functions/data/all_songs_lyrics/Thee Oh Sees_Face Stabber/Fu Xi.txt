Fu Xi Lyrics
Run, run, see through sun
Bum, bum bum
One, two, turns the screw
Bum, bum bum
Hold your reigns up high
Bum, bum bum
See a hand in sky
Bum, bum bum

Hello, look behind you
Bum, bum bum
Behold, the coiling screw
Bum, bum bum
Then you're torn in two
Bum, bum bum
Last breath before death
Bum, bum bumEmbed
