Snickersnee Lyrics
Walk around with those expired eyes
Politicians tell you only lies
It possesses every breath you breathe
Hauling all that feculence around
I'm coming right behind you

Snicker-snack will have you on your knees
I'm about to minimize your needs
Suffocating influx of your feed
No more sighing every time you breathe
I'm coming right behind you

Walk around with those expired eyes
Politicians fill you only lies
It possesses every breath you breathe
Hauling all that feculence around
I'm coming right behind youEmbed
