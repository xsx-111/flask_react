The Experimenter Lyrics
Nothing always happens when you're down here a thousand miles
Nothing always happens when you lie, lie, lie around here
Everybody's happy when you look outside, it's heavy
Humans are all crawling around out here in the streets

Something always pops up when you're outside, oh yeah, it's heavy
Every goddamn time you got the blah blah blah in the street
Everybody's doing everybody else's thing
Everybody's talking about how, how, how it should beEmbed
