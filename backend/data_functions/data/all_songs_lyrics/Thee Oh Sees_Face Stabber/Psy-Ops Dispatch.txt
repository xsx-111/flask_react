Psy-Ops Dispatch Lyrics
Look at us together
Laying eye to eye
People on the screen keep saying
They need us alive
Wipe our minds together
Scanning all we find
Crush the job of filling people
With manufactured lies
They won't know

Lock us all together
Pulsing low-end sine
Image on the screen disrupting
A withered broken mind
Link us all together
Like a spider web
We shut down the information
Open up your eye
One more time

Look at us together
Standing under sky
Feel the sun upon our faces
Content to be alive
Brother versus brother
A weapon in my mind
This will be the story we tell
To keep the fear aliveEmbed
