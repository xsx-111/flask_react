Heartworm Lyrics
We don't talk a lot
Yet we have a lot to talk about
When you feel all fucked up
Grab a shard and cover me in cuts

The world's so fucked up
We've got worms swimming in our guts
But if we should all get fed up
There's one way to sew this whole thing up, up, up, up, up, up, up

We don't talk a lot
Yet we have a lot to talk about
When you feel all fucked up
Grab a shard and cover me in cuts

The world's so fucked up
We've got worms swimming in our guts
But if we should all get fed up
There's one way to sew this whole thing up, upEmbed
