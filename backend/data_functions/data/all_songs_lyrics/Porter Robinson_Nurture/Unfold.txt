Unfold Lyrics
Ooh, watching wild skies
Wishing with closed eyes
Ooh, run for a lifetime
Follow the signs

I put my pictures down
They're not as good as the real thing
"I wish I could go home"
You're just nostalgic
What do we wander from and only notice it now?
So be here with me

And I watched the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world

I was setting in stone until I noticed it right
Do you see how you've grown?
Don't be sorry, then
And I fall from my bones
And now I know I'm alive
I want you to find it
And I watched the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Causе I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder thе weight of the world

Thaw your hands now (I have been numb)
Put color in your cheeks (Where I belong)
I missed you back then
So be here with me
And I watched the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know

And I watched the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world

'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world
And I watched the water unfold
It's a feeling I want you to know
'Cause I'm not the same as I was
As I shoulder the weight of the world4Embed
