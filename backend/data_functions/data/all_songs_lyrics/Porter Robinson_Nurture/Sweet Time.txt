Sweet Time Lyrics
The child I was
Counting the days 'til the summer would come
But you don't live forever
Your mother will one day bring you home
And I feel so stupid
'Cause I wasn't scared of this before
But since I met you
I don't wanna die no more

So take a long time
'Cause, oh, the world is lucky to be your home, I know
I need a next life
'Cause I'm not satisfied to know you just once
So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know you just once

To live with dying
Oh, wouldn't you see our world as dark?
But I won't spend time
Rеsenting the way things are
So takе a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know you just once

So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know you just once
So take a long time
Oh, the world is lucky to be your home, I know
I need a next life
Not satisfied to know you just once

But I won't spend time resenting the way things are2Embed
