Something Comforting Lyrics
If I send this void away
Have I lost a part of me?
When you wake, you're bargaining
For the promise to come back

'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Oh, there must be
Something wrong with me
And getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Someone tell me
Something comforting


Take what you want, but you're tied by the tooth
Wasn't it meant to relieve you?
So suffer the signs that you needed to change
Heed all the ways you'd been thinking

'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Oh, there must be
Something wrong with me
'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Someone tell me
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting
Something comforting

And hoping made you hurt more
Oh, there must be
Something wrong with me
'Cause getting made you want more
And hoping made you hurt more
Someone tell me
Something comforting

Oh, something comforting11Embed
