Musician Lyrics
No, I don't miss the feeling anymore
Yeah, I want somethin' new to love
I was so nostalgic, but I'm fine without it
You don't really want what you think you want
No, I don't wanna lose it, this emotion
Yeah, I just wanna do everything
I get so excited when I finally find it
It just gets brighter from now on

Then you sigh
"You know I love you, so I think I should tell you, Porter
This life
Well, isn't it time that you grow up?"
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawn—
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clear—
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
Well, this is why we do it, for the feeling
How do you do music? Well, it's easy
You just face your fears and you become your hеroes
I don't understand why you're frеaking out

Then they say, "Fine
Well, do what you need to
But I don't wanna see you wasting your life
Now isn't it time you get a job?"

Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawn—
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clear—
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself

But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clearly
And I know it doesn't last
But I don't mind at all anymore
Oh, it's calling
I just can't stop, I'm sorry
I can feel a new day dawn—
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself
But sincerely
Can't you feel what I'm feeling?
I can see my life so clear—
I burn up, burn out
I shouldn't do this to myself8Embed
