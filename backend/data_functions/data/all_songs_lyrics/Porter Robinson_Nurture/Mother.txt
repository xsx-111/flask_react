Mother Lyrics
I was born
In a sudden embrace, I'm awake
So I study the shape of your face
You take what you're given
"I only wanna do what's good for you"
Then at once
I'm checking the doors and my weight
I can't keep my hands from my face
I said, "Mom, I'm so sorry"
She smiled and said, "Darling
I don't want you to worry, 'cause

I'm on your side for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry, my child
And now there's an empty room you outgrew
But I'm here for you, ooh, ooh"


And I've known
The feeling you've had when you're held
The comfort of being unwell
So somеthing can cradle you
Oh, I don't need it
Oh, I won't grieve it
"I'm on your sidе for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry, my child
And now there's an empty room you outgrew
But I'm here for you, ooh, ooh"

I'll do right by you, you, you, you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I only wanna do what's best for you

"I'm on your side for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry, my child
And though there's an empty room you outgrew
I'll wait for you, ooh, ooh"

"I'm on your side for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry, my child
And now there's an empty room you outgrew
But I'm here for you, ooh, ooh"4Embed
