Trying to Feel Alive Lyrics
Well, do you feel better now?
I thought I'd run until the sky came out
And with the sunlight on my face
Something changed

And just trying to feel alive
You climbed a mountain, are you satisfied?
As you stand at the top
You already wanna do this
One more time

Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize
Maybe I don't really need to feel satisfied
Maybe it's a gift that I spend all this time
Just trying to feel alive
Maybe I don't really wanna be satisfied
Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize
Maybe this all, maybe this was all

And then somebody somewhere finds
The warmth of summer in the songs you write
Maybe it's a gift that I couldn't recognize
