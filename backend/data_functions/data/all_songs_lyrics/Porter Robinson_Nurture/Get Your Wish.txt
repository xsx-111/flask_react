Get Your Wish Lyrics
I'll make it right again
"But it's no use," you said
As my hunger grows and grows
I have to write the meaning of my life
Or else everything's in vain

When the glory tries to tempt you
It may seem like what you need
But if glory makes you happy
Why are you so broken up?

So tell me how it felt
When you walked on water
Did you get your wish?
Floating to the surface
Quicker than you sank
Idol, idol
So tell me how it felt
When you walked on water
Did you get your wish?
Floating to the surface
Quicker than you sank
Idol, idol
Don't say you lose just yet
Get up and move ahead
And not only for yourself
'Cause that's your role
The work that stirred your soul
You can make for someone else

One day you choke, your urges overflow
And obsession wears you down
But don't you waste the suffering you've faced
It will serve you in due time

So tell me how it felt
When you walked on water
Did you get your wish?
Floating to the surface
Quicker than you sank
Idol, idol
So tell me how it felt
When you walked on water
Did you get your wish?
Floating to the surface
Quicker than you sank
Idol, idol
So tell me18Embed
