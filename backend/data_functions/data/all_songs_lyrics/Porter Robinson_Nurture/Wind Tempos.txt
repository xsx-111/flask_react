Wind Tempos Lyrics
It's so holy
It's so holy, it's so ho—, so holy, so holy
To point out you, to point out you, you
Dream of you, you
It's so holy, it's so ho—, so holy, so holy
To point out you, to point out you, you
Dream of you, you
So I'll dream
It's so holy, it's so ho—, so holy, so holy
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream
It's so holy, it's so ho—, so holy, so holy
To point out you, to point out you, you
It's so holy, it's so ho—, so holy, so holy
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream of you
So I'll dream
It's so holy, it's so holy, holy, ho—
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Out, out, out, out, —ly
It's so, it's so holy, it's so holy, holy
It's so ho—, it's so holy, it's so holy3Embed
