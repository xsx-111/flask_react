He Went Down to the Sea LyricsHe winked an eye and the sun went out
He winked another and the stars came out
He drew his breath and the wind blew soft
And then he went down to the sea
And then he went down to the sea
He threw a rock and the seagulls soared
He touched another and the oceans roared
He traced a name there in the sand
And thought of the girl that used to be
And thought of the girl that used to be
He plucked a rose and he held it high
He brushed its beauty on the sky
He held it close to taste the red
But like his love, the rose was dead
The wind blew cold and he drew his breath
The cold wind told him the secret of death
He whispered a name to the faint starlight
And turned and walked into the night
And turned and walked into the night
And then he went down to the sea
And thought of the girl that used to be
But like his love, the rose was deadEmbed
