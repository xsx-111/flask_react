Cuckoo LyricsCuckoo, cuckoo, who's got the cuckoo?
Cuckoo, cuckoo, who's got the cuckoo?
Now someone stole my cuckoo
And I wanna know who-who
Did you take my?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Someone played a joke on me
That ain't very hard to see
Did you take my?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Now someone thinks I'm a fool
Who's got it, who-who?
Have you got my?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Now if you ain't got my cuckoo
Who are you, who-who?
Hey, you're my cuckoo
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Now someone took my cuckoo
I wanna know who-who
Did you take my?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?
Now if you didn't take my cuckoo
Who are you, who-who?
Ah, you're my cuckoo
Who's got the cuckoo?
Who's got the cuckoo?Embed
