Better Off Dead Lyrics


Heheh.. Heheh. Yeah!
Got him now. 
Hey, Cube! Cube, boy!

What, what? Whattup?


Get your ass UP!

Aiii... Ohh, shit!

Time to go!

Whassup? Ooh, man, shit!
We goin' for a 'little walk
Close 7! 

'Ey, man. 'Ey, man!

What?

I never did like you. 

Open it up!


Strap him in! All right... Calm down!
You got any last words?


Yeah. Yeah, I got some last words... FUCK ALL Y'ALL!

"Was America willing to maintain order...
No matter what the cost?"Embed
