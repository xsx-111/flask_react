Prince LyricsWilling and able to run
I am
Willing and able, I'm able to come
Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able, I'm able to come
And if I wait for you now
Would you come?
Would you run?
Would you bring it back around?
Oh, baby how?
And if I wait for you now
Would you come?
Would you run?
Would you bring it back around?
Oh, baby how?
Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able, I'm able to come
If it all went away
Nothin' left to say
Oh, would you fight it or would you lay down?
At the hand of your God
Oh, could you see the light
Oh my prince, can't you see what's been found?
Willing and able to run
Willing and able to come
Willing and able to run
I am willing, I am willing
Willing, willing
Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come
Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come
And if I wait for you now
Would you come
Would you run
Would you bring it back around
Oh, baby how
And if I wait for you now
Would you come
Would you run
Would you bring it back around
Oh, baby how
Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to come
Willing and able to run
I am
Willing and able I'm able to comeEmbed
