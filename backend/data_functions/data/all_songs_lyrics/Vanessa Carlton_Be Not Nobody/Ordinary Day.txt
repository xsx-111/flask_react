Ordinary Day Lyrics
Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but he was looking to the sky
And as he asked if I would come along
I started to realize
That every day he finds just what he's looking for
And like a shooting star, he shines

And he said, "Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand?"

And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Although they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes
His vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said

"Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand?"
In the palm of your hand
Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee
Can you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?
Did he ask if I would come along?
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal, and he said

"Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand?
In the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand"

Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy
But he was looking to the sky1Embed
