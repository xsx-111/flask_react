Unsung Lyrics
If only I could get into that corner of your head
Where things finally match, and meet the standards that you set
Oh, how I wish I was the treasure that you were lookin' for
Bet I would feel better, if only I could find the door

I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
I am melting away

I wait for the words on the tip of your tounge
I'm only as good as the last one
Well, you decide and I abide, as my song goes unsung (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Things are goin' crazy and I'm not sure who to blame
Everything is changing and I do not feel the same
I'm slippin' through the cracks of floors I thought that were strong
I'm tryin' to find a place where I can feel like I belong

Well, I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
I am melting away
If I could be the lesson that you learn, you learn if only
I could be the last one that love burns, its burns...yeah
If I could be the lesson that you learn, you learn if only
I could be the last one that love burns, its burns...yeah

If only I could get into that corner of your head
Where things finally match, and meet the standards that you set
Oh, how I wish I was the treasure that you were lookin' for
Bet I would feel better if I could find the door

Well, I am cryin'
You aren't tryin'
And I am melting away

If I could be the lesson that you learn, you learn if only
I could be the last one that love burns, its burns...yeahEmbed
