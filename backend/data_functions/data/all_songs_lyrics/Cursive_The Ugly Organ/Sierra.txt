Sierra Lyrics
In the desert, where the cities are made of gold
There's a girl playing hopscotch with pink ribbon pigtails
And her mom calls out from an apartment balcony
"Come on, baby! Your bath is ready!
It's almost time for sleep!"

And I wonder, who's the father....
And I wonder what they call her - Sierra

Does her mother smoke, or does she jog every morning?
Does she drink when she thinks about me?
Or doesn't she need to drink?
Does she have a man who works a nine to five?
Does he come home to kiss our young Sierra
Tuck her in and say goodnight?

And an extra kiss for mama
I want that kiss, that kid, that apartment

I'm ready to settle down now
So get that man out of my bed
I want my daughter back now
I want to kiss her, tuck her in, and say
"Goodnight, my baby girl, Sierra"
Sierra, Sierra, Sierra, Sierra
I'll never know, know who you are
And I don't deserve to
Sierra, Sierra, Sierra, Sierra
My little girl
We would've been so... oh, nevermind

But I'm ready to settle down now
Yeah, I'm ready to leave that wrecking ball behind
And I could be your carpenter
And you could be my twinkling north star o'er the desert skyEmbed
