Some Red Handed Sleight of Hand Lyrics
And now we proudly present
Songs perverse and songs of lament
A couple hymns of confession
And songs that recognize our sick obsessions
Sing along - I'm on the ugly organ, again
Sing along - I'm on the ugly organ, so let's begin
There's no use to keep a secret
Everything I hide ends up in lyrics
So read on - accuse me when you're done
If it sounds like I did you wrong

Whoa-oh

Our Father, who art in heaven
Save me from the wreck I'm about to drown in
Didn't I learn anything
Counting out my sins on rosary beads?
The reverend plays on the ugly organ, uh-huh
He spews out his sweet and salty sermon
On the audience
So why do I think I'm any different?
I've been making money off my indifference
We all pass the hat around
'This is my body', this is the blood I found
On my hands, after I wrote this album
Play it off as stigmata for crossover fans
Some red-handed sleight of hand
Whoa-oh
Whoa, yeah
Wow
Whoa, whoa-oh8Embed
