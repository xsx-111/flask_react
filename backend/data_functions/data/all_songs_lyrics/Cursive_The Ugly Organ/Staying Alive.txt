Staying Alive LyricsI've decided tonight
I'm staying alive
Just kicking and screaming
I'm, I'm staying alive
Blood boiling and streaming
There are things
Far too dark to comprehend
Sleep on it one more night
My sad old friend
Alive
I'm staying alive
Alive
I'm staying alive
Kicking and screaming
Blood boiling and streaming
Staying alive
Doo-do, doo-do, doo-do, doo-do
The worst is overEmbed
