Bloody Murderer Lyrics
There's a ghost in my bed
She cries in her sleep
She says I won't let her leave
I lie perfectly still
She stifles her tears
I don't want to disturb her

"Let go, let go - please let me be
Look at the ghost you've made of me"
Ohh-oh-oh-oh

Dusk dropped her starry gown
I whispered out
"Sweetie, are you here with me?"

The mirror crashed on the dresser
And she began to scream
"Bloody murderer! Let me rest in peace!" (Hey!)
"When I was yours, you fled the scene
Now you can't wash your hands of me!"
Ohh-oh-oh-oh
Bloody murder
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bloody murder
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bloody murder!
You can't hear the screams (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Bloody murder
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)1Embed
