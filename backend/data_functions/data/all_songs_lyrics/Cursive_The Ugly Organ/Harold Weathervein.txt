Harold Weathervein LyricsHarold walks down any street of this town
Both crier and witness
The sun drops, the clouds shift
His legs twitch
The clocks chime
On caf√©s, pharmacies, and dime stores
In bar rooms, he sits all alone
Erupting
In his head, it's like the weather
In his head, it's like the weather
In his head, it's like the weather
Oh, oh, oh
Back and forth, it's like the weather
Back and forth, it's like the weather
Back and forth, it's like the weather
When it rains, it pours down
Weatherman, do you feel?
Do you feel?
Is it stormy inside of your veins?
Weatherman, do you feel?
Is it stormy inside of your veins?Embed
