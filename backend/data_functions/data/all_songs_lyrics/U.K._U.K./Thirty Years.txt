Thirty Years Lyrics
Chasing rainbows for a lifetime that left you girl
Like shadows from the sun
Run into traces of faces you thought you saw
But never seemed to mean much more
Than echoes of a day gone by
When someone else would have to try
To light the stars
In your sky

All the things you planned
Just sand castles washed away
On tidal waves of tears
The fears overpowering
Your complex dreams just slither down
Drowning in rocky pools
Or smashed and dashed on peril's course
Divorcing prematurely thoughts
Of lasting love
In your life

Sometime when you've time to spare
Dreaming of missed opportunities
Spare a tear and douse your bridge (Burning)
Thirty years and on the ledge (Learning)



All the things you planned (fading)
Thirty years in bed (waiting)
All the things you planned (fading)
Thirty years in bed (waiting)

Chasing rainbows for a lifetime that left you girl
Like shadows from the sun
Run into traces of faces you thought you saw
But never seemed to mean much more
Than echoes of a day gone by
When someone else would have to try
To light the stars
In your sky, your dark skyEmbed
