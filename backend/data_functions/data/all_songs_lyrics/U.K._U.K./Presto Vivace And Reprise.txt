Presto Vivace And Reprise Lyrics

Don't tell me that
The wages of sin are for real
The writing's on the wall
What's the score, what's the deal?
No wonder we can't see
Through the wood to the trees
No perfume we design
Can ever veil the sickness on the breeze

By the light of day
In the dead of nightEmbed
