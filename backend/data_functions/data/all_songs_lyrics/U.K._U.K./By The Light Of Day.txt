By The Light Of Day Lyrics
Black clouds moving gray sky to thunder
Kinetic sunrise fever and flood
Fire and water element anger
Horizon melting to blood

By the light of day
By the light of day

Silent wheel advancing years
Power and glory growing fears
Love's a dream that some pretend
Accelerates an early end

By the light of day
By the light of day


By the light of day
By the light of day
(Love's a dream that some pretend...)Embed
