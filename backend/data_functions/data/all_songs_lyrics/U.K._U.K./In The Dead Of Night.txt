In The Dead Of Night Lyrics
Are you one of mine
Who can sleep with one eye open wide?
Agonizing psychotic
Solitary hours to decide
Reaching for the light
At the slightest noise from the floor
Now your hands perspire
Heart goes leaping at a knock from the door

In the dead of night
In the dead of night

Rich and powerful ascend
Complicated bends to be free
To indulge in what they will
Any jaded thrill or fantasy
Shuttered windows that belie
All the stifled cries from within
And prying eyes are blind
To proceedings of the kind that begin

In the dead of night
In the dead of night

In the dead of night
In the dead of night1Embed
