Nevermore Lyrics
Nevermore, the sights
Black forest, cool moonlight
Blue shadows reflect
In windows, in direct

Oh to go down to Soho
There bold spirits don't sink so low

Gold amber of lights
Beer glasses, misty nights

Oh to go down to Soho
Black tie night out, hobo outright
Singles' bars, cruising shark cars
Soho neon glow...

Nevermore...

When day is dawning
You wipe the sleep slowly from your eyes
And you remember
Soho's neon disguise...

Eyes reflect in windows direct
Soho neon glow...Embed
