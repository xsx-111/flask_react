Mental Medication Lyrics
Mental medication
Sweet music's conversation
Play for all creation here
Melody fair
Lost in contemplation
Drowned in meditation
Need your inspiration near
When I'm alone I remember
Truth is lasting

With the sun in your eyes
And a simple disguise you fooled me
Strange how your calling is clear
From the sound of your voice
You didn't give me no choice, you moved me
Deep lies desire for your quickening fire

Well it's a hell of a ride
When your courage inside deserts you
Clear though the calling may be
In a terrible way
You continue to say you need me
Show me the way through your dark red door


Mental medication
Music's conversation
Need your inspiration near
Melody fairEmbed
