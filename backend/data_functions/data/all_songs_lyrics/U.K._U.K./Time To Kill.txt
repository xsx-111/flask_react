Time To Kill Lyrics
Rip the sheets off ice cold again
Wolf at the door, can I stand
A dog's life here for one day more
Close my eyes imagine somewhere
So far away, silver sand
And azure Caribbean Sea

Sick of solitary holidays
'Cause I never get away from here

Listen to the water drip down
Into the cell, run amok
If I survive this living hell
Holed up in this cold calaboose
Captivity even takes
My lucid thoughts away from me

Time to kill, going nowhere
Killing time, staying where there's
Time to kill, going nowhere
Killing time, staying where there's...

Time to kill, going nowhere
Killing time, staying where there's
Time to kill, going nowhere
Killing time, staying where there's...Embed
