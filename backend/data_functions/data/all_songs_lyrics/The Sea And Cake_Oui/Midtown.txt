Midtown LyricsAlright don't say, but I do
Was something that you ought to know
I was hoping for daylight
When you stop by, look at you
I was hoping, well you ought to know
Keeping track of this daylight

Extraordinary, a what I hear, someone better talk this over
Reputations, yeah I don't need, someone better talk this over
Alright don't say, but I do
Was something that you ought to know
I was hoping for daylight
When you stop by, look at you
I was hoping, well you ought to know
Keeping track of this daylight
Well I don't strategize yeah, someone better talk this over
Extraordinary, a what I hear, someone better talk this over
Investigation, well that's a showdown, someone better talk this over
Atmospheric, yeah right on time, someone better talk this over
I don't let on, that you done wrong
That's the last fight
I don't let on, that you done wrong
Well it's alright, but todayEmbed
