Everyday LyricsTry me, senseless today
Before daylight they came
Falling, not to get up
Before, nothing could change
Balance, taking what's there
Try me, senseless goodnight
So long, try not to wonder
So long, falling not to get up ya
Try me, so tender
The last time it's so nice to get there
Try me, so tender
Bet you don't foget to wonder too
A balance has taken so long
So long, try not to wonder
So long, falling not to get up yaEmbed
