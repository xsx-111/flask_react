The Colony Room LyricsSuddenly, oh that dream, parallels anywhere
Wake up now, it's all to clear
Wasting, time a bets on fear
Welcome to the top, well I thought so
Bring it to an end, without hassle
No disaster, I guarantee
Suddenly the longest year
Speak up now, I brought you here
Chased around, crossed up wires
Unaware I'm just so tired
Welcome to the top, well I thought so
Bring it to an end without hassle
I would have done the same at least I thought soEmbed
