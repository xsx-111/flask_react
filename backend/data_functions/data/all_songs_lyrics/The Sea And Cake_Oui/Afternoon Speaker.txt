Afternoon Speaker LyricsGracefull sunsets are cheating in the air, do you dare
Liquid features are breaking up the door, we don't care
Down right sleepy and locked up insecure, do you dare
All I give, explanations
All I give I take why not today
Wasn't that a put down
Keepin' up with social
Falling in the middle
All I give, explanations
All I give I take why not today
Wasn't that a put downEmbed
