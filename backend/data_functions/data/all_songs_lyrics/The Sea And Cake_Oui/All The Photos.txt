All The Photos LyricsLiving, get up now. get up off my hands
Broadside the hazy day, the brightest slides away
Outside the reasons hide be careful what you say
Alright you'll never know so take it anyway
Hold out looking sweet the pressure comes to play
Broadside shall we say suspects glide away
Save it on the broadside, keep on keep on keep on
So you say it's alright , keep on keep on keep on
Save it on the broadside, keep on keep on keep on
Some of us we don't say, give it up we'd rather keep on time
Some of us a couldn't say, will you try to stay
When you gonna give it back
Yeah you gonna find you just can't hide
When you gonna make it right further down the way
So you done got my eye, did you want to make it right this time
Further up in my arms, reel on down the way
Some of us just won't say, give it up we'd rather keep on time
Some of us a couldn't say, will you try to stayEmbed
