Seemingly LyricsAfraid I don't have to
Afraid I don't have to
Afraid I don't have to
How shall I demonstrate
If you want I promise to
How shall I demonstrate
If you want I promise to
Save it for the right time, ready now let's go, I've been to your side
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have to
Better off too slow, measure the down size, crazy the whole time
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have to
So I'd rather not stay, challenged to let go, indifferent you do right
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have to
Taken with dismay, steady now be sure, hardly the wrong time
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have to
Save it for the right time, ready now let's go, I've been to your side
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have to
Better off too slow, measure the down size, crazy the whole time
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have to
So I'd rather not stay, challenged to let go, indifferent you do right
So I'd rather, afraid I don't have toEmbed
