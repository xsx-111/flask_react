Two Dolphins LyricsPass out, celebrate now, look for a way to pay
Worn out, disappear now
Second time, I shouldn't hear this, endless miles away
Photograph, reappear now
So what, celebrate now, endless miles away
And I know that it sounds right, many miles away
Paradox stay forever, celebrate this day
Anxiously it's a given, carefully appear, anxiously
I wouldn't say that, I would have sold that
And I know that it sounds right, many miles away
Paradox stay forever, celebrate this day
Anxiously it's a given, carefully appear, anxiously
Precious, no way out now, that's what they said to me
Seven years, reappear now
So what, celebrate now, endless miles awayEmbed
