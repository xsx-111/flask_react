The Leaf LyricsI'm waiting, on these over sights
Telling secrets about it all night yeah, so skillfully
Oh my darling, on this pale night
I'm waiting, so skillfully
All my last thoughts, frame these winter smiles
Too brilliantly, oh but I doubt it
I'm afraid that, there's no reason, I waited
I'm waiting till the winter dies, skillfully
Ah to bat an eye
Made up faces, skillfully
Ah but I doubt it, and then some yeah
I'm afraid that, there's no reason, I waitedEmbed
