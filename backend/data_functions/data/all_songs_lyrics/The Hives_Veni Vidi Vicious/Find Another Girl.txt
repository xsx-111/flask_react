Find Another Girl LyricsFind yourself another girl
Who will love you true, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save her love and kisses just for you
Save her love and kisses just for you
The very first time I fell in love
Got my heart broken then
People would say when I passed their way
"There's a hot young man going there, going there
An unhappy lad going there"
Well one day my mother called me to her side, said
"Son, why you so blue?"
Mother, I lost the girl that I love
Why won't you tell me what to do?
Mother, won't you tell me what to do?
Well, she said
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you true, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save her love and kisses just for you
Save her love and kisses just for you
I can imagine how you feel, my son
But throw it out of your mind
I'm going to tell you kind of truthfully
True love is hard to find sometimes
It's kinda hard to find
But forget about that girl that broke your heart
And try and start anew
For if there was a guy for her
There's got to be a girl somewhere for you
Got to be a girl somewhere for you
You just go on and
Find yourself another girl
Who will love you true, true, true
Find yourself another girl
Save all her love and kisses just for you
Save all her love for nobody but you
Ooh, another love
Ooh, another love
Ooh, another love
Save her love and kissses just for you
Save all her love for nobody but youEmbed
