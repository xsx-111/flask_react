A Get Together to Tear It Apart Lyrics
I had a tension, I had a ten
I was a better honey, so I did it again
Thought my intentions were better
Tried to put mind over matter
I lost my edge on things when I lost my head

Hey, that's what they say
Don't you know they ain't never going to help you anyway

And it's a (Get together to tear it apart)
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about
But my middle finger is going to carry it out

I got attention, I had a pen
I made history, honey and got "Please do it again"
But there is no chance I'm going to do it again
If you missed it the first time
Then it's nine to ten that you will again
And we're back at the end
Back at the end all over again
And they say Hey (Hey!)
That's what they say
Don't you know they ain't never going to but I feel okay

And it's a (Get together to tear it apart)
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about
But my middle finger is going to carry it out
(Get together to tear it apart)
Gave my middle finger a brand new start
I got a greeting, can't say what it's all about
But my middle finger is going to carry it out1Embed
