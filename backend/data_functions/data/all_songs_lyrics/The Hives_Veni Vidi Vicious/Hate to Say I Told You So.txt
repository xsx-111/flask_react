Hate to Say I Told You So Lyrics

Do what I want 'cause I can and if I don't
Because I wanna
Be ignored by the stiff and the bored
Because I'm gonna
Spit and retrieve cause I give and receive
Because I wanna
Gonna get through your head what the mystery man said
Because I'm gonna

Hate to say I told you so
Alright, come on
Do believe I told you so...

Now it's all out and you knew
Cause I wanted to
Turn my back on the rot that's been planning the plot
Because I'm gonna
No need for me to wait
Because I wanna
No need two, three too late
Because I'm gonna
Hate to say I told you so
Alright, come on
Do believe I told you so...


Do what I please, gonna spread the disease
Because I wanna
Gonna call all the shots for the "No"s and the "Not"s
Because I wanna
Yeah!

Ask me once I'll answer twice cause what I know I'll tell
Because I wanna!
Sound device and lots of ice I'll spell my name out loud
Because I wanna!
Oh yeah!5Embed
