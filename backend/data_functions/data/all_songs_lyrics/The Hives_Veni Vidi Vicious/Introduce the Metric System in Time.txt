Introduce the Metric System in Time LyricsBeen trying for all my life
But I can't add up your subtraction
Work, eat, play then go to sleep
That won't get me no satisfaction
Gotta find a way out, yea
A way out of this mess
So sick of trying to make my time last
An' ending up with less
Know your way of doing things and it
Lost its attraction
Why settle for twenty four
When I can have a hundred fractions?
Who knew I'd be the one
Pulling off that perfect crime?
So here's my new line
I'll change your mind
And the metric system to time
Caused trouble all over the town
An' it's bound to start a reaction
Metric time will come around
It's gonna overtake your contraction
I've found a way out, yea
A way out of this stress
I made my time last and it's
Total success
Got my way of doing things
And it's bound to gain your attraction
Hundred hours is my supply
It's gonna give us all satisfaction
No doubt I'd be the one
Pulling off the perfect crime
So here's my new line
I'll change from mind
And the metric system to timeEmbed
