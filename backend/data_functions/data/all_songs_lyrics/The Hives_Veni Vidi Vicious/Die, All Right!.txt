Die, All Right! Lyrics
Hey, I've got a message and tonight and I'm gonna send it
Yeah, I had a body and men with knives wanted to lend it
Sold my body to the company store
I got the money now away I go
Thank you Mr. CEO

Hey, I've got some money and tonight I'm gonna spend it
Yeah, they gave me a paper and I went ahead and penned it
And I say thank you Mr. CEO

I filled my pockets now I might as well
(Die!)
Cause I found the backdoor out of teenage hell
(All right!)
Filed my account cause I might in fact
(Die!)
But I rely on science, yeah to bring me back
(All right!)
I-I-I-I-I'm...a-gonna di-i-i-i-ie
Heavy morals seem so light
But when it comes to cash I'm gonna die all right

Hey, I lost the money seems like I can't comprehend it
Yeah, I got a hole in my head, gotta gotta mend it
Too messed up to sit and settle down
Too messed up to even mess around
That's why you're smiling Mr. CEO
I filled my pockets now I might as well
(Die!)
Cause I found the backdoor out of teenage hell
(All right!)
Filed my account cause I might in fact
(Die!)
But I rely on science, yeah to bring me back
(All right!)
I-I-I-I-I'm...a-gonna di-i-i-i-ie
But not right now

Yeah, why don't you do the same?
I got the money now I can't complain
Except the tics won't go away
Oh no, oh no, oh no, OH NO!
And the way I feel tonight
Is gonna make me die all right

I filled my pockets now I might as well
(Die!)
Cause I found the backdoor out of teenage hell
(All right!)
Filed my account cause I might in fact
(Die!)
But I rely on science, yeah to bring me back
(All right!)
I-I-I-I-I'm...a-gonna di-i-i-i-ie
Heavy morals seem so light
But when it comes to cash I'm gonna die all right!1Embed
