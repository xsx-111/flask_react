Knock Knock Lyrics
This time you got it all figured out
Think it's going to work okay
But I'll make sure it won't
'Cause I'll be standing in your way

So wait a minute if you will
I ain't got no time but time to kill
When the ground starts getting hot
It doesn't matter if you run or not

This time you've seen it done before
This time you're going to get it right
Once more you fail miserably and then
Then you do it all over again

So wait a minute if you will
I ain't got no time but time to kill
When the ground starts getting hot
It doesn't matter if you run or not

Once a failure, twice a fool
I will (knock, knock)
If you won't (knock, knock)
You're damned (knock, knock)
If you don't (knock, knock)
You did fine (knock, knock)
Now you're mine (knock, knock)
You avoided everything except for me
I'm busting in
Won't pick the lock
I'm busting in
Knock, knock

I've seen your sort before
You are nothing new
'Cause my name is failure
And failure is going to come to you

Save me lord and I will
This time I got the time to kill
When the ground starts getting hot
It doesn't matter if you run or not

Once a failure, twice a fool
'Cause I will (knock, knock)
If you won't (knock, knock)
You're damned (knock, knock)
If you don't (knock, knock)
You did fine (knock, knock)
Now you're mine (knock, knock)
You avoided everything except for me
I'm busting in
Won't pick the lock
I'm busting in
Knock, knock

Knock, knock
I'm busting in, knock, knock
Knock, knock
I'm busting in, knock, knockEmbed
