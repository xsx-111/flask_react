Supply and Demand LyricsMy boss he's a probable bore
Put me hands and knees on scrubable floor
Do it right receive the lions share bliss
Know all too well just where that ration is
Learned a lot about the company dough
Learned less about receiving it though
Saw how it came to those who always sat pretty
Don't need it
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
My girl had a probable cause
Or so she said, and took a probable pause
I was dumped for occupying her time
I asked her why and what was next in line, she said
"Shiny hair--that's my life ambition
But I'll devote my time to a newer mission
The rizzle-razzle kitsch of paranoid city"
Don't need it
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Su-su- supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demand
Supply and demandEmbed
