Outsmarted Lyrics
Outsmarted!

I used to be the kid who always got caught
I used to be the one who never let thought
Interact one bit with intellectual shit, diversity and wit
You used to be the kid who waited in line
For an opportunity to waste away time
Trying to be so cool
No suspicion, no clue
You've been-

Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted!

Now I'm the kid who put the shit back in place
And I'm the one who threw it back in your face
It took a little bit of intellectual shit, diversity and wit
Now you're the kid who put the 'L' back in lame
And you're the one who's always fitted the frame
Still such a fool
No suspicion, no clue
You've been-
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap, surprise
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted! I'm selling you--

You're outsmarted! (Yeah!)
That's what I said (Yeah!)
Yeah! (Yeah!)
I'm only throwing back what you've been putting in my face
Whoa!

Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap (Surprise!)
Outsmarted! I'm selling you for scrap
Outsmarted! I'm selling you....
For...scrap!!Embed
