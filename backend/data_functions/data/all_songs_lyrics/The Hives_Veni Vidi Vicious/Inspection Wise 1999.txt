Inspection Wise 1999 LyricsDo you know the secret hand shake?
You best use it
Here they come with ringing ears
Social misfits
Someone's gotta go
Just thought you should know
And so it has to be
The one who held the key
Check the time, T minus 5
And you're still looking
Too good to be true
So what's your secret?
Someone's gotta go
Just thought you should know
And so it has to be
The one who held the key
Someone's gotta go
Just thought you should know
And so it has to be
The one who held the keyEmbed
