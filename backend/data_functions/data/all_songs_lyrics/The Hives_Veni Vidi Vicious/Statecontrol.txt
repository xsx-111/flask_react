Statecontrol LyricsI've been around the world
Take credit for the things I've done
I've done a lot of things
And I just turned 21
They tied me up
Put red tape around my hands
I got caught in the web
'Cause I didn't stand a chance
I can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line and repeat it again
I can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line and repeat it again
I said please Mr. Doctor won't you cure my disease
I got a sore throat and I got scrubs on my knees
No matter what I do I can't get it straight
I tried to sort things out but I'm still stuck in the state
I can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line and repeat it again
I can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line, repeat again
I'm gonna lie, I'm gonna cheat
I'm gonna follow their lead then skip a beat
I'm gonna lie, I'm gonna cheat
And if that don't do it I don't know what will
I'm gonna lie, I'm gonna cheat
I'm gonna follow their lead then skip a beat
I'm gonna lie, I'm gonna cheat
I can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line and repeat it again
I can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line and repeat it again
Can't control the state I'm in
Go back in line and repeat it again
Can't control the state I'm inEmbed
