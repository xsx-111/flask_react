Main Offender Lyrics
I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of being an ass
And I got a lotta nerve that I'm ready to pass
I'm on my way
Can't settle down
Stuck in ways of sadistic joy
My talent only goes as far as to annoy, I'm on my way

This is my main offender
This is what I've got and it got me saying
Why me?

I'm on my way
I get around
Not all too sure about what I do
I feel I've got to stop a second just to think it through
And so I stop

I'm on my way
Yeah, I get around
Thought it all over and now I spit it out
When I spit, I spit on those that I care less about, I'm on my way
This is my main offender
This is what I've got and it got me saying
Why me?

I'm on my way1Embed
