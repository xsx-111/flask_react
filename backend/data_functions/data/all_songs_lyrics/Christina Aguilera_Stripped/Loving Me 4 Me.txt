Loving Me 4 Me Lyrics
People ask if I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm sitting here with your picture
And smilin' to myself (I smile)
I'm kinda lost in my own thoughts of you
My heart speaks before my mind thinks through
And I blush as I say 'Yes' (Yes)

What a feeling of vulnerability comin' over me
And I'm feeling weak and I can't speak (Speak)
I can't think, no
Never thought I'd give in so willingly to a human being
With abilities to set me free (Free), let me be me
Makes me wanna say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, filling me like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me 4 me (Loving me)
Is that you're loving me 4 me (Hey)
Now people ask why I'm in love with you
Well, let me start by sayin'
You got my heart by just bein' who you are
And what we got is between me and you
It doesn't matter 'bout the money
I make or what I do, or that I'm a star

Unconditionally, you're there for me
Undeniably, you inspire me, spiritually, so sweet
This is meaningful, it's incredible, pleasurable, unforgettable
The way I feel (Feel), so sweet, makes me wanna say

Your lips, your love, your smile, your kiss
I must admit it's a part of me
You please me, complete me, filling me like a melody
Your soul, your flow, your youth, your truth is simply proof
We were meant to be
But the best quality (Best quality) that's hookin' me
Is that you're loving me 4 me (Loving me, loving me)
Is that you're loving me 4 me (Hey)

It's so amazing how something so sweet
Has come and rearranged my life
I've been kissed by destiny, oh, Heaven came and saved me
An angel was placed at my feet; this isn't ordinary
He's loving me 4 me
Stripped of all makeup
No need for fancy clothes
No cover ups, push ups
With him, I don't have to put on a show
He loves every freckle, every curve
Every inch of my skin
Fulfilling me entirely
Taking all of me in
He's real, he's honest
He's loving me 4 me
