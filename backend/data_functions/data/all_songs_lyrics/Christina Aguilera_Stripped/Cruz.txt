Cruz Lyrics
I'm leavin' today
Livin' it, leavin' it to change

Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Tongue tied and twisted are all my memories
Celebrating a fantasy come true
Packing all my bags, finally on the move

I'm leavin' today
I'm livin' it, oh, I'm leavin' it to change

As I'm driving, I'm captured by the view
So much beauty, the road becomes my muse
The heat is rising and my hand surfs through the wind
Cool, calm, collected is a child that lies within

See, I'm leavin' today
I'm livin' it, oh, I'm leavin' it to change (Oh yeah)
See, I'm leavin' today
Oh yes, I'm livin' it, oh, I'm leavin' it to change
But somehow I'll miss it
I think I'll really miss it one day, yeah, oh
I turn up the radio
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before
Turn down the memories of yesteryears and broken dreams
I'm free, finally free
Ooh-ooh
Slowly drifting into a peaceful breeze
Oh, ooh, yeah

I'm leavin' today
Oh yes, I'm livin' it (Oh yeah)
Leavin' it to change (To change), I know
See, I'm leavin' today
Oh yes, I'm livin' it (Livin' it)
Leavin' it (Leavin' to change)
Oh
I'm leavin' today (Oh, I'm leavin' it, leavin' it to change)
Livin' it, livin' it to change
Oh, yeah
Livin' it, leavin' it
Said I'm livin' it, I'm leavin' it
Livin' it, leavin' it to change (I'm leavin' it to change)

But somehow I'll miss it
I think I'll really miss it
One day3Embed
