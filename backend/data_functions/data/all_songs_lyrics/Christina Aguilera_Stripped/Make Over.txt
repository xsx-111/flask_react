Make Over Lyrics
OK
This hospitality bracelet
Let's do something crazy

I can't believe what you did to me
Down on my knees and I needa break free
All these years, you violated me
I don't know why I can't feel inside
I try to hide, can't make it alright
It's overkill
Now I'm ready to fight (Ready to fight)

I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over (Make me over)
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Savin' all your bullshit for another day

Feeling confined like I'm bein' force fed
My vision's blurry and I'm lost in regrets
It's overload, and I'm outta control (Outta control)
So sick and tired of bein' so misused (Bein' so misused)
You're taking me down with all your mental abuse
And I said, I gotta get you outta my head
Everybody's always tryna look me over (Look me over)
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Savin' all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

Leaving the house around quarter to five
Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride
And I feel so high (Feel so high), I feel so alive
Let down my hair, feel the wind on my skin (Wind on my skin)
Crossin' the border where my new life begins
And I close my eyes and take it all in (Close my eyes)

I don't need nobody tryna make me over (Make me over)
I just wanna live simple and free
I just wanna get away
Savin' all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me
I just wanna get away
Savin' all your bullshit for another day
I'm the only one who can rescue me from me

You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down
You wanna bring me down1Embed
