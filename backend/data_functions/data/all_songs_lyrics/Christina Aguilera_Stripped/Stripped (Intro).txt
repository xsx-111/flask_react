Stripped (Intro) Lyrics
Paparazzi
That was the clip of all
Limp Bizkit Fred Durst on stage
Scandal, gossip

I did it all for the nookie

Hook up
Slim Shady
I want
Britney
And they had to say something real clear

And they had to kick Christina Aguilera out

The two of them were not fighting
What the *censored* was she talking about
Not at all
And you're forced to look at yourself
Britney
Christina Britney rivalry
We're gonna let Christina tell her side of the story
Waited a long time for this
Feels right now (Uh, uh, ha, ha, ha)
Allow me to introduce myself
Want you to come a little closer
I'd like you to get to know me a little bit better
Meet the real me

(Whoa) Sorry you can't define me
Sorry I break the mold
Sorry that I speak my mind
Sorry don't do what I'm told
Sorry if I don't fake it
Sorry I come too real
I will never hide what I really feel
No way, oh

So here it is
No hype, no glass, no pretense
Just me (Just me)
Stripped (Stripped, stripped)3Embed
