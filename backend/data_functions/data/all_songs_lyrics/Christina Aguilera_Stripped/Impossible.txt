Impossible Lyrics
Play somethin' for me, Alicia
(There you go, Chris)
(What's up?)
I just got somethin' on my mind
(Speak on it, girl)

Oh...
It's impossible
It's impossible to love you
If you don't let me know what you're feeling, yeah, ooh
It's impossible for me to give you what you need, oh yeah
If you're always hiding from me, oh

I don't know what hurts you
I just, I wanna make it right
'Cause boy, I'm sick and tired of trying to read your mind

It's impossible (Impossible)
Ooh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible) for me to love you
It's the way it is
It's impossible (Impossible)
Oh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible)
If you're makin' it this way
Impossible to make it easy
If you always tryin' to make it so damn hard, ooh, yeah
How can I, how can I give you all my love, baby, oh
If you're always, always puttin' up your guard? Oh

This is not a circus
Don't you play me for a clown
How long can emotions keep on going up and down?

It's impossible (Impossible)
Oh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible) for me to love you
It's the way it is
It's impossible (Impossible)
Oh, baby, it's impossible (Impossible)
If you're makin' it this way
Impossible, baby (Impossible, Impossible)
Oh, if you're makin' it this way, this way
Oh baby, it's impossible
If you're makin' it this way

Ohh, yeah
Hey, ooh yeah8Embed
