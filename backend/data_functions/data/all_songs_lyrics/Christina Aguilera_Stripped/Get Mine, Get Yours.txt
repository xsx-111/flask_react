Get Mine, Get Yours Lyrics
Baby, you pretend that things ain't what they seem
All this tension telling just exactly what we should be
Now I don't mind us bein' some kind of casual thing
Listen, all I wanna do for now is have you come and take all of me

Can you put your hands on my waistline?
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind (Slow grind)
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours

If you see me with a man, understand that you can't question me
The feelings that you caught ain't my fault
Can't help your jealousy
If you can handle the fact
That what we have has got to be commitment free (Free)
Then we can keep this undercover lovin' comin'
Hidden underneath the sheets

Can you put your hands on my waistline? (Ooh, on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (We don't fall in love)
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind (Slow grind)
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours
Now listen, so, come on and freak my body
We can get nasty, naughty all night, a private party
Gotta hit that spot just right, work me like a nine to five
It ain't about the kissin' and huggin'
'Cause this is a physical lovin'
Straight sweatin', our bodies are rubbin'
Gotta hit that spot just right, work me like a nine to five

We have a physical thing
We make love, but don't fall in love
(Let me get mine, you get yours)
We spend time, just enough so you get yours, and I get mine
No strings attached
I want your body, not your heart
(Let me get mine, you get yours)

Can you put your hands on my waistline? (hands on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (But don't fall in love)
Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind
Sending chills up and down my spine
Let me get mine, you get yours
Put your hands on my waistline (Put your hands on my waistline)
Want your skin up against mine (Ooh, the waistline)
Move my hips to the baseline
Let me get mine, you get yours (Oh, we don't fall in love)
(Freak my body, baby) Hang a 'please don't disturb' sign
Put my back into a slow grind (Nasty, naughty, babe)
Sending chills up and down my spine (Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let me get mine, you get yours (Oo)
Hmm, come here
Don't be shy, I won't bite
Let me get mine, you get yours4Embed
