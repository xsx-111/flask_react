Infatuation Lyrics
Ooh, ah, hey
Hey
Ooh, ah
Hey

He comes from a foreign place, an island far away
Intrigues me with every move
Till I'm breathless, I'm helpless, can't keep my cool
Steals my heart when he takes my hand
And we dance to the rhythm of the band
I feel his fingertips grip my hips
And I slip as we dip into a state of bliss

Mama used to warn me to beware those Latin lovers
She said, "I gave my heart too soon
And that's how I became your mother"
I said "Ay mama, you seem to forget I'm not in love yet
Sweet talk don't win me over"
But I realize big brown eyes can hypnotize when he says

"I am full blood boricua"
Reads the tattoo on his arm (Oh)
He tells me, "Mami, I need ya"
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (Oh)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers, "Te quiero, te quiero"
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation
Skin the color of cinnamon
His eyes light up and I melt within' (Melt within')
Feels so good, it must be a sin
I can't stop what I started, I'm givin' in (Givin' in)
He brings life to my fantasies
Sparks a passion inside of me (Inside of me)
Finds the words when I cannot speak
In the silence, his heartbeat is music to me

Mama used to warn me not to rush love with another
She said, "I'm not trying to lecture, I just care about my daughter"
"Ay mama, you seem to forget
I never will let a man control my emotions"
But when he smiles (When he smiles)
I feel like a little child when he says

"I am full blood boricua"
Reads the tattoo on his arm (Whoa, oh)
He tells me, "Mami, I need ya"
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (So strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers, "Te quiero, te quiero"
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
It's pure infatuation
Caught between my mama's words and what I feel inside
I'm wanting to explore his world, but part of me wants to hide
Should I risk it? Can't resist it
This has caught me by surprise
Should I let him take me to Puerto Rico?
I can't hold back no more
Let's go tonight
(Woo, hey)

Papi, hold me
Say that you adore me (You adore me)
Never let go
Never leave me lonely (eave me lonely)
Papi, hold me
Say that you adore me (Oh)
Never let go
Never leave me lonely

I am full blood boricua (Boricua)
Reads the tattoo on his arm (On his arm)
He tells me, "Mami, I need ya"
And my heartbeat pumps so strong (So strong)
Getting lost in el ritmo
He whispers, "Te quiero, te quiero" (Oh)
I begin to give in with no hesitation
Can't help my infatuation
(I can't help what I'm feelin', I'm infatuated)
It's pure infatuation (Oh)
Can't help my infatuation (Oh, whoa, oh)
It's pure infatuation
