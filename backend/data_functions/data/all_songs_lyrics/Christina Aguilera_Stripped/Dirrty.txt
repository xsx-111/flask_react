Dirrty Lyrics
Ahh, dirty, dirty, filthy, filthy, nasty
Christina, you nasty (Yeah)
Too dirty to clean my act up (Haha)
If you ain't dirty, you ain't here to party (Woo)
Ladies, move, gentleman, move
Somebody ring the alarm, a fire on the roof
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows (Get up, who ready to party out there?)
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm throwin' elbows (Where my dawgs at?)
Uh, let me loose

Ooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, I'm comin' through
Paid my dues, in the mood
Me and my girls come to shake the room
DJ spinnin' (Show your hands)
Let's get dirty (That's my jam)
I need that, uh, to get me off (Yeah)
Sweatin' 'til my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are thumpin'
Still jumpin', six in the mornin'
Table dancin', glasses are crashin'
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up (Can you feel it?), 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise
Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat drippin' over my body
Dancin', getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas, drop your cups
Bodies packed front to back
Move your ass, I like that
Tight hip-huggers (Low for sure)
Shake a little somethin' (On the floor)
I need that, uh, to get me off
Sweatin' 'til my clothes come off
Let's get open, cause a commotion
Still goin', eight in the mornin'
There's no stoppin', we keep it poppin'
Hard rockin', everyone's talkin'
Give all you got (Give it to me), just hit the spot
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise
Rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival

Here it comes, it's the one you been waitin' on
Get up, get it rough, yup, that's what's up
Givin' just what you love to the maximum
Uh-oh (Uh-oh), here we go (Here we go)
What to do when the music starts to drop
That's when we take it to the parking lot
And I bet you somebody's gonna call the cops
Uh-oh (Uh-oh), here we go (Here we go)
Woah, yeah, yeah

Yo, hot damn, Doc a jam like a summer show
I keep my car looking like a crash dummy drove
My gear look like the bank got my money froze
For dead presidents, I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas (Ow)
F the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo, Christina (What?), better hop in here
My block live and in color like Rodman hair (Yeah)
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a wrap, no bargain deals
I drive a four-wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up, baby, it's Brick City, you heard of that
We blessed, and hung low like Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac?)
Dogs, let 'em out, women, let 'em in
It's like I'm ODB the way I'm freakin'
Gonna get rowdy (Rowdy)
Gonna get a little unruly (Unruly)
Get it fired up in a hurry (Hurry)
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party (Party)
Sweat drippin' over my body (Body)
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival
Rowdy, gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Ooh, sweat drippin' over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirty, it's about time for my arrival
Gonna get rowdy
Bound to get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Let's get dirty
It's about time that I came to start the party (Oh, baby)
Sweat drippin' over my body
Wanna get a little bit naughty
Wanna get dirty
It's about time for my arrival

Uh, what?
