Bluebird Wine Lyrics
Baby brought me in out off the highway
Made me put my money in the bank
Straightened out my crooked way of thinking
Made it purely pleasure when I drank

And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Now baby taught me a different way of thinking
Like how to spend my evenings here at home
Listening to the music on the radio
Drinking all the Bluebird we can hold

And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine

Well baby says he'd really love a party
We'll get some friends together feeling fine
Any friend of mine is worth his habit, yeah
A belly full of baby's Bluebird Wine
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
The party just started
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird Wine
And it's all right
I've just hit my stride
Right off the bat
Lord, I'm drunk on Bluebird WineEmbed
