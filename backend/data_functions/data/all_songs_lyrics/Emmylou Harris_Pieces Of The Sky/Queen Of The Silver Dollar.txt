Queen Of The Silver Dollar Lyrics
She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the queen of the Silver Dollar's home again

She's the queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules a smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home

Now her royal dress is satin
It's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down
And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen

She's the queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules a smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her trying to win her favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Now the queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl

Yes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule a smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar home
Yes I'm the queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule a smokey kingdom
My scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around my trying to win my favors
To see which one will take the queen of the Silver Dollar homeEmbed
