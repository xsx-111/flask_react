Before Believing Lyrics
Winter, summer season is taking over
It's quiet like new fallen snow
I told you summer stories
But outside it's getting mighty cold
I told you everything I could about me
Told you everything I could

How would you feel if the world
Was falling apart around you
Pieces of the sky were falling
In your neighbor's yard but not on you
Wouldn't you feel just a little bit funny
Think maybe there's something you ought to do


Solutions that never lay down before you
The answers are all around
Believing is all the friends you need to talk to
And I'm believing in you
I told you everything I could about me
I told you everything I could
I told you everything I could about me
I told you everything I couldEmbed
