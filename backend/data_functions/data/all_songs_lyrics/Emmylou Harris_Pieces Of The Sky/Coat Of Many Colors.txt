Coat Of Many Colors Lyrics
Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my mamma put these rags to use

There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat, it was way down in the fall
Mamma sewed the rags together, sewing ever piece with love
She made my coat of many colors I was so proud of

As she sewed she told the story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you much love and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it as mamma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors that my mamma made for me
Made from only rags, but I wore it so proudly
Though we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mamma made for me

So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors well I started off to school
Just to find the children laughing and makin' fun of me
In my coat of many colors my mamma made for me
Now I didn't understand it for I felt that I was rich
And I told them of the love my mamma sewed in every stitch
And all the story mamma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors is worth more than all of their clothes

They didn't under stand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be
And though we didn't have much money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mamma made for me
In my coat of many colors my mamma just made for meEmbed
