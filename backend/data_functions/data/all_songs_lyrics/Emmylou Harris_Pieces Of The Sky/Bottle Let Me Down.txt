Bottle Let Me Down Lyrics
Tonight the bottle let down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately I've been turning everyday
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
And I'm hurting in an old familiar way

Tonight the bottle let down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let down

Each night I leave the barroom when its over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight your memory found me much too sober
Can't drink enough to keep you off my mind

Tonight the bottle let down
And let your memory come around
The one true friend I thought I'd found
Tonight the bottle let downEmbed
