Sleepless Nights Lyrics
Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two

Somehow through the days I don't give in
I hide the tears that wait till then
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart again


Why did you go? Why did you go?
Don't you know, don't you know
I need you?

Through the sleepless nights I cry for you
And wonder who is kissing you
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two

Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in two
Oh, these sleepless nights will break my heart in twoEmbed
