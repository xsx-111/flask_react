Hank and Lefty Lyrics
Daddy had a 1949 Ford
When I was just about ten years old
We would listen to Hank and Lefty on the radio
"Why Don't You Love Me (Like You Used to Do)"
And "Just Look What Thoughts Will Do"
Ole Hank and Lefty raised my country soul

Now I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listen to Hank sing the "Lovesick Blues"
We never met ole Hank but we was awful close
Cut my teeth on "Always Late"
And "I Love You a Thousand Ways"
Ole Hank and Lefty raised my country soul


Daddy said the hair on his neck would crawl
When ole Hank sang about the light he saw
Hank sure put a whole lot of heart in the songs he wrote
Every time daddy got a little bit tight
"Mom and Dad's Waltz" would make him cry
Ole Hank and Lefty raised my country soul
Now I learned how to sing and shuffle my shoes
Listenin' to Hank sing the "Lovesick Blues"
We never met ole Hank but we was awful close
Cut my teeth on "Always Late"
And "I Love You a Thousand Ways"
Ole Hank and Lefty raised my country soul
Ole Hank and Lefty raised my country soulEmbed
