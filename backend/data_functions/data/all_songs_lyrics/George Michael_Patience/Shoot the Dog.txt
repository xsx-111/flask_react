Shoot the Dog LyricsGTI, Hot Shot
He parks it there, just to piss me off
Bullyboy, gonna show ya who's tough
I'm gonna shoot the dog, I'm gonna shoot the dog
It's party time, everyday
I spent Saturday night on Novocaine
Called the pigs, but nobody came
I'm gonna shoot the dog, I'm gonna shoot the dog... (come on ladies)
Nine nine nine gettin' jiggy
People did you see that fire in the city?
It's like we're fresh out of democratic
Gotta get yourself a little something semi-automatic yeah
That's why I'm always gettin' stoned yeah
That's why I'm out there havin' fun again
Good puppy, good puppy
Rolling on over
Mustapha
Mazel Tov
The Gaza Boys
All that holy stuff
I got the feelin' when it all goes off
They're gonna shot the dog
They're gonna shoot the dog
So, Cherie my dear
Could you leave the way clear for sex tonight?
Tell him
"Tony Tony Tony, I know that you are horny, but there's
Somethin' bout that Bush ain't right"
Nine nine nine gettin' jiggy
People did you see that fire in the city?
It's like we're fresh out of democratic
Gotta get yourself a little something semi-automatic yeah...
That's why I'm always gettin' stoned yeah
That's why I'm out there havin' fun again
Good puppy, good puppy
Rolling on over for The Man...
The Ayatollah's gettin' bombed yeah
See Sergeant Bilko having fun again
Good puppy, good puppy
Rollin' on over for The Man...
I believe, I believe what the old man said
Though I know that there's no lord above
I believe in me, I believe in you
And you know I believe in love
I believe in truth though I lie a lot
I feel the pain from the push and shove
No matter what you put me through
I'll still believe in love
And I say
Cherie baby, spliff up
I wanna kick back mama
And watch the World Cup with ya baby
Yeah, that's right!
We're getting freaky tonight
Stay with me tonight
Let's have some fun while Tony's stateside
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
See Tony dancing with Dubya
Don't you wanna know why?1Embed
