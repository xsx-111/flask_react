Flawless (Go To The City) Lyrics'Cause you’re beautiful (perfection)
(Like no other)
(Flawless, absolutely flawless)
‘Cause you’re beautiful
(Perfection)
Take me, make me
(Flawless, absolutely flawless)
'Cause you're beautiful (perfection)
Maybe tonight
They’ll see you tonight
(Flawless, absolutely flawless)
(Cause you're beautiful)
Beautiful, beautiful (perfection)
(Flawless, absolutely flawless)
And it’s no good waiting by the window
It’s no good waiting for the sun
Please believe me
The things you dream of
They don’t fall in the laps of no one
And it’s no good (And it's no good)
Waiting, waiting
And it’s no good (And it's no good)
Waiting
You got to go to the city
Always the same
Always the same dreams, yeah yeah
Always the same (yes you’re movin’ up)
Well you’ve got to think of something
‘Cause your job pays you nothing
But you’ve got the things God gave ya
So the music may yet be your saviour
Got to be a way, some way
Got to be some way to make your way to the light (all the girls say)
Got to be some way, today, today, maybe tonight, maybe tonight
And it’s always the same
Always the same
Always the same dreams, yeah yeah
Always the same (yes you’re movin’ up)
You’re beautiful, you are
And you know it
You’re wasted here
You’re a star
In this small town of hand-me-downs who don’t even know it
Sometimes it brings you down
Sometimes it eats you up
Sometimes you think that your head’s going to blow
It doesn’t, it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't get better
Don’t you know
You got to go to the city (you got to go to the city)
You’ve got to reach the other side of the glass
I think you’ll make it in the city baby
I think you know that you're more than just
Some fucked up piece of ass
Got to be a way, some way
Got to be some way to make your way to the light (all the boys say)
Got to be some way, today, today, maybe tonight
They’ll see you tonight
It’s always the same
Always the same (movin' up)
Always the same dreams, yeah yeah
Always the same (yes you’re movin’ up)
‘Cause you’re beautiful
(like no other)
‘Cause you’re beautiful
(take me, make me)
‘Cause you’re beautiful
(maybe tonight, they’ll see you tonight)
Beautiful…beautiful
And it’s no good waiting by the window
It’s no good waiting for the sun
Please believe me
The things you dream of
They don’t fall in the laps of no one
And it’s no good (and it's no good)… waiting, waiting
And it’s no good (and it's no good)… waiting
You’ve got to go to the city
You’ve got to go to the city
Yeah, they’re going to find you there
‘Cause you’re beautiful
‘Cause you’re beautiful
Sometimes it brings you down
Sometimes it eats you up
Sometimes you think that your head’s going to blow
It doesn’t get better…
Don’t you know, you’ve got to go to the city
(Got to go to the city)
You’ve got to reach the other side of the glass
I think you’ll make it in the city baby
I think you know that you're more than just
A fucked up piece of ass
Always the same
(More than just)
(Movin up)
Always the same dreams, yeah yeah (movin' up)
(Movin' up)
More than just…
Sid you’ve got to think of something
‘Cause your job pays you nothing
But you’ve got the things God gave ya
So the music may yet be your saviour
Do you want a saviour, saviour
Say, say that you do (yeah)
You know you’re wasted here, wasted here
And there ain’t no miracles happening any time soonEmbed
