Last Train To Trancentral (LP Mix) LyricsAll aboard, all aboard, a-woah-ho
All aboard, all aboard, a-woah-ho
Others need the vibes
Last train of the fast train, destination general
Thoughts that seem to draw me
Heading for Trancentral
Still i'm seeking something
And some things I am seeking
In the carriage on the fast train
Of the last train to trancenteal
We've been waiting for years
And now it's here
Last train to Trancentral
Take the last train
From Sample City, on the downtown line
Last train to Trancentral
Last train
Others need the vibes
A brand new day is dawning
A light that will annoint thee
A sign from the subconcious
An angel sent to guide me
The searching will be over
The call will now be gentle
In the carriage on the fast train
Of the last train to Trancentral
The KLF will take you there
Last train to Trancentral (it's the last train)
The Liberation Loophole will make it clear...
On last train to Trancentral (last train)
This is what KLF is about
Also known as the Justified Ancients of Mu Mu
Furthermore known as the JAMS
One time!
Take the last train
Last train
All aboard, all aboard, a-woah-ho
All aboard, all aboard, a-woah-ho
Others need the vibes
Whoooo
Others need the vibes
Whoooo
Others need the vibes
Last train or the fast train
My destination's general
The thoughts that seem to draw me
Headin' downtown for Trancentral
Still I'm seeking something
And there's something that I'm seeking
In a carriage on the fast train
Of the last train to Trancentral
The KLF will take you there
Last train to Trancentral (take the last train)
The Liberation Loophole will make it clear
On last train to Trancentral (last train)
(Take the last train) <<>>
(All aboard, all aboard, a-woah-ho) <<>>
Yeah, there's only one place I'm living, man...
I'm going into Trancentral where I can
You understand, liberate and free the psyche
You know, banish my mind and my body
'Cause this way I don't know whether I'm in the future or the present...
Is this the beginning or the ending?
Although I know that things are incidental
The landscape may have to be accidental
I'm still in a carriage
On the fast train,of the last train, to Trancentral
Over an OutEmbed
