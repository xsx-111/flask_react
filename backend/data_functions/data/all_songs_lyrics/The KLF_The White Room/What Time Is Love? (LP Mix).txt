What Time Is Love? (LP Mix) LyricsUmmm-hmmm-hm
Who-nanananana
Hmmmmm mmmm
Ummm-hmmm-hm-yeah
Ummm-hmmm-hm-yeah
Ummm-hmmmmmm
They're justified and they're ancient
And they like to roam the land
They're justified and they're ancient
I hope you understand
They don't want to upset the apple cart
And they don't want to cause any harm
But if you don't like what they're going to do
You better not stop them cause they're coming through
Mu mu, mu mu, mu mu, mu mu
Kick out the JAMS
The lyrics'll flow, yo -- for the words I speak
Rap is weak so I teach and I reach
A positive vibe, a way of life is how I'm livin'
So get hype to the rhythm
KLF is the crew, ya hear -- yeah
Design a rhyme I just won't fear
Back to react, enough is enough
Let me ask you a question -- What time is love?
What time is love?
What time is love?
What time is love?
Mu mu, mu mu, mu mu, mu mu
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
Okay Houston, we'll give you a countdown
Four, three, two, one, fire
I wanna see you
The final chapter, prophetic, poetic
When I'm done, this calls for anesthetic
Get to, step to, let an MC
Come in effect with Kingboy D
A wannabe, gonnabe, ol'time sucker
You know the time, I never stutter
A feat, a dream, a-yeah seem bright
Yeah, pass the mic -- What time is love?
What time is love
What time is love
What time is love
What time is love
Mu mu, mu mu, mu mu, mu mu, mu mu, mu mu
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you
I wanna see you
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
I wanna see you sweat
Thank you, thank youEmbed
