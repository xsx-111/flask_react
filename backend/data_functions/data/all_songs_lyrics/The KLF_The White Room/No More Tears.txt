No More Tears LyricsWoo
Ooh, yeah
Ooh
Sunlight on a winter's day
They are driving, driving all the way
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
On and on and on and on we roll
Woo
Ooh, yeah
Ooh
Sunlight on a winter's day
The muumuu is here to stay
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
No more tears as we roll through the years
On and on and on and on we roll
Woo
Ooh, yeah
Ooh
Sunlight on a winter's day
The white room is where they playEmbed
