The White Room LyricsTalk to me, talk to me
If you want to know the things we see
Then step inside our skins
The White Room, the White Room
We spin, we turn, watch and wait
As the world just creeps on by
The White Room, the White Room
Talk to me, talk to me
Far below, a small boat sails
Catching fish from the sea
The White Room, the White Room
We climb the mountain, feel the wind
We climbed to touch the stars
The White Room, the White Room
The White Room, the White Room
More spetta na noo ne na noo things
The White Room, the White Room
The White Room, the White Room
(More spetta na noo ne na noo things)
The White Room, the White RoomEmbed
