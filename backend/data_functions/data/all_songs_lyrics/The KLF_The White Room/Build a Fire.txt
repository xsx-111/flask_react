Build a Fire Lyrics
Pulled up to rest, let the engine cool awhile
Open the beans, gather wood for the fire
I hum this tune to all the girls I've known
Should I care about the chances I've blown?

Build a fire
They're gonna build a fire

Build a fire
They're gonna build a fire
They're gonna build a fire
They're gonna build a fire

When daylight breaks, I'll be down that road
Rockman and me with a lighter load
We'll stop for lunch in some taco bar
Lee Marvin on the jukebox, "Wand'rin' Star"

Build a fire
They're gonna build a fire
Build a fire
They're gonna build a fireEmbed
