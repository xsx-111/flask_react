Try to Change Lyrics
Try to change, I try to change
I make a list of all the ways to change my ways
But I stay the same, I stay the same, oh
I will try and try to change, but I just stay the same

Stay the same, I stay the same
In a decadent age, I try to change
All my decadent ways, but I just can't help but
Stay the same in a decadent age, oh
I will try and try to change, but I just stay the same

The same, the same
The same, the same

Carry a cane, I carry a cane
'Cause I tried to change, and I tried too hard
So I hurt my leg and, well, overall
I just stayed the same, now I carry a cane, oh
I will try and try to change
But the list I made of change to make

It blew away, flew away
Blew away, flew away
Try to change, try to change (Blew away)
I try to change, try to change (Flew away)
Everybody be tryin' to change (Blew away)
I try to change, I try
It's safe to say, some don't change
