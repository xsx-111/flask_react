Saturday Night Forever Lyrics
I don't care what these commentators say
I swear I don't care for what difference do they make?
I go where I go and I get there fast
Don't stop me, I know that it's not gonna last

Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)

If you see someone gorgeous then you think
Am I in with a chance? Should I try buy a drink?
Or maybe it's too much like hard work tonight
But if they look my way I might be alright

Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
I go where I go and I get there fast
Don't stop me, I know that it's not gonna last

Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)


Forever, forever
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
(Saturday night, Saturday night)
Forever, forever
Forever, forever...Embed
