Up Against It Lyrics
News in this city
Breaks without pity
Long after the war has ended
We're still in fatigues

Up against it
The higher you fly the further you fall
Up against it
Wondering why we fought after all

Such a cold winter
With scenes as slow as Pinter
Synchronise your watches
There's still time to kill

Up against it
Drinking this swill to sweeten the pill
Up against it
The more that it hurts the less that it works

Wrapped up in nostalgia to queue for a show
Back to Trafalgar, one kiss then I'll go
So deep in quicklime
The bones of an old crime
I knew a man who raked them over
He's still suffering

Up against it
Buried so deep it gives me the creeps
Up against it (Come up against it now)
The longer you hate the more that it grates
Up against it (Come up against it now)
Look left then right and run for your life

(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
(Come up against it now)
(Really come up against it, ooh)
Up against it
The more that it hurts the less that it worksEmbed
