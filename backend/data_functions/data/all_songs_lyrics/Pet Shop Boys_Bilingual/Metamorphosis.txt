Metamorphosis Lyrics
Metamorphosis

Metamorphosis

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know

Please allow me to try and explain
I'm living proof that man can change
I knew what I wanted, I knew how to get it
It didn't make it happy so I started again
What I wanted to be was a family man
But nature had some alternative plans
So I did without the lot put emotion on hold
And hoped my instincts would do what they were told

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know

But every now and then and often at night
A particular feeling would surface in spite
Of what I told myself and tried to deny
I kept on asking the question: why?
Why, why, why?
I wanna know

You grow up and experience this
A total metamorphosis
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

With time and age, I had to change
'Cause my behaviour was getting strange
People on the street caught my eye
And I began to think I might be their kind of guy
The long-term suppression of an adolescent urge
Was in retreat and I was on the verge
Of falling in love or having fun
Time was running out, something had to be done

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know
I wanna know, yeah
Tell me, what's the reason?

Where was I? Laying down the law
Dancing with the others out on the floor
Music and smoke, what did it mean?
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I had what I wanted, madly in love
Nothing else mattered this was enough
Questions were answered which used to perplex
In particular those about the big S-E-X
I wanna know, yeah (Sex)
I wanna know (Sex)
I wanna know, yeah
Tell me what's the reason (Sex)
Tell me what's the reason

You grow up and experience this
A total metamorphosis
It's all about love
It's a metamorphosis

Dreaming is easy, life is tough, I got the picture
The most important thing is not to end up bitter
'Cause when you start to feel increasingly forlorner
Woomph! Love comes right around the corner
It may not last, but here am I
Once a caterpillar now a butterfly
It can seem strange, but when you reminisce
It's all about change, it's a metamorphosis

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know
It's all about love
It's a metamorphosis
You grow up and experience this
A total metamorphosis
It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know
I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know

It's all about change
It's a metamorphosis

I wanna know, yeah
I wanna know

It's all about love
It's a metamorphosis

Metamorphosis
