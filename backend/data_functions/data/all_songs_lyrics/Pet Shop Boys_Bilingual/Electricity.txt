Electricity Lyrics
"What does it mean?"
"What are you doing in San Francisco?"
"Get out of here and take this cake with you"
"What does it mean?"
"What are you doing in San Francisco?"

I'm an artist, honey, you'll see me sometimes
Making crazy pictures out of music and rhymes
Costume changes performed with poise
Dancing in formation with a couple of boys
I take them on the road with my reel-to-reels
I'm an artist, honey, you know how that feels?

It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
"What does it mean?"
It's all about wonder, the power to be
Like thunder expressing electricity
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes

Call it performance, call it art
I call it disaster if the tapes don't start
I've put all my life into live lip-sync
I'm an artist, honey, you gonna get me a drink?

It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
It's all about wonder, the power to be
Like thunder expressing electricity
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
"What does it mean?"
Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes

It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes
It's the greatest show with the best effects
Since Disco-Tex and the Sex-O-LettesEmbed
