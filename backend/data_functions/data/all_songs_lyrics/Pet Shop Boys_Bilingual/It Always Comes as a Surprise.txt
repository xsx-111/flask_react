It Always Comes as a Surprise Lyrics
I can't be cool or nonchalant
Call me an impulsive fool, you're all I want
You may be right, it's too much too soon
To talk of love all night in your bedroom

I don't know why it always comes as a surprise
To find I'm here with you
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true

I won't play games or waste your time
But I won't feel ashamed to speak my mind
So just relax, don't question why
For calculated facts will not apply

I don't know why it always comes as a surprise
To find I'm here with you
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true

In my life there've been few
Who've affected me the way you do, you do
I'll tell no lies
I won't pretend
But if you've a broken heart
I'll help it mend

I don't know why it always comes as a surprise
To find I'm here with you
You smile and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come true

Smile and I am rubbing my eyes
At a dream come trueEmbed
