The Survivors Lyrics
Cross a windy bridge
One winter night
Past Embankment Gardens
Enter warmth and light

Face the music (It's never easy)
Forget the chill
Face the future (It's never easy)
Find the will

If life is worth living, it's got to be done
One might be forgiven for thinking it's a life on the run
Many roads will cross through many lives
But somehow you survive

Look around
Picture what's in store
Is this the final edit
Or is the subject now a bore?

Don't shrug your shoulders (It's always easy)
You can't ignore
That life is worth living, it's still worth a damn
One might be forgiven for thinking it's something of a sham
Many words may make it sound contrived
But somehow we're alive

The survivors, our heads bowed
The survivors, at memorials for other faces in the crowd

Teachers and artists (It's never easy)
And Saturday girls
In suits or sequins (It's never easy)
Or twinsets-and-pearls

If life is worth living, it's got to be run
(Life is worth living, it's got to be run)
As a means of giving, not as a race to be won
(Means of giving, race to be won)
Many roads will run through many lives
But somehow we'll arrive
Many roads will run through many lives
But somewhere we'll surviveEmbed
