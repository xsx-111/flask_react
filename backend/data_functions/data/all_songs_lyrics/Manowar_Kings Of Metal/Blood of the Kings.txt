Blood of the Kings LyricsBrothers, the battle is raging
Choose your side
Sing with us the battle hymns
Into glory ride
Hail to England
The sign of the hammer's our guide
Forever we're fighting the world
Side by side
On a crusade, the world we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France will not fail
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy
Switzerland, Austria
Back to the glory of Germany
On a crusade, the world we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Sound the death tone
On our march for revenge
Spill the blood of my enemies
The oath of a friend
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring
Six magic circles made
By the blood of the kings
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Sound the death tone
On our march for revenge
Spill the blood of my enemies
The oath of a friend
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring
Six magic circles were made
By the blood of the kings
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring
Four kings of metal
Four metal kings
Death to the false ones, dance on a string
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your hand is
The blood of a king
Till the blood on your sword is
The blood of a king
Blood of a king, blood of a king
Blood of a king1Embed
