Kingdom Come LyricsSee the white light, the light within
Be your own disciple
Fan the sparks of will
For all of us waiting
Our kingdom will come
Now, rays of power shining
Rays of magic fall
On the golden voice
That speaks within us all
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come
Now, feel the white light, the light within
Yeah, it burns a fire
Drives a man to win
For all of us waiting
Your kingdom will come
Kingdom come
Words of power calling to us all
Holding us together
While other kingdoms fall
No longer waiting
Our kingdom has come
Kingdom come
Kingdom coming
Another kingdom falls
The rightful are waiting
But all are not rightful
Wait and receive the weight of the fall
Kingdom come, kingdom come
Kingdom come, kingdom come
Kingdom come1Embed
