Wheels of Fire LyricsSince the dawn of time
I've rolled across the earth
Spinning in the dust
Long before your birth
Eating tar and gasoline
Every light I see is green
Open pipes
My machine's triple-plated chrome
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Motors running
Now, you're gonna learn
Waiting on the line
Make your tires burn
Fast, fast, fast, fast
Speeding always kills
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Blood and thunder on the road
My heart is pounding
My blood's nitroglycerin, I'm fire
Burning, burning, burning, burning
Ready to explode
Don't want nothing left of me
To scrape off the road
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Clouds of smoke, tires screaming
Fire in my hair
Blown into a thousand pieces
Scattered everywhere
Fast, burn, burning, faster
Wanna take a ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire ride
Spirit of the wheel
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride
Wheels of fire burn the night
Ride across the sky
Wheels of fire burning bright
We live to ride1Embed
