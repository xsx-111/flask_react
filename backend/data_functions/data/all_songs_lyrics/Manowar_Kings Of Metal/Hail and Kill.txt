Hail and Kill LyricsBrothers, I am calling
From the valley of the kings
With nothing to atone
A dark march lies ahead
Together we will ride like thunder from the sky
May your sword stay wet
Like a young girl in her prime
Hold your hammers high
Blood and death are waiting
Like a raven in the sky
I was born to die
Hear me while I live
Now as I look into your eyes
None shall hear a lie
Now, power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
My father was a wolf
I'm the kinsman of the slain
Sworn to rise again
Now I will bring salvation
Punishment and pain
The hammer of hate is our faith
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill
Rip their flesh, burn their hearts
Stab them in the eyes
Rape their women as they cry
Kill their servants, burn their homes
Kill till there's no blood left to spill
Hail and kill
Power and dominion are taken by the will
By divine right, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail, hail, hail and kill, hail and kill
Hail and kill2Embed
