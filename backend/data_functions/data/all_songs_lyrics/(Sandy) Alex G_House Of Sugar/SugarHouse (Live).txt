SugarHouse (Live) Lyrics
Baby, I've been a good boy
But sometimes I can't keep it straight
Feels like I'm always waiting
For another chance to play the game

Gotta roll the dice now
You gotta gimme a kiss for luck
I wanna be there with you somehow
But the SugarHouse calling my bluff

You never really met me
I don't think anyone has
But we could still be players together
Let SugarHouse pick up the tab

I won't be forgotten
Let 'em bury me in the sand
When our children go digging for answers
I hope they can put me together again
