Gretel Lyrics
I don't wanna go back
Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh huh
I don't wanna go back
Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh huh

It’s calling me back
House of Sugar
Did they bury me here?
Daddy, don’t let 'em put me down
Daddy, don’t let 'em turn me around

I don’t wanna go back
Nobody’s gonna push me off track, uh huh
I see what they do
Good people got something to lose, uh huh
I don’t wanna go back
Nobody’s gonna push me off track, uh huh
I don’t wanna be this
Good people gotta fight to exist, uh huh

I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I can see it right there right in front of me
I don't wanna go back
Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh huh
I don't wanna go back
Nobody's gonna push me off track, uh huh
I don't wanna go back2Embed
