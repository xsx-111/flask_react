Near Lyrics
All I want (Is to be near)
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
(Flower, water, earth, soul)
(Flower, water, earth, fire)

All I want is to be near
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
(Flower, water, earth, soul)
(Flower, water, earth, fire)
All I want is to be near
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

(Four, five, six, seven)
I saw the light (No looking; No touching)
I'm not alright (Black feather; No touching)
I'll be alright (No touching)
I hope I'm alright (No fucking)

All I want is to be near
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you

(Four, five, six, seven)
I see the wolf
Let me go (No touching)
Leave me without you
Cut it off (No touching)
I wonder
Why you always (No touching)
Looked away (No running)2Embed
