Crime Lyrics
Lena
It's my only plan
(It's my only plan)
Eating from the palm of your hands
Lifts me from my knees
I am born to please
Lena
Let your hero shine
(Let your hero shine)
You will be my alibi
Wait until the dawn
When they look
I'm gone

They killed him for the crime
But I know they're mistaken
It was me the whole time


What you do, I do
(I do too, I do)
I will go right back to you
You know what I want
We can have so much fun
Again
I waste up all my time
I'm leaving you tomorrow
Let me kill my mind

Careful what you do
Or I'm leaving without you
Careful what you do
Or I'm leaving without youEmbed
