In My Arms Lyrics
I take it in, I do without
I never care what we talk about
Pull up the car outside the house
Took out the seats so we could lie down

You know who was in my arms
You know who was in my arms

He laid his head back on my chest
Once had a wife, now nobody's left
You said the song makes you wanna do bad things, yeah
You know good music makes me wanna do bad things

You know who was in my arms
