Hope Lyrics
He was a good friend of mine
He died
Why I write about it now?
Gotta honor him somehow
Saw some people crying that night
Yeah, Fentanyl took a few lives from our life
Alright

I awoke in the middle of the night
He spoke
With his eyes half closed
Can you get me something else to eat?
Got a hole in my chest
I can't take it anymore
Put my pillow to the test
Let me rest


In the house they were calling out his name
All night
Taking turns on the bed
Throwing bottles from the windows of the home
On Hope Street
You can write a check in my name now
Eddie take the money and run4Embed
