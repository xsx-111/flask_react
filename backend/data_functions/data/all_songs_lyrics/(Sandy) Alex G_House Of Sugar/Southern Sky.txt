Southern Sky Lyrics
One, two, three
I count black sheep on my way to sleep
I can’t pick and choose these devils in my
Patterned dreams
When I wake up I am smiling
Now I will not change my mind
I will remember the trouble in my
Brother’s eye

It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky
It’s okay we don’t cry, we love the southern sky

You and me
These are titles I can hardly speak
Are we bound here to an echo tinted
Blue and green?
Let my memory run backwards
So together we may lie
I will remember the fire
In the southern sky
