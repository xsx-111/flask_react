Bad Man Lyrics
I'm a bad man, how about that? (So bad)
Going hungry on a pillar of fat (Of fat)
If I had a way, I would take it back (Take it back)
If you let me stay, I would be so glad (So)

What river runs deeper than this?
Stamping on cigarettes, opening fists
What river runs deeper than this?
Biting off fingernails, breaking our wrists
Breaking our wrists


When the bomb dropped, I was 22
Buried under black dirt, how about you?
When the bomb dropped, I was 25
Lying in the grass under tangerine sky
Tangerine skyEmbed
