Taking Lyrics
I don't want pieces of beauty
I flare my eyes to the world
Watching the buckets of lovers
Coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming
And coming

Thatâ€™s how she found me this morning
Bundled my head in her arms
Lifted my spoonful of sugar
Taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And taking
And takingEmbed
