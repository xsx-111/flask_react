Cow Lyrics
I see the red sky
Beyond our state line
Over mama's minivan
Rushing to work on time
I see the red sky
You always ask me why
I find myself on corners
Every once in awhile

You big old cow
You draw me out
Lie on the ground
Kiss on the mouth

I dream a deep sea
That it should swallow me
And pitch me up on some wave
Put me down tenderly
Yes, I believe I made out fine
And yes, it's true
I never loved nobody
The way that I love you
You big old cow
You draw me out
Lie on the ground
Kiss on the mouth


You big old cow
You draw me out
Don't put me down
Don't put me down2Embed
