Walk Away Lyrics
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you
Not today, not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you (I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday, someday I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Today I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you
Not today
Not today, not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today
Someday, someday I'm gonna walk away from you (I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday
I'm gonna walk away from you (I don't want, I don't want, I don't want to)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today, not today
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Someday I'm gonna walk away from you (Don't let me lose, don't let me lose)
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
Not today, not today
