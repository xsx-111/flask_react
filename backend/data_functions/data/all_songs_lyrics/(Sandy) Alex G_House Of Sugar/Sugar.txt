Sugar Lyrics
You will be a bird
All of my life
Whirling in the air
Speck in the sky

Early in the day
Late in the night
Birds are in my head
Birds are in my eyes
Early in the day
Late in the night

You will be a bird
All of my life
Whirling in the air
Speck in the sky

Put me in the air
I wanna be with you
Put me in the air
I wanna be with youEmbed
