(I Saw You) Shine LyricsTurn away, turn away from the wall
Turn away, turn away from the wall
Face me now, face me now
Show me, show me all your tears
Your pain, your pain makes me burn
Its my shame, its my shame we both hurt
We both hurt
I've got to strip this flesh from my bone
I've got to hammer the walls with my hands
With my hands
I saw you, I saw you shine
I was holding you, I watched your face
I saw your face as you heard my words, my
My words
You left me, you left me to hold yourself
I've got to strip this flesh from my bone
I've got to hammer the walls with my hands
With my hands
The lights have all gone out
The lights have all gone out
The lights have all gone out
The lights have all gone out
I saw you
I saw you shine
I saw you
I saw you shine
I saw you shine1Embed
