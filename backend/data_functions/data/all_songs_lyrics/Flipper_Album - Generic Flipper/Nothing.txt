Nothing LyricsOk 1, wait everybody start at the same time, ready? 1,2,3,4
Nothing (x4)
You don't care so you say cus its
Nothing (x4)
Not to believe is what you believe and its
Nothing (x4)
Its all a dream in the daylight and its
Nothing (x4)
And at night its a nightmare
Nothing (x4)
Think too much and you'll go to jail cus its
Nothing (x4)
Stupid police won't let you pay any bail and its
Nothing (x4)
Sitting around and you're wasting my time and its
Nothing (x4)
Once you were a good friend of mine
Let me out of here
You gotta let me out of hereEmbed
