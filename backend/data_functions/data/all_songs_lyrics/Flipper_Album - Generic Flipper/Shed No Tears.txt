Shed No Tears LyricsShed no tears for the martyr dying
Only in pain, suffering and death
Can the martyr become what he's chosen to be

No tears wasted
No sorrow, no pity
No, no crying, no loss
Shed no tears for the cop bleeding
He once held the gun, he once held the keys
Now his prisoners will sing and dance and play

Shed no tears for the nun beaten
By the children she once called her flock
How they hate their teachers who force the darkness upon us

Shed no tears for the suicide
He has made his choice, the pain of life is great
And some will find it sweet to rot beneath the earth
As we rot and live and breathe
