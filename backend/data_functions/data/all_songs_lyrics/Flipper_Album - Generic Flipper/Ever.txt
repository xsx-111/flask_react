Ever Lyrics
Ever live a life that's real
Full of zest but no appeal?
Ever had to really cry
Cry so much you want to die?
Ever feel like you've been had
Had so much that you turn mad?
Ever been so depressed
That those who turn to you bring distress?

Ever sit in tormenting silence that
Turns so loud you start to scream?
Ever take control of a dream
And play all the parts, and set all the scenes?
Ever do nothing and gain nothing from it?
Ever feel stupid and then know you really are?

Ever think you're smart
And find out that you aren't?
Ever play the fool
And find out that you're worse?
Ever look at a flower and hate it?
Ever see a couple kissing and get sickened by it?
Ever wish the human race didn't exist
Then realize you're one too?
Well?
Have you?
Ever?
I have
So what?1Embed
