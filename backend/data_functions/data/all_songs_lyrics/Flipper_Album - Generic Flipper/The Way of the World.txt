The Way of the World LyricsThere are eyes that cannot see
And fingers that cannot touch
That's the way of the world
There are dreams left empty and blank
And legs that have ceased to walk
That's the way of the world
There are kisses left undelivered
And sighs and moans unuttered
That's the way of the world
There are hearts no longer beating
And there's entrails still on the floor
That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world
That's the way of the world
