Life is Cheap LyricsFeeling so numb and I'm feeling so dead
It just felt like someone hit my head
Like someone knew just what to do
Poison the masses and catch the running few
Feeling so empty and I feel so old
Just waiting to feel the death-like cold
Eating away at my life ties
Not really knowing, and not caring why
Life is pretty cheap - it's sold a decade at a time
Life is pretty cheap - it's so easy to find
Life is pretty cheap - there's really nothing new
Life is pretty cheap - except for the cold delirious few
Dying too young, and I'm living too fast
It's starting to feel like I'm living in the past
The pain is strong more than one can bear
Why is there religion? It's just not fair
People cling to things to make their lives seem real
Crawling like bugs at some fool leader's heels
Boasting of freedom when they're tied down with chains
It's time to give it up, here comes the death rain
Life is pretty cheap - it's sold a decade at a time
Life is pretty cheap - it's so easy to find
Life is pretty cheap - there's really nothing new
Life is pretty cheap - except for the cold delirious fewEmbed
