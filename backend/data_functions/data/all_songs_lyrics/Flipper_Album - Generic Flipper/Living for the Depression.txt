Living for the Depression LyricsWe're living for life to be the way we feel
We're not living for life but the death appeal
Said who needs a cancerous and boring end
When you can die from misery and following the trend
(Chorus)
I say who cares anyway? who listens to what I say?
This song rhymes and we play it in time
And if you want to live in super market isles
And take your vacation by flying for miles
Take a day off and live in the lies
While others work and capitalize
(Chorus)
I say who cares anyway? who listens to what I say?
This song rhymes and we play it in time
Play in your bands and live for fame
But all you're doing is playing their game
Brood in the corner and complain about the rest
When all we're living for is to die
(Chorus)
I say who cares anyway? who listens to what I say?
This song rhymes and we play it in time
We're living like cockroaches in this place
Sprayed with insecticide that leaves no trace
And if we could crawl on you at night
You can be sure we'd love to bite
(Chorus)
I say who cares anyway? who listens to what I say?
This song rhymes and we play it in time
I'm not living life to be
