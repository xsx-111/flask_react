Red Rover Lyrics
Why do you come around
So very much
You know it just brings you down
It's just something you can touch
You don't belong here
I guess you never did
Whisper, look up, in your ear
You just keep it so well hid

Anyone at all
Could see what was missing
Could see you were dying
But no one was crying

And I did hear what you said
Now I can go home
All my days are blue
All my days are bright

Red Rover, Red Rover, Red Rover
We come, we come, we come, we come
To take you over (ah)
Take you over (ah)
Red rover (ah)
Take you over (ah)
One of the quiet ones
One of the few
Now fall down onto your knees
Show us all what you can do
We came around here
To see if you were well
And there's nothing for you to fear
In Heaven or in Hell
