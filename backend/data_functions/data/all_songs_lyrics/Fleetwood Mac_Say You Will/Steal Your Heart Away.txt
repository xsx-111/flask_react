Steal Your Heart Away Lyrics
All alone we go on day after day
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away
It's the same old thing in the same old way
All alone we suffer
Oh, to steal your heart away

And the lie was creeping
Down, down, down
While we were sleeping
Suddenly we hit the ground

So come on, let's go, let's run away
If that's all, all there is
Oh, to steal your heart away



Suffer
The lonely suffer
Steal your heart awayEmbed
