Illume (9/11) LyricsIllume says the candle that I burn
A reflection in the window all the way to Point Dume
Illume like it dances
I am a cliff dweller from the old school
I like the coastal cities, I like the lights
I like the way the ocean blends into the city at night
It's like living on a working river, the coastline is glittering
Like a diamond snake in a black sky
I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger
I will not take you for granted
I wouldn't trade you for jade or for diamonds
Not for one minute, not for anything
I need you to be there
Just remember when I am haunted that I was just so scared
I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger
What I saw on this journey, I saw history go down
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
Because it's just like a river, it's never ending
It's just like a river, it's never ending
I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger
What I saw on this journey, I saw history go down
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
I'm alone now
With my thoughts
Of how we could make it
Of how we could get out
What we've been through
All of the trauma
The smell of Nag Champra
Shadow of a stranger
What I saw on this journey is what legends are made of
I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
It's just like a river, ooh, it's never ending
No, I cannot pretend that the heartache falls away
Because it's just like a river, it's never ending
It falls away
Like a river, it's never ending
