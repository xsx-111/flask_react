Bleed to Love Her Lyrics
Once again she steals away
Then she reaches out to kiss me
And how she takes my breath away
Pretending that she doesn't miss me

Ooh, I would bleed to love her
Ooh, bleed to love her
Ooh, I would bleed to love her

And once again she calls to me
Then she vanishes in thin air
And how she takes my breath away (breath away)
Pretending that she's not there


Somebody's got to see this through
All the world is laughing at you
And somebody's got to sacrifice
If this whole thing's going to turn out right

Bleed to love her2Embed
