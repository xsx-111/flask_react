Running Through the Garden Lyrics
Until she herself
Became the deadliest poison
As she grew older
Ooh, until she herself
Became just as fatal
As was her garden

And so you run toward
What you know is wrong
There are too many flowers
To cut down
With all the love I have for your life
For the love I have for your life
Turn around

Never did I mean to (never did I mean to)
Imprison you (imprison you)
Here in my garden (here in my garden)
Like I am imprisoned (like I am imprisoned)
All the love I have for your life
Turn around (turn around)

Until she herself
Understood her garden
Leaving her heart broken
No future at all
Until she herself
Became the toxic garden
Always frightened
No future at all




For the love I have (for the love I have)
Turn aroundEmbed
