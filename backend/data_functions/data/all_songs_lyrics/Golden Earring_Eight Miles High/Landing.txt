Landing Lyrics
When daylight and nighttime feel the same
It's time for your mind to play a game
Close all your eyes and touch the air
Reach for a hand that must be there
You know how it thrills you
You know how it is
To be one of those people
Who don't know what they miss
You can hide away from reality
But you can't escape

Yesterday I felt it
And the first thing I thought
Never let go
I held it as close as I could
But it didn't grow - like it should
And then, after hours, I opened my head
I Found myself back on the floor near my bed
Nothing has changed, it was all ...
Same again - same again
Mmmmmmmm
Oh, yes
When daylight and nighttime feel the same
It's time for your mind to play a game
Close all your eyes and touch the air
Reach for a hand that must be there
You know how it thrills you
You know how it is
To be one of those people
Who don't know what they miss
You can hide away from reality
But you can't escapeEmbed
