Eight Miles High LyricsEight miles high
And when you touch down
You'll find that it's stranger than known
Signs in the street
That say where you're going
Are somewhere, just being there own
Nowhere is their warmth to be found
Among those afraid of losing their ground
Rain, gray town, known for it's sound
In places, small faces unbound

Give me high high
And i love you forever
JaJa
Give me high high
And i love you forever
Ja
Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Daaaaaaaa ZaZa Zala
Daaaaaaaa JaJa laugh
Daaaaaaaa ZaZa Zala
Down Down Down
Daaaaaaaa ZaZa Zala
Down Down Down
Daaaaaaaa ZaZa Zala


Loud the skirts hollow in storms
Some laughing, some just shapeless forms
Sidewalks scenes and black limousines
Some living, some standing alone

Laugh laughEmbed
