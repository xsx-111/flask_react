One Huge Road Lyrics
Sunshine, I'm late back and happy
I wish I could stay here forever
When the sun's gone
I just can't be lazy
Gotta move on, to see my baby
So I pack my things and I'm going
To the highway, going on my way
Gotta move on, the road is much too long
Too long
One huge road for One
One huge road for One
Sunshine, I'm late back and happy
I wish I could stay here forever
When the sun's gone
I just can't be lazy
Moving on, to see my baby
So I pack my things and I'm going
The highway, going on my way
Gotta move on, the road is much too long
Too long
One huge road for One
One huge road for One
