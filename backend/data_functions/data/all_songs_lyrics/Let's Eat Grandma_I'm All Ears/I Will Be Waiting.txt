I Will Be Waiting Lyrics
The feeling when your head gets
You'll know it when your head gets real
So feel it in the best way
And call it when the moment's revealed
And then you'll let your chest breathe and your head stream
And make headway, through your daydreams
And there's thinking, you'd try to excavate the feelings but they'd stay in
It's like the rhythm of the beat is just a feeling
But there's no need to feel the way that it does
When you're running and you feel so above it
And there's reason why we are redone
So pull yourself into the wind and say

I will be waiting for you, ah
I will be waiting for you, ah
It's late
But I will keep waiting for you
It's late
But I will be waiting

So pull yourself together now, pull it all together now
Open up your head until your tears are streaming out
And theyâ€™ll be people in the line up, spinning safely round in cycles
Then our hands are at the corner of your desk until the ink runs out
And then you'll see yourself in the mirror of the pearls
With people singing out like that's the way, 'cause that's the way now
All your leaves will change with season
Count to eight to hear the gleaming
Be prepared 'cause when you see it
Everything will start competing
And I will be waiting for you, ah
I will be waiting for you, ah
It's late
But I will keep waiting for you
It's late
But I will be waiting

I will be waiting for you
And for the first time, this is the first time
I will be waiting for you
And for the first time, this is the first time (it's figured out)
I will be waiting for you
And for the first time, this is the first time
I will be waiting for you
And for the first time, this is the first time (it's figured out)
And for the first time, this is the first time
And for the first time, this is the first time  (it's figured out)Embed
