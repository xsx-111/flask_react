Falling Into Me Lyrics
I pave the backstreet with the mist of my brain
I cross the gap between the platform and train
(Falling into me)
Violet strip lights I try to dissipate my focus
(Falling into me)
But I realise I can’t keep hiding my emotions
(Falling into me)
I can’t just lay or let be
When all the words you say are hanging onto me
You occupy my mind by every which way

And when I climb the steps to the street
There is no reason to doubt myself here
My thoughts are pouring down with the rain
But now I see that it’s so crystal clear
We got this

You, me, this
Know wherever we go is the best place
No need to be restrained
To know whatever we know we should just say
You, me, this
Know wherever we go is the best place
No need to be restrained
To know whatever we know we should just say
When we were like night bloom violets
Our handprints pressed to my window
I was feeling quite right like this as the lightning glitched and it echoed in your eyes, beating right through the denim
You left a dent in my home screen
We’re in so far, but we need it

You know I’d
Bite my hair as I try to justify
You know I, I
You know I
We got this

You, me, this
Know wherever we go is the best place
No need to be restrained
To know whatever we know we should just say
You, me, this
Know wherever we go is the best place
No need to be restrained
To know whatever we know we should just say

No hesitation at the traffic lights
Beneath the black in my windscreen
We drive
I think they caught it on camera
Can’t help but feel it again
It’s just the necessary price you pay
If you listen to your instincts
I don’t wanna cast it in concrete
And then it hits me again

We’re so illuminated in the night
Alight together down the fireline, fireline
Beat, beat, beat, beat
Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat2Embed
