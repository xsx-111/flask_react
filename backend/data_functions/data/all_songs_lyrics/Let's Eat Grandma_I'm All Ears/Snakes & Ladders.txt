Snakes & Ladders Lyrics
As it starts I begin to open fire
How much do I have to overlap the lines?
'Cause I've grown to understand that you're resigned
Whilst I sit and wait for it all to align, no

But you don't depend on me like I do, and I do
And you don't depend on me like I do, and I do

And you bite me, my two-tooth wounds are sightly
Don't mind me, you'll find me head-to-toe in bright green
So Armani, I'm magnifique
And finally I've been givin' in, so lay your cards down
Rather give it up if I don't know how
How'd you feel so respected, majestic?
'Cause I'm objecting to things that I go off and buy into
Selecting the pails I'll be pouring your tears into
Praying to God it turns out that it wasn't true
'Cause it's so consuming, the time that they're losing
As I'm just wasting, so wasted
Not breathing, just writhing to

How'd you want to feel?
What'd you want to know?
Feel
What'd you want to know?
'Cause you don't depend on me like I, I do
But you will depend on me like I, I do

Tonight, I've been away
I've been starting to trace
Between what is here now and what we could feel
And be endlessly, and before we know it
It feels like the real thing that we treasure
But it feels like we're stuck in the Everglades
Trying to run through mud, but we get nowhere
Like we're searching across the savannah
To fill our cavities up with silver grains
And it feels like we're falling to Saturn
Just a milky star in an empty space
And it looks like we'll never come down
All the green clouds fucked up the sky
But now nothing can smash our glass eyes
Silicon rich, cash in your chips
Going 'round on the Jubilee line
Jupiter, Mercury, 'til we rot away
Where is our power, power, power?
Give me something real, something evergreen, something un-mundane
Where is our power, power, power?
Give me something sweet, something so pristine, something super strange
And it feels like we've fallen in love with it
Well of course we have
Have you lost yourself?3Embed
