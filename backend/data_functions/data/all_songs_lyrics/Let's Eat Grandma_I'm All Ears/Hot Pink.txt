Hot Pink Lyrics
'Cause I don't know what to say with you
Fill my head with shame
'Cause you need someone to blame
I'm just an object of disdain to you
I'm only seventeen
I don't know what you mean
Bite my tongue now
That's your cue to bring me down
Redirect your gaze
'Cause that's your middle name
All the same, kill me now
I'm such a drama queen
You got something up your sleeve, don't you?

Oh, oh
Oh, wait a minute

Hot pink
Is it mine, is it?
Is it mine?
Hot pink
Is it mine, is it?
Is it mine?
Hot pink
On my pony in the sky
I just want anything and everything
Just paint it all in hot pink
What can I say to you?
Been thinking over things I've never said before
'Cause there's an element of great with you
(What a waste on you)
Been looking out for me and then you bring it right back
(So call me up and hear me out)
You keep thinking about it
(You know that's not enough)
I'll keep thinking about it
I just let it go at first
But you went and made it worse
And a glitter eater doesn't need it, best believe it
Even if I'm feeling, don't you

Hot pink
Is it mine, is it?
Is it mine?
Hot pink
Is it mine, is it?
Is it mine?
Hot pink
On my pony in the sky
I just want anything and everything
Just paint it all in hot pink
Hot pink
You won't believe the lengths I've gone for you
You won't believe the shit that I can do
Is it cool, is it mine?
And why you trying to design, to decide
If it's a girl or if it's a guy
Well, there's no reason to define

Hot pink
Is it mine, is it?
Is it mine?
Hot pink
Is it mine, is it?
Is it mine?
Hot pink
On my pony in the sky
I just want anything and everything
Just can't make it obvious
Hot pink

Hot pink
Hot pink
Hot pink
Pink, hot pink
Hot pink, hot pink
(Hello?)
Pink, hot pink
(Is that you?)
Pink, hot pink
Pink, hot pink
Hot pink

Running out of faces that we come to realign to
Running out of places that we come to realign to
Running out of faces that we come to realign to
Running out of places that we come to realign to
Running out of, running out of
Running out of, running out of
Running out of, running out of
Running out of, running out of
Running out of, running out of
Running out, running out9Embed
