Cool & Collected Lyrics
Safe to say we are still strangers speculating all the time
I'll still wait disintegrating, rotting down to ash and lime
Antiseptic so infectious, next to you, I'm far away
That's sometimes why I feel the need to echo every word you say
'Cause I'm impressed with you, I don't have that effect on you
I can't express to you, I'll be here if you want me to
I'm just obsessed with you, I'm always such a mess with you
So what we gonna do, we're gonna find out somehow

How to be cool and collected
I wanna be bold and unaffected
But I'm just ooh, ooh
But I'm just ooh, ooh
The same as I ever was
The same as I ever was
The same as I ever was

And you make me feel so
And you make me feel so
And we're gonna find out somehow

How to be cool and collected
I wanna be bold and unaffected
But I wish I was you
I still blur in the haze that you cut straight through
Like you wanted me to
And you'll always wait, but I thought you knew
That I'm the same as I ever was
The same as I ever was
The same as I ever was
The same as I ever was
I'm the same as I ever was
The same as I ever was
The same as I ever was1Embed
