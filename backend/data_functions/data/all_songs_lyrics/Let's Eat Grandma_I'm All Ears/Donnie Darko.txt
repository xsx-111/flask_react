Donnie Darko Lyrics
I saw you in the yellow pages
I just looked at it to pass the time
In my self-alienating phases I play a rough game to win, to win
Of being things that I can't be
And honestly some people are so committed to honesty
But I don't know if these can face that
'Cause I've wanted to take back what I've said before
But I, I couldn't find my receipt

I've got bedbug bites
Up my spine and my left hand side
Cooled them down in the freezer aisle
Oh so sweet 'til the night comes by
Now I'm lying flat on the bathroom tiles
Hear the buzz of the hornet fly
Trapped inside of my orchid mind
I'm going batshit crazy
It's not real life, I can't be dialing the 999
Peel my skin like a clementine
Just reminds me of Auld Lang Syne
I've got to focus right on the bright blue light
And hold on tight, hold on tight

Donnie Darko's at my windscreen
Screaming, "Stop the car, stop the car, please"
But I can't
And I can't
'Cause the beatings just get harder and we'll never grow them out
'Cause the hand that does the dealings is the one that feeds your mouth
And the beatings just get harder and we'll never grow them out
'Cause the hand that does the dealings is the one that feeds your mouth
And I won't, and I won't

I saw you in the yellow pages
I just looked at it to pass the time
In my self-alienating phases I play a rough game to win, to win
Of being things that I can't be
And honestly some people are so committed to honesty
But I don't know if these can face that
'Cause I've wanted to take back what I've said before
But I, I couldn't find my receipt

I saw you in the yellow pages
I just looked at it to pass the time
'Cause I've wanted to take back what I've said before
But I can't, and I can't
And I know, and I know1Embed
