Lover Dearest Lyrics
This place is a hole, but I don't want to go
I wish we could stay here forever alone
This time that we waste, but I still love your taste
Don't let him take my place, don't just sit there

Sometimes I wish you would leave me
Well, I'm not sick of you yet
Is that as good as it gets?
I'll just try to hide it, or I could slip into you
It's so easy to come back into you

I stand for a while and waited for words
Seen but not heard and struggled to try
My tongue's turning black, but I'll take you back
You're still the best more or less, I guess, I guess

Don't you leave me
Well, I'm not sick of you yet
Is that as good as it gets?
I'll just try to hide it, or I could slip into you
It's so easy to come back into you
It hurts me to say that it hurts me to stay
And it might be alright if you go
It hurts me to say that I want you to stay
But it might be alright if you go

So leave me
Well, I'm not sick of you yet
Is that as good as it gets?
I'll just try to hide it, or I could slip into you
It's so easy to come back into you

Sometimes I think that the bitter in you and the quitter in me
Is the bitter in you and the quitter in me
The bitter in you and the quitter in me
Is the bitter in you and the quitter in me
The bitter in you and the quitter in me
Is bigger than the both of us2Embed
