Cross My Heart (Acoustic) LyricsSo here’s another day I’ll spend away from you
Another night I’m on another broken avenue
My bag is ripped and worn
Then again, now so am I
Take what you want to take
What you want to take, what you
I miss the stupid things
We go to sleep and then
You wake me up and kick me out of bed at 3 am
Pick up the phone and hear you saying dirty things to me
Do what you want to do
What you want to do, what you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me home, I don’t want to be alone tonight
And I do want to show you
I will run to you, to you ‘till I
Can’t stand on my own anymore
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart and hope to die
I cross my heart and hope to
Hotels are all the same
You’re still away from me
Another day, another dollar that I’ll never see
Can I get a piece, a piece, a piece of something good?
I’d like just a little
Like just a little, like just a (just a)
I wonder what you’re doing
I wonder if you doubt it (doubt it)
I wonder how we used to ever go so long without it (so long)
Now I know where I go
I’m coming back to you
I’ll be where I outta be
Where I outta be, where I
Take me with you I start to miss you
Take me home, I don’t want to be alone tonight
And I do want to show you
I will run to you, to you ‘till I
Can’t stand on my own anymore
I cross my heart and hope to die
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me with you, I start to miss you
Take me home, I don’t want to be alone tonight
And I do want to show you
I will run to you, to you ‘till I
Can’t stand on my own anymore
I cross my heart and hope to die
And I do want to show you (cross my heart)
I will run to you, to you ‘till I (hope to die)
Can’t stand on my own anymore (hope to die)
I cross my heart and hope to die
And I do want to show you (cross my heart)
I will run to you, to you ‘till I (hope to die)
Can’t stand on my own anymore (hope to die)
I cross my heart and hope to die
And I do want to show you (cross my heart)
I will run to you, to you ‘till I (hope to die)
Can’t stand on my own anymore (hope to die)
I cross my heart and hope to dieEmbed
