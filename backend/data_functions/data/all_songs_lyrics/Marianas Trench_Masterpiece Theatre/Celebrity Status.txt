Celebrity Status Lyrics
I look around, look around, round, look around
I look around, look around, round, look around

I look around, round, look around and look it over
I take it up, up, take it out and take you nowhere
Trading in who I've been for shiny celebrity skin
I like to push it and push it until my luck is over
It never stops, stops, never stops, well, you better
Think it over, prima donna, you don't want to sever
All the work to impress, charming girls out of their dresses
Smiling pretty, well, pretty will swallow you forever

Step one, step two, step three, repeat
And I pray at the church of asses in the seats
I disappear behind the beat
Yeah

When the mirrors and the lights and the smoke clear
I'd never guess how we ever could have got here
You can say what you say when the lights go down
So shake, shake, shake and shut your mouth
I wonder why, why, I wonder why, why I oughta
Let you wreck, resurrect whatever you wanna
I can't depend in the end, you know
I thought you were my friend
Just stop, just stop, just stop, I think I got it
Sorry you, sorry me, sorry every in between
Sorry everybody here will never be somebody clean
There's a piece of me they're throwing back at us
And they will buy you and sell you for celebrity status

Step one, step two, step three, repeat
And I pray at the church of asses in the seats
I disappear behind the beat

When the mirrors and the lights and the smoke clear
I'd never guess how we ever could have got here
You can say what you say when the lights go down
So shake, shake, shake and shut your mouth
When the mirrors and the lights and the smoke clear
I'd never guess how we ever could have got here
You can say what you say when the lights go down
So shake, shake, shake and shut your mouth
Look around, round
Look around, round
Look around
Look around, round
Look around, round
Look around
Look around, round
Look around, round
Look around
Look around, round
Look around, round
Look around
Look around, round
Look around, round
Look around
(Look around, round, Look around, round, Look around, Look around, round, Look around, round, Look around, Look around, round, Look around, round, Look around)
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying

When the mirrors and the lights and the smoke clear
I'd never guess how we ever could have got here
You can say what you say when the lights go down
So shake, shake, shake and shut your mouth
When the mirrors and the lights and the smoke clear
I'd never guess how we ever could have got here
You can say what you say when the lights go down
So shake, shake, shake and shut your mouth

I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying2Embed
