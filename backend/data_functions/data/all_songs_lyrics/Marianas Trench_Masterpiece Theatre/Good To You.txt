Good To You Lyrics
Everyone's around
No words are coming now
And I can't find my breath
Can we just say the rest with no sound
And I know this isn't enough
I still don't measure up
And I'm not prepared
Sorry is never there when you need it

And I do want you to know
I hold you up above everyone
And I do want you to know I think
You'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you
I would

I thought I saw a sign
Somewhere between the lines
Maybe it's me
Maybe I only see what I want
And I still have your letter
Just got caught between
Someone I just invented
Who I really am and who I've become
And I do want you to know
I hold you up above everyone
And I do want you to know I think
You'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I can't be without you
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Yeah
I would

And I do want you to know
I hold you up above everyone
And I do want you to know I think
You'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you

I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be so good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be good to you
I'd be so good to youEmbed
