Beside You Lyrics
When your tears are spent
On your last pretense
And your tired eyes refuse to close
And sleep in your defense
When it's in your spine
Like you've walked for miles
And the only thing you want is just to
Be still for a while

And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
I'll be right beside you

You're overwhelmed
And you've lost your breath
And the space between the things you know
Is blurring nonetheless
When you try to speak
But you make no sound
And the words you want are out of reach
But they've never been so loud
And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
I'll be right beside you

I will stay (here beside you)
Nobody will break you

Trust in me, trust in me, don't pull away
Just trust in me, trust me
'Cause I'm just trying to keep it together
'Cause I could do worse and you could do better

When your tears are spent
On your last pretense
And your tired eyes refuse to close
And sleep in your defense

And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
Nobody will break you
And if your heart wears thin
I will hold you up
And I will hide you
When it gets too much
I'll be right beside you
Nobody will break you5Embed
