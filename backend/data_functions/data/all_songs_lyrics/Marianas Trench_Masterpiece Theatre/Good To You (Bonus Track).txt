Good To You (Bonus Track) Lyrics
Everyone's around, no words are coming now
And I can't find my breath, can we just say the rest with no sound
And I know this isn't enough, I still don't measure up
And I'm not prepared, sorry is never there when you need it

And now I do want you to know
I hold you up above everyone
And now I do want you to know
I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you
I would

I thought I saw a sign somewhere between the lines
Maybe it's me
Maybe I only see what I want
And I still have your letter just got caught between
Someone I just invented, who I really am and who I've become

And now I do want you to know
I hold you up above everyone
And now I do want you to know
I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you
Whoa
(2x)
And now I do want you to know
I hold you up above everyone
And now I do want you to know
I think you'd be good to me
And I'd be so good to you

I'd be good to you 
I'd be so good to you
I'd be good to you 
I'd be so good to youEmbed
