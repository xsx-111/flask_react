So It Goes LyricsIn every heart there is a room
A sanctuary safe and strong
To heal the wounds from lovers past
Until a new one comes along
I spoke to you in cautious tones
You answered me with no pretense
And still I feel I said to much
My silence is my self defense
And this is why my eyes are closed
Its just as well for all I've seen
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knows
So I would choose to be with you
That's if the choice were mine to make
But you can make descions too
And you can have this heart to break
And so it goes, and so it goes
And you're the only one who knowsEmbed
