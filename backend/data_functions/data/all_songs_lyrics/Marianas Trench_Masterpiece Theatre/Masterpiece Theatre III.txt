Masterpiece Theatre III Lyrics
I got a new disease in me
I got a friend that's losing sleep
I take it hard, it's hard to take
I'm wide awake
I'm wide awake
One more confession, discretion's not what I need to sell
I never needed a reason for keeping secrets from myself
And now that's just how I tell I'm wide awake
I'll wreck this if I have to
Tell me what good would that do
I'll wreck this if I have to
(I'd be so good to you)
(I'd be so good to you)

You get separated, somebody's gone
And I don't know how this is wrong
And I'm so frustrated, falling behind
You were a friend of mine

I'd be so good to you
'Cause they don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
There's a difference from me to them
And the road home is paved in star fuckers requiem
I can never go, go back home again
Acadia is gone (Acadia is gone)
(Acadia is gone)

All my indecision, all my of my excess
Don't you ever tell me I'm not loving you best
And I just need a minute, I just need a breath
It's very hard to drink to my continued success tonight
Slow down, slow
It's better in the worst way
It's getting better in the worst way

(Look around, round, look around, round, look around)
(Look around, round, look around, round, look around)
(Look around, round, look around, round, look around)
(Look around, round, look around, round, look around)

So here's another day, I'll spend away from you
Another night I'm on another broken avenue
Trading in who I've been for shiny celebrity skin
I like to push it and push it until my luck is over
(Please just follow me)
I wonder what you're doing
I wonder if you doubt it
I wonder how we used to ever go so long without it
(I thought you wanted me)
All the work to impress
Charming girls out of their dresses
Smiling pretty and pretty
I am right beside you, right
(Please just follow me)
(What you want, what you need)
(I thought you wanted me)
I am right beside you, right
(Please just follow me)
(I thought you wanted me)
I'll make this perfect again
(Cross my heart, I hope to die, hope to die)
If I burn out and slip away
(Please just follow me)
(What you want, what you need)
You're beautiful, you are
(Please just follow me)
(What you want, what you need)
(Cross my heart, I hope to die, hope to die)

I've been here so very long
(I could slip into you, it's so easy to come back into you)
I'll hide it, can I hide in you a while?
(I'm not sick of you yet, is that as good as it gets?)
(And this is just the part I portray, and this is just the part I portray)
I never took you for a trick but sometimes I don't know what you want
I could take it if you need to take this out on someone
(And this is just the part I portray)
(And this is just the part I portray)
I don't know how it got this way5Embed
