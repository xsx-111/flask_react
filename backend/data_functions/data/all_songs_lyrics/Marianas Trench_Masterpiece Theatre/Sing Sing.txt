Sing Sing Lyrics
Can I have your attention? (whoa whoa whoa)
I just open my mouth
Is it clear?
Is it loud for you?

You just need me to be stable
But I won't be able
To keep it together again
Now don't "pretty please" me
You're not making it easy
To slow me down

It's no wonder
I'm not eating
I'm not sleeping
You say
Sing, sing to me
Sing me something I need
Sing new, sing good
God, I wish that I could

Are you hearing me now? (whoa whoa whoa)
Hear the sad little sounds as they fall from my mouth (whoa yeah)
You just need me to be stable
But I won't be able
To keep it together again
Now don't "pretty please" me
You're not making it easy
To slow me down

It's no wonder
I'm not eating
I'm not sleeping
You say
Sing, sing to me
Sing me something I need
Sing new, sing good
God, I wish that I could

All my indecision
All of my excess
Don't you ever tell me I'm not lovin' you best
I just need a minute
I just need a breath
Gets very hard to drink to my continued success
Do I have your attention?
You just need me to be stable
But I won't be able
To keep it together again
(together again)
Now don't "pretty please" me
You're not making it easy
To slow me down

It's no wonder
I'm not eating
I'm not sleeping
You say
Sing, sing to me
Sing me something I need
Sing new, sing good
God, I wish that I could

(Sing, sing to me)
All my indecision
(Sing, sing to me)
(Sing, sing to me)
All of my excess
(Sing, sing to me)
Don't you ever tell me I'm not lovin' you best
All my indecision
All of my excess
Don't you ever tell me I'm not lovin' you best
God I wish that I could
Yeah-eah-eah!Embed
