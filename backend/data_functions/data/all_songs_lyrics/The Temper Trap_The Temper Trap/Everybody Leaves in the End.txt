Everybody Leaves in the End LyricsDo you remember when you were young
Chasing clouds down the rivers
Catching birds in the sun
You have surrendered life's better hours
In the deep lies your freedom
In the stars is your home
As we gather to see you go
Flowers scatter to let you know
Sons of the mountains cry in the vials
Warm and tender in her arms
So you'll stay though you're gone
As we gather to say goodbye
Until we see your face again
But seasons come you're going soon
Everybody leaves in the end
Do you remember, do you remember
No one way, no one can ever walk like you again
All the names left behind
Are standing mirrors of your eyes
No one will, not one name
Shall replace the wars that came
Held you tight, we held you tight
Everybody leaves in the end
Do you remember?Embed
