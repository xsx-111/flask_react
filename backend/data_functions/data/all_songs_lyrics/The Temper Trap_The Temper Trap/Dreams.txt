Dreams LyricsOne hand holds another, tangled fingers tell a tale
I know every single line across your face so well
We don't wanna, we don't wanna, wanna walk alone forever
We don't wanna live without each other in the end

Where our dreams go, where our dreams go
Where our dreams go, where our dreams go
Where our dreams go, where our dreams go
Where our dreams go, we follow
One hand breaks another, broken bones can always mend
Loss will be a blessing that will turn us back again
Cause we don't wanna, we don't wanna, wanna walk alone forever
We don't wanna live without each other in the end

Where our dreams go
There we will follow
