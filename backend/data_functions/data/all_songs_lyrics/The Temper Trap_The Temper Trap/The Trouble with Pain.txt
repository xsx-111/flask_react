The Trouble with Pain LyricsThe trouble with pain
Is where, is where it goes
It goes
It makes you forget
A hands, a hearts
And nose
We do without
When we're all on top
We do without
When the quiet stops
Trouble with pain
Is that it's never, it's never
Ready now
To whisper that's game
To something better
To something better again
Cause no one wants to know you
When you crash it down
And no one wants to be there
To pick you off the ground
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
Aah, aah
Aah, aahEmbed
