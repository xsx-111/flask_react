The Sea Is Calling LyricsAt night, when it's quiet, and the waves come rolling in
The merchant ship's light paints the dark as we sing hymns
The one who is great, whom by words cannot be seen
When all left is love, there will be no in between

Tucked in the corner of Earth
Naked in light we are birthed
Oh, can you hear the sea calling?
Calling us into the world
A distance from grace, we shall toil with our days
And take on the dirt that has rendered us as slaves
Our mothers will cry, is there something in the sky?
We know we are present here and may never know why

Tucked in the corner of Earth
Placed on the waves' side at birth
Down on the open road
Making our way back home
