Want Lyrics
I want to be the one to set your eyes alight
I want to be the one you treasure deep inside
I want to be the one to make you laugh each time
I want to be the only one you come home to at night

Stay in my heart
You can't always get what you want this time
That's how it is, oceans apart
Two wanderers have set their course to collide

I want to be the one in my father's eyes
To make him look upon my land, tell me everything's alright
I want to be the one in my mother's arms
No matter how far I may be, home is by her side

Stay in my heart
You can't always get what you want this time
That's how it is, oceans apart
Two wanderers have set their course to collide

I want to be where you are
Oh where you are, oh where you are
Where you are
Where you are
Oh where you are, oh where you are
Where you are
Where you are
Oh where you are, oh where you are
Where you are
Where you are
Oh where you are, oh where you are
Where you are

The things I know are mine, I give them up for you
For all I ever wanted was for you to want me tooEmbed
