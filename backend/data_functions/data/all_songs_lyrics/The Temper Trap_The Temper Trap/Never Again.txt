Never Again Lyrics
No, never again will your walls
Be left abandoned by these hands
No, never again will I scale
The sleeping tower where your heart lays

Now, here we are my dear, this is where
You're walking out the way you came in

No, never again will you draw
Down your bridge to let their horses in
Dead or alive, the captives I thought I had freed
Made their bed in mine to haunt me when they please

Now, here we are my dear, this is where
You're walking out the way you came in

Oh, I came to let you try once again
It's the end

No, never again
No, never againEmbed
