Where Do We Go From Here LyricsA pretty picture paints a thousand words
Now look at yours today
It's been a while, the dust has long set in
You still look the same

So, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Years have gone and time has healed
Your words were casual but longing for
For me as someone else
What could have driven you to think of all
I let go with much tears
So, where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
How do I know what's real?
Where do we go from here?
Years have gone and time has healed
Tell me now just how to feel
Just how to feel
Where do we go when all the roads are under
Now where do we go, and many chances pass us by
Where do we go, what now when I am married, oh
But don't close, how can I let you in again?

Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from
Where do we go from here?
From hereEmbed
