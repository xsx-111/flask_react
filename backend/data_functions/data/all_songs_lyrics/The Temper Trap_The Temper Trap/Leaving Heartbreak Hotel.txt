Leaving Heartbreak Hotel LyricsOh my, oh my friends
When can I see you all again?
Built up castles made of sand
They may fall, but memories remain
Don't let them say
Dreamin' of way back when
In and out your door
We were all someone else before
Leavin' shadows on each other's walls
We laughed and cried, laughed and cried some more
So don't let them say
Dreamin' of way back when
Don't break the spell
I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)
Catch you in my sleep (I'm leavin' the heartbreak hotel)Embed
