Trembling Hands Lyrics
Treading the ground
I once used to know
People are strangers
The same as before
The streets look familiar
I remember the park
Where I buried my head
So deep in my hands
All around me was dark
This here city
Is for the lonely ones
You won't find no angels
Selling maps to the lost
This here place
Is too small for two
It took one to realise
When dreamingâ€™s this hard
It's not meant to come true

So throw me a line
Somebody out there help me
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Throw me a line
Afraid that I have come here
To win you again
With trembling hands
Passing the days
Looking over the buildings
Time seemed to stop
While the millions keep moving
Now here I am
I'm a drop in your ocean
A noise in the crowd
Pushing through your halls of reason

So throw me a line
Somebody out there help me
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Throw me a line
Afraid that I have come here
To win you again
With trembling hands

Hear me now, make me whole
Whole
Hear me now, make me whole
Whole
So throw me a line
Somebody out there help me
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Throw me a line
Afraid that I have come here
To win you again
With trembling hands
With trembling hands

There goes the ending
It left me in want
But I've tried everything, dear
I am done with my part2Embed
