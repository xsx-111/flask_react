Need Your Love LyricsThe road is pulling me into her open web
And for a moment I escape and I forget
The silhouettes behind the dust clouds call me friend
But even fools know here they’re far and few between
She has abandoned me on highways and desert plains
Of lonely creatures singing for the summer rain
And at the end of all your knees fall down to kneel
Yet something in you always yearns for someone real

Oh I need your love, I need your love
I need you now, I need you
She is my salvation in the dark
But at night with lips of honey calls the devil’s horn
And I am a war of flesh and heart that’s left undone
Between the person that I was and have become

There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting now
There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting in my heart
There’s no resting for the one you love1Embed
