Rabbit Hole LyricsI don't wanna be the only one 'round here
Everything I'm saying's falling on deaf ears
Come to get you if you make another sound
Make you an example send you crawling home
Anyone who listens is gonna get theirs when the water floods down
Into the rabbit hole
Hands up if you think you're gonna save us now
Before we shoot the messenger for talking too loud
We'll keep you on the run
We get what we want
Every which way you go they're gonna hunt you down
Making you believe a lot of sticks and bricks can get you stoned
Cause anyone who listens is gonna get theirs when the water floods down
Into the rabbit hole
Think we gone around
You think we gone around, you're wrong
Just feeding the flame
Arresting the fire
And it's a cold day in hell
It'll be a cold day in hell
Growing up
Just feeding the flame
Arresting the fire
With fire, with fire
In the rabbit holeEmbed
