To the End Lyrics
He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb
He's always choking from the stench and the fume
The wedding party all collapsed in the room
So send my resignation to the bride and the groom
Let's go down!

This elevator only goes up to ten
He's not around, he's always looking at men
Down by the pool, he doesn't have many friends
As they are face-down and bloated, snap a shot with the lens

If you marry me, would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

(Say goodbye) To the vows you take
(Say goodbye) To the life you make
(And say goodbye) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank

Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
She keeps a picture of the body she lends
Got nasty blisters from the money she spends
She's got a life of her own and it shows by the Benz
She drives at 90 by the Barbies and Kens

If you ever say never too late
I'll forget all the diamonds you ate
Lost in coma and covered in cake
Increase the medication, share the vows at the wake
Kiss the bride

If you marry me, would you bury me?
Would you carry me to the end?

(Say goodbye) To the vows you take
(Say goodbye) To the life you make
(And say goodbye) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
(And say goodbye) To the last parade
(And walk away) From the choice you made
(And say goodnight) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Ooh, whoa, oh
Hey!

(Say goodbye) To the vows you take
(Say goodbye) To the life you make
(And say goodbye) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
(And say goodbye) To the last parade
(And walk away) From the choice you made
(And say goodnight) To the hearts you break
And all the cyanide you drank
(Ooh, whoa, oh) To the last parade
(Ooh, whoa, oh) When the parties fade
(Ooh, whoa, oh) And the choice you made
To the end...22Embed
