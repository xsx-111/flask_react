The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You Lyrics

Gaze into her killing jar, I'd sometimes stare for hours
(Sometimes stare for hours)
She even poked the holes so I can breathe

She bought the last line, I'm just the worst kind
Of guy to argue with what you might find
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie with you?

Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

I'm lost in the prescription, she's got something else in mind (Something else in mind)
Check into the Hotel Bella Muerte

It gives the weak flight, it gives the blind sight
Until the cops come or by the last light
And for the last night I lie
Could I lie next to you?
Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time
Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Pull the plug, but I'd like to learn your name
When holding on, well I hope you do the same, aw sugar
Slip into the tragedy
You've spun this chamber dry

Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time
Alright, give up, get down, it's just the hardest part of living
Alright, she wants it all to come down this time

Pull the plug, but I'd like to learn your name
And holding on, well, I hope you do the same, aw sugar...19Embed
