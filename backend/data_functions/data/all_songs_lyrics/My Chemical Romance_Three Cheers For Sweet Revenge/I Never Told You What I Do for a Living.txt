I Never Told You What I Do for a Living Lyrics
Stay out of the light or the photograph that I gave you
You can say a prayer if you need to
Or just get in line and I'll grieve you
Can I meet you alone?
Another night and I'll see you
Another night and I'll be you
Some other way to continue
To hide my face

Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes
I keep a book of the names and those

Only go so far 'til you bury them
So deep and down, we go

Touched by angels, though
I fall out of grace
I did it all, so maybe
I'd live this every day
Another knife in my hands, a stain that never comes off the sheets
Clean me off, I'm so dirty, babe
It ain't the money and it sure as hell ain't just for the fame
It's for the bodies I claim and those

Only go so far 'til you bury them
So deep and down, we go

Down, and down we go, and down we go, and down we go
And we all fall down! I tried! I tried!

And we'll all dance along to the tune of your death
We'll love again, we'll laugh again, and it's better off this way

And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots
To the back of the head and we're all dead now
And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots
To the back of the head and we're all dead now

I tried! One more night, one more night!
Well, I'm laughing out, crying out, laugh out loud!
I tried, well, I tried, well, I tried, 'cause I tried, but I lied, I lied!
I tried, I tried, I tried, well...
And we'll love again, we'll laugh again
We'll cry again, and we'll dance again
And it's better off this way, so much better off this way
I can't clean the blood off the sheets in my bed!

And never again and never again, they gave us two shots
To the back of the head and we're all dead now...33Embed
