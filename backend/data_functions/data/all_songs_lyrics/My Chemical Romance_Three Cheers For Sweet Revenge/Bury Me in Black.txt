Bury Me in Black Lyrics
I said we'll drown ourselves
In misery, tonight
White lies, you've worn out
All your dancing shoes, this time
Just give us war-worn lipstick
By the purifying flame

These eyes have had too much
To drink again, tonight
Black skies, we'll douse ourselves
In high explosive light
Just give us war, war
I've been calling you all week for my shotgun

Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone, fucker
I wanna see what your insides look like (I wanna see what your insides look like)
I bet you're not fucking pretty on the inside (Not pretty)
I wanna see what your insides look like (Pretty, pretty)
I wanna see 'em
Well, you don't say
And well, I can't explain what happened to my faith
Late, last night
I sleep in empty pools and vacant alleyways
And what I'm going through
Shot lip gloss through my veins
And well, I can't complain
With the falling rain
C'mon!

I wanna save your heart
I wanna see what your insides may be like10Embed
