Thank You for the Venom Lyrics

Sister, I'm not much a poet, but a criminal
And you never had a chance
Love it or leave it, you can't understand a pretty face
But you do, so carry on, and on, and on

I wouldn't front the scene if you paid me
I'm just the way that the doctor made me
On, and on, and on, and on
Love is the red, the rose on your coffin door
What's life like bleeding on the floor, the floor, the floor?

You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will

Preach all you want, but who's gonna save me?
I keep a gun on the book you gave me
Hallelujah, lock and load
Black is the kiss, the touch of a serpent son
It ain't the mark or the scar that makes you one, and one, and one, and one
You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
Give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will


You'll never make me leave, I wear this on my sleeve
You wanna follow something, give me a better cause to lead
Just give me what I need, give me a reason to believe

So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill
You're running after something that you'll never kill
If this is what you want, then fire at will
So give me all your poison, and give me all your pills (Fire at will)
And give me all your hopeless hearts and make me ill (Fire at will)
You're running after something that you'll never kill (Fire at will)
If this is what you want, then fire at will (Fire at will)52Embed
