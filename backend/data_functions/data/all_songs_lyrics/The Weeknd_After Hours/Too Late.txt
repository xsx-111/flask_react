Too Late Lyrics
No-no, no-no, no-no-no

I let you down, I led you on
I never thought I'd be here without you
Don't let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind

I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby (Oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late to save my—

I want you, babe, ooh-ooh

It's way too late (Late) to save our souls, baby (Souls, baby, oh, oh, yeah)
It's way too late, we're on our own (Baby, on my own)
I made mistakes (Mistakes), I did you wrong, baby (Oh, baby, oh, oh, yeah)
