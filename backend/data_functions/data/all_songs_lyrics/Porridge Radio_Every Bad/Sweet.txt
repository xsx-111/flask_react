Sweet Lyrics
My mum says that I look like a nervous wreck
Because I bite my nails right down to the flesh
And sometimes, I am just a child, writing letters to myself
Wishing out loud you were dead, and then taking it back
And I used to be ashamed until I learned I love the game
And I slowly move away from everything I knew about you
And my mum gave me this pen, she said it lights up when you press it
And are you still so depressed, and I like it that you need me
You will like me when you meet me
You will like me when you meet me
You will like me when you meet me
You might even fall in love

I am charming, I am sweet
And she will love me when she meets me
She will love me when she meets me
I am charming, I am sweet (Sweet)

My mum says that I look like a nervous wreck
Because I bite my nails right down to the flesh
You will like me when you meet me
You will like me when you meet me
You will like me when you meet me
You might even fall in love
And my mum gave me this pen, she said it lights up when you press it
And are you still so depressed, and I like it that you need me
And you are such a nervous wreck
You can see it in the way you treat your body
And I used to be ashamed until I learned I love the game
And I slowly move away from everything I knew about me

I am charming, I am sweet
And she will love me when she meets me
She will love me when she meets me
I am charming, I am sweet (Sweet)
I am charming, I am sweet
And she will love me when she meets me
She will love me when she meets me
I am charming, I am sweet (Sweet)
I am charming, I am sweet
And she will love me when she meets me
She will love me when she meets me
I am charming, I am sweet (Sweet)Embed
