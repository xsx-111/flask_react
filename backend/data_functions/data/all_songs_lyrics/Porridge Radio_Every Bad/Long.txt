Long Lyrics
You're wasting my time

You're wasting my time
Nobody's telling me anything
Nobody's telling me anything
Nobody's telling me anything
And you're wasting my time
You're wasting my time
You're wasting my time
You're wasting my time

And I
Somebody had to tell you (Somebody had to)
Somebody had to tell you (Somebody had to)
Somebody had to tell you (Somebody had to)
And I'm glad it was me
I'm not in charge of everything
I'm not in charge of anything
And I'm glad it's not me (Somebody had to)
I'm glad it's not me (Somebody had to)
I don't know what you're going through (Somebody had to)
I don't know what you're going through
But it's a waste of my time
It's a waste of my time
I don't know what you're going through
But it's wasting my time
And I'm wasting my life
I'm wasting my life
I'm wasting my life
I'm wasting my life


And it's a waste of my time
It's a waste of my time
It's a waste of my time
It's a waste of my time
Leaves a sad taste in your mouth
Makes you forget why you came here
Makes you forget what you wanted
Makes you forget all your choices
Makes you feel like you're wasting
Makes you sweat out of every pore
And my bitterness
Every bitter breath

A bad taste in your mouth
A bad taste in your mouth
And I forget what I came here for
I forget what I stay here for
And I'm wasting your time
I'm wasting your time
I'm wasting everything
I'm wasting everything
And I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
And I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not me
I'm glad it's not meEmbed
