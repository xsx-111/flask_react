Homecoming Song Lyrics
Oh
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
Oh
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Oh
I need to go
I need to go
I need to go

I'm a sinking ship
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing inside
There's nothing
Oh
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming homeEmbed
