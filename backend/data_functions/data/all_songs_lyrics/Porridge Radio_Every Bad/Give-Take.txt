Give/Take Lyrics
One, two, three, four

One, two, three, four
Don't you know what I've been waiting for?
One, two, three, four
Don't you know what I've been waiting for?
One, two, three, four
Don't you know that I adore you?
One, two, three, four
Don't you know that I want more

I want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want you
I want, want, want, want, want, want, want, I need you
I want, want, want, want, and I always get what I need
I want, want, want, want, and I always get what's good for me

And how do I say no without sounding like a little bitch?
And how do I say no without being contagious?
And how do I say no?
And how do I say no?
And how do I say no?
And how do I say no?
And you do as you're told
And how do I say no?
And I say what I need
And how do I say no?
I want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want, want
And how do I say no?
And you do as you're told
And how do I say no?
And I take what I need
And how do I say no?
And you want, want, want, want, want, want to be wanted
But I like you and you like me
But I've got other things that make me happy
I like you and you like me
But I've got other things that make me happy

So you want, want, want, want, want, want, and you want some more
And you want, want, want, want, want 'til you get sore
So you want, want, want, want, want, and you want some more
And you want, want, want, want, want 'til you get soreEmbed
