Born Confused Lyrics
I'm bored to death, let's argue
I'm bored to death, let's argue
I'm bored to death, let's argue
What is going on with me?
And maybe I was born confused
And baby, I was born confused
So I don't know what's going on
Maybe nothing's going on
And everyone I know is down in the dumps about it
And everyone I know is down in the dumps about you now
And maybe I was born confused but I'm not
And maybe I was born and I knew and I forgot

Well, maybe I was born confused
And baby, I was born confused
So I don't know what's going on
Maybe nothing's going on
And maybe I was born confused
And baby, I was born confused
So I don't know what's going on
Maybe nothing's going on
