Pop Song Lyrics
Oh, won't you take me home?
I've got nowhere to be
I'm lonely, oh
I'm lonely, oh
And take me back to bed
And shoot me in the head
And don't let all this
And when did all this

And I'm not coming home, no, I'm never coming back
You'll miss me when I'm gone but I'm never coming back
I'm rotten at my core
I'm ugly deep inside
My bitterness subsides sometimes for a while
But I'm jealous to my core, so I'm never coming back
The waves keep rolling in
I'm never coming back

And where was home to you?
And where did you feel safe?
And where was home to you?
What kind of place?
And where was home to you? (And I'm not coming home)
And where do you feel safe? (I'm never coming back)
A warm and gentle place (And I'm not coming home)
A place where you feel safe (I'm never coming back)
And where was home to you? (I'm never coming home)
And where did you feel safe? (I'm never coming back)
A warm and gentle place (I'm never coming home)
A place where you feel safe (I'm never coming back)

And where was home to you?
And where did you feel safe?
And where was home to you?
What kind of place?

And please make me feel safe
And please make me feel safe
And please make me feel safe
And please make me feel safeEmbed
