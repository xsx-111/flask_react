Circling Lyrics
I'm doing well, I'm doing fine
We're all okay, all of the time
Nothing is wrong, everything's fine
We're all okay, all of the time
Everything's fine, everything's fine
Nothing is wrong, you are mine
When we are gone, all is fine
Everything's fine, everything's fine
Everything's mine, and that is what I want
That is what I chose, that is what I want
And now the sun's out, and everything's fine
And you are okay because you are mine
And nothing is wrong, all of the time

And I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes

When we are gone, all is fine
Everything's fine, everything's fine
Everything's mine, and that is what I want
That is what I chose, that is what I want
And now the sun's out, and everything's fine
And you are okay because you are mine
And nothing is wrong, all of the time
And I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
And I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes
I go inside the sea sometimes

Takes me away, puts me to sleep
Holds my hand and whispers gently
I am okay, all of the time
I am okay, some of the time1Embed
