Nephews Lyrics
Oh, I'd like to be two nephews under the sea
Plunge into murky depths
Soft and salty and deaf
Oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa, oh

Oh, my dream took me far, far away
To a place where your mind will decay
And you slip into unconsciousness
And you're dwelling again, you're an unconscious mess
Oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa, oh

Oh, I'd like to sink down
With nephews, down, down where your head might explode
And the water's so dark that you can't feel your heart as it sinks
Oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa, oh

Oh, my dream took me far, far away
To a place where your mind will decay
And you slip into unconsciousness
And you're dwelling again, you're an unconscious mess
Oh-whoa, oh, oh-whoa, oh
I'd like to find the mother who bore this kind-hearted child
And my dream is to be two nephews under the sea
Oh-whoa, oh-oh, oh
Oh-whoa, oh-oh, oh

Oh, we love each other so
Oh, we love each other so
Oh, we love each other so
Oh, we love each other so
Oh, we love each other so
Oh, we love each other so
Oh, we love each other soEmbed
