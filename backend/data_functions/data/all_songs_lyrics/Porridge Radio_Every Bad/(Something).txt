(Something) Lyrics
And you waited patiently
And you waited there for me
And you thought that I was there
The person who'd take you out of it
Keep you safe
Keep you safe
Keep you safe
Keep you safe
Don't rely on me
Please rely on me
I rely on you

And nothing makes
Me feel this way
Except for you
Every day
Sometimes I
Forget to love
But that's okay
I think it is

And you waited patiently
And you took all of me
Never thought that I would leave
Never thought I had it in me
And you took all that I had
And you wanted to give me it all
And I tell you that I love you
Even when I don't feel anything at all
Even if I don't feel anything at all
Even if I don't feel anything at all
Even if I don't feel anything at allEmbed
