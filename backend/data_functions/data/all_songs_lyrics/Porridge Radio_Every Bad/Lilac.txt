Lilac Lyrics
I am, my body’s so uncomfortable
I’m not anything unforgivable
But I don’t want to do it
I don’t want to get bitter
Forget how to make you better
I want you to be comfortable
I know you’re so uncomfortable
I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck
I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck
I’m stuck, I’m stuck, I’m stuck

And I don’t know how to find
A way to make us comfortable
I want you to be comfortable
And I want to make you better
And I don’t know how to find it
And I try hard to be kind to you
I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind
I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind
I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind

But I can never seem to find it
Sometimes I try to hide it
I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind
I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind
I’m kind, I’m kind, I’m kind
But I can never seem to find it
I can never seem to find it
I can never seem to find it
I can never seem to find it
I can never seem to find it
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other
I don’t want to get bitter
I want us to get better
I want us to be kinder
To ourselves and to each other1Embed
