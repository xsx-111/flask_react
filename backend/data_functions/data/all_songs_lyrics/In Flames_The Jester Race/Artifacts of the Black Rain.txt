Artifacts of the Black Rain Lyrics
Stood there leaning to the city moon
Casting silhouettes tall to grip her white rooms
The black-clad voyeur in his black-clad masque
In the serpentine sun of tragedy basked

Stood there cursing at the soul-dead mass
With their fabled illusions, the vain dreams that passed
Splinters of a life rushing by in the whirl
Alone, silent warrior in a fantasy world

He cried for night
But night could not come
So, swept in the shroud
Of misanthropia he went away

And fed the empty galleries
With the artifacts of the black rain
Sunken into the shadows
With a dry, sardonic smile

He made the footprints a part of his heart
To rouse a sacred confrontation
Stood there carving on the monument to lies
Digging of the Earth, making friends with the soil
As the all-mother rises and bares her bleeding thighs
He disappears into her cold, icy womb1Embed
