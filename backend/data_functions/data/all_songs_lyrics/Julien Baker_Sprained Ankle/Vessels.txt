Vessels LyricsTell me in thin paper about your love
Breath like thick water lives in my lungs
My skin is full of black ink, in your white clothes
For so much I think, little I know
Pull off my armor, knees bruised and naked
Peel back my skin, call out my name
Vessel of brightness, come make me blind
This present darkness is swallowed by light
And my skeleton is a house for my eyes
Purchased with a bleeding side3Embed
