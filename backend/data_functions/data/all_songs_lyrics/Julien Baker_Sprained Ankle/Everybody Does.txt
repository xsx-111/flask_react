Everybody Does LyricsLet me pick through the empty dirt
And the rotten wood and the shoddy work
'Cause I'm interested
And our carpenter is so elegant
At placing splinters right beneath my nails
Where I cannot dig them out
But the same briars from your ribs
Are the tinder in my father's house
And I know
I know
I know
I know
I know myself better than anybody else
And you're gonna run
You're gonna run when you find out who I am
I know I'm a pile of filthy wreckage
You will wish you'd never touched
But you're gonna run when you find out who I am
Yeah, you're gonna run
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does
You're gonna run, it's alright, everybody does2Embed
