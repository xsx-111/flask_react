Blacktop LyricsDo you think that there's a way I could ever get too far
That you'd ask me where I'd been
Like I ask you where you are?
But I know you're in the pews
The same as stools around the bar
And I know I saw your hand
When I went out and wrapped my car
Streetlamp
Around the streetlamp
So I wrote you love letters
And sung them in my house
And all around the South
The broken strings and amplifiers scream with holy noise
In hopes to draw you out
But if no one sings along in praise
Are you still proud when I open my mouth?
Come visit me
Come visit me
In the back of an ambulance
A saline communion that I held like a séance on the blacktop
The devil in my arms says feed me to the wolves tonight
And come visit me
In the back of an ambulance
And a saline communion that I held like a séance2Embed
