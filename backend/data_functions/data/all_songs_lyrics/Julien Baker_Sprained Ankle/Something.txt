Something LyricsI know you're sleeping by now
But I'm still up walking around
The walls of my skull bend backwards
And in like a labyrinth
And I knew I was wasting my time
Keep myself awake at night
'Cause whenever I close my eyes
I'm chasing your tail lights
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
And I know you left hours ago
I still haven't moved yet
I knew you were gone months ago
But I can't think of anyone else
I should have said something, something, something
But I couldn't find something to say
So I just said nothing, nothing, nothing
Sat and watched you drive away
And I just let the parking lot swallow me up
Choking your tires, and kicking up dust
Asking aloud why you're leaving
But the pavement won't answer me
And I just let the silence swallow me up
The ring in my ears tastes like blood
Asking aloud why you're leaving
But the pavement won't answer me
And I know I meant nothing, nothing to you
But I thought I meant something, something, something
But I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
Sat and watched you drive away
Oh I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
No, I won't think of anyone else11Embed
