Rejoice LyricsAll of my friends live in a plastic bag
Walking around, jumping the train tracks
Over the fence, veins all black
Sleep on a bench in the park
On my birthday
Call the blue lights
Cursed your name
When I find I'm still awake
Give me everything good, and I'll throw it away
I wish I could quit but I can't stand the shakes
Choking to smoke, or singing your praise
But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice
And complain
I never know what to say
But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice
And complain
Lift my voice
That I was made
And somebody's listening at night
With the ghosts of my friends when I pray
Asking "Why did you let them leave
And then make me stay?"
Know my name
And all of my hideous mistakes
I rejoice
I rejoice
I rejoice
I rejoice15Embed
