Forever Dolphin Love LyricsFrom bleached waves that never change
From Dalston
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah ah ah
My dull steed, she has no hair
I’ll talk to her
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah ah ah
And Dun’s life, he’s turning heads
He talks to her
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah ah
From memories that never change
Of Dalston
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah ah ah
Oh Sunter, I loved her
She was to be my wife
Oh Sunter, I loved her
She was to be my wife
My wife, my wife
The backbeat, never change
In Dalston
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah ah ah ah
The beat way, they're never dark
Dalston
They're never back in place, ah ah ah
The beat way, they're never dark
In Boston
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah ah
From memories that never change
From Dalston
Forever Dolphin Love, ah ah ah6Embed
