Please Turn Me Into the Snat Lyrics
His master's name was Don
They shared a life in Rottenrun
Their lair was full of scales
Way beneath the fallen log

No fear, no love alive
If Don would call, the Snat would rise
No fear, no love alive
Between the two, their tears ran dry

Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again

A painting of his face
Placed there by the master Don
Reminds him of the tale
Of when he dies, the Snat lives on

No fear, no love alive
If Don would call, the Snat will rise
No fear, no love alive
Between the two, their tears ran dry
Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again
Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again
Father Manker, it's the Snat here
You've noticed that of course, my fangs are sharp like barbs
Father Manker, it's the Snat here
I'm asking now, with a voice like this, would you let me in?
Do you remember when the time it was
The perfect days, that's how it was
With my Snat suit on, with my Snat suit on
With my Snat suit on
Oh, when I retire
I hope the Snat suit fits me well
I want to be a hybrid with lovely memories
So, so politely I'll ask please

Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again
Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again
Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat again
Please turn me into the Snat
Please turn me into the Snat againEmbed
