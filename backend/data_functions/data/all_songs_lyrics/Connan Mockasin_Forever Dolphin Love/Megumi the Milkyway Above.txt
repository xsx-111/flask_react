Megumi the Milkyway Above Lyrics"Hello, Connan!"
It's interesting, we ought to know
Originally we all came from
A place to test the mist beyond
To Megumi the milkyway
Like sharks that wear the knife edge stone
To pull the fish to catch the wind
Forever be good, no love making it all
With Megumi the milkyway above
At three years old, the curly head
With teeth that grow before his hair
A spotty nose, he loves his voice
Unlike Megum has done instead
Leave the boy that traveled on
With neo-blossom and harnessed his boys
They came to stay and there they were
I don't believe in what we saw
Forever be afar from here
When we receive before too long
From scratching heads, the flame grows strong
With Megumi the milkyway above1Embed
