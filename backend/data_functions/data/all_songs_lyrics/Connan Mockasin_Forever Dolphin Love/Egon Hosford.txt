Egon Hosford Lyrics
Long but thin from the top his name is Egon
Friends him sound the most, that makes him lucky
We've heard it all before, it's Egon at the door
Feel like waking up inside a rubber
Sitting in a chair beside the fire
We've heard it all before, it's Egon at the door

Egon is jumpy
Egon is jumpy

Pushing down the minute that he heard you
Licking the balls until he's told he loves you
We've heard it all before, it's Egon at the door
Noone's ever found him, oh wherе's Egon?
Wandering down the hall, intriguing eyеs
We've heard it all before, it's Egon at the door

Egon is jumpy
Egon is jumpy
Egon is jumpy

King of comeback road until you hold on
Wears his crown inside his furry chest
We've heard it all before, it's Egon at the door
Listening for the call of me, his master
Thinks his master  rats
We've heard it all before, collects bread up with his paw
Egon is jumpy
Egon is jumpy
Egon is jumpy1Embed
