You & Me Lyrics
All I care for is you and me
Let the world sink into the sea
We'll roam while the city sleeps
For the river shall flood the streets

 of the door
Find it harder to breathe
All our friends are no more
And there's blood on the 

All I care for is you and me
Let the world sink into the sea
We'll roam while the city sleeps
For the river shall flood the streets

As the sun starts to fade
And their hearts start to freeze
Shadows form twisted shapes
We'll ignore all their screams

All I care for is you and me
Let the world sink into the sea
We'll roam while the city sleeps
For the river shall flood the streets
And we'll never turn 'round
Feel the heat of the globe
There's no stars, there's no sound
Into darkness we goEmbed
