Angry Lyrics
Now big respect in every aspect to one massive of all the crew
Remember there is only one rule in selectah
And it's The Bug
And this is Tippa Irie sayin' dis
A-ha!

Look on 
Boom!

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

When a ting go motion a ting go here
Have my people livin' in fear
Every country they interfere
Suicide bomber dem everywhere
And dem marching up our atmosphere
The ozone layer, dey know it gon' tear
The people in Africa should be livin' in fear
But it's funny the bus must not be goin' down here
So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and
I gotta say
So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and
I gotta say

Real offender but that might be
But di devil-devil dem, that's 
Twenty years, down a decade, now this
I'm a teacher with 'nuff apprentice
Well, I'm really fed up about my people, definitely 
 I am a teacher with 
Pay my dues all over again, leave me alone you're not my friend

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and

So many tings dat get mi angry and
So many tings dat get mi mad
So many tings dat get mi angry and
