Jah War Lyrics
Yo, no soundbwoy test
Right a'now it's da big Flowdan in effect
We have the Bug pon da set and we're coming in perfect

Dem boy get bun inna di revolution when the war has begun
Bugs, hand me mi-
Somebody life ah go done, dem can't see me come
Dem boy get up and run
Two double oh four, three, two, one
Venomous who? Venomous what? Tongue
Life who? Life what? Life ah go done
Bun, fire bun, fire bun, rah
Trust, when me draw for the venomous tongue
Some people get prang and people start run
Done tell a guy that fire ah go bun
Weh me say again, huh? Bun, fire bun
Ramp wit the real Flowdan? You must be dumb
Bulletproof vest and mi pump action
That type of flex, that type of tan
Jah Rastafari
 (x2)
Some bwoy haffi stop chat 'bout war
Him see  stamp outta di war
Say dem ah big man but they won't get far
Without Jah, dem nah reach far
War
You know my name and me know me love war
Run from anyone? We'll stand up and fight, war
Coulda fist fight, knife stab, any war
War, could a fist fight knife stab any war
Well if I want war, pass me the SLR
Load and cock that, buss it inna by Jah
Dress up inna black when man ah fight war
You know my name and me know me love war
Me nuh run from anyone, man ah roll with
Jah Rastafari, king and saviour
You nuh believe in Jah? Nobody's gonna save ya
Bun inna di revolution when the revolution come
You know you can't fight with gun
Knowledge, wisdom, weapon inna war
Bring di two of dem when you come inna di war, yeah
So what you reckon inna war?
Without Jah, you won't last a second in a war

And that's why they will burn
They couldn't listen and they couldn't learn
When it comes to di war
Your face could get scarred and wet up like a perm
That's not my concern
Man roll with Jah
 (x2)

How long will I live? When will I die?
Is there a heaven or was that a lie?
Let me tell you something: I don't really mind
Just as long as I'm here, I'll kill dat with style
Whether it's now or near future
Make sure you bury me with the shooter
Bulletproof vest and my silencer
When I go to the grave, I'll keep it gangsta
Six foot deep, coffin and wreath
Bun the devil and all ah kill dutty beast
Big war ah gwan between north and east
So watch your neck back, protect your head, please
Please, my yout, unnu try live clean
But do your own ting and smoke a lil' bit weed
Before your start smoke, separate your seed
Jah Rastafari bless you and me
 (x2)

Yeah
Stop chat 'bout war
If you don't know 'bout the meaning of war
You see Flowdan and The Bug?
We represent Jah
No guy test
