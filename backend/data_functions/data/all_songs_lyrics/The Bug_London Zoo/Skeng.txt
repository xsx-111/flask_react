Skeng Lyrics
Nuh badda king
And love is all I bring
I woulda kick you inna your face

Ooh, that could jump on it as well
Nuh badda king
Phenomenomenon One, Phenomenomenon One, Phenomenomenon One
Phenomenon One
This one dedicated to all badman
Whether you're from Manchester or London
Whether you're from North London or Brixton
Put up unnu hand
Phenomenon two
Sight Flowdan and Killaman a roll through
So What bruddas and mi Roll Deep crew
You don't wanna brush we or step pon we shoe
You know say a true
Phenomenon three, put in the ganja, tek out the seed
Fi all of me intelligent people
Pon di roadside, we a smoke weed
Yes indeed, that's what we need
Four, one time him talk and nah talk no more
Sight dem boy and we kick off them door
Kick off them door and mi run up with the .44
You don't wanna see the .44
Five, buss my gun and them nah stay alive
Tek way your son, I might tek way your wife
And you dun know say
Mi ah go still ah go stab with knife
Tell dem about phenomenon six
Dem walk with knife when we walk with sticks

Done some pricks with the M16
Tell dem bout phenomenon seven
How much gun mi buss fi di week? Seven
Man don't wan' get one outta di seven
'Cause you're only gonna get eleven

Mi and Killaman love roll inna car
Roll, roll, roll
Gun inna hand and mi nah walk with sword
Sword, sword, sword
Shot inna face like dart inna board
