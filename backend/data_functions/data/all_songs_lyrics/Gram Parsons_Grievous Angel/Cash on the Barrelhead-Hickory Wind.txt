Cash on the Barrelhead/Hickory Wind LyricsAll right
Oh, yeah
Got in a little trouble down at the county seat
Thrown to cook in the jail house for loitering on the street
When the judge heard the verdict, I was a guilty man
Said, forty-five dollars or thirty days in the can
Said, "That'll be cash on the barrelhead, son
You can take your choice, you're twenty-one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you 'cause I'm a busy man"
Forty days in the jail house, four days on the road
I was feeling mighty hungry, my feet a heavy load
Saw a greyhound coming, stuck up my thumb
Before I got to my seat, the driving caught my arm
Said, "That'll be cash on the barrelhead, son
This old gray dog gets paid to run
When the engine starts, and the wheels won't roll
Give me cash on the barrelhead, I'll take you down the road"
Said, "That'll be cash on the barrelhead, son
You can take your choice, you're twenty-one
No money down, no credit plan
No time to chase you 'cause I'm a busy man
No time to chase you 'cause I'm a busy man"
Yodel-aheo, yo-layhea, yodel-ahe
In South Carolina, there are many tall pines
I remember the oak tree that we used to climb
But now when I'm lonesome, I always pretend
That I'm gettin' the feel of hickory wind
I started out younger at most everything
All the riches and pleasures, what else could life bring?
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind
It's a hard to find out that trouble is real
In a far away city, with a far away feel
But it makes me feel better each time it begins
Callin' me home, hickory wind
Keeps callin' me home, hickory windEmbed
