Ooh Las Vegas Lyrics
Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck out of me

Well, the first time I lose I drink whiskey
Second time I lose I drink gin
Third time I lose I drink anything
'Cause I think I'm gonna win

Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me, no
Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck out of me

Well, the queen of spades is a friend of mine
The queen of hearts is a bitch
Someday when I clean up my mind
I'll find out which is which

Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck out of me

Well, I spend all night with the dealer
Tryin' to get ahead
Spend all day at the Holiday Inn
Trying to get out of bed

Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Ooh, Las Vegas, ain't no place for a poor boy like me
Every time I hit your crystal city
You know you're gonna make a wreck out of meEmbed
