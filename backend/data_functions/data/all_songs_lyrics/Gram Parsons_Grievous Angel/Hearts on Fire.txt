Hearts on Fire LyricsHearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
One short year our love had burned
Until at last I guess you learned
The art of being untrue and then goodbye
What could I do except to cry and moan
Lord, what have I done
Once we were as sweet and warm
As the golden morning sun
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
Bridge
Friends say it's just a game
And that no one is to blame
Go out forget her lies
But she'll be there and sparks will fly
My love has turned to hatred
Sleep escapes me still
God, please take this heart of mine
'cause if you don't the devil will
Hearts on fire
My love for you brought only misery
Hearts on fire
Put out the flames and set this cold heart free
Hearts on fireEmbed
