A New Season LyricsShaded crystal water
Bathed in by God's daughter
Sighing whispers near
A new season passes here
Sensory gifts to all who come
Soak up the stars and setting sun
It's strange and wilder, ageless bechilder
Saved by fire, touched and finer
Gray stands the tower in the distance
Days pass like warm sun on the face
A new season
Shared is the cure to conquer loneliness
It's strange and wilder, ageless bechilder
Saved by fire, touched and finer
Peaceful, blissful union is the priestess
Doubt flows the river into darknessEmbed
