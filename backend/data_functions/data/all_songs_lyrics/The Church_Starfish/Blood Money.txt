Blood Money LyricsBlind with dollars
Bought and sold
And you pay for everything in cold, hard cash
Better read through the fine print, you sift through the ash
In the hand
(Blood money)
In the sand
(Blood money)
She's worth the ransom
He says, "Do you accept my card
Or can I pay for it now in cold, hard cash?"
I'm priceless, you're worthless, but it's not a bad match
And I know you understand, it's blood money
There's such a big demand for blood money
A hundred and fifty grand, blood money
It's flowing under the land like blood money
He's worth the ransom
She says, "Why can't you get hot?"
Because you pay for this now in cold, hard cash
You make the front page, I'm gonna bring back the lash
Then I know you'll understand, it's blood money
There's such a big demand for blood money
It's one hundred and fifty grand, blood money
It's flowing under the land like blood moneyEmbed
