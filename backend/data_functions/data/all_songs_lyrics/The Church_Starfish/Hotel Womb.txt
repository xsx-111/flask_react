Hotel Womb LyricsVolcano pierce the air
Ashes block out the sun
Down in the lair, well, I met her there
With a price for everyone
I paid eighty dollars for this wedding ring
I couldn't take it off if I tried
And the cactus sure tastes strangely sweet
As it goes down inside
I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb
Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room
Sudden voltage in the night
With a rain forest girl
As we float downstream to the Amazon River
Where the black waters swirl
I say, why are you people wearing those masks?
I say, can we be reconciled?
She says the mother of the storm has to roam the sky
Searching for her child
I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb
Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room
I wish I'm back in my hotel womb
Slip through the crack to that wonderful room
Morning comes at last
And she's lying by my side
She's got the face of the widow who keeps following me
And the body of my bride
I say, why are those buildings swaying like trees?
I say, can we stop for a while?
She says, can't you hear the city that's hidden in there?
It's just another mile
I dream I'm safe in my hotel womb
Soft and soul-made, it's a wonderful room
I wish I'm back in my hotel womb
Slip through the crack to that wonderful room1Embed
