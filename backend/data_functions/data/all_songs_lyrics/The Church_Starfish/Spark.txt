Spark LyricsI'm saturated
Wet with your tears, you spill so easily
In reflection, I'll see you again
Approach me, soak me
Faith, faith, breathe
'Cause it's here, it's where the air is clear
Where far-off things could be quite near
No repairs are needed, just a spark
I'm interested
You've always been a subject that I could learn
Splendid hills, unconquerable mountains
Climb, don't ever turn back
Seed, seed, grow
'Cause it's here, it's where the air is clear
Where far-off things could be quite near
No repairs are needed, just a spark
I'm saturated
Wet with your tears, you spill so easily
In reflection, I'll see you again
Approach me, soak me
Faith, faith, breathe
'Cause it's here, it's where the air is clear
Where far-off things could be quite near
No repairs are needed, just a sparkEmbed
