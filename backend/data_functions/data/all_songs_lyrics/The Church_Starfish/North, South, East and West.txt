North, South, East and West LyricsA war's being waged and the world's just a stage
(In this city)
The real estate's prime, the number plates rhyme
(Liquidity)
Wear a gun and be proud, but bare breasts aren't allowed
(In this city)
Dream up a scam and then rake in the clams
(Liquidity)
(It's neither here nor there)
It's neither here nor there
North and south and east and west
(It has to be somewhere)
It ought to be somewhere
North and south and east and west
I take my payment, I catch my flight
And don't wait up for me tonight
(And you might find me there)
And you might find me there
North and south and east and west
Have a quick throw or host your own show
(In this city)
To a wolf from a lamb, for just half a gram
(Liquidity)
The face of today just a scalpel away, hey
Restore your lost soul for two dollars plus toll
(Liquidity)
Backs are patted when calves are fatted
(In this city)
The emperor's clothes are host for the proles
(Liquidity)
The guys with the brains are all bitter and vain
(Stupidity)
The guys with the luck got the bimbos and bucks
(Liquidity)
(It's neither here nor there)
It's neither here nor there
North and south and east and west
(It has to be somewhere)
It ought to be somewhere
North and south and east and west
I take my payment, I catch my flight
And don't wait up for me tonight
(And you might find me there)
And you might find me there
North and south and east and west
North, south, east, westEmbed
