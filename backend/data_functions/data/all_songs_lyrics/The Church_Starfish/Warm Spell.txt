Warm Spell LyricsEcho drenched inside reverb rain
Your festive summer you just couldn't blame
We became free into darkness then
Until the night silence distance froze

Our old house stands never empty
Our old house filled with strangers' pity
Well, I'd say I put it down to this warm spell
And I must admit I don't know you very well
Hear him laughing, his memory walks the garden
I say it's alright, I still believe in you
We pretend nothing ever changes
Shivering, we don't stay too long

In the back seat, awake and dizzy
Journey's over, it left me sleepy
Well, I'd say I put it down to this warm spell
And I must admit I don't know you very well
One hot night, solid air like blankets
My father's piano dreams of his son
His fingers tingle, anticipation
Down the hall we shudder back tonight
