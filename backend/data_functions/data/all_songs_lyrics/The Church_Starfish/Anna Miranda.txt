Anna Miranda LyricsAnna Miranda, I've been waiting here
On my verandah, southern hemisphere
All of the slow storms which blow the dust across the sky
Anna Miranda, I've been waiting here
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Anna Miranda, distance alters all our words
Time meanders, discord and music of the birds
All of the dark storms which drive the rain across my face
Anna Miranda, I've been waiting here
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Anna Miranda, well, it's serious
The salamanders are delirious
All of the black storms which shake the fruit down from the trees
Anna Miranda, yeah, it's serious
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Anna Miranda, I've been waiting here
On my verandah, almost seven years
All of the wild storms which cause the flowering buds to burst
Anna Miranda, I've been waiting here
Wish I knew what you were looking for
Might have known what you would findEmbed
