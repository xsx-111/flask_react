 Lyrics
I cannot walk
For my legs are broken
But I have to, have to find you

40 lakes I’d wade through
But my boat it was taken too
By who I cannot tell you
For they took my tongue too

All day, follow me
Come inside
Animal, animal, animal, animal
All day, follow me
Come inside
Animal, animal, animal

I set out toward it
But this damn door won’t open
Well then how to find you?

All day, follow me
Come inside
Animal, animal, animal, animal
All day, follow me
Come inside
Animal, animal, animal, animal
All day, follow me
Come inside
Animal, animal, animal, animal
All day, follow me
Come inside
Animal, animal, animal
I gave up walking
Took a blade to get it open
But now I think I, think I
Found youEmbed
