Nowhere LyricsDo you wanna go to a place I know
Where there’s no one around
And there’s no sorrow?
Oh, everybody goes but they won’t admit
‘Cause once you’ve been there, love
You can’t speak of it
Where all our worries
They never happen
No heaven, no hell
Where no one’s allowed
To stand or sit down
No lies, no hills
No hollows, no light
No shadows, no joy
No frowns, no up, no down
And all our worries
Oh, they never happen, they never, they never happen
No heaven, no hell
Do you, do you think of it, too?
Do you, darling?
Do you, do you think of it, too?
Do you, darling?
Do you, do you think of it, too?
Do you, darling?
Do you, do you think of it, too?
Do you, darling?
Well, if you wanna go
To that place I know
It’ll always be there
Yeah, it’s going nowhere1Embed
