Out Alee Lyrics
We went away on a Saturday
Oh, what a day, what a fantastic morning
Look out alee
There, there out alee
There out a’leaning
Thought I saw lightning
There in the middle of what a haze
Just a phase
Oh very oh so frightening
Where there’s a war
There, there is a war
There is a warning
Thought I saw lightning

Why am I hiding?
Get it off me
Get it in
And hold on
Or fall out

Are we in the middle of providence?
Innocence is in a sense oh so frightening
There is a war
There, there is a war
There is a warning
Thought I saw lightning
But where did it come from?
It’s not supposed to happen
O lord
No sign
No way out
Way out
Way out
Way out
Why am I hiding?
Why am I hiding?
Why am I hiding?
Why am I hiding?
Get it off me
And hold on
Or fall out

But where did it come from?
It’s not supposed to happen
O lord
No sign
No way out
Way out
Way out

Why am I hiding?
Why am I hiding?
Why am I hiding?
Why am I hiding?3Embed
