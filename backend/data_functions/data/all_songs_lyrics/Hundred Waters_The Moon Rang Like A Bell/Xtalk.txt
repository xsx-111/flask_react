Xtalk LyricsIt began in a conversation
No relation to you
Out of your mouth came flying
Terrifying! Full of
Hey now
Will you will you
Will you sit down?
Can I tell it to you?
Off with your crown love
Why now can’t I get some quiet?
I don’t know who you want me to be
But tomorrow I’m leaving
And I won’t do it kneeling
Do you have, do you have, do you have
Do you have time?
To lay around, around, around
And pick out all the folly in me?
Off with your crown love
Why can’t I get some quiet?
All that I want
And all that I need
Is not a thing to believe in
It’s not a thing for receiving
It’s just a little, a little relieving
All that I want  you to take from me
Is just my hand when I’m walking
Take my hand when I’m walking
Cause I don’t know who
It wants me to be
But tomorrow I’m leaving
Tomorrow I’m leaving
Cause I can’t and I won’t take this feeling
Quiet the ring
That’s ruining me
Cause with you I don’t hear it
With you I don’t fear it
With you I don’t even get near it
Yea when I’m with you
I don’t hear it at all
It’s just noise to me
It’s just bad electricity
It’s just, it’s just crosstalk
(Crosstalk… crosstalk… )
All that I want
And all that I need
Is not a thing to believe in
It’s not a thing for receiving
It’s just a little, a little relieving
So relieve me
Till I stop
