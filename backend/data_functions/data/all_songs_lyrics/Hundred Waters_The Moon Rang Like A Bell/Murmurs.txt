Murmurs Lyrics
I wish you, I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you would see what I see
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you I wish you
I wish you
I wish you would see what I see
Lead a lead a light of thee
You used to used to see
How you only only need
To blow them out

Yesterday was your birthday
Happy birthday
200 candles
A liar, a scandal
A fire through the roof
When I called you
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you ever alive?

Wish I would see what you see
Wish I would see what you see

Lead a lead a light of thee
You used to used to see
How you only only need
To blow them out
Lead a lead a light of thee
You used to used to see
How you only only need
To blow them out
Lead a lead a light of thee
You used to used to see
How you only only need
To blow them out

Silly silly silly me
I used to used to see
Now our only only light
Is blowing out12Embed
