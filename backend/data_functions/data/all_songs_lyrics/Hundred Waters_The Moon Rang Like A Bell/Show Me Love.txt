Show Me Love Lyrics
Don't let me show cruelty
Though I may make mistakes
Don't let me show ugliness
Though I know I can hate
And don't let me show evil
Though it might be all I take

Show me love
Show me love
Show me love

Don't let me think weakly
Though I know that I can break
Keep me away from apathy
While I am still awake
And don't let me think too long
Of the one I'm bound to face

Show me love
Show me love
Show me love12Embed
