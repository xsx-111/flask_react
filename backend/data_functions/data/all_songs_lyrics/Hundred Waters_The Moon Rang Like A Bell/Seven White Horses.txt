Seven White Horses LyricsSummer came in a flash of fire
Rolled out its swirling tongue round me
Will you wait, oh most impatiently?
I hear grace bellowing like me, just like me
Sometimes the sky feels empty
Sometimes I can’t find what’s right in front of me
And assume, assume is all I can do
Here they come, running in front of me
Seven white horses, seven galloping
They’re running, they’re running! Away from me
Sometimes this room is a blank space
Sometimes the walls just won’t stop shaking
What then?
I see white burning in their veins
I see great big gloves pulling on their reins
Like I’m in a stampede
Someone shake me from my sleep!
Cause when I talk to you, do you hear me? Do you hear me?
When I talk to you, are you listening? Could I be screaming?
When I talk to you, do you hear me?
Do you?2Embed
