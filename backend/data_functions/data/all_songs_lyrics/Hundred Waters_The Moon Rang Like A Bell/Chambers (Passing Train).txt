Chambers (Passing Train) Lyrics
To have and hold
As long as you let go
To have control
And want to yell
When all at once

So suddenly
You find it hard to breathe
From the window pane
On a passing train you only want to reach out

Every heartâ€™s a part of another
Every lung it yearns to yell
And every yell it longs for you
To let me love
O them all at once
