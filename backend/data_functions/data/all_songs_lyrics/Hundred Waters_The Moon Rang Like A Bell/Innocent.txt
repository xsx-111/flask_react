Innocent Lyrics
There was a light on… a light on inside… I saw it crawling
Looming, low ringing sigh
Its smooth skin
Sliding
O the line of illusion
Is so very loose (ain't it darlin’?)
Come lie here, say it's okay
There's nothing… no one… no real reason

But every other word's
A war inside
Legs are no good when
They're paralyzed
Always wondering
Always worrying
Innocent… innocent
Why do I worry if you're innocent?

O the roaring, the crash!
It's all very cruel (ain't it darlin'?)
Come lie here, say it's okay
There's nothing… no one… no one…
Say it's only in my head
Is it only in my head?
Is it only in my head?
