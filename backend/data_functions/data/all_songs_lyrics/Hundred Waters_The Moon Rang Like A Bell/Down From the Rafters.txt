Down From the Rafters Lyrics
I woke free
From something clutching me
Pulled its awful, leaden, cold, clammy body
Out away from me
And the light that came out, came out
Came out
But to survive, how can I?
I've wandered through water
Since the morning I heard you
You were half alive, but that mud inside
Is the same mud that makes me love you

Only after all the fog has long dissolved
Take a little pill, drown it out in laughter
Take a little pill, maybe think about it after
Cause every morning's like a climb from the rafters
Take a little pill, drown it out in laughter
Take a little pill, maybe think about it after
Think about it after
Delude
Dementia
Make it feel
Like I never met ya
Delude
Dementia
To make it feel
Like I never met ya
(Chorus)Embed
