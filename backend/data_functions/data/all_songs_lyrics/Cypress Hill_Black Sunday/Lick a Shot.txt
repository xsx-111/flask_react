Lick a Shot Lyrics
(Oh yeah it is!)
(Colour is not important)
Lick a shot!
(Oh!)
Comin' at ya
(Fire!)

Zippedy do da, zippedy hey
Cried "oh my", wanna get that punk with my AK
And get on the way
On a mission, puffin' on a fat ass J
Prude! You can't hang
Flash back on the skills when I used to bang
On the corner
I'll warn ya
Gonna roll on ya
Fool
Hit ya with a golden rule
Don't turn your back on the street
When I hit that corner, feel the concrete
If ya push that by like nothin'
Watch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden
Blastin' at these fools with a passion
Look at the Glock when it's time for some action
Let the gat hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hummm
Let the gat hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hummm

Sunday morning, wake up it's stormin'
Raindrops fallin' on my head it's pourin'
Cats and dogs, pigs in a wagon
Lookin' for the Afro, one that's saggin'
Scooby-Doo
An' fucked down too
Ploy me
Don't let your punk ass try me
Gonna take more
Then you better call your backup team and wait for the crew
I'm the one flippin' keepin' the clip on my hip, an' just watch your back if you're slippin'
Oooo
Where did that .22 come from
When the bullet passed through my lung
I've lost my breath I'm winded
I've been hit by a slug that wasn't intended
I hear thunder, I wonder
If a nigga like me's goin' under, take a number!
Let the gat hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hummm
Let the gat hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hummm

Had a bad dream, woke up in a casket
Now I can't even get back at the bastard
Bullshit!
This pine box ain't strong enough to contain the Afro 
Critical bell rings, snapped out the dream
What the fuck's up with the funny red beam
Pointin' at me? I got no strap G
What now? Gotta duck, they're gonna gat me
Bam, I feel numb
Where did the shotgun blast come from?

Let the gat hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hummm
Let the gat hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gat hummmEmbed
