Psycho LyricsNowhere to run, she's coming after me
No more places to hide, no way I can get free
I should've been long gone, century's ago
I can guarantee you this, somewhere she's watching me
No matter where I go, she won't let me be
No I'm crying for mercy, want to be left in peace
I only meant to be nice, now I'm running from this Psycho
I know I should have thought twice, honed by the Psycho
(Listen close), caught her the other night, she was looking through my window
She would never leave me alone, did I want her, hell no
Ohh please won't you help me, I just want to be able to breathe (let me breathe)
I only meant to be nice, now I'm running from this Psycho
I know I should have thought twice, caught up by this Psycho
Oh, won't you help me, I've been dancing with this Psycho
I should have listened to me friends, dancing with this Psycho
Yeah, somebody won't you please help me
Please somebody help me
Yeah, won't you help meEmbed
