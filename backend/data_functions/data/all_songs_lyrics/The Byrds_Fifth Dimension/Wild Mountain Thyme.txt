Wild Mountain Thyme Lyrics
Oh the summer time is coming and the leaves are sweetly turning
And the wild mountain thyme blooms across the purple heather
Will you go lassie go
If you will not go with me I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme all across the purple heather
Will you go lassie go

And we'll all go together to pull wild mountain thyme
All across the purple heather
Will you go lassie goEmbed
