Mr. Spaceman LyricsWoke up this morning with light in my eyes
And then realized it was still dark outside
It was a light comin' down from the sky
I don't know who or why
Must be those strangers that come every night
Whose saucers shaped lights put people up tight
Leave blue green footprints that glow in the dark
I hope they get home all right
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride
Woke up this mornin', I was feeling quite weird
Had flies in my beard, my toothpaste was smeared
Over my window, they'd written my name
Said: "So long, we'll see you again"
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a ride
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
I won't do anything wrong
Hey Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along
For a rideEmbed
