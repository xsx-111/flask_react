I See You Lyrics
I see you, under there behind your hair everywhere
I see you
I see you, turned on eyes can't tell lies, empathise
I see you
Warm sliding sun through the cave of your hair
Wind washing fields, kind of space living there
I see you
I know you, met before seventh floor, first world war
I know you
Who lives there, tell old fair I'm aware that she cares
Who lives there
Green specks bright spiralling out in the sky
Catch my mind, turn my head, have to look, don't know why
Who lives there
We thought talked
For a while they just smile just a silent thought talk
I see you, sun is there behind your hair everywhere
I see you, I see youEmbed
