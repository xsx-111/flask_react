Set the Twilight Reeling Lyrics
Take me for what I am
A star newly emerging
Long simmering explodes
Inside the self is reeling
In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood
In the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love
I accept the new found man
And I set the twilight reeling

At 5 a.m. the moon and the sun
Sit set before my window
Light glances off the blue glass we set
Right before the window
And you who accept, in your soul and your head
What was misunderstood, what was thought of with dread
A new self is born, the other self dead
I accept the new found man
And set the twilight reeling

A soul singer stands on the stage
The spotlight shows him sweating
He sinks to one knee, seems to cry
The horns are unrelenting
But as the drums beat he finds himself growing hard
In the microphone's face he sees her face growing large
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling
As the twilight sunburst gleams
As the chromium moon it sets
As I lose all my regrets
And set the twilight reeling
I accept the new found man
And set the twilight reelingEmbed
