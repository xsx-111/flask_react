Trade In LyricsI met a new me at 8 am, the other one got lost
This was not a trade in, although I wouldn't believe the cost
I woke up crying as we said goodbye
Me an my old self, each day he vanished more and more
As I became someone else
He actually was murdered I had taken him apart
But when I put him back together, I couldn't find his heart
It was resting underneath a chair, in a bed of bright tin foil
If I pulled back the flaps, I could still see it beat
I could still hear his voice uncoil, As I said :
I want a trade in, a 14th chance at this life
I've met a woman with a thousand faces
And I want to make her my wife
How could I have been so mistaken, how could I think that it was true
A child that is raised by an idiot, and that idiot then becomes you
How could I believe in a movie, how could I believe in a book
But most of all how could I listen to you, such an obvious schmuck
A life spent listening to assholes, it's funny but it's true
So get rid of them I said to myself
But first I'm getting rid of you
I want a trade in, a 14th chance at this life
I've met a woman with a thousand faces
And I want to make her my wife
Take me over to the window, my heart said to my head
Please set me on fire, so we can start again
I was so wrong that it's funny, and I can't apologize
But instead you can be everything that I'm not, the second that I die
Ooohhh, I want a trade in, the second chance at this life
I've met a woman with a thousand faces
And I want to make her my wife
Ha!
A 14th chance at this life, I want a trade in ...
... I said ... uuuhhh, 14th, 14th chance at this lifeEmbed
