Egg Cream LyricsWhen I was a young man, no bigger than this
A chocolate egg cream was not to be missed
Some U-Bet's Chocolate Syrup, seltzer water mixed with milk
You stir it up into a heady fro, tasted just like silk
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
Now you can go to Junior's, Dave's on Canal Street
And I think there's Ken's in Boston
There must be something in L.A
But Becky's on Kings Highway, was the egg cream of choice
And if you don't believe me, go ask any of the boys
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
The only good thing I remember about P.S. 92
Was the egg cream served at Becky's, it was a fearsome brew
For 50 cents you got a shot, choco bubbles up your nose
That made it easier to deal with knife fights
And kids pissing in the street
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
So the next time you're in Brooklyn, please say hello for me
At Totonno's for pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's
But mostly you go to Becky's, sit in a booth and say hello
And have two chocolate egg cream, one to stay and one to go
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream, ah
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg creamEmbed
