Sex With Your Parents (Motherfucker), Part II LyricsI was thinking of things that I hate to do
SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Things you do to me or I do to you, baby
SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Something fatter or uglier than Rush Rambo
Something more disgusting than Robert Dole
Something pink that climbs out of a hole
And there it was - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
I was getting so sick of this right-wing Republican shit
These ugly old man scared of young tit and dick
So I try to think of something that made me sick
And there it was - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Now these old fucks can steal all they want
And they can go and pass laws saying you can't say what you want
And you can't look at this and you can't look at that
And you can't smoke this and you can't snort that
And me baby - I got statistics - I got stats
These people have been to bed with their parents
Now I know you're shocked but hang and have a brew
If you think about it for a minute you know that it's true
They're ashamed and repelled and they don't know what to do
They've had sex with their parents
When they looked into their lovers eyes they saw - mom
In the name of the family values we must ask whose family
In the name of the family values we must ask - Senator
It's has been reported that you have had illegal congress with your mother - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Ah, Senator
An illegal congress by proxy is a pigeon by any other name - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Senators you polish a turd
Here in the big city we got a word
For those who would bed their beloved big bird
And make a mockery of our freedoms
Ah, without even using a condom
Without even saying "no"
By god we have a name for people like that
It's - hey motherfuckerEmbed
