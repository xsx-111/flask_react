You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb Lyrics
Life can be so fair
Let it go on and on
I can push for good
You got that cherry bomb

Blow out that cherry bomb for me
We lost it long ago
You and me

Now you know your way
Back from the spirit bar
Brush your teeth for bed
Blow out that cherry bomb

Blow out that cherry bomb for me
You got to know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve (Come on, come on)

It was the longest day that I'd ever known
I watched you start that drive alone
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
It's going to burn right up your sleeve
Burn right up your sleeve

So there you go again
Out in your dressing gown
Get yourself to bed
Blow out that cherry bomb

Oh, life could be so fair, let it go on and on
I could pay to that hand on your cherry bomb
Oh, life could be so fair, let it go on and on
I could pay to that hand on your cherry bomb2Embed
