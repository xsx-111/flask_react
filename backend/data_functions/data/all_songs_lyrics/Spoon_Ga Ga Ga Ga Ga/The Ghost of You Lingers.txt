The Ghost of You Lingers LyricsIf you were here
Would you calm me down?
You settled the score
The feelings I fight (all the strangers in town)
Burn so bright (would know if you were here)
The feelings I fight (would you ease my mind?)
Yeah (Come on!)
The sleep fled from my eyes
And I, I know that I need some
Give a thought to the one that you know
(Oh would you calm me down)
(When the dark gets shallow and fast)
(We put on the clinic)
If you were here (It felt good to me)
Would you calm me down (Can't see I'm losing it)
We settled the score (Must have set up the scene)
Put on a clinic (The man asleep knockup)
And now I need to write (I see it, they're all alive)
Oh, would you ease my mind?
Yeah
(The ghost of you lingers)
Put on a clinic till we hit the wall
(It lingers)
Just like a sailor with his wounds being salted
Come on
I had a nightmare nothing could be put back together
It's alright
It's alright
Would you settle the score?
If you were here
Would you calm me down?
The ghost of you lingers
And leaves
I always think about it
Oh, would you calm me down?2Embed
