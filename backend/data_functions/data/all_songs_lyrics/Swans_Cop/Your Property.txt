Your Property Lyrics
I give you money
You're superior
I don't exist
You control me
You're corrupt
You deform me
You deform me
You deform me

You own me, you own me
You own me, you own me
You own me, own me
Own me, own me
Own, own worship

I worship your authority
Your authority, your authority
Your authority, your authority
You're deformed
You're corrupt
I think you're better than I am
I don't exist
I worship, worship
Your authority
You own me, you own me
You own me, you own me
You own me, own me
Own me, own me
Own, own
Own, own
Own me, own me
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
Own, own
