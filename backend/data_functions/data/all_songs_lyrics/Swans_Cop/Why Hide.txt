Why Hide Lyrics
My heart pumps
My legs move
I sit down, I rot
I hide my stink
I follow directions
I know how to work
I keep my mouth shut
I know my place
I know my place
I hide my stink
I need you more
Than I hate myself
I need you more
Then I need myself
You hurt me
Then you hate yourself
You hurt me
And you hurt yourself
You hurt me
And you hurt yourself
You hurt me
And you need yourself
You need me
And you need yourself
You hurt me and
Why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide?
Oh, why?
Oh, why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide?
Oh, why?
Oh, why hide the lie?
The lie
The lie
Oh, why hide?
Oh, why?
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide
Oh, hide the lie
Why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide the lie?
Oh, why hide the stinkin' lie?
Oh, why?
Oh, why?1Embed
