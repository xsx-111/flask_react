Half Life Lyrics
Permission is bloodless
Ambition is senseless

Don't make a wrong move
Work with a purpose
Work with a purpose

You win or you lose
Imitate a slave

Don't make a wrong move
Learn from experience
Learn from experience

Don't be useless
Waste is obscene, waste is obscene, waste is obscene

Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong move
Don't make a wrong moveEmbed
