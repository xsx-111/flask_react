Clay Man Lyrics
Get into this car
Get into this car
Bow your head down
Your flesh is soft
Your flesh is clay

Your flesh is easy
Your flesh is easy
Your flesh is easy
Your flesh is easy to shape
To shape, to shape, to shape, to shape, to shape

Get into your cell
Get into your bed

Your flesh is easy
Your flesh is easy
Flesh is easy
Flesh is easy to shape
To shape, to shape, to shape, to shape, to shape
To shape, to shape, to shape
Now you're a clay man1Embed
