Job Lyrics
Cut off the arms
Cut off the legs
Cut off the head
Get rid of the body
Get rid of the body

Heartache to heartache
Heartache to heartache

Job to job
Dollar to dollar (Dollar to dollar)

Heartache to heartache
Heartache to heartache
Heartache to heartache
Heartache to heartache
Heartache to heartache

Body to body to body to body
To body to body to body to body
To body to body to body to body
To body to body to body to body
To body to body to body to body
To body
Pus, poison, blood, shit
Pus, poison, blood, shit
Heartache to heartache
Heartache to heartache
What a heart to heartache
What a heart to heartache
What a heartache
What a heartache
Heartache to heartache
What a heart to heartache
What a heartache
What a heartache
What a heartache
What a heart to heartache1Embed
