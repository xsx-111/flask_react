Thug Lyrics
The only real thing is misery
Submission means you get murdered
You get revenge when you wait for it
Frustrated means you're insane
He's a dead thing under the sheet
Causing pain
Sex turns impotence into decay
Unconscious repression degrades the real thing
Causing the pain
Causing the pain
You can't kill a criminal need
When you're polluted with fear you need comfort
You can't kill what you can't see
You can't think what you don't own
You can't rub out what you don't recognize
You don't get what you really deserve
You don't fight if you can't feel it
Obedience pays if you use it right
When you eat your pain you keep your nerves
You degrade yourself when you hide your fear

Use it right, use it right
Use it right or don't feel it
Use it right or don't feel it
Use it right or don't feel it
Use it right, use it right
Use it right, use it right
Ah, right, use it right
Use it right, use it right
Use it right2Embed
