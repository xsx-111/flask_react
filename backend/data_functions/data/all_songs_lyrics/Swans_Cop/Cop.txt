Cop Lyrics
The punishment fits the crime
Nothing beats mutilation
Humiliation's a disease
Nothing beats humiliation
Nothing beats them like a cop with a club
Nothing beats them like a cop in jail
Nothing beats their heads like a cop with a club
Nobody beats their heads in like a cop in a jail
Nobody hurts them like a cop with a club
Nothing beats them like a cop with a club
Nobody rapes them like a cop with his club
Nothing hurts them like a cop when he's done
Nobody beats him like a cop in jail
Nobody burns him like a cop with a match
Nobody burns their bodies like a cop in jail
Nobody burns their skin like a cop with a match
Nobody has as much fun as a cop
The heat hurts
Humiliation's a disease

Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurts
Heat hurts, hurts, hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurt, heat hurt
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Heat hurts, heat hurts
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt3Embed
