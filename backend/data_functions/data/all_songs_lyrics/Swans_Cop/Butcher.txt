Butcher Lyrics
You're too close
I don't recognize your smell
You're in the wrong skin
I don't recognize your face
Your mouth smells strange
Some people want to kill you
Some people want to fuck you

When you say the wrong word
When you do the wrong thing
You could be screwing yourself
You could be screwing yourself
You could be screwing yourself
You could be screwing yourself
When you act the wrong way
When you do the wrong thing
You could be screwing yourself

Don't be a whore, now
Don't be a whore, now
Don't be a whore, now
Don't be a whore, now
Don't be a whore, now
You could be screwing yourselfEmbed
