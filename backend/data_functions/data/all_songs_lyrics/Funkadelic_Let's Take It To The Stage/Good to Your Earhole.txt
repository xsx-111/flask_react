Good to Your Earhole Lyrics
I'm going to give you what you're here for
I've got the means to take you there
I'm not here to kill you softly
But I promise to be good to your earhole

Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet, Lord
Put your hands together, come on and get in beat
There's a good time waiting for you, come on and let's get free

Mashing your brain like silly putty
Leaving you in a better frame of mind
Drowning out the voices that bug you
But I promise to be good to your earhole

Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet, Lord
Put your hands together, come on and get in beat
There's a good time waiting for you, come on and let's get free

I'm not here to kill you softly
But I promise to be good to your earhole

Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet (Woo, ow)
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet, Lord
Put your hands together, come on and get in beat
There's a good time waiting for you, come on and let's get free (Ow)
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet, Lord
Put your hands together, come on and get in beat
There's a good time waiting for you, come on and let's get free
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet (Lord)
Put your hands together, come on and stomp your feet
Put your hands together, come on and get in beat
There's a good time waiting for you, come on and let's get freeEmbed
