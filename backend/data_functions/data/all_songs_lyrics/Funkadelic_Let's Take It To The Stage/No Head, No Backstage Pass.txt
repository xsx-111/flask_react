No Head, No Backstage Pass LyricsShe said I know the drummer, can you let me in?
Tell the guitar player I brought a friend
Ask the roadies do they need a hand
Tell the manager there's a girl named Jan
The doorman said: "No head no backstage pass" (x6)
Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin
If you ain't giving head, you ain't getting in
The doorman said: "No head no backstage pass" (x4)
I'm a friend of the drummer can you let me in
Ow-woo, ow-woo, a yabba-yabba yabba-yabba awoo
She said I know the drummer, can you let me in?
Tell the guitar player I brought a friend
Ask the roadies do they need a hand
Tell the manager there's a girl named Jan1Embed
