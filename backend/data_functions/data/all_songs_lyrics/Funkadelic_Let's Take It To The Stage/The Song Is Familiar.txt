The Song Is Familiar LyricsThere is a song that I sing whenever I'm sad, feeling bad
There is a place in my head that I go when I'm feeling low
I can trust in the melody, in this song I can find me
Ever since I lost you, I've been so lost too
In our love there is harmony, and I want to see this love through with you
There is a song you can sing
When the love you had is love gone bad
There is a place you can go
There's a quiet place...all you gotta do is space
There is a song that I sing whenever I'm sad, feeling bad
There is a place in my head that I go, when I'm feeling low
To my song I can relate and I don't got to syncopate
Every word is in time, on time, at all times
In our love there is harmony, and I want to see this love through with you
There is a song you can sing whenever you're sad, feeling bad
There is a quiet place, you can go, when you're feeling low
There is a song you can sing
When the love you had is love gone bad
There is a place you can go
There's a quiet place...all you gotta do is space
There is a song that I sing whenever I'm sad, feeling bad
There is a place in my head that I go, when I'm feeling low
