U-Turn LyricsTurn your truck around boy
Y'ain't got enough gas to get up the hill
Turn your truck around boy
Y'ain't got enough gas to get up the hill
You should make a u-turn fo' you get yourself killed
Take the bus, leave yo' wheels
Free your mind, leave yo' wheels
Trade in all the rules son
Margarita & Jack take a shot at the wheel
You think you own the road son
Got your radio blarin' & yo' vision ain't clear
Gonna shake a few bones, gonna bend some steel
Smile in style, leave yo' wheels
Ride your high, leave yo' wheels
Take your time, decide son
You can riddle the road or be the daddy of her dreams
You got the reaper on his knees
Make the first the last, gonna finish right here
Gonna make a u-turn 'forr you get yourself killed
Gonna fill up the tank, gonna get up the hill
Free yo' mind, leave yo' wheels
Ride your high, leave yo' wheels
Or you're gonna have a bang-up timeEmbed
