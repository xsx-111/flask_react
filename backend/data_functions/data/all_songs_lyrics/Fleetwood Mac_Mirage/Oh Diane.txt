Oh Diane Lyrics
Oh no
Here I go
Again
Falling
In love
Again

Love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slipping through your hands
Oh, oh, whoa

Whoa, oh, Diane
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

Will I love you
I will
Always
Will you stand
By me
Always
Cause love is like a grain of sand
Slowly slipping through your hand
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, oh, Diane
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

Talking 'bout Diane
Mmm mmm (Diane)
Whoa, oh, Diane
(Diane)

1:38 - 1:51

Whoa, oh, Diane
Oh, whoa, oh, Diane
Ooo, (Diane)

Talking 'bout Diane
Mmm ooo (Diane)
Whoa, oh, Diane
Oh ohh ooh (Diane)Embed
