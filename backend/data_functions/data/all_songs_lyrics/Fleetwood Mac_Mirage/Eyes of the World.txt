Eyes of the World LyricsTellin' you people, tell you no lie
My heart was breakin', I'll tell you why
Back and forth, lies unfurl
In the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes of the world
(Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes)
Mondays children are filled with face
Tuesday's children are filled with grace
Back and forth, lies unfurl
In the eyes, in the eyes, in the eyes of the world
(Eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes)Embed
