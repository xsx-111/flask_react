Cool Water LyricsAll day I face barren waste
Without the taste of water
Cool Water
Poor Dan and I
We crossed the dry
And so I cried
Cool water
Cool clear water
Keep moving Dan
Don't you listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan don't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
Shadows sway
They seem to say
Tonight we'll pray for water
Cool water
Way up there
You hear a prayer
And show us where there's water
Cool clear water
Keep moving Dan
Don't you listen to him Dan
He's a devil not a man
And he spreads the burning sand with water
Dan don't you see that big green tree
Where the water's runnin' free
And it's waiting there for me and you
All day I face the baron ways
Without the taste of water
Cool clear water
Cool clear waterEmbed
