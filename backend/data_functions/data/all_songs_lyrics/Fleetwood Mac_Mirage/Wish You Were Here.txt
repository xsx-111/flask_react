Wish You Were Here Lyrics
There's distance between us
And you're on my mind
As I lay here in the darkness
I can find no peace inside

I wish you were here holding me tight
If I had you near, you'd make it alright
I wish you were here
Because I feel like a child tonight

There's rain on my window
And I can count the drops
But I can't help feeling lonely
There's no way, no way that I could stop


Each moment is a memory
Time's so unkind
Every hour filled with an emptiness
I can't hide


Wish you were here3Embed
