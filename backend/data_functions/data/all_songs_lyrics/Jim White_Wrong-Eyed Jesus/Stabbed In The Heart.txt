Stabbed In The Heart LyricsUpon awakening I find myself
Lying in some woods
And for the longest time I've sat here
Just trying to remember why
I feel like I am floating
Why blood is running down my shirt
Then my memory returns to me
As the pain comes flooding;
Into my heart
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
Left me here to die
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
And I know why
I hear the sound of distant footsteps
And I know that she is running
From that past which will pursue her
Until the day that she dies
'Cause I know about her family
And their crimes upon her body
So I guess it wasn't me at all
That she was trying to kill
When she drove that knife
Into my heart
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
Left me here to die
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
Really came as no surprise
Over the hill there is a highway
Now I hear a truck is stopping
She's flagged somebody down
And asked 'em for a ride
And I would try to follow her
But I don't seem to be able
To lift this heavy body anymore
As the light fails
And the darkness falls
Into my heart
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
Left me here to die
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
So now I'll just, I'll just close my eyes
Close my eyes as the darkness falls
Into my heart
My baby she stabbed me in my heart
Into my heart
I'm falling, I'm falling, I'm fallingEmbed
