Still Waters Lyrics
Well I was shacked up down in Mobile with a girl from New York City
She woke me up one night to tell me that we weren't alone
She said she saw the ghost of a woman staring at me
I told her not to worry, but in the morning when I woke up, she was gone
So I headed on to Florida where I tangled with some sailors
And as I laid bloody on the wharf I cursed the ship they sailed on
Wouldn't you know it, twenty-four hours later that ship sank into the ocean
Disappearing like an unwanted memory beneath the waves

I guess it's 'cause
Still waters run, run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
Crazy way I'm swimming in still waters

I was woke up just before dawn by an old man crying in the rain
He was drunk and he was lonely and as he passed by he sang a hymn
And as I lay there listening, well, I almost joined him in that song
But instead I just held my peace and waited 'til that old man moved along
Then later on that day about a quarter mile out of town
I found his body hanging in a grove of pines, swaying in the wind
And as he swang that rope sang another hymn to Jesus
And this time though I don't know why I somehow felt inclined to sing along
I guess it's 'cause
Still waters run, run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
Crazy way I'm swimming in still waters

Don't you know there's projects for the dead, and there are projects for the living
Though I must confess sometimes I get confused by that distinction
And I just throw myself into the arms of that which would betray me
I guess to see how far Providence will stoop down just to save me

And it's all because
Still waters run, run deep in me
'Cause I got this crazy way
Crazy way I'm swimming in still watersEmbed
