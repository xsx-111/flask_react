Angel Land LyricsI cannot be superman no more
I cannot walk upon the high wire in my mind
And now that I understand the extent of my mortal coil
Suddenly and somehow I have lost all my desire
To shine, to shine like the sun
To shine, to shine like the sun
On a sunny day in Angel Land
And I guess sometimes you find that the river just runs dry
And you've got to get up out of the boat and walk
And I suppose you might try to find another river
But sometimes, sometimes it's just too hard
To hard to shine, to shine like the sun
To shine, to shine like the sun
On a sunny day, in Angel Land
Mostly now these days I'm dreaming normal dreams
Little things like who I spoke to, or what I did today
I have not written a speech for God to say in years
'Scuse me if I leave that undertaking up to those who say
Who say the wanna shine, to shine like the sun
To shine, a shine like the sun
On a sunny day, in Angel Land
