Sleepy-Town LyricsI whisper beautiful secrets into
The drainpipes at night
For the old folks while they're sleeping
Something to help them with their dreams
I climb the wall to the cemetery
Lay down on the grave of my father
I hear him asking me for forgiveness
So I close my eyes in prayer
And then a rainy-rainy-rain falls down
A cool rainy-rain upon my head
It makes the river overflow it's banks
And wash my cares away to Sleepy-town
I pour whiskey in the honeycomb
It makes the bees all turn to angels
I watch 'em fly off into heaven
Disappear where I can't follow
And I would write Jesus a letter
But I hear that he don't speak English...
So instead I'll just throw these cobblestones Until I ring that old church bell
Until the rainy-rainy-rain fall down
Cool rainy-rain upon my head
It makes the river overflow it's banks
And wash my cares away to Sleepy-town
In Sleepy-town, you let the wild wind blow away your name
In Sleepy town, you let the healing rain just wash your pain away
I see a light on in the station
Yeah someone is waiting for a train
And I envy them their leaving
As I turn to head back home again
For soon the morning sun will rise
And this little town will open up its eyes..
And return from the land where I've never been
From a Sleepy-town, that's free
From all that rainy-rainy-rain fall down
The cool rainy-rain upon my head
Make the river overflow it's banks
And wash my cares away to Sleepy-townEmbed
