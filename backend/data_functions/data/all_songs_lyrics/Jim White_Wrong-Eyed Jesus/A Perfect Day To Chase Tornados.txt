A Perfect Day To Chase Tornados LyricsWay down south I know a girl who is blind
She walks alone along a lonely highway each day
She dreams that one day a man will pull up in a car
He'll open up the door, she'll climb in and he will say:
"Hey babe, whatcha know? Hope you're ready to go
'Cause today's a perfect day to chase tornados."
Yeah when the wild wind whips around your head you know, that you have found a perfect day to chase tornados
And what about that preacher man on the run from the law?
He killed a girl in Memphis and ran 'till the dogs tracked him down
They shot him by the river and as he lay dying in the mud
Well someone asked him, "Hey, Preacher, where's your soul going now?"
And Preacher said, "Well, I do not know, but wherever it is I'll gladly go...
'Cause today's a perfect day to chase tornados."
Yeah when the wild wind kicks around your head you know, that you have found a perfect day to chase tornados
Sometimes I think that the sky is a prison and the earth is a grave
And sometimes I feel like Jesus, in some Chinese opera
And sometimes I'm glad I built my mansion from crazy little stones
But sometimes I feel so goddamned trapped by everything that I know
And I wish it wasn't so, cause the only thing that anyone should ever know
Is that today's a perfect day to chase tornados
Yeah, when the wild wind whips around your head you know
That you have found a perfect day to chase tornadosEmbed
