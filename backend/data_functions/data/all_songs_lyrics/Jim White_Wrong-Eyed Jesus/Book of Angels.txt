Book of Angels LyricsBig ole car moving fast
Watch the world go speeding by
Little wheels inside my brain
God I wonder where I'm going
Where you going? Need a ride?
We got time to see a movie
It's all right, it's okay
I can tell you my big secret:
Sho' is cool. Sho' is cool
I'm like a mad tap dancing fool
I got my car, and I got my dreams
But won't you help me
Help me write my Book of Angels
Book of Angels
And it's a gloomy ole house in a spooky town
You make that light, better just keep rolling
Higher still, climb the mountain
'Course what you'll find there
You can't be certain
'Cause when you're free, well you're just free
And ain't that scary, ain't that wild?
And don't you feel, feel just like
Like chucking freedom out the window?
Sho' is cool. Sho' is real
I dance just as good as I feel
Feel just like a hurricane, say my name
Help me write my Book of Angels
Book of Angels
I'm counting trees, I'm counting miles
I count the distance between your smiles
Give me something to hold onto; no, not that
I don't want to
And if you drive, drive your car fast
And hard a million miles
Well you might finally find yourself alone
Way out there on the highway
Sho' is cool. Sho' is wild
Once I was a little baby (child)
But I lost my car, and I lost my dreams
So won't you help me
Help me write my Book of Angels
