Heaven Of My Heart LyricsRadio song, playing in the car, don't even know where we are
Don't know the time of day or the color of the clothes I'm wearing
Would you look at that sky, pretty little stars twinkling far above in heaven
Sorta makes me feel like dancing, right here in the moonlight
But this little girl, well she's so shy
She won't even look up, into the sky
At the shiny stars, guiding stars pointing the way to the heaven of my heart
Guiding stars pointing the way to the heaven of my, the heaven of my heart
Got a funny-bone, laugh like a mule, always did pretty good in school
But still I cannot decipher her arithmetic
'Cause I'd walk to the moon, I'd lick a spittoon
I'd wear wooly underwear in a sauna
Just to show her how much I want to be her lovable lunatic
But she's so demure, that it's no surprise
When I tell her I love her, well she just closes her eyes
To the shiny stars, guiding stars pointing the way to the heaven of my heart
Guiding stars pointing the way to the heaven of my, the heaven of my heart
Yes she's a brainy girl, that is good
She's smarter than me but then so is wood
But that don't mean I should submit to her authority
'Cause I want to make her laugh
I want to make her sing
But she won't do a doggone thing, and don'tcha know
When she don't it makes her even more adorable
I guess that's why, it's the way she fights me
It makes them stars burn extra brightly
Them shiny stars, guiding star pointing the way to the heaven of my heart
Guiding stars pointing the way to the heaven of my heartEmbed
