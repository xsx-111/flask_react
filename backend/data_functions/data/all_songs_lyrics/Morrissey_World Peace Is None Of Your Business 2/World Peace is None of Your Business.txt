World Peace is None of Your Business LyricsWorld peace is none of your business
You must not tamper with arrangements
Work hard and sweetly pay your taxes
Never asking "what for?"
Ooh, you poor little fool
Oh, you fool
World peace is none of your business
Police will stun you with their stun-guns
Or they’ll disable you with tasers
That’s what government’s for
Ooh, you poor little fool
Oh, you fool
World peace is none of your business
So would you kindly keep your nose out
The rich must profit and get richer
And the poor must stay poor
Ooh, you poor little fool
Oh, you fool
Each time you vote
You support the process
Each time you vote
You support the process
Each time you vote
You support the process
Brazil and Bahrain
Egypt, Ukraine
So many people in pain
No more "you poor little fool"
No more "you fool."3Embed
