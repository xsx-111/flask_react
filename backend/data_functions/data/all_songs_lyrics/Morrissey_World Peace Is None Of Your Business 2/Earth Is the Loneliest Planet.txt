Earth Is the Loneliest Planet LyricsEarth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Day after day you say "one day"
Day after day you say "one day"
But you're in the wrong place
And you've got the wrong face
And humans are not really very humane
And Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Live with aloneness that no one else knows
Time after time you say "next time"
Time after time you say "next time"
But you fail as a woman
And you lose as a man
(We do what we can)
And Earth is the cruelest place that you will never understand
But you're in the wrong skin
And the skin that you're in says
"Urgh, let it begin"
And Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Earth is the loneliest planet of all
Day after day you say "one day"
Day after day you say "one day"
But there’s always a reason why you’re refused
They always blame you, you, you
And there is nothing anyone can doEmbed
