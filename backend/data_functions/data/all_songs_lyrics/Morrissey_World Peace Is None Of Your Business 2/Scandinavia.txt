Scandinavia LyricsI was bored in a fjord
And I curse the heart and soul
Of Scandinavia
Let the people burn
Let their children cry and die
In blind asylums
But then you came along
And you held out your hand
And I fell in love with you
And Scandinavia
I kiss the soil
I hug the soil
I eat the soil
And I praise the God who made you
Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia
Unprotesting I'll die in Scandinavia
Pinned to a crime in Trondheim
I despise each syllable In Scandinavia
Let the people burn
Let their children cry and die
In blind asylums
But then you came along
And you held out your hand
And I fell in love with you
And Scandinavia
I kiss the soil
I hug the soil
I eat the soil
And I praise the God who made you
Stab me in your own time in Scandinavia
Unprotesting I'll die in ScandinaviaEmbed
