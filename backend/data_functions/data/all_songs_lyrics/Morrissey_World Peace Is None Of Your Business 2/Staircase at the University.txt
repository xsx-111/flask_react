Staircase at the University LyricsMarch, April, May
She crammed night and day
I hadn't seen her smile in a while
March, April, May
She crammed night and day
I hadn't seen her smile in a while
Staircase at the university
She threw herself down
And her head split three ways
"If you don't get three A's"
Her sweet daddy said
"You're no child of mine
And as far as I'm concerned, you're dead"
"If you don't get three A's"
Her sweet daddy said
"You're no child of mine
And as far as I'm concerned, you're dead"
Staircase at the university
She threw herself down
And her head split three ways

"If you don't get three A's"
Her lovely boyfriend said
"Your shame is sure to stain
The family name"
"If you don't get three A's"
Her lovely boyfriend said
"Your shame is sure to stain
The family name"
Staircase at the university
She threw herself down
And her head split three ways
Cramming, slam in
Pack 'em in, ramming
Choc-a-bloc books
Power study, polish up
And if it breaks your heart
Then don't come running to me
Cramming, slam in
Pack 'em in, ramming
Choc-a-bloc books
Power study, polish up
And if it breaks your legs
Then don't come running to meEmbed
