Do You Read Me LyricsDo you read me, well won't you tell me?
If you read me, then please believe me, when I say
Yes I've been waiting, seems like forever
I've been waiting, my situation ain't got much better
Well I've been waiting, the situation don't get much better
You don't do unto others as you do unto me
Well, why am I the only one that treats you this way?
Well, you got that something and it's hard to specify
I can't diagnose that look in your eyes
You don't do unto me, like I know you could
Why am I the only one who's misunderstood?
Ashes to ashes, and it's dust to dust
Well, if you won't take me then I guess the devil must
I've been hurting, my hearts been burning
I've been hurting, but I've been learning, just the same
Well, I've been waiting, seems like forever
While I've been waiting
My situation ain't got much better
While I've been waiting
The situation ain't got much better
I've been waiting
The situation don't get much betterEmbed
