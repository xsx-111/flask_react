Edged In Blue LyricsI've cried enough tears to fill up an ocean
Surely you see that my world's been broken?
Here I am, where are you?
Help me please, pull me through
Here I am, where are you?
All my days are edged in blue
You made up your mind and nothing can change it
You want to be free but I can't rearrange it
Here I am, where are you?
Tell me please, what to do
Here I am, broken into
All my days are edged in blue
I'd go anywhere, if I thought you'd be there
'Cos I've made up my mind that's where I belong
I've traveled the world 'cos I couldn't be told
Told by my heart that you really had gone
I'd go anywhere, if I thought you'd be there
'Cos I've made up my mind that's where I belong
I've traveled the world 'cos I couldn't be told
Told by my heart that you really had gone
Yeah...
Our lines got crossed through all things unspoken
A tangle of knots not easily opened
Here I am, where are you?
Help me please, pull me through
Here I am, where are you?
All my days are edged in blue
Here I am, where are you?
Help me please, pull me through
Here I am, where are you?
Can't you see I'm edged in blue
Ohhh...
Ohhh...Embed
