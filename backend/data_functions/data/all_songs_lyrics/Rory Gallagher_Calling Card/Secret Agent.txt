Secret Agent LyricsMy baby`s got a secret agent
To watch me like a hawk
Well, my baby`s got a secret agent
To watch me like a hawk
He knows each time I leave my house
He knows each time I move around
Ow...
Secret agent, won`t you please take my advice?
Secret agent, secret agent
Won`t you please heed my advice?
You crossed me once, don`t cross me twice
I`m gonna cut you down to size
I`ll make that man
Turn in his badge in the morning
I slip around
But I`m too quick to catch in the morning
I`ll make that man turn in his badge
I`ll slip around him, I`m too quick to catch
No jealous woman is gonna keep tabs on me
Well, she`s got that secret agent
And he`s breathing down my spine
Yea, she`s got that secret agent
And he`s breathing down my spine
He must like working overtime
I think I`m always hard to find
Oh, secret agent, secret agent
Gonna have a showdown before long
Won`t you listen, secret agent
We`re gonna have a showdown before long
I know you pack a forty-four
I hope you know just what it`s for
I know you pack a forty-four
I hope you know just what it`s for
Just keep your shadow from my door
Oww...Embed
