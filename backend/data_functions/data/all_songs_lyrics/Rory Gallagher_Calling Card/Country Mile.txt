Country Mile LyricsWell I was born on the side of a road
A gap in the hedge
Did you hear what I said?
Born in a house with no slates
But I wouldn't switch
I didn't have a stitch
Always been out on a limb
I've been hard to mend
Like a kick in the shins
You'll only see me smile
When I eat up a country mile
Born on the green light, a mission to move
Something to prove, an itch in my shoes
I heard then wail of a train
From a burnin' stack and I jumped on the back
Well the engineer threw the switch
And it got to my brain, I've never been the same
You'll only see me smile
When I eat up a country mile
Gotta make tracks, gotta raise the dust
Grease my heels
Out race the bus
Don't blink your eyes
Or you won't see me again
Born a spoke of the wheel
Not a part of the set and I'm running yet
I ran before I could walk
The price of the fare was hardly ever there
Saw an eight wheeler move
And I couldn't choose
I just had to cruise
You'll only see me smile
When I eat up a country mile
Well I was born on the side of a road
A gap in the hedge
Did you hear what I said
Born in a house with no slates
But I wouldn't switch
I didn't have a stitch
Always been out on a limb
I've been hard to mend
Like a kick in the shins
You'll only see me smile
When I eat up a country mile
Gotta make tracks, gotta raise the dust
Grease my heels
Out race the bus
Don't blink your eyes
Or you won't see me againEmbed
