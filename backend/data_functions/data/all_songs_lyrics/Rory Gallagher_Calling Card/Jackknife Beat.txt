Jackknife Beat LyricsShake it baby, before it shakes you
Get it baby and let it take you
Where you want it to
Don't you maybe
That just won't do
You say I'm crazy
But this music's got me feelin' good
I know it's fever
I don't need a cure
You're the doctor
I'm your patient that's for sure
I'm your patient that's for sure
Hear it baby
Sneaking on through
You'll know it baby
When that music gets inside your shoes
It's too late baby, what do you do
Hear it baby
Hear it baby
Sneaking on through
You'll know it baby
When that music gets inside your shoes
You know it's creeping up on you
Scat
We got that Jackknife beat
A killer of a back beat
Sounds like an ice truck
Rolling down a back street
Yeah, we got the whole thing going like a pneumatic drill
The guitar man's playing like he's fit to kill, oh yeah
We got that Jackknife beat
A killer of a back beat
Siphon off the syrup
Let it take a back seat
What's cooking in the kitchen has boiled to the brim
What's brewing in the basement
Is bound to over spill, oh yeah
Shake it baby, before it shakes you
Get it baby and let it take you
Where you want it to
Don't you maybe
That just won't do
You say I'm crazy
But this music's got me feelin' good
Got a fever
I don't need a cure
You're the doctor
I'm your patient that's for sure
I'm your patient that's for sureEmbed
