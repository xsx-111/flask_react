Rue The Day LyricsYou seemed to be like a real good idea
At the time, at the time
You lifted me up to some higher ground
Then you knocked me down on the ground
But I rue that day like I don't know how
You picked me up right out of the tide
My eyes weren't open wide
I was blind
But I see much better, much better now
Well, I roll with the punches, I sway with the curves
I walked on a tightrope, didn't lose my nerve
Stayed on the canvas, couldn't count me out
Never threw in the towel, yeah, I saw the fight out and how
All fifty rounds
Well, I roll with the punches, I sway with the curves
I walked on a tightrope, didn't lose my nerve
Stayed on the canvas, couldn't count me out
Never threw in the towel, yeah, I saw the fight out and how
You lifted me up to some higher ground
Then you knocked me down on the ground
You lifted me up right out of the tide
My eyes weren't open wide
I was blind
But I see much better, much better now
You seemed to be like a real good idea
At the time, don't know why
But I rue that day like I don't know how
I rue that day as of now
I rue that day like I don't know howEmbed
