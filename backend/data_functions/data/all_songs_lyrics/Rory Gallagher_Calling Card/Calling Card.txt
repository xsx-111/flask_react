Calling Card LyricsWell the rain ain't fussy 'bout where it lands
It'll find you hiding no matter where you stand
It's gonna rain brother and it's gonna rain hard
When the blues comes calling with his calling card
It ain't too funny when you'd rather die
Ain't no pleasure when that girl don't reply
To your lovesick letter that you wrote in tears
About feeling so bad for a million years
Watch out brother, be alert
Whatever you do, don't show that hurt, don't show that hurt
It ain't so funny when you'd rather die
Ain't no pleasure when that girl don't reply
To your love-sick letter that you wrote in tears
About feeling so bad for a million years
I've been so subjected, I've been so distresses
Come back baby, to clean up this mess, clean up this mess
It ain't too funny when you'd rather die
Ain't no pleasure when that girl don't reply
To your lovesick letter that you wrote in tears
About feeling so bad for a million years
Well the rain ain't fussy 'bout where it falls
It rains on one just like it rains on all
But when it falls brother, it's gonna rain hard
When the blues come calling with his calling card
Watch out brother, be alert
Whatever you do, don't show that hurt, don't show that hurtEmbed
