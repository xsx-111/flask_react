Barley & Grape Rag LyricsWell I don't care if I get arrested
'Cos tonight they'll need more than a ball and chain
I don't care who's interested
I'm coming into town just the same
I've been so alone, I've been feeling blue
I think I need a little drink or two
Be my friend, tell me where the place is
Where the whiskey flows and the dices roll till dawn?
My baby's done me wrong you must have guessed it
My heart's so low I think it must be told
That I don't wanna know where east or west is
'Cos pretty soon I won't feel the cold
When I'm walking down mainstreet, feeling no pain
Along comes a cop, he can take my name
And explain to me what a federal case is
I'm mixing the barley with the grape again
Bright city lights, make me feel alright
I'm right or wrong and tomorrow never comes
I don't care if I get investigated
And the city fathers they all black my name
I'm pretty sure that you can smell the traces
For tomorrow morning, I'll take all the blame
I've been feeling bad and feeling blue
I think I need a little whiskey or two
God, brother, you look like you could do with it too
(That's true)
Tonight I'll sleep on a walking-cane
Bright city lights, make me feel alright
I'm right or wrong and tomorrow never comes
I don't care if I get arrested
Cause tonight they'll need more than a ball and chain
I don't care who's interested
I'm coming into town just the same
I've been feeling alone and I've been feeling blue
I think I need a little drink or two
Hey, be my friend, tell me where the place is
Where the whiskey flows and the dices roll till dawnEmbed
