Let the Flames Begin Lyrics
What a shame we all became
Such fragile, broken things
A memory remains
Just a tiny spark
I give it all my oxygen
To let the flames begin
So let the flames begin
Oh, glory
Oh, glory

This is how we’ll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is what we’ll be, oh, glory

Somewhere weakness is our strength
And I'll die searching for it
I can't let myself regret
Such selfishness
My pain and oh, the trouble caused
No matter how long
I believe that there's hope
Buried beneath it all and
Hiding beneath it all and
Growing beneath it all and
This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing, oh
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory

Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)
Reaching as I sink down into light (Into light)

This is how we'll dance when
When they try to take us down
This is how we'll sing, oh
This is how we'll stand when
When they burn our houses down
This is what we'll be, oh, glory14Embed
