Fences Lyrics
I'm sitting in a room
Made up of only big white walls
And in the hall
There are people looking through
The window in the door
They know exactly what we're here for
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be
You're always on display
For everyone to watch and learn from
Don't you know by now?

You can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh, open wide
'Cause this is your night so smile
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style

If you let me, I could
I'd show you how to build your fences
Set restrictions
Separate from the world
The constant battle that you hate to fight
Just blame the limelight
Don't look up, just let them think
There's no place else you'd rather be
And now you can't turn back
Because this road is all you'll ever have

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh, open wide
'Cause this is your night so smile

Yeah, yeah, you're asking for it
With every breath that you breathe in
Just breathe it in
Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it
Yeah, yeah, well, you're just a mess
You do all this big talking
So now let's see you walk it
I said let's see you walk it

And it's obvious that you're dying, dying
Just living proof that the camera's lying
And oh, oh, open wide
Yeah oh, oh, open wide
Yeah oh, oh, open wide
'Cause you'll go out in style
You'll go out in style7Embed
