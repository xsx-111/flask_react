When It Rains Lyrics
And when it rains
On this side of town it touches
Everything
Just say it again and mean it
We don't miss a thing

You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)
And convinced yourself that it's not the reason you don't see the sun anymore

And oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

And when it rains
Well, you always find an escape
Just running away
From all of the ones who love you
From everything

You made yourself a bed at the bottom of the blackest hole (Blackest hole)
And you'll sleep till May and you'll say that you don't wanna see the sun anymore
And oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?

Take your time
Take my time
Take (Take) these chances (Your) to turn it around (Time)
Just take these chances, we'll make it somehow
And take (Take) these chances (My) to turn it around
Just turn it around

Oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming

Oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, how could you do it?
Oh, I, I never saw it coming
Oh, oh, I need an ending
So why can't you stay just long enough to explain?
You can take your time
Take my time15Embed
