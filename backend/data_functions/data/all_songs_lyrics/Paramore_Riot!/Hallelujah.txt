Hallelujah Lyrics
Somehow everything's gonna fall right into place
If we only had a way to make it all fall faster everyday
If only time flew like a dove
Well, God, make it fly faster than I'm falling in love

This time we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming "Hallelujah!"
We'll make it last forever

Holding on to patience wearing thin
I can't force these eyes to see the end
If only time flew like a dove
Well, we could watch it fly and just keep looking up

This time we're not giving up
Let's make it last forever
Screaming "Hallelujah!"
We'll make it last forever

And we've got time on our hands
(We've got time)
Got nothing but time on our hands
Got nothing but, got nothing but
(We've got time)
Got nothing but time on our hands
This time we're not giving up
Ooh, let's make it last forever
Screaming "Hallelujah!"
("Hallelujah!")
"Hallelujah!"9Embed
