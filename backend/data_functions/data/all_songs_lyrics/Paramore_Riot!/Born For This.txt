Born For This Lyrics
Oh no, I just keep on falling
Back to the same old
And where's hope, when misery comes crawling?
Oh, my way-ay
With your faith, you'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
And kill off this common sense of mine

And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
We don't need the headlines
We just want!
(We want the airwaves back)
(We want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Right now, you're the only reason
I'm not letting go, oh
And I'm out if everyone's worth pleasing
Ha, ha
You'll trigger a landslide
(Victory)
To kill off their finite state of mind

And it takes acquired minds
To taste, to taste, to taste this wine
You can't down it with your eyes
So we don't need the headlines
No, we don't want your headlines
We just want!
(We want the airwaves back)
(We want the airwaves back)

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, do you feel the pressure?
Alright, so you think you're ready?
Okay, then you say this with me, go
We were born for this
We were born for this
Alright, so you think you're ready?
Okay, then you say this with me, go
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for, we were born for...

Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Everybody live
Like it's the last day you will ever see
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure now?
Everybody sing
Like it's the last song you will ever sing
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?
Tell me, tell me, can you feel the pressure?

We were born for this
We were born for this
We were born for this9Embed
