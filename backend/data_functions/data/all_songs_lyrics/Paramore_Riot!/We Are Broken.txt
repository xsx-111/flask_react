We Are Broken Lyrics
I am outside and I've been waiting for the sun
With my wide eyes, I've seen worlds that don't belong
My mouth is dry with words I cannot verbalize
Tell me why we live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me, yeah

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

Lock the doors, cause I'd like to capture this voice
It came to me tonight
So everyone will have a choice
And under red lights, I'll show myself it wasn't forged
We're at war, we live like this

Keep me safe inside
Your arms like towers
Tower over me
'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole

Tower over me
Tower over me
And I'll take the truth at any cost

'Cause we are broken
What must we do to restore our innocence
And all the promise we adored?
Give us life again
'Cause we just wanna be whole8Embed
