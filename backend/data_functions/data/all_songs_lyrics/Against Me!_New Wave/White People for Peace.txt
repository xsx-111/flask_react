White People for Peace Lyrics
East and West
Could not agree
So the Generals gave call
Gathered troops at the border
With guns at ready
Drawn and aimed
Each side was praying to a God
To bless them with strength and courage

And it was in His name
Artillery lit the sky on fire
The people sang protest songs
Try and stop the soldier's gun

Protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try to stop the soldier's gun
But the battle raged on

Sirens filled the air
And the ground shook with war
Civilian casualties had been a cost
That was predetermined
When interviewed for report
Victims plead in frustration
Their claim â€” That this is a war without reason
And bureaucrats engaged in debate
To try to reach a resolution
The people sang protest songs
Try and stop the soldier's gun

Protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try to stop the soldier's gun
Protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try to stop the soldier's gun
But the battle raged on

All the protests, like their prayers
Went unanswered and ignored
God, like the rest of the world, just watched in silence
There was purpose to be served
There was fortunes to be earned
Before a peace could be called to stop the fighting

They sang protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try and stop the soldier's gun
Protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try and stop the soldier's gun
Protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try and stop the soldier's gun
Protest songs
In response to military aggression
Protest songs
Try to stop the soldier's gun
But the battle raged on11Embed
