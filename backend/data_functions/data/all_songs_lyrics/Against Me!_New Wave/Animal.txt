I was dreaming of your love
I was lost in your arms embrace
Our bodies collide together
Oh, this ultimate betrayal
The heart will not resign
What could be said what could be done?
I held out hope for your reciprocation

Like an animal
These thoughts have gone beyond my control
For pleasure
Maybe just amusement

This overwhelming urge
Towards you I feign disinterest
While I covet the attention
While I crave your affection
Ravenous with lust
Jackal in heat, spit dripping
This mechanical impulse knows not loyalty or mercy

Like an animal
These thoughts have gone beyond my control
For pleasure
Maybe just amusementEmbed
