Your talent outshines all that I could ever do or say
And me and my jealousy, I stole your songs and passed them off as my own
As much as I would like for it not to show
You can smell the stink on my breath and in my clothes, it's so obvious
If I could only be half the things you write about in your songs
If I could only mean half as much to anyone
And in my arrogance I write pages of anger, hate and spite
All of the reasons I have to trust absolutely no one
Today I heard you on my stereo and it shamed me to think
That I could be so unoriginal
If I could only be half the genius that you are
To feel such honest want, to show love
I would show you love
If I could only feel half as resolute in my beliefs
If I could only sing with such bravery
I cannot explain how much you mean to me
Without your words, I would be lostEmbed
