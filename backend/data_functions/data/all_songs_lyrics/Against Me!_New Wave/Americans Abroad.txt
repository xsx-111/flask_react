Golden arches rising above the next overpass
These horizons are endless
We're Americans abroad
We're Americans abroad
Profit-driven expansion into foreign markets

And while I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure
So while I hope I'm not like them —  I'm not so sure

This is the best summer that I've ever had
European vacation, me and my best friends
We're Americans abroad
We're Americans abroad
Whatever there is to be said's said in English

While I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure
So while I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure

Here we are, a rock band looking for new audiences
Wherever we go, Coca-Cola's already been
We're Americans abroad
We're Americans abroad
And I just can't help but think that there's a comparison
While I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure
While I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure
While I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure
While I hope I'm not like them — I'm not so sure

I'm not so sure
I'm not so sure
I'm not so sure
