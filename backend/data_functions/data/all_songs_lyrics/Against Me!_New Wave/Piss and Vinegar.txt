I've heard the hype about your band
I've seen your video playing on the TV
Publicity photos in magazines, no, none of it makes me feel anything
I would be lying to you if I did not say something
That would make me feel like a politician
A middle of the road opinion that no one finds offensive or challenging
I'm not interested
The stage is not a pedestal
And I don't think you're bad people
I just think that your aesthetic is horrible
Please treat me with the same respect and candor
I would appreciate the honesty, yeah
A little less professional, a little more upfront and confrontational

Just say what you're thinking
Say what you're really thinking
Just say what you're thinking
Say what you're really thinking
Say what you're thinkingEmbed
