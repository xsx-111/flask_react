Stop! LyricsStop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
You've got to make a serious decision
It could be me up there in stage lights
It could be me on the TV in your living room
It could be me jet setting with my band all across the world
Appearing live in concert one night only, tickets sold out
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
You've got to make a serious decision
There I am giving candid disclosure to press in interview
There I go on my way through the crowd up to the podium
On behalf of our fans, we'd like to accept this award
Smile for the camera, boys, gold record in hand
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
You've got to make a serious decision
All of our lives in waiting
All of our lives traded for their roses and applause
All of our lives dedicated to shoving it right back in their fucking face
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
Stop, take some time to think, figure out what's important to you
You've got to make a serious decision
Stop, take some time to thinkEmbed
