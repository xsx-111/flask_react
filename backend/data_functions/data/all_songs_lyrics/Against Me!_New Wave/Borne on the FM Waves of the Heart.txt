No, no it's not what we meant to say
Not what we meant to say
We don't really love each other
What happens when the summer's over?
How long before distance becomes a chore?
I'm approaching with great great trepidation
I hope you'll understand

Before you speak
Before you speak
Think about what you're trying to say
Think about what you're trying to say
Who else is there to blame for miscommunication?
You're getting caught up in the excitement
You're making promises you can't keep
You need to leave all your options open

Too much momentum, this room feels like it's going to explode
Too many angles, too many factors to cover
Waiting for signal, you're searching for a network
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation

Anxiety, anxiety, you give me no mercy
Grind my teeth smooth and flat in my sleep
We took some pills to calm us down, we needed help to come back up
Just trying to stay in control of the situation
Too much momentum, this room feels like it's going to explode
Too many angles, too many factors to cover
Waiting for signal, you're searching for a network
You have to fight to stay in control of the situation
And they fall apart so easily

Too much momentum, this room feels like it's going to explode
Too many angles, too many factors to cover
Waiting for signal, you're searching for a network
You have to fight to stay in control, you have to fight to stay in control
No, you don't have to fight to stay in control of the situationEmbed
