Thrash Unreal Lyrics
If she wants to dance and drink all night
Well, there’s no one that can stop her
She’s going 'til the house lights come up
Or her stomach spills onto the floor
This night is gonna end
When we’re damn well ready for it to be over
Worked all week long
Now the music is playing on our time
Yeah, we do what we do to get by
And then we need a release

You get mixed up with the wrong guys
You get messed up on the wrong drugs
Sometimes the party takes you places
That you didn’t really plan on going
When people see the track marks on her arms
She knows what they’re thinking
She keeps on working for that minimum
As if a high school education
Gave you any other options, you know
They don’t know nothing about redemption
They don’t know nothing about recovery
Some people just aren't the type for marriage and family
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone

She’s out of step with the style
She don’t know where the action's happening
You know the downtown club scene
Ain't nothing like it used to be
You reach a point where there’s not a lie in the world
That you could use to make the boys believe
You're still in your twenties
But they keep getting younger, don't they, baby?
She’s not waiting for someone to come over
And ask for the privilege
She can still hear that Rebel Yell
Just as loud as it was in 1983, you know
There ain't no Johnny coming home to share a bed with her
And she doesn’t care
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to sleep alone

No mother ever dreams
That her daughter's gonna grow up to be a junkie
And if she had to live it all over again
You know she wouldn’t change
Anything for the world7Embed
