Stay With Me Lyrics
Books and covers and part time lovers
Spinning in rooms in cities of rust
I'm stranded, struck out on this line
There's smoke and fire and steel and wire and glass and spire and dust
One to the floor at dawn with lips tied and drawn
Sleepless nights spent, with angels heaven sent

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me, stay, with me
Stay, with me

All of us lying there in the dreams
Speak of days and another place
I wander as the gypsy under a beckoning moon
Speak of time, and another face
They would in languid cry a fleeting furtive sigh
From the cradle to the grave love to desire and crave

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me, stay with me
Stay, with me

I'll laugh for you, and I'll dance for you
But don't ask me to she'd any tears when I have to go
You are a joy and a pleasure to love and to hold
Your promises, as pure as the driven snow
Passing shapes in the night the touch distraut and light
As you brightly shine, your love tonight is mine

Stay with me, lay with me, lay down by my side
Stay with me, lay with me, take me deep inside
Lay with me, stay with me, lay with me, stay, with me
Stay, with me

Stay, stay, with me
Stay, stay, stay, with meEmbed
