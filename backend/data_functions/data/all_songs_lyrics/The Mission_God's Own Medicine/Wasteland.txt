Wasteland Lyrics
I still believe in God
But God no longer believes in me

There's a crystal view from my window
And I can see years to come
I live for the burn and the sting of pleasure
I live for the sword, the steel, and the gun
I can tear down the walls, storm the barricades
Run to the place where the frightened crawl
Desire lurks beyond good and evil
So I dance on the graves where the hallowed fall

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

You can touch, but please keep your distance
You're innocent and pure and with no shame
The spirit is willing, and the flesh is craved
You tease and you taunt with the pleasure of pain
Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland


Heaven and Hell, I know them well
But I haven't yet made my choice
I'm feeling scared 'cause I'm shouting loud
And no one can hear my voice
I'm walking the tightwire, can't look down
Strung out high, above you all
Fateful wind blows through this land
Howls my name, heralds my fall

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland

Over this land
All over this wasteland
Over this land
All over this wasteland3Embed
