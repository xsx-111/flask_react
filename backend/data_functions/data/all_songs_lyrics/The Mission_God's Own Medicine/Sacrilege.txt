Sacrilege LyricsTarot strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the salad days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know
Bible for the love and damned
Religion for the pagan man
Faith and prayer for the chosen few
Mystic shades of violent hue
Blood, blood on my cheeks
And the taste
The taste of ash curls across my tongue
Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn
Rape and pillage the sacred word
Heart of darkness crowned and stirred
Rite of passage reckless whirl
Fruit forbidden ritual swirl
And you, what can you do?
And I, I say there's nothing you can do to stop this
Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burn
Tarot strewn across the floor
Fate creeps under the creaking door
Say farewell to the salad days
Arms held out for the needle haze
Scars, scars start to show
But don't, don't despair for the shame I know
Sacrilege, burning on the funeral pyre
Sacrilege, toss and turn on the cross to burnEmbed
