Let Sleeping Dogs Die LyricsThere's the crime of passion
And the crime of revenge
But the worst crime of all
Is the crime of regret
Speak of the devil
And the devil may speak of you
Why can't we
Let sleepin' dogs die?
Deep, it cuts deep
And the affection, it grows
And heaven only knows
What you were to earth
And the giving birth
To the giving rounds of judgement
And by fact of reason
You accuse of treason
Claim betrayal to the Holy Ghost
Of the sacred past
It's fading fast and forever
You took my hands
And turned it over
Why can't we
Let sleepin' dogs die?
No devil so dark
As the devil I know
There's no love lost
And no reason why
Talk, of faith you talk
But you were the one
Intent on stun
You took my glory and pride
Sanctity defied
And you never knew what the Gods could bring
By playing the game
Of who's to blame
It gets harder all the time
To put my trust in you
So reverence please, let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs die
Let sleepin' dogs dieEmbed
