Love Me To Death Lyrics
Let me come inside your ivory tower
Let me come inside your hallowed walls
God, it's heaven in here
Fix me with your hand of praise
Fix me with your touch of precious thrills
Your fingers dance across my skin
Reaching out for the pride of man

Hand in hand, flesh in flesh
We're walking through the fire of love
Breath by breath, and flame by flame
We burn till the sun rises and shines hot
Love comes gushing, love runs free
My love comes all over you
My love comes for you

Love me to death, my flower
Run barefoot through my hair
Naked on my lips
Love me to death, my precious
Smother me with kisses
Drown me in your waves of falling sweetness
Hold me dear, bury me deep
Bless me with your word of savage honour
We love more by fate than design
So give me your hand and I'll gladly give you my life
A flower, that sways in the breeze
You must be stronger than the winds that blow you away
Blow you away

Love me to death, my precious
Run barefoot through my hair
Dance wild on my lips
Love me to death, my flower
Lay me down on your bed of petals
Cover me with your honey, my blossom


Love me to death
Love me to death
Love me to death, my flower
Love me to death, my treasure
Run barefoot through my hair
Dance wild on my heart
Love me to death, my precious
Love me to death, my love
Tarnish, taint and punish me softly
Softly love me to death
Love me to deathEmbed
