Severina Lyrics
She's got her head in the clouds
She's got the stars in her eyes
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart
She's got the wind in her hair
Moon child shining bright
And she's dancing
With a dream in her heart

Severina, Severina

She believes in angels
She believes in will of the Gods
And she's dancing
Amongst the magic dust
She believes in the midnight trance
She believes in love is the law
She's dancing
Amongst the magic dust

Severina, Severina
Star child
Baby born of heaven
Severina, Severina

She's got a heart full of promise
She's got a hand in her heart
She's dancing
By the light of the moon
She's got a head full of secrets
Sworn to the faith of love on the will
She's dancing
By the light of the moon

Severina, Severina
She's a gift to the Gods
She's dancing
Severina, Severina, Severina
