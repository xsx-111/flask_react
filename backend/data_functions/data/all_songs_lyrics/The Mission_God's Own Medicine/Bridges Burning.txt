Bridges Burning Lyrics(Screaming people)
Snow blind, dog tired
Snow blind, and barb wired
Last chance in the jungle trance
And the fast step of the monkey dance craze
War paint, misty days and dizzy faint
Keeping the faith, spinning turning
Watch the flames
Of bridges burning!
Turning colors and shedding skin
Shining brightly, thick and thin
Mirror of God, legend and myth
The fatal charm of the treasure
Gift wrapped and heaven sent
So trapped on islands of intent
Avenging angel of the wild and yearning
Stoke the flames
Of bridges burning!
It burning me over!
Bridges burning!
Burning, drives me wild
Yearning for the small child
Blind men cry, but shed no tears
See no evil, speak in tongues
And hear you say, "Lovers Leap"
Cos there's NO other way across waters deep!
Feel the fire and the fool is learning
To run from the flames
Of bridges burning!Embed
