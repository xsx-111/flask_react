Blood Brother LyricsI gave you flowers and you gave me faith
We of minds and hearts that move as one
Chameleon, warrior, gypsy and brave
We turn our eyes to the heart of the rising sun
You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me
Kiss by kiss, touch by touch
We tore the clouds apart
You took my hand and walked me through the rain
An act of love, a mission of tender mercy
We stood tall and proud together we conquered again
You and me, we are blood brothers
You and me, we are blood brothers
Blood brother, lay down your life for me
Lay down your love for me
We pulled no punch and we gave them hell
Made the fearless cry and the shameful tell
Mountains and sand and seas and land
We moved winds to calm
And we rose again to win the war to
Rule and reign our hearts to soar
Heads held high, we touched the sky and we kissed
The ever faithful moonEmbed
