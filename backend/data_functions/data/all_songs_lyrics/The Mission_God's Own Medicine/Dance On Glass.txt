Dance On Glass LyricsRun you ragged
Torn and jagged
Sharp tongued, ripped and ragged
Couldn't find the party line
Gee whiz, it's happy time
Mirror, mirror, reflects me hazy
The heat's on, I'm running round crazy
Here's the road, didn't miss a trick
While you trash the punch and kick
I'll kiss the lips that sealed your fate
I'll bring you flowers and place them on your grave
Dreaming of colours, swamped in dust
Sweet dreams all covered in rust
Looking at heaven, gladdest ghosts seen
Turn to kill this crazy dream
You are revered for your work with ink and mirrors
You are renowned for bringing me steel and power
So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass
Shadow boxing, mild and meek
Send me flowers, tongue in cheek
Medicine man cast a spell
Head spins round, kiss and tell
So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass
Cheeks on fire, dance on glass
A touch of magic, a hint of class
Dress in leather, play in the dark
Pain and torture leave their mark
Take no prisoners, smash the light
Lunatic fringe, kiss and bite
Wild promise, cheeks are red
Battle cry, and then it's off to bed
You've taken my heart and ripped it from my sleeve
Hold it in your hands
Grip your fingers and it starts to bleed
So dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance, dance on glass
Dance, dance, dance on
Dance, dance, dance
Dance on glass
You shudder at a touchEmbed
