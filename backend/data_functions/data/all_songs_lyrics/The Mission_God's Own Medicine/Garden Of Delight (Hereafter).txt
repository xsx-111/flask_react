Garden Of Delight (Hereafter) LyricsI see your dancing, laughing, naked
Sweet and pretty face
And the promise, burning brightly
In your crystal-shot eyes
Your savage, and violent flesh
The cut that bleeds, the kiss that stings
We're shooting up stars and desperate snows
That fall from shimmering skies, So
(chorus)
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Take my hand and lead me
To the Garden of Delight
Revelation is laid, and reflects
On the windswept liquid mirror
Of this breathless world, this Happy Death
This elegance in charm
The treasured first fleeting touch of a gracious stranger
In-charmed me and entranced me
I know you can do me no harm, so
(chorus)
We're playing with fire, dancing in the flames
And we're covered in burns that may never heal
And angels may come, and angels may go
But it's heaven on earth when you
(chorus)Embed
