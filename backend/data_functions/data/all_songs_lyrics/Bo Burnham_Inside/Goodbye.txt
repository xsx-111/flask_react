Goodbye Lyrics
So long, goodbye
I'll see you when I see you
You can pick the street
I'll meet you on the other side
So long, goodbye
Do I really have to finish?
Do returns always diminish?
Did I say that right?
Does anybody want to joke
When no one's laughing in the background?

So this is how it ends
I promise to never go outside again

So long, bye
I'm slowly losing power
Has it only been an hour?
No, that can't be right
So long, goodbye
Hey, here's a fun idea
How about I sit on the couch
And I watch you next time?
I wanna hear you tell a joke
When no one's laughing in the background

So this is how it ends
I promise to never go outside again

Am I going crazy?
Would I еven know?
Am I right back where I startеd fourteen years ago?
Wanna guess the ending?
If it ever does
I swear to God that all I've ever wanted was
A little bit of everything all of the time
A bit of everything all of the time
Apathy's a tragedy, and boredom is a crime
I'm finished playin', and I'm stayin' inside
If I wake up in a house that's full of smoke
I'll panic, so call me up and tell me a joke
When I'm fully irrelevant and totally broken, damn it
Call me up and tell me a joke
Oh, shit
You're really joking at a time like this?
Well, well, look who's inside again
Went out to look for a reason to hide again
Well, well, buddy, you found it
Now come out with your hands up
We've got you surrounded32Embed
