Unpaid Intern Lyrics
Who needs a coffee? 'Cause I'm doing a run
I'm writing down the orders now for everyone
The coffee is free, just like me
I'm an unpaid intern

Sorting papers, running around (Runnin' around)
Sitting in the meeting room, not making a sound (Not a sound)
Barely people, somehow legal
Unpaid intern

You work all day, go back to your dorm
And since you can't afford a mortgage, you just torrent a porn
Cause you're an intern (Unpaid)
