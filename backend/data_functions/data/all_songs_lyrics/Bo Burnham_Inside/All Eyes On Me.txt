All Eyes On Me Lyrics
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me

Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody, oh
We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows

Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Ayy, come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah, come on
Heads down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
You wanna hear a funny story?
So, uh, five years ago, I quit performing live comedy
Because I was beginning to have, uh, severe panic attacks while on stage
Which is not a great place to have them
So I, I quit, and I didn't perform for five years
And I spent that time trying to improve myself mentally
And you know what? I did! I got better
I got so much better, in fact, that in January of 2020
I thought, "You know what? I should start performing again
I've been hiding from the world and I need to re-enter"
And then, the funniest thing happened

Are you feeling nervous? Are you having fun?
It's almost over, it's just begun
Don't overthink this, look in my eye
Don't be scared, don't be shy
Come on in, the water's fine

You say the ocean's rising like I give a shit
You say the whole world's ending, honey, it already did
You're not gonna slow it, Heaven knows you tried
Got it? Good, now get inside
We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows
We're goin' to go where everybody knows
Everybody knows

Come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Hey, come on, get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seats
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Heads down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said get your fuckin' hands up
Get up, get up
I'm talkin' to you, get the fuck up

Get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me
Ayy, fuckin' get your fuckin' hands up
Get on out of your seat
All eyes on me, all eyes on me, yeah
Come on, heads down, pray for me
Heads down now, pray for me
I said get your fuckin' hands up
Get onâ€”
All eyes on me, all eyes on me25Embed
