FaceTime with My Mom (Tonight) Lyrics
Pour me a drink and clear my schedule
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Night, night, night, night)
These 40 minutes are essential
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Night, night, night, night)

I call, she answers, and her hair is wet (Hair is wet)
I say, "Did you just shower?"
She says, "How'd you guess?"
I say, "Your hair is wet"; she says, "Oh, yeah"

I tell my boys I need some space, yeah
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight
She'll hold her iPhone 5 no further than six inches from her face, yeah
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Tonight)

She says, "Oh, look who's here. Say hi to Dad!"
(Da— Da— Da— Hi to Dad— Hi to Dad)
He says, "How ya doing, bud?"
I say, "I'm not so bad"
And that's the deepest talk we've ever had

Watching as she looks for her glasses
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight
She'll tell me all about the Season Six finale of The Blacklist
I'ma FaceTime with my mom tonight (Night, night, night, night)
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom
My mother's covering her camera with her thumb
I'll waste my time FaceTiming with my mom3Embed
