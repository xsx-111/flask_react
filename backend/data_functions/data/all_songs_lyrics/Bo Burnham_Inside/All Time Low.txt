All Time Low Lyrics
So, um... Uh, my current mental health is is rapidly approaching, um... an ATL ... which is, um... That's an all-time low. Not... Not Atlanta. And, you know, I feel okay when I'm asleep. Like, when I'm asleep I feel alright. But it's basically... From the moment I wake up, I, uh... I just get this

Feeling in my body
Way down deep inside me
I try not to fight it
(Describe it!)
Alright
A few things start to happen
My vision starts to flatten
My heart, it gets to tappin'
And I think I'm gonna die!

Yeah, so, um, yeah. Not, not doing great2Embed
