Country Honk Lyrics
Here we go

Yeah

I'm sittin' in a bar, tippin' a jar in Jackson
And on the street, the summer sun it shines
There's many a barroom queen
I've had in Jackson
But I just can't seem to drink you off my mind
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
Woo! The lady she all dressed me up in roses
She blew my nose, and then she blew my mind
It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
Ah yes
Woo! All right

It's the honky tonk women, yeah yeah
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
All over

It's the honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues
Yeah1Embed
