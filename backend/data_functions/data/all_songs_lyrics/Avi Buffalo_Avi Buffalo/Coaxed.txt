Coaxed LyricsThere once lived a soul whose ears
Lived nothing but open years
I still can't read your lips like i coaxed
That beast who makes love to me
Keep me from holes that i could fall into soon
The jade servant spits the moon
From stories as high as you
I took the two into town
Because i thought i'd be found
With strips of weariness in my raving heart
No matter how tired
I nearly kissed my will power out the door
And you wouldn't expect more
If i were to tell you so
You could be too young for that
And why i thought i could stand
With fields of fog around my neck and knees
I have no beliefs
I can't recall the last time i talked to you
And certain things that excite, won't keep me from anyoneEmbed
