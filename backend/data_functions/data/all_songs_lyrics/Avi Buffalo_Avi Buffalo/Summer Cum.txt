Summer Cum Lyrics
I've waited for your love
I got lost in your summer cum
Leave all your stains with me
I know that I will never be
Allowed to walk right next to you
And be that one that you want too
I tell you day and night
That I can't feel you with my right hand
Go on and tell your friends
How I can't rearrange my skin
They made up stories based on me
So everyone could feel at ease

Oh I can tell that you fell alive
And I won't disturb you in your time of rebirth
Please when you're taking your time with me
Just tell me that I'm making you feel weary
It's not the age I feel when by your side

I think you're over this but I'm not finished with your kisses
I know it's not allowed but you sure didn't seem to mind
If you continue being so kind I don't think I could stop trying
I saw you out today just walking back from some hot place
Where you had robbed them dry of t-shirts and some pre-made pie crust
You made desert that night I could taste a robots fist
