Jessica LyricsJessica, why do you always make it so hard
You know I'm kidding but sometimes
I feel like you're all I've got
Someone comes and tells you stop
I just won't ignore your calls
We sit down, I can't express these thoughts without mistakes
No one can make you lose your faith
Except for someone who you love
And I still want to leave my mark
Show you that I fit the part
Remember when we talked all night
And it made you laugh
And these things don't have to last
If your bills stretch
Jessica, I'll try my best not to make this hard
I know I took this way too far
And I can't tell when somethings real
Nobody tells me how they feel
It's always right beneath my nose
And if that's just the way it goes
Someone won't be there when you fallEmbed
