One Last Lyrics
There's one last song
It's been so long
Since I've been true
There is no way
To erase
What I said

I make my way through my old days
And I'd come over to ask
You what's wrong and why you seem like
You've been counting all the meltdowns
You've been having

Don't feel so bad
I once had
Work like yours
When it came time
I'd decide
What went first

Please take your time
Don't unwind
This too soon
There won't be love
So untamed
With us, too


Don't try to be comical
There's no one in here who can teach me
About the set and they control the stage
And there's no order, got no borders
They arrived without a call
Their mistakes are my fault
Acquainted self with architects
Who laid down plans
To build a wall between us
Have you seen us?
It ain't prettyEmbed
