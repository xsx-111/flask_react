Truth Sets In LyricsWhat's another time to say
Witches speak in my head all day
Witchcraft seems to unload and say
That you don't love me anymore
What's another word to scream
Maybe one more about the team
Try to improve the local scene
We ain't no good anymore
Wait 'til the truth sets in
Pay no attention to how we've been
You know that i thought too much
Of when i made my fatal mistake
Hope for the consequence
Picture your people still on the fence
Pretend that you hope that it's ok
When it's no good anymoreEmbed
