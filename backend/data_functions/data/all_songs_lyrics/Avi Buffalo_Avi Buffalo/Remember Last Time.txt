Remember Last Time LyricsRemember last time, you know how it went
I thought i served you all too well
And all along i had something in my eye
How long can we go this close
How soon before my laughs die?
If i had to tell you, something about myself
I don't think that you could have handled it well
You don't put up with so much stuff that you're cool
How long did i really last, how soon
Were you sick of me too?
Why'd don't we just go and ruin everything by
Taking this westbound, i know i seem too keen
We'll only stop to talk about our feelings
How good did you really feel
How much was he willing to spare
I've never written a love song, but i will for youEmbed
