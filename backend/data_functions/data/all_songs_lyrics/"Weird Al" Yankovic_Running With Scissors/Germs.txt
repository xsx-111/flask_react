Germs Lyrics[Verse 1}
Sometimes I really want to be alone
But that's one state I'm never in
Because I know that I've got millions upon millions
Of tiny, one-celled organisms living on my skin

(Germs) I rub and scrub until my flesh is raw and bleeding
(Germs) But they just come right back again
(Germs) I can't even see'em
But I know they're up to something
Hey, don't touch that - you don't know where it's been!

They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get'em offa me
I'm covered with... (microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me?
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with... (microscopic bacteria)

Now if I ever dare to go to sleep
That's when they start their sneak attack
In the morning I wake up in utter horror
To find my teeth are covered with bacterial plaque
(Germs) Can't get those parasitic creatures off my face
(Germs) And there's more comin' every day
(Germs) I never said that they could camp out on my body
I wish they'd pack their tiny little bags and move away

They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get'em offa me
I'm covered with... (microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with... (microscopic bacteria)

They're creepin' around my shorts
They're under the bathroom sink
They're ridin' inside my car
They're swimmin' in every drink
They're hidin' between my toes
They're lurkin' in every kiss
I got'em way up my nose
In every orifice
I'm gonna show them who's boss
I'm gonna get even yet
Just gimme some Lysol spray
Just hand me a moist towelette
Don't tell me I'm paranoid
I know that they're after me
Look under the microscope
See...
{Chorus]
They're all over me
They're inside of me
Can't get'em offa me
I'm covered with... (microscopic bacteria)
What do they want from me
What'll they do to me?
There's no escape for me
I'm crawling with... (microscopic bacteria)

(Germs) They're all over me
(Germs) I can feel'em all over me
(Germs) Over every part of me
(Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) I know they're watching me
(Germs) They're always watching me
(Germs) They're coming after me
(Germs) (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) Won't somebody help (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) Please sombody help me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) You've got to believe me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They're out to get me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They wanna control me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They wanna destroy me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) They're tryin' to kill me (Microscopic bacteria)
(Germs) It kind of upsets me (Microscopic bacteria)
Uhh...1Embed
