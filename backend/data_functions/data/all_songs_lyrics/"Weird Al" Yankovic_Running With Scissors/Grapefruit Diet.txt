Grapefruit Diet Lyrics
Who's that waddlin' down the street
It's just me cause I love to eat
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham
Who's real flabby?  Yes, I am
Every picture of me's gotta be an aerial view
Now my doctor tells me, there's just one thing left to do

Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Throw out the pizza and beer
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Now get those jelly donuts out of here
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Might seem a little severe
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
I'm gettin' tired of my big fat rear
Blow, fatty!

Well, I used to live on chocolate sauce
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss
Walked down an alley and I got stuck
I got more rolls than a pastry truck
When I'm all done eating, I eat a little more
When I leave a room, first I gotta grease the door
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Can't have another eclair
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
I gotta decrease my derriere
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet

No more pie now
No more creme brulee
Lay off the gravy
And souffle
No French fries now
No ice cream parfait
Mr. Cheese Nacho
Stay away
Oh, I think I'd sell my soul for a triple patty melt
But I need a boomerang when I put on my belt

Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Lay off the 3 Musketeers
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
Until my big booty disappears
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
I eat 'em till they're comin' out of my ears
Grapefruit diet (Diet!)
'Cause I haven't seen my feet in years
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet
I'm on a grapefruit diet

I think I'm about ready for a Quarter Pounder with extra cheese, and maybe a side order of onion rings and-oh, don't forget to super-size that, yeah!Embed
