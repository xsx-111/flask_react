Proclamation Lyrics
You may not have all you want or you need
All that you have has been due to my hand
It can change, it can stay the same
Who can say, who can make their claim

The situation we are in at this time
Neither a good one, nor is it so unblest
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim
Hail, hail, hail, hail
Hail!

Unity's strength and all must be as one
Confidence in you hope will reflect in me
I think everyone not as my nation for
You are my people and there must be no change
It can change, it can stay the same
I will say, I will make my claim
Hail, hail, hail, hail
Hail!

Hail!
To the Power and to Glory's way
Hail!
To the Power and to Glory's way
Hail!
To the Power and to Glory's way
Hail!
To the Power and to Glory's way

Hail!
To the Power and to Glory's way
Hail!
To the Power and to Glory's way
Glory's way
Day by day, day by day
Day by, day by, day by
Day by, day by, day by
Day by, day by day

The situation we are in at this time
Neither a good one, nor is it so unblest
It can change, it can stay the same
I can say, I can make my claim
Unity's strength and all must be as one
Confidence in you hope will reflect in me
I think everyone not as my nation for
You are my people and there must be no change
It can change, it can stay the same
I will say, I will make my claim2Embed
