The Power and the Glory Lyrics
Run, run, the shotgun has got you in its range
Turn, turn away, when it's time to make a change
Look where you're going, try not to lose your way
What good is knowing you have to go away?
Go, you may go, never know, never know
Time's run away, so have to go, have to go
Put back the ace black, you never made it good
Go while you can go, go while the going's good

And the power and the glory is over, so I'll take it
The power and the glory is over, so I'll make it
The power and the glory is over, and I'll break it
The power and the glory is over

Face up to reason, you know it's up to you
Do what you can do, all that you have to do
Move over now, and I'll try to take your place
Time to remember that I have won the race
Go, you may go, never know, never know
Time's run away, so have to go, have to go
Pick up the pieces, to you I'll have to stand
Break up the power, the glory's at the end
And the power and the glory is over, so I'll take it
The power and the glory is over, so I'll make it
The power and the glory is over, and I'll break it
The power and the glory is over

Run, run, the shotgun has got you in its range
Turn, turn away, when it's time to make a change
Look where you're going. try not to lose your way
What good is knowing you have to go away?

And the power and the glory is over, so I'll take it
The power and the glory is over, so I'll make it
The power and the glory is over, and I'll break it
The power and the glory is over, so I'll take it
The power and the glory is over, so I'll make it
The power and the glory is over, and I'll break it
(repeat until fade out)Embed
