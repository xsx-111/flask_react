Playing the Game LyricsAs I hold the key to the back door
Of the world I feel my
Hand touching bounds never had before
I can view the power of my position and my
Eyes can see more than anyone in any place
I'll play the game and never ever lose
I'm the king in fighting competition
And the other pieces
Are there for my art and my tactics now
All my games are won before they're played for
I have planned that no opposition can stage a fight
I'll play the game and never ever lose
My thoughts never spoken only the
Visions inside my head the truth never broken
Within my silent words left unsaid
I will steer the helm of all the nation
As the captain
Take my rewards for all the good I'm doing now
And no words that I'm the knave will alter my
Philosophy for if any are heard, the games started
Again I'll never ever loseEmbed
