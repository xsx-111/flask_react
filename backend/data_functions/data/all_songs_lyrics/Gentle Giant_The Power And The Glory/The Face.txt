The Face Lyrics
Sing your song, words that have to continue
Tell a tale, seal the screen that is in you
Make your peace, face the face that is after
Reasons plain, tears of pain are not laughter
Cast off the mould, buy all you've sold
Confidence lost, pay for the cost

Choose your way, realizing our mission
Figures lay, pulling strings for position
Take your bows, hear the people are calling
Play the game, Take the blame as you're falling
Time to confess, clean up the mess
Stand in the white, step in the light

(Oh, wow!)

Use the time, show the face that is sorry
For the day, questions leading to worry
Hide your mask, show the face that is sorry
Time to ask, answering all their worry
Time to confess, clean up the mess
Cast off the mould, buy all you've soldEmbed
