Valedictory Lyrics
And though the hard times are really due to me
It still is in me, to wave all this unrest
Things must stay, there must be no change
Anyway, time to rearrange

You must believe him, that there's been no betrayal
All that I've done, I've really done for you
Things must stay, there must be no change
Anyway, time to rearrange

Hail to power and to glory's way
Hail to power and to glory's way

Must be a reason, why plans have turned around
Not only in me, must also be in you
Things must stay, there must be no change
Anyway, time to rearrange
Hail-Embed
