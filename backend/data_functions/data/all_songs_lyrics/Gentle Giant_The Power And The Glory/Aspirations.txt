Aspirations Lyrics
As the dust settles, see our dreams
All coming true, it depends on you
If our times, they are troubled times
Show us the way
Tell us what to do

As our faith, maybe aimless blind
Hope our ideals and our thoughts are yours
And believing the promises
Please make your claims
Really so sincere

Be our guide, our light and our way of life
And let the world see the way we lead our way
Hopes, dreams, hopes dreaming that all our sorrow's gone

In your hands, holding everyone's
Future and fate, it is all in you
Make us strong, build our unity
All men as one, it is all in you

Be our guide, our light and our way of life
And let the world see the way we lead our way
Hopes, dreams, hopes dreaming that all our sorrow's gone
ForeverEmbed
