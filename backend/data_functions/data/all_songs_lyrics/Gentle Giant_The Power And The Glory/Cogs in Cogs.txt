Cogs in Cogs Lyrics
Empty promise broken the path has not been paved anyway
Cogs in cogs, the machine is being left where it lay

Anger and the rising murmur breaks the old circle
The wheel slowly turns around

All words saying nothing, the air is sour with discontent
No returns have been tasted, or are they ever sent

Slow-burning is the fire, rising murmur breaks the old circle
The wheel slowly turns around
Cogs in cogs, wheel turning around

The circle turns around, the changing voices calling
(Circle turns around, the changing voices)
(repeat)

Slow-burning is the fire, rising murmur breaks the old circle
The wheel slowly turns around
Cogs in cogs in wheels in circles slowly turn aroundEmbed
