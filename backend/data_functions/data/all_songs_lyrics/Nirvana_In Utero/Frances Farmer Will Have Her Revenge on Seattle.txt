Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle Lyrics
It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking
Whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
Starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

In her false witness, hope you're still with us
To see if they float or drown
Our favorite patient, a display of patience
Disease-covered Puget Sound
She'll come back as fire to burn all the liars
Leave a blanket of ash on the ground

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving
As soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to know that you're asking
Wherever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me
It's starting to sound the same

I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad
I miss the comfort in being sad33Embed
