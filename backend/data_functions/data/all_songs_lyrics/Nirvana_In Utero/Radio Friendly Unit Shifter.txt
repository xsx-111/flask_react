Radio Friendly Unit Shifter Lyrics
(Mmm)
What's your name?
Do you like me?

Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Speak at once while taking turns

What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?

Nothing to do with what you think
If you ever think at all
Bi-polar opposites attract
All of a sudden my water broke
I love you for what I am not
I do not want what I have got
A blanket acne'ed with cigarette burns
Second-rate third degree burns
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?

Hate your enemies
Save, save your friends
Find, find your place
Speak, speak the truth

What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What do I think I think?


Use just once and destroy
Invasion of our piracy
Afterbirth of a nation
Starve without your skeleton key

What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What is what I need?
What do I think I think?
What is wrong with me?
What is what I need?
What is wrong with me?
What do I think I think?12Embed
