Very Ape Lyrics
I am buried up to my neck in
Contradictionary flies
I take pride as the king of illiterature
I'm very ape and very nice
If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt

If you ever need anything please don't
Hesitate to ask someone else first
I'm too busy acting like I'm not naïve
I've seen it all, I was here first

Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the ground
Out of the ground
Into the sky
Out of the sky
Into the dirt24Embed
