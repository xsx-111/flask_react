This Sporting Life Lyrics
Are you bored?
Are you jaded?
Has all enthusiasm faded?
Are you one of those people
Like glazed fruit
Who sit there in shell-shock
Till the dot on your screen disappears?
Are you one of those people?
Or are you just afraid?
Are you one who craves excitement?
Were you tailor made

For this sporting life?
Living on a knife edge
This sporting life's forever changing

Are you one of these people?

The keys please quick
Every second counts
I've signed the book
Gimme the keys
The elevator opens its mouth
Like Jonah and the whale
The elevator spits me out
Into a freak show
It's a freak show
And into a swarm of flies
Do, do not disturb
Do, do not disturb
The sign on the door read
Do not disturb
Strange looks from the bellman
As he takes me down the hallway
Through a fire door to a stairwell
Skidding, skidding, skidding, skidding
Skidding, skidding, skidding, skidding
Out of control, out of control
Do, do not disturb
Do, do not disturb
The sign on the door read
The sign on the door said
The sign on the door read
Do not disturb

This is the Bad Samaritans
Hello loved one
Sorry there was nobody here
To take your call personally
However, we understand
What you're going through
How you've travelled life's highway
With your smile on upside-down
And now you think you've found
The ultimate answer to all your problems
Don't be hasty
Why waste a life?
Wait till there's a crowd down below
Give a little when you go
Are you one of these people?

(Jump jump jump jump)
There's a fruitcake in the window
(Jump jump jump jump)
Someone fetch the cops
(Jump jump jump jump)
For God's sake get a camera
(Jump jump jump jump)
Before the bastard drops
(Jump jump jump jump)
A little to the left
(Jump jump jump jump)
A little to the right
(Jump jump jump jump)
A little to the left
(Jump jump jump jump)
Maybe tonight's the night
(Jump jump jump jump)
(Jump jump jump jump)
Why are we waiting?
(Jump jump jump jump)
(Jump jump jump jump)
We're waiting
(Jump jump jump jump)
(Jump jump jump jump)
A little to the left
(Jump jump)
Right down the middle
(Jump jump)
A little to the right
(Jump jump)
X marks the spot
(Jump jump)
You ain't gonna be
(Jump jump jump jump)
On This is Your Life tonight
(Jump jump jump jump)
(Jump jump jump jump jump)
Jump
This sporting life
Needs organising
We'd gladly lose the cup
If we could stick the knife in
This sporting life
This sporting life
This sporting life's forever changing

Are you bored?
Are you jaded?
Has all enthusiasm faded?
Are you one of those people?Embed
