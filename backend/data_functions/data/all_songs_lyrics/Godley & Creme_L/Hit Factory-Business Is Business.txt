Hit Factory/Business Is Business Lyrics

We're all working in a hit factory
We're all working in a hit factory
We're all working in a hit factory
We're all working in a hit factory
We're all working in a hit factory
We're all working
We're all working
We're all working
We're all working
We're all working


Keep it simple
Keep it neat
Aim your hook
At the man in the street
Throw him the bones
But freeze the meat
'Cause the meat goes off
But the beat goes on
Business is business
Business is business
Business is business
And only thе tough survive

Radio fallout
In an open prison (No balls)
Jazz-based soul tingеd
Watered down rhythm (No feel)
Too many pretty sleeves
With nothing in 'em
Johnny be good or bad
But not indifferent (Please)
Hard-core bland-out
Stocking filler (Cheap)
Soft-sell overkill
Tee-shirts given

Everybody's wearing them
See you at the party tonight
M.O.R. is good
M.O.R. is safe
M.O.R. is here
Just give it to 'em
Never think about it
Just give it to 'em
Never think about it
Force fed (Just give it to 'em)
On half dead melodies (Never think about it)
Dragged up from the archives (Just give it to 'em)
Playing on your sympathies (Never think about it)
I'm being brainwashed (Just give it to 'em)
And don't know how to block it (Never think about it)
'Cause something in the chorus (Just give it to 'em)
Burns a hole in my pocket (Never think about it)
And I can't feel the pain (Just give it to 'em)
When my finger's in the socket (Never think about it)
And only the numb survive
Only the numb survive
Only the numb survive

Business is business (Business is business)
Business is business (Business is business)
Business is business

Everyone was doing it
You weren't at the party last night
M.O.R. is good
M.O.R. is safe
M.O.R. is you
M.O.R. is here
Where
Relax, relax
Relax, relax
Relax, relax
Relax, relax
Maybe you can think of a way
To turn me onEmbed
