Art School Canteen Lyrics
Let me tell you what it's all about
Walking 'round with your talent hanging out
I'm feeling ragged as a scrubber's tights
Must have had too much to paint
Last night's routine

Art school canteen
Art school canteen
Art school canteen

Come in late and go home earlier
One day a week or maybe less
So I lied about the funeral
I was really playing chess
I was seen

By the coffee machine
By the coffee machine
Art school canteen

I'd cut my ear off to spite my face
But it's been done
No, maybe that's too weird
I'd better sketch it out on Kodatrace
And redesign my beard
Does getting into Zappa
Mean getting out of Zen?
Sex has reared its ugly head at last
But it didn't look ugly then
Begin the beguine
Art school canteen
