Sandwiches of You Lyrics
I'd like to know you better
And maybe take you home
I'd like to meet your father
But really not tonight
We'll be stopping off at Dayvilles
For pistachio and beer
It's the flavour of the month but
You're the flavour of the year

I could eat
Sandwiches of you
You could eat
Sandwiches of me

Thanks

Oh my Papa
He will not approve
He won't like your car
Or the way that you conduct yourself
In public
Your move
Shame, shame on you
I want to keep this friendship platonic
I respect the fact that you're waiting
For Mister Right
Am I wrong?
Let's pull over
Please let's pull over
And discuss the ramifications
Of a lasting and complex relationship
Like mature and responsible people do
Am I getting through?

I could eat
Sandwiches of you
You could eat
Sandwiches of me
I could eat
Sandwiches of you
You could eat
Sandwiches of me
