Room 101 LyricsDon't claim to be a prophet
Don't claim to read the stars
But I can see a future
Mapped out in scars
Look to the skies
Keep praying to your gods
Your only salvation
Will come in the shape of the bomb
No clockwork orange
The doom watch ticks
There's no second coming
Only final conflict
Blind pessimism?
Only time will tell
The cold hard reality
Is that this world had gone to hell
And this is where I belong
In my room one zero one
As I sit here all alone
In my own private year zero
These numbers branded
Embedded in the mind
How can your herald a future
When it's already arrived?
Keep looking to the skies
Keep waiting for your lord
You fools there's no second coming
To redeem you all
And this is where I belong
In my room one zero one
As I sit here all alone
In my own private year zero
Don't claim to be a prophet
Don't claim to sight the stars
But I can read the future
In anguished mental scars
I have no faith
In anything that you hold dear
The future is ours
Only in sweat and tears
And this is where I belong
In my room one zero one
As I sit here all alone
In my own private year zero
And this is where I belong
In my room one zero one
As I sit here all alone
In my own private year zeroEmbed
