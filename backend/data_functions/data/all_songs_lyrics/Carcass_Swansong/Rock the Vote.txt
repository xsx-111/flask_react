Rock the Vote LyricsHands in another's pocket
The bed they make
Is not the one in which they lie
The same old faces
The same old establishment
The same old lies
Cross your 'x'
It's your only voice
Do as you're told
Stay in line
Don't rock the boat
And buy what you're sold
Believe the lie
The line that you toe
Doing fine
If you just do as you're told
No dissident voices
The faces merge
Are one, absolute
A comfortable, privileged
White over belly
Revolution
No threat, no change
No gain, just pain
The same old scheme
No hope, no choice
No future, no voice
This is no pipe dream
All is not what it seems
Believe the lie
The line that you toe
Doing fine
If you just do as you're told
Believe the lie
The line that you toe
Doing fine
If you just do as you're told
Is this rock'n'roll
Or a form of state control?
Is this really rock'n'roll?
Or a form of state control?
Believe the lie
The lie that you're told
Doing fine
Just do as you're told
Believe the lie
The lie that you're told
Doing fine
Just do as you're told
Believe the lie
The lie that you're told
Doing fine
Just do as you're told
Is this rock'n'roll
Or a form of state control?Embed
