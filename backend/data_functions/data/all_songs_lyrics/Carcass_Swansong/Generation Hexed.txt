Generation Hexed LyricsLost forever a whole generation of pathetic lost souls
With no meaning of depth they're already dead, before it gets old
Anonymous, blank no individuality, uniformed
A wholesale banket identity, from the day that they're born
Another generation to mourn
What choice for a new generation?
Another generation under sedation
Flocking like sheep the instinctual herd, as fashion dictates
Primitively seduced commonly reduced, resigned to their fate
Another useless faceless degeneration like the one which precedes
Acknowledging a bleak existence, to be spent on it's knees
The pattern it seeds
What choice for a new generation?
Another generation under sedation
Generation hexed
Just another useless generation
...Hexed
Trapped together another wasted generation is sold
With no meaning, of depth they're there to be bled
Never breaking the mould
Anonymous, blank no individuality, misinformed
A wholesale blinkered non-entity, on it's knees born
Another generation to scorn
What choice for a new generation?
Just another generation under sedation
Self suppressed
Generation vexed
Self oppressed
Just another generation hexed
What choice for a new generation?
A generation vexed
Still no choice for a new generation
Just another generation under sedation
Generation hexed
Just another useless generation
Generation hexed
Just another wasted generation
