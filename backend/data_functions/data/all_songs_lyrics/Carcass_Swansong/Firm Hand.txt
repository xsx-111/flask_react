Firm Hand LyricsFirmhand, iron fist, an ardent dexterous weeding process
Overlord with a strong grip, viral containment, a harvesting grid
Firmhand - unnatural selection is applied
Firmhand - the final solution, eugenocide
Hate is the law, love under will
Hate is their law, love under will
Transfusing, contagion breeds
Multi-cultured epidemic is released
Held firm, crushing grasp
A painstaking, callous, arduous task
Firmhand - indiscriminate selection is applied
Firmhand - the final solution, eugenocide
Hate is the law, love under will
Hate is their law, love under will
With slight of their firmhand
And deviancy is cleansed
Firmhand - unnatural selection is applied
Firmhand - the final solution, eugenocide
Hate is the law, love under will
Hate is their law, love under will
With slight of their firmhand
With the might of their firmhand
With slight of their firmhand
And deviancy is cleansedEmbed
