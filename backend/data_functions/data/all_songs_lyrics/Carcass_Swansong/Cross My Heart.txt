Cross My Heart LyricsYeah, cross my heart and hope to die
It will only end in tears, eye for an eye
For an eye
If beauty is only skin deep
Then thankfully I am blind
Cross my heart and hope to die
Cross my heart, come cross the line
Won't you be mine, my bloody valentine?
Put me on a pedestal, I'll put you on a slab
Cross my heart and hope to die
Come, let's cross the line
There's a fine line between love and hate
Let's tear it apart
Cross my heart and hope to die
Cross my heart, come let's cross the line
Time is no great healer, quickly the senses numb
Come cross my heart, void and null
Love is a weakness, lust conquers all
Cross my heart and hope to die
Where do we draw the line?
There's a fine line between love and hate
Let's tear it in two
Cross my heart and hope to die
Cross my heart, come let's cross the line
Let's tear it apartEmbed
