Polarized LyricsDon't want your number
Don't want your name
Don't want your colour...
Don't want your politics
Don't want your cause
Don't believe what you believe
Don't want to wear your emblem
Don't want your cult or sect
Don't want your faith
Don't want your respect
Don't want your love
Don't want your praise
Don't want your stupid fashion
Don't want your phase
Polarized - tell me what colours do you wear?
Your beliefs, polarized
I just don't care for what you care
I just don't care for what you care
Polarized - tell me what colours do you wear?
Your beliefs, polarized
I just don't care for what you care
Don't want your number
Don't want your name
Don't want your colour...
Don't want your politics
Don't want your cause
Don't believe what you believe
Don't want to wear your emblem
Don't want your cult or sect
Don't want your faith
Don't want your respect
Don't want your love
Don't want your praise
Don't want your stupid fashion
Don't want your phase
Polarized - tell me what colours do you wear?
Your beliefs, polarized
I just don't care for what you care
Polarized - tell me what colours do you wear?
Your beliefs, polarized
I just don't careEmbed
