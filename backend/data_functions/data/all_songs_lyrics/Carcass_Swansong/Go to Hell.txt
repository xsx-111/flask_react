Go to Hell LyricsSome people aren't cut out to be saints
And since I was born in original sin
Hedonism has a certain attraction
I think I’ll cut the crap, cut out the middle man
And go to hell
I’ve sold my soul, so when my body goes cold
I’ll go straight to hell
Go to hell
Won’t you be told?
I’ve sold my soul
Go straight to hell
Your paradise doesn't sound too fetching
It’s not only your souls which must be lost
"Hell is other people"
Yeah, too right, my hell is you
The sins of the flesh sound so appealing
So let me wallow in my guilt
Your hell will be my heaven
So let's turn up the heat, let eternity begin
And go to hell
I’ve sold my soul, so when my body goes cold
I’ll go straight to hell
C'mon
Let’s go to hell
Won’t you be told?
I’ve sold my soul
Go straight to hell
Let’s burn in the flames, yeah!Embed
