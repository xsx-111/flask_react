Childs Play LyricsRaised in a nursery of crumbling brick
Rusted iron, cracked stone and steel
Nurtured in a barren concrete crib
In a playground of grey, your fate is sealed
Against a back drop of drab, cold corrosion
We learn to dance, love, sing and play
Razor wire the strung umbilical cord
In an unsterile womb of urban decay
Let me take you down
As I'm going to
Play hard - like child's play
Playing rough - after all it's only a game
(lead)
Now, redevelopment lies in ruins
As gutted slums are sown
Enveloping, smothering squalor
This dereliction grows
Outside it is now cold and dark
Only desolation, darkness and gloom
Not a far cry from a tortured cat
Your cities will become your tombs
Let me take you down
As I'm going to
Play hard - like child's play
Playing rough - after all it's only...
Play hard - like child's play
Playing rough - after all it's only a gameEmbed
