Black Star LyricsBlack star, jewel of the night
Black star, burning bright
Magnificent sun, a beacon burning
Five pointed coal, a guide eternal
Black star, five pointed coal
Black star, the cosmic soul
Shining opaque, celestial furnace
Glittering dark, a sun in mourning
Black star, where light never shines
Black star, won't you be my guide?
A dead sun for where the light never shines
Shine on...
Twinkle, twinkle black star
Shine on...
Black star, darken the skies
Forever burn, never to die
An ebony flame, a sun infernal
Nemesis of the night, my own dark angel
Black star, jewel of the night
Black star, so cruel, so bright
A glorious sun, with warmth so healing
Glittering dark, a sun in mourning
Black star, where light never shines
Black star, won't you be my guide?
A dead sun for where the light never shines
Shine on...
Twinkle, twinkle black star
Shine on... black starEmbed
