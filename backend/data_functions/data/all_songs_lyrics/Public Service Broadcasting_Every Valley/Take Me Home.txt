Take Me Home Lyrics
The sun set in the west over South Wales
And mine and steelworks and factory spilled out their people to the evening and leisure
As the people of the valleys
Colliers and Choristers
Lovers and Lonely alike
Sang out aloud with life

I remember the face of my father
As we walked back home from the mine
He laughed and he'd say
"That's one more day
And it's good to feel the sun shine"
I remember my mother was smiling
As I set out to make my own way
She seemed to know that I had to go
But I'd come back home one day
Take me home
To my family
Take me home
To my friends
Take me home
Where my heart lies
And let me, let me sing again
Take me home
Let me sing again
Take me homeEmbed
