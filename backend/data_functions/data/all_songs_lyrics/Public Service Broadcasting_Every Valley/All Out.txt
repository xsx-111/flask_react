All Out LyricsYou know we're not gonna take it anymore, we've just had enough
We never went on strike because we wanted more wages
Better wages than a doctor have or a nurse
We went on strike for a job; the right to go out the house in the morning and go to work
If you look at the benefits of ordinary working people
All the things they've achieved in life, is through conflict and strikes
I don't think there ever be a day in life, when ordinary people can say, 'I never have to go on strike again'
What you see on the telly is nothing, what you read in the papers is nothing
I was brought up to respect police; I don't respect them nowEmbed
