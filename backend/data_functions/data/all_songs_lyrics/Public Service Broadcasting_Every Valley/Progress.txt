Progress Lyrics
Continually experimenting with new ideas and techniques
Reconstructing
Developing
Modernising

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

Machines will do the heavy work
Men will supervise the machines
You owe much to these machines
Horsepower, not manpower
Brains, not brawn
I believe in progress

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress
I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress

These men look the same as they have always looked
They talk as they have always talked
But before your eyes they are changing
I believe in progress

I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress
I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress
I believe, I believe
In progress, in progress
I believe in progressEmbed
