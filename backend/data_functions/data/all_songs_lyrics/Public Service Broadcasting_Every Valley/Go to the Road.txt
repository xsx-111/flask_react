Go to the Road LyricsIt was a sad day at the Ogilvie Colliery in the Rhymney valley when the pits finally closed after bring in operation for 60 years. This means that all the pits at the top end of the Rhymney valley have now been closed down...
35 years of loyal service in the industry. There must be more than just 'put them over in the next pit'
You're selling your son's job, not your job
When you're a young pit goer, like this, you wanna pick up the other pitmates every one of them
United we stand, united we bloody fall, the lot of you ought to say
The offers that we've been having now,  nothing short of disgusting
They've been promising this and promising that. We know no self if we're gonna end up with a job
The way it's going now, we've been chucked on the scrapheap
The union have accepted it, the party have accepted it, and they've made know to us that under no uncertain terms, that we've reached the end of the roadEmbed
