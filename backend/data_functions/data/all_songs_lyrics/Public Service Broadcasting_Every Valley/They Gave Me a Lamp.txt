They Gave Me a Lamp Lyrics
"If you could get the women into one, you could get them involved in one thing, you could see them in this other light."
"...and then they started questioning other aspects of their own, not just relating to themselves, or, at yourself, 'politics was just something that wouldn't affect me', but politics is life, and everything to do with it affects you, directly or indirectly."
"A lot of women weren't as fortunate as me, they weren't taught to wire a plug, they were taught to make a sponge; they weren't taught how to change a wheel on a car, they were taught the proper way to iron a white shirt."
"...you can't climb up this tree, you're a girl. You can't come with us 'cause you're a girl. And it made me damned determined to do it. And I suppose it sort of stuck with me, so I... I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't be out there doing what I was doing, why I shouldn't work with them, why I shouldn't found a support group
I think a lot of women found their feet."
"I've been in front, I have never give in, I have never sat back, and I have never refused anybody, and I am very proud of it, and I'll be proud to look back on it."Embed
