Stupid Girl LyricsYou're just a stupid girl
You really got a lot to learn
Start living again
Forget about remembering
You're such a stupid girl
You're such a beautiful fish
Flopping on the summer sand
Looking for the wave you missed
When another one is close at hand
You're such a stupid girl
You're such a stupid girl
I saw you in Mercedes Benz
Practicing self-defense
You got it pretty good I guess
I couldn't see your eyes
You're really stupid, girl
You're such a stupid girlEmbed
