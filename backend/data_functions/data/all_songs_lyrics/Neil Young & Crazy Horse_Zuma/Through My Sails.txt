Through My Sails LyricsStill glaring from the city lights
Into paradise I soared
Unable to come down
For reasons I'd ignored
Total confusion
Disillusion
New things I'm knowing
I'm standing on the shoreline
It's so fine out there
Leaving with the wind blowing
But love takes care
Know me, know me
Show me, show me
New things I'm knowing
Wind blowing through my sails
It feels like I'm gone
Leaving with the wind blowing
Through my sailsEmbed
