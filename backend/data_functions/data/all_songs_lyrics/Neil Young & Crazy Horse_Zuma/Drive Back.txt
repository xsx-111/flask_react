Drive Back LyricsWhatever gets you through the night
That's all right with me
When it's time to say goodbye
I have to make you see
You won't know me, I won't call you
I won't be there to remind you
What you told me when I showed you
In the morning, let me know you'll
Drive back to your old town
I want to wake up with no one around
Drive back to your old town
If somebody is haunting your mind
Look in my eyes, let me hide you
From yourself and all your old friends
Every good thing comes to an end
Drive back
Drive back
Drive back
Drive back to your old town
I want to wake up with no one around
Drive back to your old townEmbed
