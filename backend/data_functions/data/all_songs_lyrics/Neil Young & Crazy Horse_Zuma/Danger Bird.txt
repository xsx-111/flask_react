Danger Bird LyricsDanger bird, he flies alone
And he rides the wind back to his home
Although his wings have turned to stone
And we used to be so calm
Now I think about you all day long
(That's the moment that he cracked)
Because you've been with another man
(Long ago in the museum with his friends)
Here you are and here I am

The jailbird takes the raps
And he finds himself spread-eagled on the tracks
But the training that he learned will get him nowhere fast
And I know we should be free
(With the rain pounding on his back)
But freedom's just a prison to me
(He recalls that moment when he cracked)
Because I lied to keep it kind
(Long ago in the museum with his friends)
When I left you far behind
(And like those memories, the rain keeps pounding down, down, down)

And though these wings have turned to stone
I can fly, fly, fly away
Watch me fly above the city
Like a shadow on the sky
Fly, fly, flyEmbed
