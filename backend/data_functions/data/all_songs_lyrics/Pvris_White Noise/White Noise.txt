White Noise Lyrics
It's hard to be what you need through a static screen
Been tryin' to speak for weeks and weeks
Open my mouth, all that comes out is white noise and incomprehensible sounds
And all you ever do is turn me down

I'm watching
I'm waiting
I'm aching
Suffocating
I'm breathing
I'm speaking
Can you hear me?
I'm screaming for you

Day by day, I'm slowly replaced in your picture frames
A brand new face on your pillowcase
Come the night, you dim the lights and close the blinds
But I still see them running down your spine
'Cause I illuminate the room just enough to watch you

I'm watching
I'm waiting
I'm aching
Suffocating
I'm breathing
I'm speaking
Can you hear me?
I'm screaming for you
Sick of the lack of signal
Sick of the lack of touch
Sick of the static voice
It's not enough, it's not enough
Baby, it's hard to be just what you need
When all I speak is static screams
Can you hear me?

I'm watching
I'm waiting
I'm aching
Suffocating
I'm breathing
I'm speaking
Can you hear me?
I'm screaming for you

Sick of the lack of signal
Sick of the lack of touch
Sick of the static voice
It's not enough, it's not enough
And, baby, it's hard to be just what you need
When all I speak is static screams10Embed
