Eyelids Lyrics
I'll face my fear of the evening
Once I get used to this feeling
I can't sleep
That's when you're torn away from me
While I'm dreaming, I feel you leaving

I'll face my fear of the sunrise
When I wake up with your hand inside mine
It's hard to say "good morning"
When it's followed with "goodbye"
(Just wanted to say "goodnight")

Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "goodnight"
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-oh
I try and hold on tight
'Cause it's just not time to say "goodnight"
Say "goodnight"

I'll face my fear of the cold nights
When you leave me behind
I felt your hands in my hair
I felt your breath on my neck
Yeah, I need to feel you again
(Just wanted to say "goodnight")
Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "goodnight"
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-oh
I try and hold on tight
'Cause it's just not time to say "goodnight"
Say "goodnight"

These eyes are closed again for yet another night
I wake up and I can feel you by my side
But I can't find you in the dark
When you're so far
Yeah, that's the hardest part
Here comes the hardest part

Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "goodnight"
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-oh
I try and hold on tight
'Cause it's just not time to say "goodnight"
Say "goodnight"
Our eyes fighting the light
But I'm not ready to say "goodnight"
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-oh
I try and hold on tight
'Cause it's just not time to say "goodnight"
Say "goodnight"

I mean, in what world do I go to sleep after you
And wake up before you?
I don’t even know how it happens
Well, I hope you’re having sweet dreams, and
You call me when you wake up5Embed
