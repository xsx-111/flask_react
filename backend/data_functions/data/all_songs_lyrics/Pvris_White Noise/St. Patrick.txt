St. Patrick Lyrics
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
Hey
Hey, hey

I know it's chemicals
That make me cling to you, cling to you
Ooh, and I need a miracle
To get away from you, 'way from you

I know it's chemicals
(That can make me cling to you, cling to you)
And I need a miracle
(I gotta stay with you, stay with you)
And I'm not spiritual
(But please stay)
'Cause I think you're a saint
And I think you're an angel

I said, ooh, ooh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
I said, ooh, ooh, ooh
You give me something to think about
That's not the shit in my head
You're a miracle
You're a miracle, a miracle
Transparent hands
Around my neck, at my neck, at myâ€”
Ooh, but I love the way
You let me breathe instead, breathe instead
(Around my neck, at my neck)

Take in your chemicals
(That can make me cling to you, cling to you)
You are a miracle
(I gotta stay with you, stay with you)
And I'm not spiritual
(But please stay)
'Cause you're a glimpse of bliss
A little taste of Heaven

I said, ooh, ooh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about (Hey, hey)
I said, ooh, ooh, ooh
You give me something to think about
That's not the shit in my head
You're a miracle
You're a miracle, a miracle
I said, ooh, ooh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about
I said, ooh, ooh, ooh
You give me something to think about
That's not the shit in my head
I need a miracle
To bring me back to you, back to you
Ooh, I know you're gone now
But I still wait for you, wait for you
(Hey, hey)

I said, ooh, ooh
You give me something to talk about
Something to talk about (Hey, hey)
I said, ooh, ooh, ooh
You give me something to think about
That's not the shit in my head
You're a miracle (Hey, hey)
You're a miracle, a miracle

I still wait, still wait for you
Ooh, I know you're gone now
But I still wait for you, wait for you17Embed
