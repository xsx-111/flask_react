My House Lyrics
I feel you in these walls
You're a cold air creepin' in
Chill me to my bones and skin
I heard you down the hall
But it's vacant when I'm lookin' in
Oh, who let you in?
You walk around like you own the place
But you never say anything
I caught you walkin' straight through my walls
Guess it was all my fault
I think I let you in

Never thought that I would feel like this
Such a mess when I'm in your presence
I've had enough, think you've been makin' me sick
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah
It's my house (My house)
And I think it's time to get out
It's my soul (It's my soul)
It isn't yours anymore
It's my house (My house)
I think it's time to get out
Yeah, I think it's time to get out
You're at my bedroom door
Heard your footsteps on the floor
Closer than ever before
And now you're in my room
You're a cold air creepin' through
Under sheets, avoiding you
You walk around, I can hear you pace
Circlin' my bed frame
Oh, but now, we're face-to-face
Head on my pillowcase
But darlin', you can't stay

Never thought that I would feel like this
Such a mess when I'm in your presence
I've had enough, think you've been makin' me sick
Gotta get you out of my system, yeah
It's my house (My house)
And I think it's time to get out
It's my soul (It's my soul)
It isn't yours anymore
It's my house (My house)
I think it's time to get out
Yeah, I think it's time to get out
Haven't you heard?
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
It's my soul (And I think it's time to get out)
Haven't you heard?
I'm not yours anymore
I'm not yours anymore
It's my house

I feel you in these walls
You're a cold air creepin' in
Chill me to my bones and skin

Never thought that I would feel like this
Such a mess when I'm in your presence
I've had enough, think you've been makin' me sick
It's my house (My house)
And I think it's time to get out
It's my soul (It's my soul)
It isn't yours anymore
It's my house (My house)
I think it's time to get out
Yeah, I think it's time to get out
Yeah, yeah, ooh, oh-oh
Yeah, I think it's time to get out13Embed
