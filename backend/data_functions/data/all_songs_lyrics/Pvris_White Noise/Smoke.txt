Smoke Lyrics
This isn't violence, this is just a war in my head
I give it time, but it never seems to end
I feel a fire in the back of my throat
So let's get covered in flames and play some games with the smoke
You said, "Don't you try to run right now
'Cause, baby, I could burn you down"

Yeah, you make your way into my veins
Course right through my limbs and dig your way into my brain
So in the second that you walk, walk into a room
I can't help myself from the things that you do

Oh, you're killing me right now
You're killing me, killing me right now
I think it's time you burn me down, oh
I love the things we do (We do) when it's just me and you
I'm burning up, burning up
Oh, burning up, yeah

Oh, you're killing me right now
I think it's time you burn me down
You're just a ghost of blissful feelings
A cloud of smoke that I keep breathing
An illusion, I'm losing you to the games in my mind
I see your face, an apparition
But now it's changed, shape shifting
Don't wanna open my eyes

(Hey)
Oh, yeah, oh
Oh, you're killing me right now
The things we do, me and you7Embed
