Mirrors Lyrics
White lights are too bright
I just wanna see a trace or an outline
Say your name into a mirror three times
Said it three times, said it three times
But when you float above my body
I can see, I can see clearly
Straight through the ceiling, ceiling

Darlin', don't be so shy
I'll see you at midnight
And when I close my eyes
I said it three times, said it three times
You make my world spin, placebo feelings
And in the morning, I'll wait to see you again
I'll wait to see you again
(I'll, I'll, I'll)

Your dead eyes before mine
The way they're missing their whites, yeah, they're just right
I know you're dead inside
And that's what I like, yeah, I like
But when you float above my body
Standin' up right above me
I don't feel so lonely, lonely
Darlin', don't be so shy
I'll see you at midnight
And when I close my eyes
I said it three times, said it three times
You make my world spin, placebo feelings
And in the morning, I'll wait to see you again
I'll wait to see you again
(I'll, I'll, I'll)

And in the morning
I hope I see you by my side
In the sunlight
With my own eyes
And I go searchin' through reflections for your outline
But it's just mine, but it's just mine
I know you're dead inside
But you make me feel alive

I'll wait to see you again

Darlin', don't be so shy (Darlin')
I'll see you at midnight (Midnight)
And when I close my eyes
I said it three times, said it three times (La, la, la, la, la, oh)
You make my world spin, placebo feelings (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
And in the morning, I'll wait to see you again
Yeah, I'll wait to see you again13Embed
