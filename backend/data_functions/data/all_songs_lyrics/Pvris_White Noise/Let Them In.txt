Let Them In Lyrics
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You're a fire
Burning up in my brain
You can't be tamed for me
You struck a match and left me to burn
It doesn't feel right
To feel the weight of your world
The weight of your world in my spine
You've had me going out of my mind

I wanna feel something
That's not the touch of your breath on my neck
I wanna feel something
That's not the weight of your world in my head
And all the walls are caving in
And I feel you entering
I shouldn't give in
But I let you win, I let you in

Find a new place
Another space to invade
Another brain to decay
With your presence, with your ghost (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm growing sick in the head
Tryna push you out, tryna push you out of it
I said it and I'll say it again
I won't let you in
I wanna feel something
That's not the touch of your breath on my neck
I wanna feel something
That's not the weight of your world in my head
And all the walls are caving in
And I feel you entering
I shouldn't give in
But I let you win, I let you in

(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Caving in, entering
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Caving in, entering

I wanna feel something
That's not the touch of your breath on my neck
I wanna feel something
That's not the weight of your world in my head
And all the walls are caving in
And I feel you entering
I shouldn't give in
But I let you win, I let you in4Embed
