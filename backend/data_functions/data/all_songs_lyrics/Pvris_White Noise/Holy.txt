Holy Lyrics
Yeah, you've got it all
But you've got it all wrong
No, you don't know
You're a poor unfortunate soul
Oh, I know
You make it seem that you feel whole
So they don't know
You're a poor unfortunate soul
Yeah, you put on a faith facade
Think you're holy when you're not
I hate to break it to you, baby
But you're simply lost
You can right all the wrongs just to feel you belong
But simply calling out sins don't bring you closer to God

You're just a ghost at most
A set of empty bones
Searching for anything and everything to make you feel whole
When it gets cold, oh-oh-oh

You don't know
No, you don't know
Oh, you're all alone
You poor unfortunate soul
You can't control where your body lets you go
Oh, you're all alone
You poor unfortunate soul
And you say that I've got it all wrong
'Cause you just know
I'm a poor unfortunate soul
But there's no way that there's weight in the words that you preach
When you're claiming your faith and you contradict your speech
So I sit here and listen to your tongue and cheek
I know that when you sit and pray, you're only praying for keeps

'Cause you're a ghost at most
A set of empty bones
Searching for anything and everything to make you feel whole
When it gets cold, oh-oh-oh

You don't know
No, you don't know
Oh, you're all alone
You poor unfortunate soul
You can't control where your body lets you go
Oh, you're all alone
You poor unfortunate soul

You're shallow and empty and filled with regret
I think that chest must be heavy from that cross on your neck
You only wear 'cause you're wary of what comes next after your death
Don't think I didn't notice
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Don't think I didn't notice
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Don't think I didn't know
You just a po-o-o-or, poor unfortunate
So-o-o-oul, poor unfortunate
Oh-oh-oh-oh, poor unfortunate
So-o-o-oul, poor unfortunate

And you've got it all (Po-o-o-or, poor unfortunate)
You've got it all wrong (So-o-o-oul, poor unfortunate)
No, you've never known, known, known, known (Po-o-o-or, poor unfortunate)
You're a poor unfortunate soul (So-o-o-oul, poor unfortunate)
(Ooh, oh-oh-oh)
Don't think I didn't notice
(Ooh, oh-oh-oh)16Embed
