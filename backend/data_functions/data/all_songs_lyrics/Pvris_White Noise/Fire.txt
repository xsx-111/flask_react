Fire Lyrics
Don't blame your death on the shit in your head
That you claimed ate you like a virus for days on end
Watched you decay, watched you waste away
Who'd you think you'd fool, baby, digging your own grave?
So go ahead, yeah, just drop dead
And while you're tryna fool the whole world don't forget that
You'll decay, and you'll waste away
You can't cheat death when you're digging your own grave

You're out of line
Buried yourself alive and expected to be fine
You can't rewind
When you're choking on your own dirt, begging for your life
Your bridges are burning (All your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning (All the tables are turning)
You started a fire
And you're burning up, up, burning up (Yeah)
Burning up, up, burning up
Burning up, up, burning up (Hey, hey)
Burning up, up, burning up
Burning up, up, burning up

What you give is what you get
And in your case, that's nothing but guilt and regret
And all the flames, you kept in your brain
Came out your lips and sent you straight into your own grave
You were a walking, talking corpse at best
And I swear, I couldn't wait to get you off my chest
And when you asked us why we couldn't look you in your eyes
It's hard to find life in something that's already died
You're out of line
Buried yourself alive and expected to be fine
You can't rewind
When you're choking on your own dirt, begging for your life
Your bridges are burning (All your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning (All the tables are turning)
You started a fire
And you're burning up, up, burning up (Yeah)
Burning up, up, burning up
Burning up, up, burning up (Hey, hey)
Burning up, up, burning up
Burning up, up, burning up

Ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah
You started a fire

You're out of line
Buried yourself alive and expected to be fine
You can't rewind
When you're choking on your own dirt, begging for your life
Your bridges are burning (All your bridges are burning)
And all the tables are turning (All the tables are turning)
You started a fire
And you're burning up, up, burning up (Yeah, yeah)
Burning up, up, burning up
Burning up, up, burning up (Hey, hey)
Burning up, up, burning up
Burning up, up, burning up10Embed
