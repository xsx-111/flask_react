Ghosts Lyrics
I'm the one with the ghosts in my bed
But they only come alive at night
Stuck in my sheets, an accustomed coffin
I swear that I'll be fine
I'll be fine in the daylight
If I change and I start to fade
And all the green in my eyes desaturate
It's my head, not my heart that's strayed
I'm sorry I keep pushing you away

You're the one at the foot of my bed
Trying to keep me alive at night
Using words as a comforter, you said
"I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight"
But they, they sink into my skin
Pushing you out just to make their way in
I've grown sick of this fight so frequent
If you can't help it, then I'll push you away

Why can't you stay?
Up against these things I can't see
They don't compare
Make me believe, make me believe
Why can't you stay?
Up against these things I can't see
They don't compare
Make me believe, make me believe
I'm sorry I keep pushing
Yeah, I'm sorry I keep pushing
(Now you're up against the ghosts in my head, in my head)
I'm sorry I keep pushing
(Now you're up against the ghosts in my head, in my head)
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
(Hey, hey)

Oh, why can't you stay?
Up against these things I can't see
They don't compare
Make me believe, make me believe
Why can't you stay?
Up against these things I can't see
They don't compare
Why can't you stay?
Make me believe, make me believe
Make me believe, make me believe7Embed
