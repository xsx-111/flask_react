The Heavenly Blue Flu Lyrics
Responsibility
I never tried
Probability
But well disguised

Never learned about the darkness
We had to find it on our own
I want to go unnoticed, untouched, unknown
Left alone

What some call love
Is only dust to me
What some call love
Never meant that much to me

You laughed at what I said
My truth will die
United with the dead
RIP
Buried you'll never find

Never learned about the darkness
We had to find it on our own
I want to go unnoticed, untouched, unknown
Left alone
What some call love
Is only dust to me
What some call love
Never meant that much to me

Only walking on bridges built to fall
Running in circles like rats stuck in the wall

What some call love
Is only dust to me
What some call love
Never meant that much to meEmbed
