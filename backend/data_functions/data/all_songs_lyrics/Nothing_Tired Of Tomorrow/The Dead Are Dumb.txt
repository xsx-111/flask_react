The Dead Are Dumb LyricsAlways try to keep up
Always fall behind
Belly pains and headaches
Inside you
Isn’t it quite the same
And isn’t it such a shame
Too heavy for the lightness
But weightless in the rain
All our words are wasted
Never fails to fail me
Never say never
Loathing phase, self-inflicted pain
I’d never - oh, I’d never
Isn’t it quite the same
And isn’t it such a shame
Too heavy for the lightness
But weightless in the rain
All our words are wasted
Isn’t it quite the same
And isn’t it such a shame
Too heavy for the lightness
But weightless in the rain
All our words are wastedEmbed
