Tired of Tomorrow LyricsLeaving from LA
Turned into a graveyard today
So the train moves East
Where the mouths of Heaven
Devour me
Stranded in today
Clawing from the outside
And I’m tired of
Tomorrow on the inside
Draped in rusty chains
And the faintest of skin
We’ll still pretend
We’ll take the war to bed
The children will come
Children will go
Sifting through decay
Rejoice if we are allied
But our everything
Is empty on the inside1Embed
