Vertigo Flowers LyricsAnd I hate
Everything you’re saying
Anxiety
It’s all about me
Watch out for those who dare to say
That everything will be okay
Watch out for those who want to be
Anything at all
And I hate
Everything you’re saying
Anxiety
It’s all about me
Watch out for those who dare to say
That everything will be okay
Watch out for those who want to be
Anything at all
They’re coming for meEmbed
