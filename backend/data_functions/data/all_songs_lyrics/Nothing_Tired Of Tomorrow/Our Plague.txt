Our Plague LyricsWater colored fingers
Paint my picture
Interlocking tightly
Candles flicker
Trembling hands move with mercy
They will not
Sing to me
Promise I could make it on my own
Throwing flowers at her
My worst behavior
Change my tired patterns
If you could change yours as well
Promise I could make it aloneEmbed
