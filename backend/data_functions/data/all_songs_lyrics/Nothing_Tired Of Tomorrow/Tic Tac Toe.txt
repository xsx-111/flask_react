Tic Tac Toe LyricsWill you wait for me?
Will you wait for me to try?
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me to lie?
If I wait for you
I'll be waiting all the time
If you wait for me
I'll be wasting all your time
Will you stay with me?
Will you stay another day?
Can I kneel towards you?
There is nowhere left to pray
If I wait for you
I'll be waiting all the time
If you wait for me
I'll be wasting all your time
What I've spun
Will come undone
What I've spun
Will come undone again
Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me to try?
If I wait for you
I'll be waiting all the time
If you wait for me
I'll be wasting all your time
Would you stay with me
If I'm wasted all the time?
If you wait for me
I'll be wasting all your timeEmbed
