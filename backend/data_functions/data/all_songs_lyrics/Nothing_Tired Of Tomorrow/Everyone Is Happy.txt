Everyone Is Happy LyricsDefy your solitude
The ghost of you
Is moving through
Climb Ladders
Of your thorns
To reach your rose
Is what I chose
I suppose
Your sorrow
Was empty
But I see
Is still heavy
Kneeling
And praying
Are the same
You’re just begging
And that’s a sin
Tell me again
How you needed a friend
Again
I don’t think of youEmbed
