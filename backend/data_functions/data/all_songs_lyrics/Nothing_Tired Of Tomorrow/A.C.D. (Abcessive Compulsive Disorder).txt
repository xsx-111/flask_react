A.C.D. (Abcessive Compulsive Disorder) LyricsSwallow corrosive confection
Decay, rotting in the womb
I can wallow in your filth
I live to
Here we are again
Will someone find a cure cause
You know me and you know I am not well
I always knew I'd eventually hurt you
Infection, my bacteria
Always give you all to me
Old aches from your new mistakes
Same mistakes
Here we are again
Will someone find a cure cause
You know me and you know I am not well
I always knew I'd eventually hurt you
And I will leave you
With a bad taste in your mouth
Here we are again
Will someone find a cure cause
You know me and you know I am not well
I always knew I'd eventually hurt you
Here we are again
Will someone find a cure cause
You know me and you know I am not well
I always knew I'd eventually hurt youEmbed
