Fear the Future Lyrics
When the Earth split in two
I was I, you were you
I run for you, run for me, too
When the wall rose and fell
And the oceans all swell
I run for you, run for me, too

Come on, Sir, just give me an answer
Come on, Sir, now I need an answer
I won't be gone with the goners
Come on, Sir, just give me the answer
I fear the future

When the club come and go
To the top of your skull
I run for you, what can I do?
When the war started new
In our bed, in our room
I'll come for you, come for me, too

Come on, Sir, just give me the answer
Come on, Sir, now I need an answer
My baby's lost to the monster
Come on, Sir, just give me the answer
I fear the future1Embed
