Young Lover Lyrics
How long has this been going on?
I found you in the bathtub with your clothing on
Oh, so what? Your mother did a number
So, I get gloves of rubber to clean up the spill, yeah

No, I, young lover, I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover, I wish that I was your drug
No, I, young lover, I miss the taste of your tongue
No, I, young lover, I wish love was enough, enough

You say "You got no room to talk, babe"
You're boozin' on a midday and I don't see no cake
Oh, but these pills, I can't even pronounce them
Your thousand watts of light dim then you're gone again, yeah

No, I, young lover, I'm begging you please to wake up
Young lover, I wish that I was your drug
No, I, young lover, I miss the taste of your tongue
No, I, young lover, I wish love was enough, enough, enough

We were in Paris, the Eiffel was shining
All that I wanted was lying on tiling
I heard the robins and thought they were sirens
Wake up, young lover, I thought you were dyin'
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover
No, I, young lover6Embed
