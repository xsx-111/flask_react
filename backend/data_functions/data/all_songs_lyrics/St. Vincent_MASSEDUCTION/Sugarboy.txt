Sugarboy Lyrics
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Boys
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Girls

Sugarboy, I'm in need
How I wish for somethin' sweet
Sugarboy, I am weak
Got a crush on tragedy

Oh, here I go
A casualty hangin' on from the balcony
Oh, here I go
Makin' a scene, oh here I am, your pain machine

I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you (Girls)
I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you
I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you (Girls)
I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you
Sugargirl, figurine
Pledge all your allegiance to me
Sugargirl, dissolve in me
Got a crush from kicked-in teeth

Oh, here I go
A casualty hangin' on from the balcony
Oh, here I go
Makin' a scene, oh here I am, your pain machine

I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you (Girls)
I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you
I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you (Girls)
I am a lot like you (Boys)
I am alone like you
