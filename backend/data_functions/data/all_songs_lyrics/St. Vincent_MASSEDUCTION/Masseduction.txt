Masseduction Lyrics
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗
政権の腐敗
政権の腐敗-敗

Black saint, sinner lady
Playin' knock-off soul
A punk rock romantic
Slumped on the kitchen floor
Nuns in stress positions
Smokin' Marlboros
Lolita is weeping
"The bride is beautiful"

Mass seduction
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Smilin' nihilist met
Angry glass half full
Drinkin' Manic Panic
Singin' Boatman's Call
Teenage, Christian virgins
Holdin' out their tongues
Paranoid secretions
Fallin' on basement rugs

Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Oh, what a bore to be so adored
Oh, what a bore to be so adored

Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I can't turn off what turns me on
Mass seduction
I hold you like a weapon
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on

Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
I don't turn off what turns me on
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction
Mass destruction9Embed
