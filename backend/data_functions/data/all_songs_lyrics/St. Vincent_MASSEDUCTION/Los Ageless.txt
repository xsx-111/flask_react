Los Ageless Lyrics
In Los Ageless, the winter never comes
In Los Ageless, the mothers milk their young
But I can keep runnin'
Oh, I can keep runnin', ah-ah, oh, ah-ah
The lost sages hang out by the bar
Burn the pages of unwritten memoirs
But I can keep runnin'
Oh, I can keep runnin' ah-ah, oh, ah-ah

How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind, too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind, too? (Oh)

The last days of the sunset superstars
Girls in cages playin' their guitars
But how can I leave?
I just follow the hood of my car, oh, ah-ah
In Los Ageless, the waves they never break
They build and build until you don't have no escape
But how can I leave?
I just follow my hood to the sea, go to sleep
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind, too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind, too? (Oh)

Oh Lola, we really did it now
I'm a monster and you're my sacred cow
Oh, I can keep running
No, I can't keep on running, ah-ah, oh, ah-ah

How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind, too?
How can anybody have you?
How can anybody have you and lose you?
How can anybody have you and lose you
And not lose their mind?
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to tell you I love you and it comes out all sick
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to tell you I love you but it comes out all sick
I guess that's just me, honey, I guess that's how I'm built
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament
I try to write you a love song but it comes out a lament17Embed
