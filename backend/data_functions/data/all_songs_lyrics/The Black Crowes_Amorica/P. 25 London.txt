P. 25 London LyricsI am a cobweb
In the corner of the room
I tell you I built myself a boat baby
So c'mon and cry me a monsoon
Get busy on it
And make it deep
Chorus:
Imagine how surprised all the kids will be
Empty bottles, saviors they crawl
That has always been and will always be
There's a hornet's nest in my head
Come and save me
If I don't say nothing
You say now tell us what to do
So I tell ya'll this is just how I live
Someone else calls it the news
But that's yesterday
Yesterday's news
Chorus:
Imagine how surprised all the kids will be
Empty bottles, saviors they crawl
That has always been and will always be
There's a hornet's nest in my head
Come and save meEmbed
