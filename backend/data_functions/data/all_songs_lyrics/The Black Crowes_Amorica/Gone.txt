Gone LyricsSave me
From this season's dead air
Take me
Blind naked scared
Want you to burn me, burn me baby
Cover your eyes with my ashes
C'mon why don't you pray for me
Sit back and watch my divine spark flash
Chorus:
Gone
Good riddance I'm gone
Gone in a wasted way
Wasted my way I'm gone
Push and pull on me baby
With your fingernails full of fur
I want you to stab me
Do it, do it, 'cause you know it don't hurt
Chorus
Jinx me, jinx me baby
Beautiful like a fool
C'mon and remove me
Dilated and burned
