She Gave Good Sunflower LyricsI've been lost in the headlights
All night long
Said I've felt taller, yes I heard
The dealer's song
Say babe don't mark me absent
I only missed out by a fraction
Be the sun that bursts through my clouds
It's hard enough just living on this ground
Chorus:
Say don't pretend to me
I beg and I plead, your sunflower I need
Thought nothing would surprise me
I was wrong now I see
Come on baby and just do me if you please
This made me reminiscing
About the honey we made
I feel warm in your blizzard
And your flood I crave
I won't abuse my anger
I promise you no lecture
Come be the sun bursting through my clouds
It's hard enough just living on the ground
