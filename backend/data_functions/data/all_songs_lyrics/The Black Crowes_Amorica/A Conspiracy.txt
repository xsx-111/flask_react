A Conspiracy Lyrics
Did you ever hear
The one about last year?
It was all a lie
Ain't it funny how the time flies?
What we gonna do, baby
What's left for us to prove
I've never stolen nothing
No not a thing
I always tried
To stay away from this year's big thing
Ain't as easy as it seems
To find a mutual dream

Can you tell me wrong from right?
Do you know when to freeze or take flight?
Can you tell me more or less?
I got to know, confess

Don't neglect me, no no
Come on and be, be my conspiracy
No no, don't neglect me, baby
Come on and be, be my conspiracy
Now you got a question about your answer, yeah yeah yeah
Say try your Adam's apple
You talk it try it like it right
So now you want to fight? Well alright
Let's step outside
I got tradition
It's an addition
My definition, it don't hold me back
What you think about that
What you don't understand
This is a very old land

Can you tell me wrong from right
Do you know when to freeze or take flight
Can you tell me more or less
I got to know, confess

Don't neglect me, no no
Come on and be, be my conspiracy
No no, don't neglect me, baby
Come on and be, be my conspiracyEmbed
