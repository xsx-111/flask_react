Ballad in Urgency LyricsHere with me
And this price you pay
Just a wishful dream could be blown away
Ask yourself for better or worse
Because what's the use if it's just good luck
A black cat has crossed my path
Tell me what's good luck about that
Chorus:
Hate and greed
Swollen and sweet
Let's start this misery
If that's where you wanna be
Fear and love
From down or form up above
Come to me
Come to me
I bet you please
Come set me free
Excuse me please
For my definition
But deeper still are my convictions
Urgently I wait to hear an answer
While I misconduct
A sad lost anthem
An anthem like you have never heard
Have you heard something so absurd
