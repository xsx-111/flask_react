Descending Lyrics
Have mercy baby
I'm descending again
Open your eyes, baby
'Cause this time it's sink or it's swim
No sermons on ascending
No verdict on deceit
No selfish memorandum
No confusion for me, not for me

Curses, curses and clues
A feast, a feast for fools
Curses, curses and clues
A feast, a feast for fools

So have mercy baby
And hand me down
Well it was just a few years ago
You'd hand me up and map right out of town
But I would let it slide
Slide like mercury
Silver and quick, baby
Poisonous and deadly, so deadly
Curses, curses and clues
Just a feast, a feast for fools
Curses, curses and clues
A feast, a feast for fools
Curses, clues
Just a feast, a feast for fools
Curses, curses and clues
A feast, a feast for foolsEmbed
