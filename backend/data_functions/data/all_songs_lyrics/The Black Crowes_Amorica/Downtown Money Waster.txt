Downtown Money Waster LyricsTo my low down downtown
Money waster
Your only saving grace
Is that I like to taste ya
But your flower is spoiled
Too easy to make ya
You got a .38 and your book of revelations
I got a .44 and a lead of temptation
Chorus:
I am a rounder, like to round around
Two for one at the store on the corner
Little girl like to drink and sniffin' powders
Like the bars that stay open after hours
Like the boys that go 24-7
Too many late nights and you don't go to heaven
