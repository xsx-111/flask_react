Tied Up and Swallowed LyricsI forgot I found you tied up and swallowed
A mess with the magic and the knot
You touch my teeth and say you like the way I bite ya
Sin, skin, sounds wrong but it's not
Everybody says that you're such a pity
Well baby, they, they out to know
Everybody says you're such a pity
Tell ya baby, they, they out to know
Touch from up above and touch between your legs
But which one, baby, burns
So you've been touched so many times so many ways
Come on baby, who gets hurt
Everybody says that you're such a pity
Well baby, they, they out to know
Everybody says you're such a pity
Tell ya baby, they, they out to know
See ya
Everybody says that you're such a pity
Well baby, they, they out to know
Everybody says you're such a pity
Tell ya baby, they, they out to knowEmbed
