The Fall Lyrics
Leaves are falling, the wind is blowing so cold
The end, cycle, peel to the core
Vision faces disintegrator
It all came back to me
None could be lower, crawling under
The weight I can't take
I eat all, wild and virgin
The world carries the tears
Again the glory collapsing in silence
I'll be counting the layers

And the millions of mirrors you're sending
Reflecting rays of sun in dark time
Greater spirits from above are watching
Let us drink those tears, may we grow strong
Sometimes in our love disappointed
Fool ourselves in blind pretension
Sever ties to the possible options
Destroy the bridges to the green land

Fall to the ground
All dies again
A circle of blood and power recycled
Greater vision awaits a new coming
Melting rocks on the lives hard-working
And all shall die, transform
Nothing left to steal, no rewarding
Competition over no cheating
This great opened eye underwater
Is rising slowly, embrace all over

Fall to the ground
All dies again

Leaves are falling, the wind is blowing so cold
The end, cycle, peel to the coreEmbed
