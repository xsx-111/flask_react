Explosia Lyrics
Go

Jealousy will crush you to the bones
Unless you open up and let it go
I've only seen too much of it
I'm bursting open while you set the tone

You ignored this fury too long, I explode
Bring back to life this anger, let it grow
Put aside mind traps and false beliefs
These heavyweights created pull you down

The mask you wear is falling
Try on and watch it fall
Hands down, you feel the moment
Releasing out a lifetime

All prayers to these gods
While the tide is growing high
Will you make us stronger
When you strike us down?2Embed
