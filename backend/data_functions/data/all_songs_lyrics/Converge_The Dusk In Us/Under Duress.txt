Under Duress Lyrics
Don't need a helmet if I have my heart
Don't need your war to find peace
I don't need to learn to live in compromise
I will never kneel and kiss your ring

The sickness spreads under duress
Compassion bends under duress

Wouldn't need a gun if you didn't have one
Don't need you to serve or protect
I am not a number just patiently waiting
To enter the belly of the beast

The sickness spreads under duress
Compassion bends under duress

The delusions of control
Are rotting the root of the tree
It's the fear that keeps you there
And it's mine that sets me free
The delusions of control
Are rotting the root of the tree
It's the fear that keeps you there
And it's mine that sets me free

The sickness spreads under duress
Compassion bends under duress

Don't need a helmet if I have my heart
Don't need your war to find peace
I don't need to learn to live in compromise
I will never kneel and kiss your ring2Embed
