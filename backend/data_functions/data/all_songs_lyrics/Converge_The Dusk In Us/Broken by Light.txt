Broken by Light LyricsEmotion sickness afterglow
A darkness reigns over all
But it's the white noise harmony
That I find so troubling
And the echo of that whisper
Said how much better it used to be
As a petal fell from the rose
Withering as a long forgotten dream
Phantom broadcast from the past
Predicts the end of all good things
But it's the white noise harmony
That I find so troubling
And the echo of that whisper
Said how much better it used to be
As a petal fell from the rose
Withering as a long forgotten dream
Broken by light
Broken by light
Broken by light
And the echo of that whisper
Said how much better it used to be
As a petal fell from the rose
Withering as a long forgotten dream
Broken by light
Broken by lightEmbed
