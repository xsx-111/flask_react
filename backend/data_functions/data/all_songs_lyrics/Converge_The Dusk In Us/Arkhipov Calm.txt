Arkhipov Calm Lyrics
Fresh faced oligarch, we have grown worlds apart
My Arkhipov calm will serve me in due time
Turbulence shakes the teeth from the chaos that you speak
With every barb that you threw, I saw you list to the side
And I won't sink with you, I have so much more to do
Promises, the lost cause, but the bones will heal in time
My Arkhipov calm will serve me in time

Fresh faced oligarch, we have grown worlds apart
My Arkhipov calm will serve me in due time
Turbulence shakes the teeth from the chaos that you speak
With every barb that you threw, I saw you list to the side
And I won't sink with you, I have so much more to do
Promises, the lost cause, but the bones will heal in time
My Arkhipov calm will serve me in time

You see the patience is a test, it separates boys from men
And my Arkhipov calm will serve me in time
It's the fires that we quell that save us from our hells
It's the wars that we don't fight that keeps love alive
My Arkhipov calm will serve me in timeEmbed
