Cannibals LyricsOpportunism
Will spread within the land
If the parasitic heart
That beats in all of us
Is unrivaled
Crocodile tears
Extinguish empathy
And we will not survive
If this is all there is
Feral animals
Must not ever be unrivaled
We are just cannibals
If there is nothing left to love
We are just cannibals
If there is nothing left to love
Cannibals
Cannibals
Cannibals
