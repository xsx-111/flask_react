Trigger Lyrics
The sting of pain ripens with age
Into a withered recompense
Doesn't make a dent in the path you paved
Just a flower at the grave of indifference

The world's a trigger seemingly without end
You have to bury the gun to finally make sense of it

No way forward through tangle of veins
Just through the thorns and brutal truth
Your apologies mean nothing to me
When a burning bridge can't be crossed

The world's a trigger seemingly without end
You have to bury the gun to finally make sense of it

Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?

The world's a trigger seemingly without end
You have to bury the gun to finally make sense of it
Your apologies mean nothing to me
When a burning bridge can't be crossed

The world's a trigger seemingly without end
You have to bury the gun to finally make sense of it

Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?

The world's a trigger seemingly without end
You have to bury the gun to finally make sense of it

Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it?
Tell me was it fucking worth it?Embed
