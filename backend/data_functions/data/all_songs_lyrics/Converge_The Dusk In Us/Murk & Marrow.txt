Murk & Marrow LyricsJoy escapes through the tangled days (Iron demands fire)
Youth escapes through the blur of pain (Iron demands fire)
Smoke cloaks the sky, the bell explodes
A shudder runs through, we have nowhere to turn
When the luster is gone and life loses sight
We cannot escape the slipping of time
Exodus of eden led by convenience
The murk and marrow are all that we know
When the luster is gone and life loses sight
Nothing will escape the slipping of time
Joy escapes through the tangled days (Iron demands fire)
Youth escapes through the blur of pain (Iron demands fire)
Smoke cloaks the sky, the bell explodes
A shudder runs through, we have nowhere to turn
When the luster is gone and life loses sight
We cannot escape the slipping of time
Exodus of eden led by convenience
The murk and marrow are all that we know
When the luster is gone and life loses sight
Nothing will escape the slipping of time
