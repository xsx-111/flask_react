Thousands of Miles Between Us LyricsWe fell in and out of touch
Our distance never meant too much
I always wanted to be more
Than what you were searching for
I know you never wanted this
But thank you for giving me your best
I knew that you always loved me
Though you never said that you did
There is no place in this world to hide
My shattered smile that life provides
Stand up straight take it on the chin
Pick up my teeth and start again
I never knew the reasons why
Somewhere we both stopped trying
But when you said that you were dying
I said that I loved you
There is no place in this world to hide
My shattered smile that life provides
Stand up straight take it on the chin
Pick up my teeth and start again
Just start again
Numbness makes some sense
Without a consequence
Something not meant to be
Found a way to breathe
Numbness makes some sense
Without a consequence
Something not meant to be
Found a way to breathe
Thousands of miles between us
Between us
There is no place in this world to hide
My shattered smile that life provides
Stand up straight take it on the chin
Pick up my teeth and start again
Just start again1Embed
