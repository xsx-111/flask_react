I Can Tell You About Pain LyricsSick matriarch
We are worlds apart
Your dysfunction rips
The roots from my heart
I swear that I'm trying
I swear that I'm trying, but
You don't know what my pain feels like
And our memory dims
A bitter sting sets in
The resentment grows
And my blood thickens
I swear that I'm trying
I swear that I'm trying, but
You don't know what my pain feels like
You don't know what my pain feels like
I just need to leave, just have to find a way out
I just have to run, just need to fight my way out
I just need to leave, just have to find a way out
I just have to run, just need to fight my way out
Stay calm, stay calm, keep your head down
Stay calm, stay calm, keep your head down
I just need to leave, just have to find a way out
I just have to run, just need to fight my way out
You don’t know what my pain feels like
You don’t know what my pain feels like
You don’t know what my pain feels like
You don’t know what my pain feels likeEmbed
