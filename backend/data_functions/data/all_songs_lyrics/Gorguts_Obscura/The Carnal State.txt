The Carnal State LyricsOnce my earthly pass
Over and stuck in the past
I will become one with the ground
Dust, I'll be
For those who've seen my earthly pass
Taking place in the past
Coldness will lead to emptiness
Free I'll be from this carnal state
The stench of mediocrity soars
Once tangible vanish
The lucid pure calmness of ecstasy
The carnal state, my only grief
The carnal state
Entrenched in the logical
Carnal state
The epitome of a comfortless epoch
Transcend
Dreamless in this mind of flesh
Mind of flesh
The fragments of a worthless epoch
Collapse
The stench of mediocrity soars
Once tangible vanish
The lucid pure calmness of ecstasy
The carnal state, my only griefEmbed
