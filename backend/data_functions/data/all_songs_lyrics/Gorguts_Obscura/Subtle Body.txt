Subtle Body LyricsVolatile incarnation intangible
Ghostly shades aerate
In the air, penetrates
Transparent fleshless beings cast intangible
Mortal eye horrified by this spectral light
Enhance, Enhance
Cloudy, obscure conception
Floating, Floating
Unspeakable perception
Volatile infiltration invisible
Beyond sight and demise
Shall transcend darkened minds
Existence, being transposed to invisible
Terms of life, once arrived, I will
Bring your spectral flight
Sweet silence
Crawling animation
Sweet serenity
Unearthly variation
Embrace, embrace
Futile fascination
The flight enhance
Increasing perversion
Volatile incarnation intangible
Beyond sight and demise
Have trancend, Darkened minds
Transparent fleshless beings cast intangible
Terms of life, now arrived
Brought your spectral flightEmbed
