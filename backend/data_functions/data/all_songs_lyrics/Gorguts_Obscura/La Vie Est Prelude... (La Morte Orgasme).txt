La Vie Est Prelude... (La Morte Orgasme) LyricsThe incoherent system of life
Structured in my self dark ideology
"But why am I sombre with pride?"
It may be a prelude to a symphony
Through this prelude Carnal Confinement
Anguish was my closer friend
Once into the world of breathingless
I'll be glad to meet my end
My flesh, I overwhelm
As I rise in ecstasy
Proceed into the realm
Of blissful immortality
Winds of pureness I inhale
How can they love this life so miserable?
I neglect my being
How can they trust this God so feeble?
The inner belief now I deny
I structured in myself my proper entity
Inner-prelude increases my will to fly
Sounds of Blackness, my energy
Through this prelude Carnal Confinement
Anguish was my closer friend
Once into the world of breathingless
I'll be glad to meet my endEmbed
