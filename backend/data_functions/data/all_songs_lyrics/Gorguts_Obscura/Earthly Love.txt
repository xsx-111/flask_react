Earthly Love LyricsFlesh the feeble flesh confines the pain and soul
Vault in which, the earthly way, I bear
Earthly Love my denial
Tears as a gift upon my mirror
Bright... The pureness of the unperpetual
The meaningless heat of flesh, I ignore
Reflection of betrayal
Fear as a gift, a creeping splendour
Flows of ecstasies within the succubus
The carnal healings of the soul
Earthly form of illusion
Flesh, my desires a living radiance
Must of ecstasies the mankind's incubus
The carnal addictions of the soul
Concrete form of sorrow
Impure malignant indignation
In my dreams, earthly love seems so bright
In my nights, earthly love I deny
Earthly love... carnal bliss
Which I'll have inside of me until my end
(repeat 1st verse)
Earthly love...carnal bliss
Which I'll have inside of me till my end1Embed
