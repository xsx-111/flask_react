Nostalgia LyricsLatest being drowned
In fictive degradation
Coming depression revolved
Around an Earth
Nostalgia excludes the whole
As spleen takes over me
Resound, the echoes of my threnodies
And then the fact of being
Has no longer meaning
The hymns of light
They'll sing once I'll be gone
Reverie appears cause
Existence collapse
Nostalgia
Sadness shall obnubilate
Nostalgia
Sadness, feels, the desolated
Desperately lost within
Lament, pain and misery
The more lies burden lives
The more I am dying
The realm of light
I'll reach once I'll...
Latest feeling drowned
In lucid contradiction
Coming relation revolved
Around a heart
Nostalgia
Excludes the whole
