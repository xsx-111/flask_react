Faceless Ones LyricsThe granted land forsaken
I cross the threshold of the faceless ones
Lost in the twilight, confinement in emptiness
The granted flesh abandoned
I shall reborn as a faceless one
Darkly, splendid world, confinement in rapture
Unbearable pain I share
My carnal past I deny
Timeless life They share
A rebirth through demise
Fearless to the grave
It brought me to a new level
Instead of crying the dead
I see further in the cyclone's eye
Lost in the twilight
Confinement in emptiness
The granted land forsaken
I cross the threshold of the faceless ones
Darkly, splendid world
Confinement in rapture
The granted flesh abandoned
I shall reborn as a faceless one1Embed
