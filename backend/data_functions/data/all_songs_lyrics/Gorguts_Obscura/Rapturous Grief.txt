Rapturous Grief LyricsDead with pride
Hopelessness behind... I ascent
Feeble minds
Regret in their eyes... They repent
Inner horizon
I glorify my death in peaceful solitude
Obscure concept of blissful imagery
Rapturous Grief
As my soul rises, transparency I reach...
Far from this world, I'll be
Lost within darkness
Timeless dormancy is
Where now I shall dwell
Cast beyond mortals
The faceless ones, I meet
The faceless ones are cleansing me
Grotesque earthly love behind
As my soul rises, i leave the sun behind
Splendid fluid transparency ashore
Within darkness, I dwell
The carnal state, I escape
Life is now a part of past extracted from me
The carnal state I forsake
Death is now a part that
Last longer than life and its misery
Mindless soul
Pure consciousness
My internal dream was my eternal fear
Inner horizon
I glorify my death in peaceful solitude
Obscure concept of blissful imagery
Rapturous Grief
Dead with pride
Hopelessness behind... I ascent
Feeble minds
Regret in their eyes... They repent...Embed
