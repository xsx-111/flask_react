The Art of Sombre Ecstasy LyricsBuild the passage way through the art
A sombre decay, a collection of mind
A collection of mind
Once life fades to shapeless
As a light
Through this path of pureness
Now I rise

Death is white, within
Creep is bright consciousness without mind
A sombre delight, a repulsion of mind
A repulsion of mind
Once life fades to shapeless
As a light
Earthly lies and sadness
