Wind Up Space LyricsI can't wait
I can't wait for the time to break
Use it for a motorbike
You'll spin right out of sight
You'll never have been where you'll be
You go back to the faceless ride
Wind up space
Wind up space to go from place to place
Dream that you died
It takes you out of your mind
The black walls of space take me all the way1Embed
