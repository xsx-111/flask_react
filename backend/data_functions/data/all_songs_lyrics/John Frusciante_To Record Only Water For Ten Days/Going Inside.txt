Going Inside Lyrics
You don't throw your life away
Going inside
You get to know who's watchin' you
And who besides you resides
In your body
Where you're slow
Where you go doesn't matter
'Cause there will come a time
When time goes out the window

And you'll learn to drive out of focus
I'm you, and if anything unfolds
It's supposed to
Ooh

You don't throw your time away sitting still
I'm in a chain of memories
It's my will
And I had to consult some figures of the past
And I know someone after me
Will go right back

I'm not telling a view
I've got this night to unglue
I moved this fight away
By doing things there's no reason to do2Embed
