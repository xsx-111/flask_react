Saturation LyricsI feel that wheels are turning
I feel that wheels are turning round, oh
Replay
We made you, we made you
We made you what you were
We brought them up that hill
We brought them up to roll them down
Down
In the morning, light must clean you
In the morning, light must clean you out, out
Right out
I'm sad that time escapes me
It pushes ahead of me all day
Remind me, remind me
Remind me what I could've been
I feel the faster I'm going
The more I am slowing down
Down
I'm the focus of the bring down
I'm the one who captures what he lost and turns it 'roundEmbed
