Representing LyricsI'm representing a face of light
I'll take your place, it's only right
I don't hesitate this time
I'm only seen 'til I arrive
I'm reappearing and I'm holding back
I steal this field if I relax
You've never moved the end
You'll shake out of yourself again
Revealing the face that's frozen cold
Hey y'all
Raise the rain the other way
Hey y'allEmbed
