Fallout LyricsCarried through the road so far alone
Days glue themselves to what is wrong
And soon the hills will swallow us up
Plans will pass her
Land on the walls is laid out
I know you're in pain
Train for the cause of staying down
It plays you out
Fall out of love again
Your dreams all end
Fall out of love again
Your dreams all end
Fall out of love again
Your dreams all end
Fall out of love again
Your dreams all end
Your dreams all end1Embed
