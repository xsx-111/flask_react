Away & Anywhere Lyrics
I do dream you
Allow me to believe you are the real me
I see you breathin' underwater
See you on both sides of a door
I didn't mean you to fathom what you bought
I'm away
I'm away and anywhere to suffice

Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh

Every life filled with what will be
If my own will is from me
How do I take another mirror?
How do I drink the whole shore?
I do greet you
And slam the door in your face
You come in anyways
It's a long, long time before this takes place

Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh
I answer these questions now (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
As to why I'm the only one (Aah, aah)
Who carries answers to their fathers (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Who carries gray sky to the sun (Aah, aah)
I'm not the railway (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I leave all of it to the air (Aah, aah)
Passin' highway's traffic (Ooh-ooh-ooh) while just lyin' there (Aah, aah)
Carry me away (Ooh)
Come in anyway (Ooh)
Both sides of the door
The closed and open door

Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-ooh
Ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo
Ooh-hoo, ooh-ooh-hoo-oohEmbed
