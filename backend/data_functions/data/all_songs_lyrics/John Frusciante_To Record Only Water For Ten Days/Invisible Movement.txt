Invisible Movement LyricsExtra time when you think it's all over
Live a life when you rolled over and died
I don't feel pain
I don't travel this line
Levitate and feel the ground get closer
Ecstasy made every step a mile
When it becomes a waste
Why hold on for dear life
Wide pain in the blue white break up
All paths divide
Life has a way of opening up
All names travel with their owner
Though they've no space, they move all around
I see invisible movement in every town
Every cry is a separate emotion
Happenings are planned
And then they arrive
They go on with or without you there
Wide pain in the blue white break up
All paths divide
Life has a way of opening up
Wide pain in the blue white break up
All paths divide
Life has a way of opening upEmbed
