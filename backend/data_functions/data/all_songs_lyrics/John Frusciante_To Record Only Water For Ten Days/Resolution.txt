Resolution Lyrics
We tried, blasted the moment
Three lies open the door;
Redesign the reflection
It takes my heart away

Refined timbre of air
You've painted it all that way;
If I face it always
It becomes a problem

I'm leaving, I'm broken;
I envisioned half this time
I surrounded this line
Trade the wind for the fire

Eyes disguising of you
Dreams fade my ends all the way;
I believe in you
The frames that make the hollow empty

I'll pay sometime
Drowning in my tears;
I'll wait for some night
When all this comes, all  this comes out right
Taking it all is unfair
I'm sent away each time
Faking as if I care
Is all they want
Is all they want, failureEmbed
