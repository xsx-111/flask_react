Circles Lyrics
You saw me lost and treading water
I looked pathetic
I looked as helpless as a stinger without a bee
But underneath my presentation, yeah
I knew the walls were coming down
And the stones that fell were aiming away from me

Hey! What would it mean to you
To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey! Whatever it means to you
Know that everything moves in circles, yeah

I saw you standing in my headlights (Blink, blink, blink)
I thought I'd run you down
For the weight you left on me
Instead I pushed rewind, reversed and drove away
And seeing you disappear in my rearview
Brought to me the word Reciprocity

Hey! What would it mean to you
To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey! Whatever it means to you
Know that everything moves in circles, yeah
Round and round we go
Who could've known it'd end so well?
We fall on and we fall off
Existential carousel
Spin!

Hey! What would it mean to you
To know that it'll come back around again?
Hey! Whatever it means to you
Know that everything moves in circles, yeah
Oh, that everything moves in circles

Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round and
Round and round and
Round!2Embed
