11 A.M. Lyrics
Seven a.m
The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away
Could I push rewind?
The credits traverse signifying the end
But I missed the best part, could we please go back to start?

Forgive my indecision

Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again
Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, babe

Eleven a.m
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bed sheets shade the heat of choices I've made
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in that old fear

Forgive my indecision
I am only a man
Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again, again, again
Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, baby

Twelve p.m. and my dusty telephone rings
Heavy head up from my pillow, who could it be?
I hope it's you
It's you

Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again, again, again
Then again, the day has come and I want off that ride, babe3Embed
