Warning Lyrics
Bat your eyes girl, be otherworldly
Count your blessings, seduce a stranger
What's so wrong with being happy?
Kudos to those who see through sickness-yea

Over and over and over and over and...
Ooo-ooo

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
Don't ever let life pass you by

I suggest we learn to love ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn? When will we change?
Just in time to see it all fall down
Those left standing, will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning - warning
Don't ever let life pass you by
Floating in this cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like frogs oblivious to the water starting to boil
No one flinches, we all float face down

When she woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning - warning
Don't ever let life pass you by

Pass you by
Oh, oh, oh4Embed
