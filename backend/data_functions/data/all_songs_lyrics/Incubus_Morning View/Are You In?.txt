Are You In? Lyrics
It’s so much better
When everyone is in
Are you in?
It’s so much better
When everyone is in
Are you in?

Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you in?
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you in?

It’s so much better
When everyone is in
Are you in?
It’s so much easier
When sea foam green is in fashion

Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you in?
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you...
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
Are you, are you, are you, are you
(Everybody in, every
Everybody in, every
Everybody in, every
Everybody in, every)
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh no, oh oh no
(A-are, you in
A-are, are
You, you, i-i-in)

Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo
Are you in?
Ooh, hoo
Ooh, hoo, hoo10Embed
