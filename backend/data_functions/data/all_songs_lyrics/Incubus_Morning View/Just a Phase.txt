Just a Phase Lyrics
I am bottled fizzy water
And you are shaking me up
You are a fingernail running down
The chalkboard I thought I left in third grade
Now my only consolation
Is that this could not last forever
Even though you're singing and thinking
How well you've got it made

Who are you?
When will you be through
Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase
Yeah, it's just a...
Phase

Call it women's intuition
But I think I'm on to something here
Temporaryism has been the Black Plague
And the Jesus of our age
I know that I sound opinionated
Maybe biased and quite possibly jaded
But sooner than later they'll be throwing
Quarters at you on stage
Who are you?
When will you be through
Yeah, it's just a phase
It will be over soon
Yeah, it's just a phase
Yeah, it's just a...
Phase, and I'm waiting for it to be over, too

Yeah, oh ho
Yeah, oh ho
Yeah, oh ho
Yeah, oh ho
Yeah, oh ho
Yeah, oh ho
Yeah1Embed
