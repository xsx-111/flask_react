Wish You Were Here Lyrics
I dig my toes into the sand
The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds strewn across a blue blanket
I lean against the wind, pretend that I am weightless
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here

I lay my head onto the sand
The sky resembles a backlit canopy with holes punched in it
I'm counting UFOs, I signal them with my lighter
And in this moment I am happy, happy

I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here

Oh yeah, the world's a roller coaster and I am not strapped in
Maybe I should hold with care, but my hands are busy in the air saying
I wish you were here
I wish you were
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
Wish you were here5Embed
