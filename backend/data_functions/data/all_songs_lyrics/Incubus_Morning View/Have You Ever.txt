Have You Ever Lyrics
To get up and walk away would be too easy
So stay and stand your ground, just watch your mouth with me
On the back of every right, there's a wrong looming
So here you and I should tread as soft as these razor blades
For boots will let be

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed

Thought unabashed honesty would be ideal
But a prophet did once say that honesty is a lonely word
So where do we go from here, abandon ship now?
My problem is you made me melt
And I don't want to be frozen anymore

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed
Have you ever, have you ever tried to?
I have never, I have never tried to

Have you ever tried to step in my shoes?
Have you ever tried to balance that beam?
And if you ever tried to fit in my shoes
They'll never be quite as soft as they seemed3Embed
