Echo Lyrics
There’s something about the look in your eyes
Something I noticed when the light was just right
It reminded me twice that I was alive
And it reminded me that you’re so worth the fight
Ooh yeah

My biggest fear will be the rescue of me
Strange how it turns out that way, yeah

Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting

There’s something about the way you move
I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing
More subtle than something someone contrives
Your movements echo that I've seen the real thing
Oh yeah
Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you
Strange how it turns out that way, yeah

Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting
Could you show me dear?
Something I've not seen
Something infinitely interesting3Embed
