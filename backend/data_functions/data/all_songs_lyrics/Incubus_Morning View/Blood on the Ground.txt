Blood on the Ground Lyrics
I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue everytime you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

Hand over my heart; I swear I've tried
Everything I could within all my power
Two weeks and one hour I slaved
And now I've got nothing to show
Oh, if only you'd grow taller than a brick wall
From now on I'm going to start holding my breath
When you come around and you flex that fake grin
'Cause something inside me has said more than twice
That breathing less air beats breathing you in

I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue everytime you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

Hand over my mouth, I'm earning the right to my silence
In quiet, discerning between ego and timing
Good judgment is once again proving to me
That it's still worth it's weight in gold
From now on I'm gonna be so much more wary
When you start to speak and my warm blood starts to boil
Seeing you is like pulling teeth
And hearing your voice is like chewing tin foil
I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue everytime you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground

High fives to better judgment
By saying less today, I will gain more, gain more
Low twos to you, my, my fickle friend
Youâ€™ve brought the art of silent war

I don't want to talk to you anymore
I'm afraid of what I might say
I bite my tongue everytime you come around
'Cause blood in my mouth beats blood on the ground2Embed
