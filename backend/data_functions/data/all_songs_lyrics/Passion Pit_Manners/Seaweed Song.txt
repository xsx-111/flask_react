Seaweed Song Lyrics
Some day you'll see
Surrounded by angels
Floating atop of the sea
On bended knee
Don't go where they go
Don't sing all the songs they sing

Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew

Between these walls
Her bark-stripped limbs
Casts shadows frighteningly tall
I slow to a crawl
I jump and I yell
And she hears nothing at all
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew

Stay, stay the same
Cause everything else will change
And I'll always be to blame
So please just stay the same
The current has pulled me in
The tide has reached my chin
My seaweed tickled skin
Just let the water win
I'm freezing to the bone
You'll never feel at home
Just watch your body go
Just watch your body go
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew
Nobody knows you
The way you know you
But I think I do
Well, I thought I knew
Yeah, I thought I knew5Embed
