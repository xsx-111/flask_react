The Reeling Lyrics

We dug these holes we crawled into
Now they're my home
Now here I cannot feel the wind
Can't feel the rain or cold

And I believe in gentle harmony
How I loathe all this obscenity
Is this the way my life has got to be?
Have I a single opportunity?

Look at me, oh look at me, is this the way I'll always be?
Oh no, oh no
Now I'm dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me
Oh no, oh no
Everyday I lie awake and pray to God today's the day
Oh no, oh no
Here I am, oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?
Oh no, oh no

And all at once I feel this
Oh, how it clings to me
It reels and calls me towards it
Confounding destiny
And I can feel the madness, inch by inch
The more I run, the more I am convinced
Iâ€™ve coloured all these like the branch's twist
Just like we settle in the foggy mist

Look at me, oh look at me, is this the way I'll always be?
Oh no, oh no
Now I'm dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me
Oh no, oh no
Everyday I lie awake and pray to God today's the day
Oh no, oh no
Here I am, oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?
Oh no, oh no


Look at me, oh look at me, is this the way I'll always be?
Oh no, oh no
Now I'm dreaming somebody would swiftly come and kidnap me
Oh no, oh no
Everyday I lie awake and pray to God today's the day
Oh no, oh no
Here I am, oh here I am, oh when will someone understand?
Oh no, oh no8Embed
