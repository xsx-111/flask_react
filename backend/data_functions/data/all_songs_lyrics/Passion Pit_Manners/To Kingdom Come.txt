To Kingdom Come Lyrics
That's a frosty way to speak
To tell me how to live next to your potpourri
All this talking pulls my teeth
I believed in you so you'd believe in

Me, I cried out "God!"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel

Once I had a name to claim
I scraped on all the walls
Like an orthodox saint
I wish for the same old things
That turned me inside out
Keeling in such pain
It's a game

Me, I cried out "God!"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel
Never have I ever been
Clutching at your hair
To cure you of some sin
But that's the kind of state I'm in
Swimming in a pool of godly medicine

Come, come hear it, calling me yelling like
If ever there was someone who could make things
Heavenly again
Feel alright

Me, I cried out "God!"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel

Me, I cried out "God!"
You dared me in the dark
I felt a hush fall quietly from my spark
So now I hide in piles
Of princely orange peels
It feels the way you told me
How it'd always feel4Embed
