Dreams Lyrics
Oh my life is changing everyday
Every possible way
Though my dreams, it's never quite as it seems
Never quite as it seems

I know I felt like this before
But now I'm feeling it even more
Because it came from you
Then I open up and see
The person falling here is me
A different way to be

I want more, impossible to ignore
Impossible to ignore
They'll come true, impossible not to do
Impossible not to do

Now I tell you openly
You have my heart so don't hurt me
For what I couldn't find
Totall me amazing mind
So understanding and so kind
You're everything to me
