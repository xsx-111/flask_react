Swimming in the Flood Lyrics
My eyes have once again been proven wrong
Your clouds, your blanket and my pity song
Hovering on your front lawn
Carry on until it's gone

What can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch
But the water is rising up

Then I lie naked in a rampage
In the flesh, face to face with the onset
I forget everything that's ever made me rise again
Now slowly leave my memory

What can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch
But the water is rising up
Now all my lovers raise their cups
What can I do?
The river is overrun
We're swimming in a flood, you know?
I thought I felt your touch
But the water is rising up
Now all my lovers raise their cups2Embed
