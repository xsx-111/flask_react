Pan Am Highway Blues Lyrics
I've gotten good at missing her
I practice all the time
While I drive the Pan Am highway through
With that cactus friend of mine
It's getting hard to see
The white line rolling by
I can't forget her memory deep inside

I dropped a bundle down in Panama
But the loss didn't do me no good
Spendin’ cash and talkin’ trash
Don't do it like it should
I realised I just couldn't buy her smile
I'll keep trying on that Pan Am mile by mile

If she'd meet me in San Salvador
I'd buy her a drink or two
We'd talk about our used to be
And ride on to Peru
The time to get it right is here and now
And if she won't i’ll move on anyhow
