Snappy Kakkie Lyrics
I say hey, snappy kakkie
Do you wanna play?
I say hey, snappy kakkie
I said what you say
The water she is nice, we can steal away
They'll never know we're gone
Until the break of day
Come on, come on

I say hey, snappy kakkie
Did they talk to you today?
I say hey, snappy kakkie
Did you see it their way?
The moon she is high, we must leave tonight
We must get away, we will join the fight
Well come on, come on

I say hey, snappy kakkie
Did our brothers stay?
I say hey, snappy kakkie
Will our sisters pay?
Does it really matter of the friends we lost?
It doesn't really matter
Cause their souls were lost
So come on, come on

I say hey, snappy kakkie
Do you wanna play?
I say hey, snappy kakkie
I said hereâ€™s what you say
The water she is nice we can steal away
They'll never know we're gone
Until the break of day
So come onEmbed
