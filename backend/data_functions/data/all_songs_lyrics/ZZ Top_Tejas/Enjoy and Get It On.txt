Enjoy and Get It On Lyrics
Oh, I’m making my way back home
Least that's what I told her on the phone
Been a while since I made her smile
And I know she gonna dig my style
Could she enjoy baby
Really enjoy getting it on

Could I get some may then ala mode
When I come in off the road
Do she still have her fighting gear?
Just one look is gonna make it clear
She would enjoy baby
Really enjoy getting it on

How does it feel holding me again?
She's holding on like it gonna never end
Well, I’m home thinking I should stay
While I’m here just let me hear you say
Say you enjoyed baby
Really enjoy getting it on
