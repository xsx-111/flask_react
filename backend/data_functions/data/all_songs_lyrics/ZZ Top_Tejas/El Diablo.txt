El Diablo Lyrics
Did you ever hear the story
That happened not long ago
About the man with a tan
El Diablo de Mexico?
And this man played his hand
And he lived by the luck of the draw
Now and then and again
Found him stepping outside of the law
Hey, hey!

And his fortune he had made
Let him live high on the hog
Til the day of the raid
When they hunted him like a dog
He was out on the run
Knowing he could get by
Because the men killed in sin
Were not there to testify
Hey, hey!

He was caught, he was bound
In La Casa de Calaboose
He was tried, he was found
And readied for the noose
But the break he would make
It didn't turn out so well
And the hombre called "Diablo"
Bid his last farewell
