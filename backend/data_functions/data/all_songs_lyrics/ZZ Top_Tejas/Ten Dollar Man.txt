Ten Dollar Man Lyrics
Mister ten dollar man
With that gold in your hand
Coming around here after sunlight
With your peaches and your pream
And your rolling magazine
Telling me you'll make me feel alright
Now, you'll make me feel alright

Mister ten dollar man
With a girl by the hand
Will this ten-spot take her away?
With his slaver's finance
He winked, said take a chance
Don't you know it happens every day
I said it happens every day, hey, oh!

Mister ten dollar man
With the gun in your hand
Can I get a case of those tonight?
And now you've got the order
I said it's time to slip the border
Don't you know it happens every day
I said it happens every day, yeah
