Avalon Hideaway Lyrics
Somebody breathing down my neck
While I’m trying to roll the bones
I don't care i'll just float a check
Cause I’m feeling my Gambling Jones
Here come seven, gimme eleven come again
Love to hideout where I am
My own best friend

There's crazy little Linda Lou
With the long and lanky legs
Nobody do it like Linda do
At these backwoods lone star dregs
Like I told you, head out FM 92
Roll in slowly, you'll be safer if you do
Hey, ho, mmm, oh!

If you don't know what I’m talking about
Let me ease your worried mind
It's the place to go without a doubt
But it's a little bit hard to find
Back in the timber, once you're there
You'll wanna stay
Get loose and limber anytime night or day
Just remember, ask for the avalon hideawayEmbed
