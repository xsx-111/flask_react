An Assassin LyricsI don't want to tell you
Where feelings don't reside
By myself I keep by this one design
Wondering just kicked about
Fell on to the ill I couldn't hide
The patience is giving up ya
Shocked on you
So the veins are running black
When I say I understated
Devoted to wasting time
Eluding what's on your mind
I don't want to tell you
Lost all my dreams
I found out someone's gonna trip me
Dim and slight
Wait and seeEmbed
