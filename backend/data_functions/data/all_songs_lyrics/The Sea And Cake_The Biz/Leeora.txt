Leeora LyricsI'm deep in the station
Wrap myself
I sleep on the other side
I'm better off keeping a split from the strings
A ten flights up
A ten flights down ow man
I'm deep in the station
Wrap myself
I sleep on the other side
I'm better off keeping a split from the strings
A ten flights up
A ten flights down ow manEmbed
