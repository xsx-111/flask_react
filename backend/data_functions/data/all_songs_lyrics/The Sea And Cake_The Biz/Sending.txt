Sending LyricsI'm in all the way
No sense in leaving
There's something about you
I cast on the balance soul
Below all I have
Because we shift
From hand to hand
Take all you want I say
It doesn't even mean that much
The devil's still breathing
I wish it away
I'm bad enough
I barely love you
If it's falling
Better than all I got
I'm in
I'm sending
I couldn't fell
You hardly changed me
I'm in
When all is said
I'm doneEmbed
