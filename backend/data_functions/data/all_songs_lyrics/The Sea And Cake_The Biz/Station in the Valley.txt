Station in the Valley LyricsStraight to the mouth
Fits of electricity
Loops of the hero
Stares us down
Passive revolution
My eyes are spinning
If it's on a Monday
And I'm trying
Don't you want to be
I'm better choking sorely hopeless
It don't matter which way
Ah one two one two fat Archer
So on time when you're leaving
Could you ever known
Beat it up inside
With the lights left on
And I just don't care so I left alone
If it's on a Monday
And I'm trying
Don't you want to be
We want what's holding out
If it's on a Monday
And I'm trying
Don't you want to be
I'm better hoping a sour sweetness
Ring my eyes
And a sorely hopeless every day
It don't matter about what you say
I mean would you doubt it
I better say which wayEmbed
