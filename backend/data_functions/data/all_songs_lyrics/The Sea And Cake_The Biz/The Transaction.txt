The Transaction LyricsLet me move my arms
It's a movie without lights
Be now I'm on forever
I'm the same and it shows
Plays like winter all the time
On these sore lips
On these sore lips that I know
Be any less I am any less I'm leaving
Once again and I'm bitter still to be lucky
So chase me I'm unreal
Leave it alone and I'll be on your side
Leave it alone and I'll be on your side
Got you better than I know
Leave it alone and I'll be on your side
Standing once together
It's not even
We lift above an ocean
So I'm certain about it now
Say you would
And I don't know how that I understood
That I'm leaving
Be now I'm on forever forever
Leave it alone and I'll be on your side
Leave it alone and I'll be on your side
Got you better than I knowEmbed
