House of Love LyricsSpeak to me
Tell me a dream
Why don't you let me know
It's only a key
I'm locking it up
I think its got to go
And when I think about it now
We'll build a house of love somehow
Ah, talk to me, you're packing your clothes
You leave me walking the floor
Ah, feels strange to me, I'm losing control
I can't feel you any more
And when I think about it now
Built a house of love somehow
It hurts a little too much
It hurts a little too much
Oh, my crazy arms,empty now
So cold like dying snow
Mmm, remember me, I can't forget
You touched my very soul
But when I think about it now
Built a house of love somehow
A little too much
It hurts a little too much
It hurts a little too much
It hurts a little too much
Oh girl, you really do now
Ah, you hurt me child
You know you really really do now
You know things get better, baby
Oh, I was running - just running so hard
But things get much better baby
It's so hard - it's so hard, so hard
Keep a-running, keep a-running, yes
Yes, it gets better, baby
My crazy arms -sp  empty now
So call that dying slow
Oh, remember me - I can't forget
You touched my very soul
And when I think about it now
Build a house of love somehow
Just a little too much
Oh a little too much
Just a little too much
It's just a little too much
Oh, come on, keep on, keep on
Come on come on come onEmbed
