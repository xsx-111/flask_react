Most High LyricsWho guards the truth, oh Lord most high?
A frightened dove in the starless sky
Oh-oh - so high, most high, so high
Who hides the east from the blind man's eye?
In the land of peace where the righteous cry
Oh-oh - so high, most high, so high
Where are the words of a king
Who moved the stars and then the sun?
To the light when my spirit was born
Bring this wanderer home
While mercy sleeps in the hearts of liars
And the olive tree is consumed by fire
Oh-oh - so high, most high, so high
Where are the words of the king
Who moves the stars and then the sun?
To the light where my spirit was born
Bring this wanderer home
Come on, come on, come on
Mmmm
When David's seed talks
Through his paper crown
And he spits hot steel
See all the kids fall down
Ohhh yeah, mmm
So high, most high, oh oh, oh yeah
Mmmmm, oh oh, mmmm
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Ahhhh, ahhhhh
Better hurry, hurry
Better hurry, hurry
Better hurry, hurry
Most high, most  high, most high
So high, so high
So highEmbed
