Upon a Golden Horse LyricsFirst there was a fire that burned
After came the sea
Crawling through the rain and storm
For you - for me
Slowly walk the sacred fool
Countenance sublime
Shining in the light of love
Shining - shining
Oh, shine for me now
Oh, shine for me now
High upon a golden horse
Out upon the sea
Moves a man with simple words
Some for you now and then some for me
Oooh, burn for me, burn for me now
Oh, burn for me now
Oh, burn for me, burn for me now
Oh
Out there where the wild wind blows
Oh, the soul is free now
You will be my brightest star
Shining - shining
Oh, shine for me now
Oh, shine for me now
Oooh, burn for me - burn for me, yeah
Oh, burn for me now
Ahh, burn for me, burn for me now
Oh, shine for me now
Oh, shine for me now, yeah
Ahhh ahhh
Ooohhhh ohhhhEmbed
