Burning Up LyricsMy mind is cracked
I stand alone
And my way is dark as night
Back on the hill the wind it moans
And big black clouds fly by
The rain fell down
It drowned my heart
It raged inside my soul
A pain that tore the skies apart
The twisted night unfolds
Oh, burning up
I'm burning up
I'm burning up
This lonely road that I must walk
All these tears that burn my eyes
Emptiness my torment draws
In my silent, loveless life
Oh, I'm burning up
I'm burning up
I'm burning up
Oh, can you hear me?
Hear me calling 'cross a thousand miles
Oh, would you lead me?
If I die, I die a thousand times
 I'm burning up
 I'm burning up
 I'm burning up
 I'm burning upEmbed
