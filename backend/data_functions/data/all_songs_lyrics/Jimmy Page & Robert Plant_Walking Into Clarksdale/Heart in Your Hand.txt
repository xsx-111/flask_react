Heart in Your Hand LyricsDo you gather flowers for me?
Moving softly through the trees
With the scent against your arms
Long ago I knew your charms
As I walk through the purple hills of soon forgotten
Know that my heart was in your hand
And my heart was in your hand
Do your lips still call my name?
Would your mouth still taste the same?
And I learn the sweetest words
What implies some mercy yet
Though I steal all across the years, the memory lingers on
All my heart in your hand
All my heart in your hand
Should I fall beside the road
Everlasting unconsoled
And my memory so blind
And my heart laid ahead
As I walk through the purple hills of long ago
I know my heart is in your hand
All my heart is in your hand
My heart is in your hand
All my heartEmbed
