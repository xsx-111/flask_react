Blue Train LyricsAnother day is ending
And I remember when
My world came falling down
Out there the stars stop dancing
Lost in my darkness now
The rain, keeps falling down
Light of my life, where have you gone?
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun
Ah - ah - ah - ah - ah - ah
Here comes the blue train rollin'
Across my heart it crawls
The rain still pouring down
Another day escapes me
A little later maybe
Love will roll around
Light of my life, where have you gone?
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun
I've been waiting on a corner
Yeah, I've been waiting for a sign
Ohhh, I've been waiting on the corner
I've been waiting for a sign now, oh now
Light of my life, where have you gone
Love's true flame dies, without the warmth of your sun
Whistle blowin', blue train rollin', carry my heart, my soul
Whistle blowin', blue train rollin', carry my darling son
Whistle blowin', blue train rollin', carry my heart
I've been waiting on a corner
I've been waiting for a sign now
Ohh, I've been waiting on the corner
I've been waiting for a sign, now, oh oh, ooh
Whistle blowin', blue train rollin'
Carry my heart now, oh yeah, ohhh
I've been waiting on a corner
I've been waiting for a sign
Hear the blue train, hear the blue train, ohh
It's the blue train rollingEmbed
