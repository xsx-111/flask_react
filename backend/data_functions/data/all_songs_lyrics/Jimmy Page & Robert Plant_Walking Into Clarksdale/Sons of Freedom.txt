Sons of Freedom LyricsGo fetch another nice girl
To play with in the sand
The one I have right now is broke
The one I really want has planned
To get religion - to find another way
She's at the temple - all I've got to say
I've got to face it - I'm all alone
I feel quite naked - oh! so forlorn
I am united in disarray
I've no intention - I kneel and pray
Send me a dreamboats I can sail away
A drift in warm devotion - no memory - I feel no pain
To live for the new beginning
Ride the wind to win the day
Out on the ocean - decide I'm here to stay
I can't get started - I'm at the end
She's got religion - I've lost a friend
I talk in circles - I make no sense
I get so nervous, so nervous
I have to face it - I'm home alone
I feel quite naked - oh, so forlorn
I am united - in disarray
I've no intentions - I kneel to pray
Bring me the brightest star
That I can wish upon
And close my eyes so very tight
Pretend that you're not gone
So deep is my distraction
Maybe I'll disappear
I'm sorry about that
I'm not talking when you're here
I can't get started - I'm at an end
She's got religion - I've got a friend
I talk in circles - I make no sense
I get so nervous - don't break the fence
I have to face it - I'm home alone
I feel quite naked - I just don't belong
I am united - in disarray
I've no intention - I go pray, hey hey
I can't get started - I'm at an end
She's got religion and I've lost a friend
I talk in circles - I make no sense
I get so nervous - so make no amends
A reflection of a nice girl
I'm with a nice girl
I'm with a nice girl
Nice girlEmbed
