Shining in the Light LyricsBig boat stealing through the darkness
Will you bring to me my love?
Will you bring to me my only love?
In the night the light of oneness
And the one light guides you home
And the keeper turns his cards alone
From this shore my memory wandered
And I danced upon the sea
Can I dance with you upon the sea?
Oh! how I love your brown-eyed madness
And your beauty was exposed
Now your memory's grained into my bones
Shining in my light - shining in the light
Shining in my light - shining in the lightEmbed
