Whiskey from the Glass LyricsOh, take the whiskey from my glass and run
Yes, take the whiskey from my glass and run
Take the love from my heart - take it all now
You tear it up and tear it apart
Oh, take the whiskey from my glass and run
Oh, you broke my heart and gone
Yeah, you broke my heart and gone
You tore it up - you tore it down
Little bitty pieces on the ground
Yeah, broke my heart and run
Oh yeah
Oh, take this chain from my heart and run
Yes, take these chains from my heart and run
Take these chains from my heart - I can't explain
How it can tear me apart if you call my name
Oh, take the whiskey from my glass and runEmbed
