When the World was Young LyricsOh yeah, here I am
I've been here since all the time began
Oh oh, I'm here and then
Go round and round and back again
Hey hey, come look and see
My footsteps through eternity
Riding hard and strong and free
The messenger will hold the key
I saw him - I knew him - I touched him
When the world was young
I saw - I knew and I touched
When the world was young
When the world was young
High on a hill
Home of my heart, take me dancing
Round and round
Carry me still
Sweet home of my heart, take me dancing
Round and round
Yes, I saw him - I knew him - I touched him
When the world was young
I saw you - I knew and I touched you
When the world was young
Round, round, round and round
I saw him - I touched him - I knew him
When the world was young
I saw him and I touched him and I knew him
When the world was young
Carry me still
Home of your heart, keep me dancing
Round and round
When the world was young
When the world was youngEmbed
