Please Read the Letter LyricsCaught out running with just a little too much to hide
Maybe, baby, everything's gonna work out fine
Please read the letter, I nailed it to your door
It's crazy how it all turned out, we needed so much more
Too late, too late, a fool could read the signs
Maybe, baby, you'd better check between the lines
Please read the letter, I wrote it in my sleep
With help and consultation from the angels of the deep
Aww, aww
Aww, aww
Once I stood beside a well of many words
My house was full of rings and charms and pretty birds
Please understand me, my walls came falling down
There's nothing here that's left for you, but check with lost and found
Aww, aww
Aww, aww

Aww, aww
Aww, aww
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
One more song just before we go
Remember, baby, all the things we used to know
Please read my letter and promise me you'll keep
The secrets and the memories and cherish in the deep
Aww, aww
Aww, aww
Aww, aww
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Aww, aww
Aww, aww
Aww, aww
Mmm, please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wrote
Please read the letter that I wroteEmbed
