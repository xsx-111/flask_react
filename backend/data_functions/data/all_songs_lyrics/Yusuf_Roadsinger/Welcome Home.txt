Welcome Home LyricsSaw a sign on the path
"All seekers this way"
A fairy sat and laughed
And threw a peddle my way
As I neared the bridge
Two soldiers stood and stared
No one passes by us, but hey
You're welcome here
Carried on down the road
To the market place
I was still alone
No one knew my face
Then a stranger sang
The voice like the wind
Then the hails began to sing
Welcome in
Time rolls on. Ain't no good to sit and moan
Time rolls on. And so we travel on
Never did I imagine
What a dawn could be
Till I opened my eyes to see
It was welcoming me
At the end of my days
On my way home
I paused a while to gaze
Upon the sacred stone
There it stood in the middle
Of the holy domain
Then the people came out to say
Welcome home again
Time rolls on. And so we carry on
Time rolls on. Ain't no good to sit and moan
Time rolls on. And so we travel on
Time rolls on. Ain't no good to sit aloneEmbed
