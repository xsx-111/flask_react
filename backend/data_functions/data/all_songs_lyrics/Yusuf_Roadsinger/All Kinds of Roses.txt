All Kinds of Roses LyricsAll kinds of roses, all kinds of roses
All kinds of roses grow in my garden
All kinds of creatures, all kinds of creatures
All kinds of creatures run on my land
All kinds of children, all kinds of children
All kinds of children play in my yard
So many feelings, so many feelings flow through my blood
All kinds of people, all kinds of people
All kinds of people make up my life
All kinds of faces, all kinds of faces
All kinds of faces show me their love
All kinds of lanterns, all kinds of lanterns
All kinds of lanterns light up the dark
But there's only one God, only one God has a place in my heart
All kinds of roses, all kinds of roses
All kinds of roses grow in my gardenEmbed
