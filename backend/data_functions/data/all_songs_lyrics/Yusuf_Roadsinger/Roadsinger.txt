Roadsinger LyricsIslam
Roadsinger came to town, long cape and hat
People stood and stared then closed their doors as he passed
He strolled the empty street, kids banged on tin cans
Then the panting dogs began to bark as the Roadsinger sang
Where do you go, where do you go, when hearts are closed ?
When a friend becomes a stranger, nobody wants to know
Where do you go, where do you go, when the world turns dark ?
And the light of truth is blown out and the roads are blocked ?
He stopped by a stall, between the barrels and sacks
A child's face peeped out and gave a smile and ran back
Behind a misty glass, on a windowpane
A little finger drew a perfect heart and a name
Where do you go, where do you go, in a world filled with fright ?
Only a song to warm you through the night
Where do you go, where do you go, after lies are told ?
And the light of truth is blown out and the night is cold ?
Mmm ...
Roadsinger rode on to another land
Though the people spoke a different tongue it understand
They showed him how to share and took him by the hand
Showed him the path to Heaven through the desert sand
Where do you go, where do you go, to find happiness 
In a world filled with hatred, cheers ?
Where do you go, where do you go, if no one cares ?
And everybody's lost looking for theirs ?Embed
