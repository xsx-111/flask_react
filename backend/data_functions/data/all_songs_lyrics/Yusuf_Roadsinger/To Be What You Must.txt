To Be What You Must LyricsI have journeyed, endless miles
Seen many others, where I took rest a while
On this boat called "near and far"
To be what you must, you must give up what you are
Only on a wind of hope my heart said
Braving mystic oceans to arrive
Those who do not leave and choose to stay
Many survive
Be you dust or be you star
To be what you must, just reach out for what you are
And though you travel many roads
There's but one way and that's the one you choseEmbed
