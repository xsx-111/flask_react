Start Anew Lyrics
I've been so alone
Ain't no fun since you've been gone
Since you've been gone
Cryin' on the phone
You're the one
I got to fly to you
I got to get to you somehow

Our love is tried and true
I'm a believer now
I'm still high on you
And now we're through the hardest part
Open your heart, and let's start anew

Let your angel, baby, bring you a dream
I can't wait now, baby, to spread these wings
Oh, what you do to me
Make my grey skies electric blue
Kiss these sad times goodbye and let's start anew

Why did I let you go? Say so long
Thought I was strong
Yes, I thought I was strong, baby
Baby, now I know, I was wrong
I want to fly to you
Make it up to you somehow
Reach for the sky with you
And never come back down
I'm still high on you
Now we're through the hardest part
Open your heart, and let's start anew

And let your angel, baby, bring you a dream
I can't wait now, baby, to spread these wings
Oh, what you do to me
Make my grey skies electric blue
Kiss these sad times goodbye and let's start anew


Let your angel, baby, bring you a dream
I can't wait now, baby, to spread these wings
Oh, what you do to me
Make my grey skies electric blue
Kiss these sad times goodbye and let's start anew, ooh
Let your angel, baby, bring you a dream
I can't wait now, baby, to spread these wings
Oh, what you do to me
Make my grey skies electric blue
Kiss these sad times goodbye and let's start anew
Let your angel, baby, bring you a dream
I can't wait nowEmbed
