Control Lyrics
This is a story about control
My control
Control of what I say
Control of what I do
And this time, I'm gonna do it my way (My way)
I hope you enjoy this as much as I do
Are we ready?
I am
'Cause it's all about control (Control)
And I've got lots of it

When I was seventeen, I did what people told me, uh
I did what my father said, and let my mother mold me
But that was long ago, I'm in

Control
Never gonna stop
Control
To get what I want
Control
I like to have a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up (Ah)
First time I fell in love, I didn't know what hit me
So young and so naive, I thought it would be easy
But now I know I've got to take

Control
Now I've got a lot
Control
To get what I want
Control
Never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown upNow I'm all grown up

Jam, woo-woo
Rebel, that's right
I'm on my own, I'll call my own shots
Thank you

Got my own mind
I wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life, my life
I wanna be the one in control
So let me take you by the hand and lead you on this dance
Control is what I've got, because I took a chance
I don't wanna rule the world, just wanna run my life (Ooh)
So make your life a little easier
When you get the chance, just take

Control (Ooh-ooh)
Now I've got a lot (Ooh)
Control
To get what I want (Oh)
Control
I'm never gonna stop
Control
Now I'm all grown up (Ooh)

Free at last
Out here on my own
Ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, hee
Now control this, uh

Control
That's right
Control
Career moves
Control
I do what's right for me
Control
And me wants to groove, is that okay?
Yeah
Ooh, control
I've got my own mind
Ooh, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got my own mind
Wanna make my own decisions
When it has to do with my life
I wanna be the one in control

Hop to it
I'm in control and I love it
Hahahaha, that's right
Control
Now I've got a lot
Control
Now I'm all grown up
I'm in control (Uh)
I'm in control (Ah)
I'm in control (Uh)
Don't make me lose it6Embed
