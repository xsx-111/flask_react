Fight or Fall LyricsBrothers, here I stand
Spread my wings and take command
The sky he justly planned
The boy become a man
After all this time
I tell myself that I'm
Not just wasting time
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined
Brothers, if you hear
Raise your flags and make it clear
There is more to fear
If we wait for another year
After all this time
I tell-a myself
I tell-a myself
Tell-a myself
Tell-a myself
Tell-a myself
Tell-a myself
Tell-a myself that I'm
Just passing through time
After all this time
I tell myself that I'm
Not just wasting time
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined
Brothers, fight or fall
It's man for man and one for all
No more can we crawl
Brothers, brothers, hear the call
After all this time
I tell myself that I'm
Not just wasting time
Oh you know I'm not that way inclined
Brother, brother
Brother, brother
Brother, brother
Brother, fight or fall
Brother, brother
It's man for man and one for all
Brother, brother
Brother, brother
What you want?
Brother, brother
Brothers, we got to fight for one another
Brother, brother
Fight
Brother, brotherEmbed
