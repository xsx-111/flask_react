Warriors LyricsI am a warrior
I serve the death machine
Losers or conquerors
All flash past on my silver screen
Death is no easy answer
For those who wish to know
Ask those who've been before you
What fate the future holds
It ain't pretty
I am a messenger
The message here you must know
I am the warrior
I deliver the fatal blow
So fate will have to wait
Till time heals the scar
See my heart is ruled by Venus
And my head by Mars2Embed
