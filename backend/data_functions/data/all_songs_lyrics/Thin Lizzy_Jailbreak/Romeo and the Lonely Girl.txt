Romeo and the Lonely Girl Lyrics
Romeo and the lonely girl
They seemed to hit it off
Till Romeo, he told the lonely girl
"I must take my leave, my love"
It was these few words I overheard
Thought I should move in
But before I could
The lonely girl had fallen in love again

Oh poor Romeo
Sitting out on his own-ee-o
Oh poor Romeo

Romeo he had it rough
The guy you'd like to burn
But everything that Romeo had
You can bet it was well earned
For all his good looks there were scars that he took
And a lesson to be learned
Never judge lovers by good looking covers
The lover might be spurned



Romeo he like to put it around
He was everybody's friend
But in the end even Romeo found
On no one could he depend
For all his charms in someone else's arms
Lonely girl safely lay
The train came in it had to leave again
And Romeo pulled away
