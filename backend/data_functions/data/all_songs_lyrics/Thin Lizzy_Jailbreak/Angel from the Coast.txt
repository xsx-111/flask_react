Angel from the Coast Lyrics
The sacred heart is bleeding
Go and tell the Holy Ghost
That the drunk is cheating
To get the things he needs the most

Lady Luck has got me covered
Keeping her watchful eyes over me
The lovers are discovered
The charge is first degree

Angel, she's a killer
She's just flown in from the coast
Makes the hit, it's a winner
Leaves you dead past the post

And Sally's took to playing poker
And the joker is her favorite card
And the drunk he can't stay sober
He says oh it's much too hard, it's much too hard

Meantime something seedy
Was happening across the hall
Someone seemed to be groaning
You could hear it through the wall
And the cops they came like lightning
The bullet flew astray
And the noise it was frightening
But the crook he got awayEmbed
