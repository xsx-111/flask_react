Tightrope Lyrics
Caught up in a whirlwind, can't catch my breath
Knee deep in hot water, broke out in cold sweat
Can't catch a turtle, in this rat race
Feels like I'm losing time, at a breakneck pace
Afraid of my own shadow, in the face of grace
Heart full of darkness, spotlight on my face
There was love all around me, but I was looking for revenge
Thank God it never found me, would have been the end

Walkin' the tight rope, steppin' on my friends
Walkin' the tight rope, was a shame and a sin
Walkin' the tight rope, between wrong and right
Walkin' the tight rope, both day and night

Lookin' back in front of me, in the mirror's grin
Through eyes of love I see, I'm really lookin' at a friend
We've had all our problems, that's the way life is
My heart goes out to others, who are there to make amends

We have been walkin' the tightrope, trying to make it right
Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night
Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around
Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found
Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world
Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls
Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right
Walkin' the tightrope do it, do it tonight
Walkin' the tightropeEmbed
