Let Me Love You Baby Lyrics
Oowee baby, I declare you sure look fine
Oowee baby, I declare you sure look fine
A girl like you has made many a man change his mind
Baby, when you walk, you know you shake like a willow tree
Baby, when you walk, you know you shake like a willow tree
A girl like you would just love to make fool of me

Let me love you baby, let me love you baby
Let me love you little darlin', let me love you baby
Let me love you darlin' till your good love drives me crazy
Let me love you baby, let me love you baby
Let me love you little darlin', let me love you baby
Let me love you darlin' till your good love drives me crazyEmbed
