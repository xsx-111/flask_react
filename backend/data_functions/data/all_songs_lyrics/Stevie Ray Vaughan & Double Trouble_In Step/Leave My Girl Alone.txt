Leave My Girl Alone LyricsYou better leave, you better leave my little girl alone
You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone
Lord, before I get evil, man, and go and do something wrong
You called my house just yesterday
I picked up the extension, and I heard every word you said
Why don't you just go on, man, and leave my little girl alone
Lord, before I get evil, man, and go and do something wrong
You call my house all hours of the night
Let me tell you mister, that's a sure way to start a fight
Why don't you just go on, man, and leave my little girl alone
Lord, before I get evil, man, and go and do something wrongEmbed
