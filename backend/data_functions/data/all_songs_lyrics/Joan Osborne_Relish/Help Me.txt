Help Me LyricsYou got to help me, baby
I can't do it all by myself
You got to help me, baby
I can't do it all by myself
If you don't help me, daddy, gotta find somebody else
Put on your nightshirt, baby
Yeah, I'm in my morning gown
Put on your nightshirt, baby
Yeah, I'm in my morning gown
Don't feel sleepy, I just feel like lying downEmbed
