Lumina LyricsLumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Take me through the snow
Eve take a train, Eve took a train
Went to see her man
Melting inside, melting away
Like butter in the pan
Lumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Take me through the snow
Eve took a fruit, Eve bit the fruit
Juice ran down her chin
Babies will put things in their mouths
Never heard of sin
Lumina
Open like the sea
Lumina
Sing me in the dark
Eve had to ask, Eve had to ask
What is wrong with this?
Here is the place, now is the time
Let's invent the kiss
Lumina
Come and wrap around me
Lumina
Take me through the snow
Come and wrap around me...Embed
