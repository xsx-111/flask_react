Right Hand Man LyricsLet me use your toothbrush
Have you got a clean shirt?
My panties in a wad
At the bottom of my purse
I walk into the street
The air's so cool
I'm wired and I'm tired
And I'm grinnin' like a fool
I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for my, my...
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
If he can't fix it, I don't know who can
The sinsemilla salesman
And the cops on the block
They know what I been doin'
They see the way I walk
I wonder what they see now
I wonder what they do
To feel somebody want them
The way I'm wanting you
I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for... to really be...
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
Use me up if you think you can
I've been on the floor lookin' for a chair
I've been on a chair lookin' for a couch
And I've been on a couch lookin' for a bed...
Lookin' for a bed
Lookin' for my...
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
Say... my right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
My right hand, my right hand man
If he can't fix it, gonna find a boy who canEmbed
