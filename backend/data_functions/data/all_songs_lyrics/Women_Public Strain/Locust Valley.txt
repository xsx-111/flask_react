Locust Valley LyricsHaven't the word
And hands are tied
They're leaving you
The cheap confusion pulls through
Enter the mirror
The grays appear
Discard the real
She's making me seem unkind (unkind)
Listen too long
So play along
One seldom viewed
Policing I'm told jut out
Shooting the breeze
And see her now
Confide in you
True images found and cut (and cut)
Sharpened angle in the dirt
You don't walk for an hour
First offensive has been shot
Lost your footing
Hopeless now
Covered metal on the wall
You can lend another skin
Twice now fixed on such a mess
Subtle green and send it back
Precious ornament to crack
It's an overwhelming lie
First offensive has been shot
Lost your footing
Hopeless now
Covered metal on the wall
You can lend another skin
Twice now fixed on such a mess
Subtle green and send it back
Precious ornament to crack
It's an overwhelming lieEmbed
