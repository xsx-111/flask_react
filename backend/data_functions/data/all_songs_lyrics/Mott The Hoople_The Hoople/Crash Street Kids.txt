Crash Street Kids LyricsSee my thoughts and then see my scars
See my clothes, I dress to kill
See my blood and see my gun
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Better run, better run, better run)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(You'll get done, you'll get done, you'll get done)
Heed my faults and heed my curse
Heed my frustration, you just don't know
A new town nothing, send for the hearse
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Better run, better run, better run)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Just for fun, just for fun, just for fun)
Pull down the wires, set you on fire
I'm getting too tired to resist
We'll torture your flats
You keep us like rats
Then you tell 'em we're brats
And the press twist our fist
Get me out of this mess
Hear me swear, hear every word
I ain't just a number, I wanna be heard
A TV announcer he talks to the scum
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Better run, better run, better run)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Prick your thumb, prick your thumb, prick your thumb)
I ain't been solved, I'm uninvolved
I've been annulled and I can't seem to prove it
And you're so pure, you know the cures
Just keep us poor, the juvenile delinquent bit
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Better run, better run, better run)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(One's your son, one's your son, one's your son)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Better hide, better hide, better hide)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Take a ride, take a ride, take a ride)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(You're too late, you're too late, you're too late)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Where's your mates? Where's your mates? Where's your mates? )
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(You're exposed, you're exposed, you're exposed)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Now you're closed, now you're closed, now you're closed)
The crash street kids are comin' to get ya
(Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're dead)
Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're dead
Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're dead
Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're dead
Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're dead
Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're dead
Now, you're dead, now, you're dead, now, you're deadEmbed
