Roll Away the Stone Lyrics
Baby, if you just say you care
I'll follow you most anywhere
Roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
And in the darkest night
I'll keep you safe and all right
Roll away the stone
Roll away the stone

Won't you roll away the stone
(Shalalala push push)
Why be cold and so alone?
(Shalalala push push)
Won't you roll away the stone
(Shalalala push push)
Don't you let it lie

No matter if fools say we can't win
I know I'll fall in love again
Roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
So sing we still got a chance
Baby, in love and sweet romance
Roll away the stone
Roll away the stone
Won't you roll away the stone
(Shalalala push push)
Why be cold and so alone?
(Shalalala push push)
Won't you roll away the stone
(Shalalala push push)
Don't you let it lie

There's a rockabilly party on Saturday night
Are you going be there?
(Well, I got my invite)
Going to bring your records
(Ooh, will do)
Ha, ha, ha
Made it!

Won't you roll away the stone
(Shalalala push push)
Why be cold and so alone?
(Shalalala push push)
Won't you roll away the stone
(Shalalala push push)
Don't you let it lie
C'mon roll
(Won't you roll away the stone)
C'mon roll, yeah
(Won't you roll away the stone)
C'mon roll
(Won't you roll away the stone)
I want you to roll
(Won't you roll away the stone)
C'monnnnnnnnnnnnnn
(Won't you roll away the stone)
Yeah
(Won't you roll away the stone)
C'mon rollllllllllllll
(Won't you roll away the stone)
C'mon roll
(Won't you roll away the stone)
I said roll
(Won't you roll away the stone)
C'mon roll
(Won't you roll away the stone)Embed
