Marionette LyricsNo puppet, no liar, won't bend my lips to wire - No
Don't pressurize me so
Don't gamble, with my life, or you won't live to do it twice
Oh take some good advice from me
And let the wires rock
All dressed in black so nobody sees you
Smile in the wings, tell me I please you
Call me a king and watch for the wordworm to choke me
And you're like a giraffe, the performance is poor
Watch the audience laugh as my head hits the floor
When I'm broken in half you still reach for the floor
STOP!
I've had enough of this
The pantomime's reversed
I need -you feed
I greed - you bleed
Marionette - I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet - Well you'd better forget it
Marionette - I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet - Go check your stocks and shares
And when the coffin comes make sure there's room for two
You lied - I led
I died -You're dead
Marionette - I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet - You'd better forget it
Marionette - I ain't one yet
Teacher's pet - go check your product
A traitor, deceiver, a groovy disbeliever I thought
A puppet was a thing cheap-taught - No way
Creator, conceiver, romantic love receiver - caught
"Who are you"
"The nerve"
I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get out, I wanna get
Out, AHHHHH!
Oh he wanna play chords to the chick on the street
He wanna play words to a world that don't speak
He wanna play people who play hide 'n' seek when they don't talk
He wanna play a riff to the man with the wires
He wanna play lead but his hand's getting tired
He just wanna play but don't know how to say - STOP
OK, the show's been fun
But my wood's begun to warp
They won -I'm done
New one - begun
Marionette - I did my best
Teacher's pet - It just couldn't last
Marionette - Get me out of this mess
Teacher's little pet - It happened so fast
Marionette - Now I need a rest
Teacher's pet - Where's my sanity gone - Mother?
Marionette - I did my best
Teacher's little pet - I'm just like all the others
They gambled, with my life
And now I've lost my will to fight
Oh God these wires are so tight....
I'm just a marionetteEmbed
