I Am Produced LyricsI am pressed, printed, stomped, and strategically removed
I am everybody
Insane without innocence, I am trapped, tricked, packaged
And shipped out
I am produced
I am produced
(Pressed, printed, stomped, tripped
Trapped, tricked, packaged, shipped)
I am produced
(Pressed, printed, stomped, tripped
Trapped, tricked, packaged, shipped)
I am produced
(Pressed, printed, stomped, tripped
Trapped, tricked, packaged, shipped)Embed
