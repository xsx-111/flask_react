Running Off with the Fun City Girls Lyrics
Generous samples rising in the Indian heaven
Doesn't pretend she even cares things change at eleven

She's running off with the fun city girls
She's running off with the fun city girls

She threw away her treasure chest of nice tomorrows
And anyway it's such a glue to loosen
Every time you drink it
Doesn't have to think it, she's full grown

Doesn't acknowledge ever-knowing sound security
Shunning advice and clearly showing new found maturity

She's running off with the fun city girls
She's running off with the fun city girls

She threw away her treasure chest of nice tomorrows
And anyway it's such a glue to loosen
Every time you drink it
Doesn't have to think it, she's full grown
With a pocket full of dimestore ammunition
She's arrived at the grand fitting of her mink
And new electric press kit
Maximize the gaping hole and goEmbed
