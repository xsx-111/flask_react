Now to War Lyrics
There is no boy in me now
There is no time and I'm alone
But I am only breathing
Breathing around
I get involved with your crowd
They make me feel so alone
If you could only see me
When I'm around

But this is you and this is war
It makes me drink even more
And I'll have fun then I'll make a mark on you
I'll tell you all that I am
How simple feet will walk for free
Until you injure me again


This is you and this is war
It makes me drink even more
And I'll have fun then I'll make a mark on you
I'll tell you all that I am
How simple feet will walk for free
Until you injure me againEmbed
