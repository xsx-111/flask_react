The Old Grunt Lyrics
Firmly rooted and quite hellbent
The old grunt packs up the hose
And pokes his nose through the old trunk trap

Hurts from years of concentration
Spent in the umpires association
Talking 'bout the next sensation

Up and coming, but now he's strumming
A buzzing one-stringer, always quite a singer
Did his wife in with dueling banjosEmbed
