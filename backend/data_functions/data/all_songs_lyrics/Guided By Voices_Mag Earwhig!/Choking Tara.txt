Choking Tara Lyrics
Days into weeks, she rattled my mind
We stayed out all week and got happy this time
She fills empty space, I kinda need it that way
Crybaby says bye to me

Can't imagine that all our troubles will go away
But I could catch her and break the falls
I could snatch her with beaks and claws

Today when every "fake it" decides to make it
They just can't take it away
Shove it, 'cause I'll just stay
Like an ugly unwanted stray
Don't care what you sayEmbed
