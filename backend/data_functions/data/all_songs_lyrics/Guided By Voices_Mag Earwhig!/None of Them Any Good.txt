None of Them Any Good Lyrics
The para-coats are coming
When we opened fire from the fear
We realized they were never really here

None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good

Recrystallizing mansions were visual and real
But when we moved in for the pillage
There was no crystal village

None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good

Thanks for the lie, it was quite groovy
A miscue in the greatest movie
Delete my scenes, of course you should
Not one of them was any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any good
None of them any goodEmbed
