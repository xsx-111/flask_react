Bomb in the Bee-Hive Lyrics
Here I go around the blame
Here I go with hand over flame
Down on the floor at nine o'clock
A scene not fully recognized at precisely nine o'clock

Here I go with clapping hands
Here I go with "still no plans"
Illuminate the mystery
The film is not for view, this film is not for youEmbed
