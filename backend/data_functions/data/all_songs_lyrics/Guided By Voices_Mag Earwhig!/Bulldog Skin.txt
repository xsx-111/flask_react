Bulldog Skin Lyrics
I played the part, I played the start
I made a table out of clay
I placed my hands upon the plans
I waited for a proud display (woo-ooh)
I played around, I heard the sound
Of certain trouble on the way

I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin

I took a car, drove it far
I dug the quality of steel
I crashed my nerve, I made it swerve
I made it back, was no big deal
I tasted blood, a date with scud
And now I don't know how to feel

'Cause I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin
Alright, get wild (look out)

I've got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skin

I got bulldog skin
I got bulldog skinEmbed
