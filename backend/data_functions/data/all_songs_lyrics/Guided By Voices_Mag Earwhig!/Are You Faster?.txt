Are You Faster? LyricsNear a distant sea, her clear yellow eyes
Are opening to pink and black skies
And soon they are blinking with compound camera eyes
Are you faster
Than the eyes of the car-people styled in silver?
Are you able to roam
Faster then the lighthouse keeper credits you?
Yeah... yeah!Embed
