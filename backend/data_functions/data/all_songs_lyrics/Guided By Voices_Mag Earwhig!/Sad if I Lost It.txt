Sad if I Lost It Lyrics
Strikes me as an animal
And now gone kissing
But soon be missing home
And waving at waterfalls
Too strong not to mention
With tempting extensions unknown

Oh, this time I really mean that
A cracking coat where I dig that
Oh, this time I want to keep it alone
Oh, this time I really trust you
But it can't belong to anyone
And I'd be so sad if I lost it

And the curried seekers
Of the aborted logo
Of declaration "no-go" are gone
But I'll keep a light for 'em
Hold down the fort for 'em
And wear my maroon blazer all the time

Oh, this time I really mean that
A cracking coat where I dig that
Oh, this time I want to keep it alone
Oh, this time I really trust you
But it can't belong to anyone
And I'd be so sad if I lost it
Oh, this time I really mean that
A cracking coat where I dig that
Oh, this time I want to leave it alone
Oh, this time I really trust you
But it can't belong to anyone
And I'd be so sad if I lost it

Oh, this time I really mean that
It can't belong to anyone
Oh, this time I really mean that...Embed
