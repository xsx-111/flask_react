Learning to Hunt Lyrics
You were a child reaching out, brave and true
For big things in the next room, and I
Couldn't step into such open sky
Where on the crest of uncertainty you loom

I'm learning to hunt for you
I'm learning to hunt for you

Say that you'll never run too far away
Even with all the answers out there
Where it's brighter, but no one will care
Half as much as I care about you

I'm learning to hunt for you
I'm learning to hunt for youEmbed
