Little Lines Lyrics
They should never take you away
Not for all the little lines you say
Especially when you make them laugh

Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change

Philosophers and critics of the play
Will listen hard to every word we say
Especially when it makes us laugh

Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change

Come with me, believe in what you're making me
Baby, out of sadness there is pain
But your barrage of little lines is making me
Change now
Change
Change now
