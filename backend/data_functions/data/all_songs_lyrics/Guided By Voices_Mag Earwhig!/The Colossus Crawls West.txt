The Colossus Crawls West Lyrics
It's too late now, she's got me dreaming
Without you there is no truth according to me
Inside and around me, tears got me drinking
Without you, there is no scope in the morning for me

One of these days in the night
Old enemies will come back to fight
And since you would then disagree
We will be skinned alive when full-colored kings arrive

And teach them we will all we know
Bring popcorn for Geronimo
And dance with our freshly made friends
Ignoring the old ones, the boring and cold ones

And when the colossus crawls west
Jazz bastards will fall and confess
We all love you so and your rock
Is paradise plastic, it's cheap and fantastic
It's too late nowEmbed
