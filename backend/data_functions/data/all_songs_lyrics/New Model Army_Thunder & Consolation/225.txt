225 LyricsShe stares at the screen, at the little words of green
Tries to do remember what to do next
There's a trace of frustration that crosses her face
Searching for the key she should press
And I would help her if I only know how
But these things are a mystery to me too
And it seems that the Corporate eyes they are watching
She fears for her job and the moments are passing
I stare at her nametag and I think to myself
Both you and I, we never asked for any of this
So let's take a walk up past the chemical works
Where the sky turns green at night
And we'll talk about getting away from here
Some different kind of life
But even in the freshest mountain air
The jet fighters practise overhead
And they're drilling these hills for uranium deposits
And they'll bury the waste for our children to inherit
And though this is all done for our own benefit
I swear we never asked for any of this
This golden age of communication
Means everyone talks at the same time
And liberty just means the freedom to exploit
Any weakness that you can find
Turn off the TV just for a while
Let us whisper to each other instead
And we'll hope that the Corporate ears do not listen
Lest we find ourselves committing some kind of treason
And filed in the tapes without rhyme, without reason
While they tell us that it's all for our own protection
I swear we never asked for any of thisEmbed
