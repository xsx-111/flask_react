Family Life LyricsHow did they do this to you?
How did they do this to you?
Were you the weapon that they used
As they tore apart the family
Did they bring you here as they were passing through?
How did they do this to you?
And now you don't want to go home
And now you say that you never will go home
Take a tram across the city
Past the places where your brother died
Of the comfort for the girls who work alone
And I can't tell you that you're not alone
In the cities of the far north, the skies are cold and clear
The loneliness is aching
And after all this time and after all these words
Your hands are still shaking
Why did they do this to you?
Why did they do this to you?
Were they cut off from their past?
Did they try to kill the future?
Do we all forget the things that we once knew?
Why did they do this to you?
Who was it that did this to you?
Who was it that did this to you?
Well if I could have my way
I would line them up against a wall
Do unto them as they have done to you
Who was it that did this?
Who was it that did this to you?Embed
