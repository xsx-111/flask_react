Filmstar Lyrics
Filmstar, propping up the bar, driving in a car, it looks so easy
Filmstar, propping up the bar, driving in a car tonight
Filmstar, giving it class, living it fast, it looks so easy
Filmstar, giving it class, living it fast tonight

What to believe in, it's impossible to say
What to believe in when they change your name
Wash your brain, play the game again, yeah, yeah, yeah

Filmstar, an elegant sir, a terylene shirt, it looks so easy
Filmstar, an elegant sir in a terylene shirt tonight
Filmstar, propping up the bar, driving in a car, it looks so easy
Filmstar, propping up the bar, driving in a car tonight

What to believe in, it's impossible to say
What to believe in when they change your name
Wash your brain, play the game again
Yeah, yeah, yeah...


What to believe in, it's impossible to say
What to believe in when they change your name
Wash your brain, play the game again
Again, again, again
