Lazy Lyrics
Here they come with their make-up on
As lovely as the clouds, come and see them
Boys and girls and their mums and their words
And their romances and jobs and their sons

Barking mad kids, lonely dads
Who drug it up to give it some meaning
From the raves to the council estates
They're reminding us there's things to be done

But you and me
All we want to be
Is lazy
You and me
So lazy

Here they come gone 7am
Getting satellite and Sky getting cable
Bills and Bens and their mums and their friends
Who just really really want to be loved

Uncle Teds and their legendary vests
Helping out around the disabled
From the flats and the maisonettes
They're reminding us there's things to be done
But you and me
All we want to be
Is lazy
You and me
So lazy
You and me
All we want to be
Is lazy
You and me
So lazy
You and me
All we want to be
Is lazy
You and me
So lazy

It's you and me
It's you and me
It's you and meEmbed
