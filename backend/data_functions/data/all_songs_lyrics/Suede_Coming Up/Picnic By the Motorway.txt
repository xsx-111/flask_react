Picnic By the Motorway Lyrics
I'm so sorry to hear about the news
Don't you worry
I'll buy us a bottle and we'll drink in the petrol fumes
I'm so sorry to hear about your world
Don't you worry
There's a gap in the fence down by the nature reserve

Hey
Such a lovely day
Such a lovely day
Such fun
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one

I'm so sorry to hear the news today
Don't you worry
There's been a speeding disaster so we'll go to the motorway
I'm so sorry to hear about the scene
Don't you worry
Just put on your trainers and get out of it with me

Hey
Such a lovely day
Such a lovely day
Such fun
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my little one
Hey
Such a lovely day
Such a lovely day
Such fun
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my lovely one
We could go dancing
We could go walking
We could go shopping
We could keep talking
We could go drinking
We could sit thinking
We could go speeding
Or we could go dreaming, see?

Oh, hey
Such a lovely day
Such a lovely day
Such fun
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my lovely one
Hey
Such a lovely day
Such a lovely day
Such fun
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my lovely one
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my lovely one
Looking at the lovers in a lay-by with my lovely oneEmbed
