She Lyrics
She, walking like a killer
She, another night another pillow

Nowhere places
Nowhere faces
No one wants to see
No education, it's the arse of the nation
She is bad
She is bored
She is bony, she is...

She, sh-shaking up the karma
She, injecting marijuana

Nowhere places
Nowhere faces
No one wants to see
No education, it's the arse of the nation
She is bad
She is bored
She is bony, she is
She
She
She

Nowhere faces
Nowhere places
No one wants to see
No stimulation in this privatisation
She is bad
She is bored
She is bony, she is

She
She
SheEmbed
