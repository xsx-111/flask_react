By the Sea Lyrics
She can walk out anytime
Anytime she wants to walk out
That's fine
She can walk out anytime
Anytime she feels that life has passed her by

And when I start my new life
I won't touch the ground
I'm gonna try hard this time
Not to touch the ground

He can walk out anytime
Anytime he wants to walk out
That's fine
He can walk out anytime
Across the sand, into the sea
Into the brine

And when I start my new life
I won't touch the ground
I'm gonna try hard this time
Not to touch the ground
So we sold the car and quit the job
And shook some hands and wiped the make-up right off
And we said our good-byes to the bank
Left Seven Sisters for a room in a seaside shack

And when I start my new life
I won't touch the ground
I'm gonna try hard this time
Not to touch the ground

It's by the sea we'll breed
It's by the sea we'll breed
It's by the sea we'll breed
It's by the sea we'll breed

Into the sea we'll bleed
Into the sea we'll bleed
Into the sea we'll bleed
Into the sea we'll bleed
Into the sea1Embed
