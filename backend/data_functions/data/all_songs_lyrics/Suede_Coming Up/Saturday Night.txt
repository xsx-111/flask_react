Saturday Night Lyrics
Today she's been working
She's been talking
She's been smoking
It's gonna be alright
Cos tonight we'll go dancing
We'll go laughing
We'll get car sick

And it'll be okay like everyone says
It'll be alright and ever so nice
We're going out tonight
Out and about tonight

Oh whatever makes her happy
On a Saturday night
Oh whatever makes her happy
Whatever makes it alright

Today she's been sat there
Sat there in a black chair
Office furniture
But it'll be alright
Cos tonight we'll go drinking
We'll do silly things
And never let the winter in
And it'll be okay like everyone says
It'll be alright and ever so nice
We're going out tonight
Out and about tonight

Oh whatever makes her happy
On a Saturday night
Oh whatever makes her happy
Whatever makes it alright

We'll go to freak shows and peepshows
We'll go to discos, casinos
We'll go where people go and let go

Oh whatever makes her happy
On a Saturday night
Oh whatever makes her happy
Whatever makes it alright
Oh whatever makes her happy
On a Saturday night
Oh whatever makes her happy
Whatever makes it alright
Oh oh la la la la la la
Oh oh la la la la la la
Oh oh la la la la la la
Oh oh la la la la la la
Oh oh la la la la la la1Embed
