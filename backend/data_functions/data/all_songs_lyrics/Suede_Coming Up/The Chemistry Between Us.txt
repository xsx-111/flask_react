The Chemistry Between Us Lyrics
And maybe we're just kids who've grown
And maybe not
And maybe when we're on our own
We don't have much

But oh, we are young and not tired of it
Oh, we are young and easily lead
Oh, with all the kids getting out of their heads

Oh, Class A, Class B
Is that the only chemistry?
Oh, Class A, Class B
Is that the only chemistry
Between us

And maybe were just Streatham trash
And maybe not
And maybe we're just capital flash
In a stupid love

But oh, we are young and not tired of it
Oh we are young and easily lead
Oh, by all the kids getting out of our heads
Oh, Class A, Class B
Is that the only chemistry?
Oh, Class A, Class B
Is that the only chemistry
Between us?

Oh, we are young and not tired of it
Oh we are young and easily lead
Oh, we are the kids getting out of our heads

Oh, Class A, Class B
Is that the only chemistry?
Oh, Class A, Class B
Is that the only chemistry
Between us?1Embed
