The Hills LyricsI can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God
My animal howls
My angel's upset
But I'm not allowed
A trace of regret
For someone will use
The thing I could not be
My heart will be hers
Impersonally
She'll step on the path
She'll see what I mean
My will cut in half
And freedom between
For this in a second
Our lives will collide
The endless suspended
The door opened wide
And she will be born
To someone like you
What I left undone
She will certainly do
I know she is coming
And I know she will look
And that is the longing
And this is the hook
I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God
My page was too white
My ink was too thinned
The day wouldn't write
But the night penciled in
But I know she's coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
This is the hook
I know she is coming
And I know she will look
That is the longing
And this is the hook
I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God
I sailed like a swan
I sank like a rock
But time is long gone
Past my laughing stock
I can't make the hills
The system is shot
I'm living on pills
For which I thank God3Embed
