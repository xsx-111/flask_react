Thanks for the Dance LyricsThanks for the dance
I'm sorry you're tired
The evening has hardly begun
Thanks for the dance
Try to look inspired
One-two-three, one-two-three, one
There is a rose in your hair
Your shoulders are bare
You've been wearing this costume forever
So turn up the music
Pour out the wine
Stop at the surface
The surface is fine
We don't need to go any deeper
Thanks for the dance
I hear that we're married
One-two-three, one-two-three, one
Thanks for the dance
And the baby you carried
It was almost a daughter or a son
And there's nothing to do
But to wonder if you
Are as hopeless as me
And as decent
We're joined in the spirit
Joined at the hip
Joined in the panic
Wondering if
We've come to some sort
Of agreement
It was fine, it was fast
We were first, we were last
In line at the
Temple of Pleasure
But the green was so green
And the blue was so blue
I was so I
And you were so you
The crisis was light
As a feather
Thanks for the dance
It was hell, it was swell, it was fun
Thanks for all the dances
One-two-three, one-two-three, one2Embed
