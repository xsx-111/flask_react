What I Know LyricsMaybe I was young and I didn't understand

Could save you some trouble
Cause I know what I know, the hard way
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Listen up and you will know what not to do
Or, you can carry on until, they carry you
Either way it's thought, the lesson will be learned
Like you, I thought I was so clever
But, now I see that I was just a fool
Before I discovered what I know
Could save some trouble
Causse I know what I know, the ward way
What I know, I had to discover
What I know, could save you some trouble
Cause I know what I know, the hard way

Yeah, yeah, I know what I know
Yeah, yeah, I know what I know
Yeah, yeah
I used to think I was so clever
But now I see that I was just like you, before I discoverd...Embed
