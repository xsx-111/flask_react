Runaway (Tin Tin Out Single Remix) LyricsSay it's true
There's nothing like me and you
I'm not alone
Tell me you feel it too
And I would run away
I would run away, yeah yeah
I would run away
I would run away with you
Because I, have fallen in love with you
No, never, I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you
Close the door
Lay down upon the floor
And by candlelight
Make love to me through the night
Cause I have run away
I have run away, yeah yeah
I have run away, run away,run away
I have run away with you
Because I, have fallen in love with you
No, never, I'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you
And I would run away
I would run away, yeah yeah
I would run away
I would run away with you
Because I, have fallen in love with you
No, never, i'm never gonna stop
Falling in love with you
With you, my love
With you
Runaway yeah, runaway yeah
Runaway, runaway, runaway, runaway
Runaway yeah, runaway yeah, runaway, runaway, runaway yeah...
With.....you.......Embed
