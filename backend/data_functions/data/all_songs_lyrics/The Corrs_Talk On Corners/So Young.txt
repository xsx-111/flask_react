So Young LyricsYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We are taking it easy and bright and breezy, yeah
We are livin' it up just fine and dandy, yeah
And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all
Cause we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes we can do it all again
We are chasing the moon just running wild and free
We are following through every dream and every need
And it really doesn't matter if we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter, really doesn't matter at all
Cause we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes we can do it all again
Yeah we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes, we'll just do it all again
All again, all again, yeah, all again, all again, yeah...
Yeah so young now, we are so, so young now
And when tomorrow comes, we'll just do it all again
Yeah we are so young now, we are so young, so young now
And when tomorrow comes we'll just do it all again
We are so young, yeah, yeah, (repeat till fade)Embed
