Remember LyricsI see you in my memory
As vivid as today
And I wonder do you see me
In that same familiar way
Oh another place another time
We'll meet again
And you'll be mine
Oh cause nothing can compare to you and I
Wasn't it true
Do you remember like I do
Is it all tainted in your view
Could I just be a dream or two
Away from you
Now I know it was so special
Every single way
You know I'd go right back there
If you take me back today
Cause I knwo there's no one to replace you
In my mind
Wasn't it true
Do you remember like I do
Is it all tainted in your view
Could I just be a dream or two
Away from you
Do you remember?
Really remember?
Do you remember?
Really remember?
Wasn't it true
Do you remember like I do
Is it all tainted in your view
Could I just be a dream or two
Away from youEmbed
