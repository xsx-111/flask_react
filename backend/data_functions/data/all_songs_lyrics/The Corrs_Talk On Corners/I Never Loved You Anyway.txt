I Never Loved You Anyway LyricsYou bored me with your stories
I can't believe that I endured for as long as I did
I'm happy, it's over
I'm only sorry that I didn't make the move before you
And when you go I will remember
To send a thank you note to that girl -oooh that girl-
I see she's holding you so tender
Well I just wanna say -just wanna say-
I never really loved you anyway
No I didn't love you anyway
I never really loved you anyway
I'm so glad you're moving away
Valentino, I don't think so
You watching MTV while I lie dreaming in an empty bed
And come to think of it
I was misled
My flat, my food, my everything and thoughts inside my head
Before you go I must remember
To have a quiet word with that girl -oooh that girl-
Does she know you're not a spender
Well I just have to say -just wanna say-
I never really loved you anyway
No I didn't love you anyway
I never really loved you anyway
I'm so happy you moved away
Yeah I am
Yeah I am
And when you go I will remember
I must remember to say...
I never really loved you anyway
No I didn't love you anyway
I never really loved you anyway
I never really loved you anyway
I never really loved you anyway
-I never loved you anyway-
No I didn't love you anyway
-I never loved you anyway-
Never truly loved you anyway
-I never loved you anyway-
I'm so happy you moved away
Yeah, I'm delighted you're moving awayEmbed
