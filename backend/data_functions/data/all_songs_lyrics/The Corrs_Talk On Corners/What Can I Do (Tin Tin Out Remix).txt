What Can I Do (Tin Tin Out Remix) LyricsI haven't slept at all in days
It's been so long since we have talked
And I have been here many times
I just don't know what I'm doing wrong
What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there
There's only so much I can take
And I just got to let it go
And who knows I might feel better, yeah
If I don't try and I don't hope
What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there
No more waiting, no more
Aching
No more fighting, no more
Trying
Maybe there's nothing more to say
And in a funny way I'm calm
Because the power is not mine
I'm just gonna let it fly
What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What can I say to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there
Just tell me what to do
What can I do to make you love me
What can I do to make you care
What will it take to make you feel this
What can I do to get you there
And love me, love me, love me...Embed
