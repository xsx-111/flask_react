Soft Shock Lyrics
Unknown, talk to unknown
Ever lasts forever

Well, it's a sharp shock to your soft side
Summer moon, catch your shut eye
In your room
In my room
In your room
In my room

Louder lips speak louder
Better back together

Still, it's a sharp shock to your soft side
Summer moon, catch your shut eye
In my room
In your room
In my room
In your room

What's the time?
What's the day?
Gonna leave me?
What's the time?
What's the place?
Go and leave me
What's the time?
What's the day?
Gonna leave me?
What's the time?
What's the place?
Go and leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out
Leave me out1Embed
