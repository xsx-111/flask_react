Shame and Fortune Lyrics
"Shame is soft," they say
Lose when I play your game
Come if you call my name
Lose when I play your game

You got an attitude
You got a way

All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor

"Shame is soft," they say
Lose when I play your game

All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor
All fortune on the floor1Embed
