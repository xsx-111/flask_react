Dragon Queen Lyrics
My mouth is touching
Your mouth is running
No loving for nothing
Nobody, knock my body out

My mouth is blowing right up
I'm so gone
Incoming, out clubbing
Not loving, slow your body down

How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?

My mouth is touching
Your mouth is running
No loving for nothing
Nobody, knock my body out
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
How my love gonna show no scar?
How my love going huh, huh?
Huh

Going huh, huh, huh
Going huh, huh, huh
Going huh, huh, huh
Going huh, huh, huh
Going huh, huh, huh
Going huh, huh, huh2Embed
