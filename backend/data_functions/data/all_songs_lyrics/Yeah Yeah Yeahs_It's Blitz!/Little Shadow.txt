Little Shadow LyricsPatience, shadow
For all your sight, there's no sight to see
Little shadow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Pardon, shadow
Hold on tight to your darkened key
Little shadow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Closer, shadow
For all your strikes, still, we're caught between
All this sorrow, little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?
Every shape and size
Deep and deep, we dive
Turn and turn aside
To a fantasy
Little shadow
Into the night, will you follow me?
Little shadow
To the night, will you follow me?Embed
