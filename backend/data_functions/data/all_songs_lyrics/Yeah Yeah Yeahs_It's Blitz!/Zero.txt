Zero Lyrics
Shake it like a ladder to the sun
Makes me feel like a madman on the run
Find me never, never far gone
So get your leather, leather, leather on-on-on-on

You're a zero
What's your name?
No one's gonna ask you
Better find out where they want you to go
Try and hit the spot
Get to know it in the dark
Get to know it whether you're a crime, crime, crime of love
Can you climb, climb, climb higher?

Shake it like a ladder to the sun
Makes me feel like a madman on the run
Know you're never, never far gone
So get your leather, leather, leather on-on-on-on-on

You're a zero
What's your name?
No one's gonna ask you
Better find out where they want you to go
Try and hit the spot
Get to know it in the dark
Get to know it whether you're a crime, crime, crime of love
Can you climb, climb, climb higher?
Was it the cure?
Shell-shock
Was it the cure?
Hope not
Was it the cure?
Shell-shock
Was it the cure?
What's your name?

You're a zero
What's your name?
No one's gonna ask you
Better find out where they want you to go
Try and hit the spot
Get to know it in the dark
Get to know it whether you're a crime, crime, crime of love
Can you climb, climb, climb higher?

Was it the cure?
Shell-shock
Was it the cure?
Hope not
Was it the cure?
Shell-shock
Was it the cure?
Hope not
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?
What's your name?3Embed
