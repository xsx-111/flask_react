Turn the Page Lyrics
Nothing can survive in a vacuum
No one can exist all alone
We pretend things only happen to strangers
We've all got problems of our own
It's enough to learn to share our pleasures
We can't soothe pain with sympathy
All that we can do is be reminded
We shake our heads at the tragedy

Every day we're standing in a time capsule
Racing down a river from the past
Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel
Facing down the future coming fast
It's just the age
It's just a stage
We disengage
We turn the page

Looking at the long range forecast
Catching all the names in the news
Checking out the state of the nation
Learning the environmental blues
Truth is after all a moving target
Hairs to split, and pieces that don't fit
How can anybody be enlightened?
Truth is after all so poorly lit
Every day we're standing in a time capsule
Racing down a river from the past
It's just the age
It's just a stage
We disengage
We turn the page, we turn it
It's just the age
It's just a stage
We disengage
We turn the page
Every day we're standing in a time capsule
We disengage, we turn the page
Racing down the river from the past
Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel
(It's just a stage)
We disengage, we turn the page
Facing down the future coming fast
Every day we're standing in a time capsule
(It's just a stage)
We disengage, we turn the page
Racing down the river from the past
Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel
(It's just a stage)
We disengage, we turn the pageEmbed
