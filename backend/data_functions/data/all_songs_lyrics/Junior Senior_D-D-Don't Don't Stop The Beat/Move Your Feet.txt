Move Your Feet Lyrics
Can't stop, (Can't stop) the beat
I won't stop, (Won't stop),  won't stop the beat, and go!

Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
We goin' down town, oh yeah
We goin' down town, oh yeah
We goin' down town, oh yeah
We goin' down town, oh

D-d-don't, don't stop the beat
I c-c-c-can't control my feet
P-p-p-people in the streets
C'mon, everybody, and move your feet

Don't stop (Don't stop), don't stop the beat
I can't stop (Can't stop), can't stop the beat
I won't stop (Won't stop), won't stop the beat, and go!
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
We goin' down town, oh yeah
We goin' down town, oh yeah
We goin' down town, oh yeah
We goin' down town, oh

S-s-s-s-sing my song
And y-y-y-you, you sing along
Just p-p-p-put my record on
And all of your troubles are dead and gone

Don't stop (Don't stop), don't stop the beat
I can't stop (Can't stop), can't stop the beat
I won't stop (Won't stop), won't stop the beat, and go!
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh

Yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Don't stop (Don't stop), don't stop the beat
I can't stop (Can't stop), can't stop the beat
I won't stop (Won't stop), won't stop the beat, and go!

Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
Everybody
Move your feet, and feel united
Oh-oh-oh
