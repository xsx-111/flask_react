Dynamite LyricsAh shake it one, shake it two
Shake it three and four
'Cause we are starting up a fire on the dance floor
Step aside, day and night they use dynamite
You know Junior Senior's outta sight
Do you think that Junior's dynamite?
Ah, do you think that Senior's dynamite?
Bombs, we got bombs, we got bomb-ba-bombs
Ah, we got bomb-bombs, bombs-a-bombs
Ah, we got bomb-bomb-ba-bomb-ba-bombs
We got a big, bad bag full of dynamite
Alright, three-two-one
Go countdown, son
And we say three-two-one
We've just begun
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Ah TNT, you and me ain't no wannabe
We'll show you the way it's gonna be
Won't be long, it's begun, 'til we drop the bomb
We are playing with fire, and we've just begun
Do you think that Junior's dynamite?
Ah, do you think that Senior's dynamite?
Bombs, we got bombs, we got bombs-a-bombs
Ah, we got bomb, bomb, we got bomb-a-bombs
Ah, we got bomb, bombs, we got bomb-ba-bombs
We got a big, bad bag full of dynamite
Alright, three-two-one
Go countdown, son
And we say three-two-one
We've just begun
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Bombs, we got bombs, we got bombs-a-bombs
Ah, we got bomb, bombs, bombs-a-bombs
Havin' fun on the run (???)
With my big, bad bag full of dynamite
Alright, three-two-one
Go countdown, son
And we say three-two-one
We've just begun
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamite
Junior Senior's dynamite, dynamiteEmbed
