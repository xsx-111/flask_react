Go Junior, Go Senior LyricsSenior: Are you there, Junior?
Junior: I am here, Senior!
Both: Let's Go
We wanna take you, to outer space
We wanna shake you, the human race
We wanna take you to the moon and back
We wanna give you a heart attack
{Chorus *}
Do the kids dig what we do?
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Do the kids dig what we do?
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
He is the son of Frankenstein (Bow-wow-wow)
He shakes it good (yeah), He shakes it fine
Here's a fan of the JJ Fad (JJ Fad)
He's the best thing you ever had
{Chorus *}
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Junior, Senior
Go Junior, Go Senior
Go Junior, Senior, Hey
{Bridge}
Clap your hands and move your feet
Get on down and feel the beat
Hey boys and girls can you feel the heat
When we're through, take it to the street
{Bridge x 3}
{Chorus*}Embed
