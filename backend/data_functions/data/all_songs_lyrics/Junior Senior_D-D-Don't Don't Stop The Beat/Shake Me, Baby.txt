Shake Me, Baby LyricsIf you can't shake my brother
If you can't shake my sister
If you can't shake my brother
Come on and shake away with me
And I'll be your tamborine man
Oooh shake me in the palm of your hand
Shake me your Tamborine man
Shake me Shake me baby like no other can
I need you honey almost all the time
When I feel blue (ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
I think about you almost all the time
When I feel blue
Uh HUhhhhh
If you can't shake my brother
If you can't shake my sister
If you can't shake my brother
Come on and shake away with me
And i'll be your tamborine man
Come on and shake me in the palm of your hand
And You'll be my Tamborine girl
Shake Shake me baby till the end of the world
I need you honey almost all the time
When I feel blue ( ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
I need you honey almost all the time
When I feel blue
Say Pre-pre-preacher man
Knock-Knock on your door
Why don't you let me in?
What is my sin?
Say Pre-pre-preacher man
Knock-Knock on your door
Why don't you let me in?
What is my sin?
I think about you almost all the time
When I feel blue
But you've been cryin', my baby ( ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)
You hold my hand and you make me cry
And tell me maybe, baby, baby, babyEmbed
