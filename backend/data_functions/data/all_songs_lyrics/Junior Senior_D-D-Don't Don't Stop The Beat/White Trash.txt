White Trash LyricsWe wanna be like Nancy and Lee
We wanna sing like K-k-kim and Marvin
We wanna wear the same as Sonny and Cher
And show we got balls like the New York Dolls
(repeat)
I wanna look good that ain't a bad thing
Hang on man I'm a little girl
I'm white trash, I stick to my own
(??)
What's your name? white trash, what's your name? white trash
What's your name white trash, what's your name white trash
Oomamamowmowooma White trash
I ain't got no cash, I ain't got no cash
And if I get some money I'll still be a white trash, yeah!
We wanna move like Rusted Crew
We wanna play like Stevie and Ray
Underground trance like they do in France
And bad to the bone like Joey Ramone
We wanna move like Rusted (wooohoo!) Crew
We wanna play like (woowoowoo!) Stevie and Ray
Underground trance like they do (wooohoo!) in France
And bad to the bone like (woowoowoo!) Joey Ramone
I wanna be cool and drop outta school (wooohoo!)
I wanna take brunt but not the door (woowoowoowoo!) knockin'
Understand this or understand nothing (wooohoo!)
All I think about is money and fuckin'
What's your name white trash, what's your name white trash
What's your name white trash, what's your name white trash
Oomamamowmowooma white trash
I ain't got no cash, I ain't got no cash
And if I get some money I'll still be a white trash, yeah!
