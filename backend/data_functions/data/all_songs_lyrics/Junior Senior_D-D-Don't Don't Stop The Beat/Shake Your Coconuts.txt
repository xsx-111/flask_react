Shake Your Coconuts Lyrics
Come on
Oh yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Shout! Ah, ah
O-wa, o-wa
Woo!

Come on in, hang your coats
Eat our chips, come on, we've got loads

Shake your coconuts, coco boys
Until the nut comes out, come on, coco girls

Just keep on dancing now, just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun, the party's just begun
Just keep on dancing now, just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun, the party's just begun

All dressed up, and dressed to kill
Doctor says, come on, eat your pills
Shake your coconuts, coco boys
Until the milk comes out, come on, coco girls

Just keep on dancing now, just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun, the party's just begun
Just keep on dancing now, just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun, the party's just begun

It's Junior Senior time to show us you care, hey
Just feel the power put your hands in the air, hey
Hey boys and girls we want to see what you got, hey
We wanna see you shaking coconuts, shake it

Hey! Hey!
Whoa

We'll get up, to sing some music
We'll get down, to pass the time

Shake your coconuts, come on, coco boys
Until the nut comes out, come on, coco girls
Just keep on dancing now, just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun, the party's just begun
Just keep on dancing now, just keep on getting down
Just keep on having fun, the party's just begun

Just keep on dancing (Dancing now)
Just keep on getting (Getting down)
Just keep on having (Having fun)
The party's just begun (Just begun)
Woo!Embed
