Good Girl, Bad Boy LyricsI've got to, got to, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to catch my breath
Baby, baby, baby, whoo it's true
I wanna, wanna dance with you woohoo
We're dancing, dancing, dancing slow, too close
I'd kiss you if I could like a bad boy should
We're getting closer and closer
And warmer and warmer
My heart is racing and pacing
Your dad is gonna kill me
Good girl
I'm a such a bad boy
You used to be a good girl
But then you met a bad boy
Yeah
You know I've got to catch my
I've got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to catch my breath
Pumping, pumping, pumping up each other
We are working, working, working off a sweat
I'm looking, looking, looking for your heartbeat
Oooh just understand I wanna be your man
We're getting closer and closer
And warmer and warmer
My heart is racing and pacing
Your dad is gonna kill me
Good girl
Your mom says I'm a bad boy
You're father's little good girl
Your mom says I'm a bad boy
Because of my long hair
Got to catch my, got to catch my breath
I've got to, got to, got to, I've got to
We're getting closer and closer
And warmer and warmer
My heart is racing and pacing
Your dad is gonna kill me
Good girl
Your mom says I'm a bad boy
You're daddy's little good girl
Your mom says I'm a bad boy
Yeah, you used to be a good girl
But then you met a bad boy
Yeah, that's me alrightEmbed
