The Downtown Lights Lyrics

Sometimes I walk away
When all I really wanna do
Is love and hold you right
There is just one thing I can say
Nobody loves you this way
It's alright
Can't you see?
The downtown lights

In love we're all the same
We're walking down an empty street
And with nobody, call your name
Empty streets, empty nights
The downtown lights

How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's alright
Tonight and every night
Let's go walking down this empty street
Let's walk in the cool evening light
Wrong or right
Be at my side
The downtown lights

It will be alright
It will be alright
The downtown lights
Yeah, yeah

How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?

It's alright
It's alright
The downtown lights
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know you feel it?
How do I know it's true?
Yeah, yeah, the downtown lights

The neon's and the cigarettes
Rented rooms and rented cars
The crowded streets, the empty bars
Chimney tops and trumpets
The golden lights, the loving prayers
The coloured shoes, the empty trains
I'm tired of crying on the stairs
The downtown lights3Embed
