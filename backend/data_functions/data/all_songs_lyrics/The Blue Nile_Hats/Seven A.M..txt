Seven A.M. Lyrics
Where's the love that shines?
Every single time I'm near you
Where's the love that's all
All I want is you

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
I need love to be true

Where's the light that shines
Out among the neon signs?
Every single time I see you
You're mine and only mine

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Ooh, baby
Where's the love that shines?

Each time I fall for you
It hurts me a little bit more
Than I want it to
I don't want it to, yeah
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
I need love to be true, yeah
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
I'm coming home to you

Stop, go
Stop, go
Stop, go
I don't know, yeah

Where is the love?
Where is the love?
