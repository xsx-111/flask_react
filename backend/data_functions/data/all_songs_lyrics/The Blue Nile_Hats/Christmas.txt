Christmas Lyrics
Waking up
The christmas lights
The money running out
The kid seem to cry all the time

Take it easy
Take it easy
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you

The christmas streets
The ribbons in your hair
I stand in there watch
In the window

Take it easy
Take it easy
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believе in you

The christmas lights
Go all around the world
And shining down on you one day
So takе it easy
I still love you
I believe in you
I believe in you
I believe in loveEmbed
