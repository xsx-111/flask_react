Saturday Night Lyrics
Who do you love?
Who do you really love?
Who are you holding on to?
Who are you dreaming of?
Who do you love?
When it's cold and it's starlight
When the streets are so big and wide
I love you
An ordinary girl
Can make the world alright
Love me all the way
Saturday night
Saturday night

Quarter to five
When the storefronts are closed in paradise
Meet me outside the cherry light
You and I walk away
An ordinary girl
Will make the world alright
She'll love me all the way
It's Saturday night, yeah, yeah
Ordinary girl
And all the coloured lights
She'll love me all the way
It's Saturday night
Saturday night

Love me wrong or right
Who do you love?
Who do you really love?
Who do you love?
Who do you really love?
Saturday night, yeah
Saturday night, yeah
Saturday night, yeah
Saturday night, yeah

I love an ordinary girl
She'll make the world alright
She'll love me and I know
Love is Saturday night
Alright, alright, alright
She'll love meEmbed
