Over the Hillside Lyrics
Workin' night and day
I try to get ahead
But I don't get ahead this way
Workin' night and day
The railroad and the fence
Watch the train go roll around the bend

Over the hillside
Over the moment
Over the hills and waiting

Workin' night and day
I try to get ahead
Workin' night and day
Don't make no sense
Walk me into town
The ferry will be there
To carry us away into the air

Over the hillside
Over white water
Over the hills and falling
The stars in your eyes
Knowin' what's right
The stars in your eyes
Don't explain

Over the hillside
Over the hillside
Over the hills and waiting
Over the hillside
Over the hillside
Over the hills and home we'll go

Tomorrow I will be there
Tomorrow I will be there
Tomorrow I will be there
Oh, you wait and see

I can't go on and I can't go back
I don't feel so, matter of fact
I tried and tried to make good sense
What's the good to try it all again?1Embed
