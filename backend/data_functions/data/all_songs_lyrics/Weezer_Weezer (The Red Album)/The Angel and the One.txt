The Angel and the One Lyrics
It's not my destiny to be the one that you will lay with
So many reasons why I have to go but want to stay here
Sometimes I want a taste
But then I don't know what I'm saying

You are the angel
And I am the one that is praying

There is another love
That I would rather be obeying
I see the ecstasy
And already I'm anticipating

I feel a deeper peace
And that deeper peace is penetrating
I got the magic in me
I am complete is what I'm saying

I'm flying up so high
My purple majesty displaying
I've reached a higher place
That no one else can make a claim in
I'll take you there, my friend
I'm reaching out my hand, so take it
We are the angels
And we are the ones that are praying

Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
Peace, shalom
Peace, shalom
Peace, peace
