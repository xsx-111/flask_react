I Can Love LyricsI didn't hope for much
I was used to how things were
Even though I was not sure
You say
I was throwing it away
And I never learned to heal
I can't believe what I see
After all this time it is meant to be
Help me believe
Believe
Believe
That I can love
I can love (x7)
I guess it goes to show
That you never should give up
Even when you're out of luck
You might
Find an angel in your sight
Who turns everything around
I can't believe what I see
After all this time it is meant to be
Help me believe
Believe
Believe
That I can love
I can love (x7)
Help me believe what I see
After all this time it is meant to be
Help me believe
Believe
Believe
That I can love
I can loveEmbed
