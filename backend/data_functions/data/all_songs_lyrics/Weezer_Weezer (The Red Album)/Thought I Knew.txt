Thought I Knew Lyrics
Sorry about my past life
Sorry but we just missed
Sorry it had to end up like this
Sorry if I caused you pain
Sorry I forgot your name
Sorry, but you left me out in the rain

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true

Sorry if I caused you harm
Sorry I'm no good luck charm
Sorry you didn't end up in my arms

Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true

Now that our world's gone dark
We've drained the well, blew out the spark
And now we're left with broken hearts
Trying to find a new place to start
Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true
Thought I knew you better then
Thought I knew your intentions
Thought I knew but didn't have a clue
Not a single damn thing was true1Embed
