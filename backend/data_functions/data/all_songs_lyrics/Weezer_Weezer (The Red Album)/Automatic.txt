Automatic Lyrics
How am I going to
Deliver you a mountain size of love?
How do oceans connected by a straw
Get something through?
I might need some time to remember
Need some time to remember

Hey, it's automatic when you know it
Hey, it's automatic when feel it

When do I lay down
And get to see the world inside your eyes?
How can I reach out
And hold on to the joy you've got inside?

Hey, it's automatic when you know it
Hey, it's automatic when feel it

I got some
But I wanna feel it every hour
Cause I want to give it to you
Hey, it's automatic when you know it
Hey, it's automatic when feel it1Embed
