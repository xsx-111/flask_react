Miss Sweeney Lyrics
Hi, hello, Miss Sweeney, could you please come in my office for a second?
I'm headin' home for the day and I thought it'd be good for you and me to check in
I met with a gal from expo and they do have the "slab" cabinets in white
She thinks we can take measurements down at the site

If we do that we'll be just fine, Miss Sweeney
That's all I got to say to you at this time, Miss Sweeney
Actually, there's one other thing on my mind

Girl, you make the rainclouds disappear
The sun always shines when you're near
I'm waiting, until you love me
Sweeney

I'm so sorry, Miss Sweeney, I don't know where that came from
I think I was overcome by a spontaneous emotion
Anyway, the cash deposit of five thousand dollars
Will need to be sent to the property owner tomorrow

If there are any problems with the deposit or contract, don't be afraid to holler
I don't wanna have to approve each stinkin' dollar that we borrow
Ah, forget it!
Miss Sweeney
Girl, you make the rainclouds disappear
The sun always shines when you're near
I'm waiting, until you love me

Miss Sweeney, I got to admit the truth
I am totally head-over-heels in love with you
Everyday you come to the office lookin' fine
Navy business suit clingin' tightly to your spine
You ask me if I'm ready to get down to work
Sweeney, baby, I'm ready, be my...

Girl, you make the rainclouds disappear
The sun always shines when you're near
I'm waiting, until you love me...

Girl, you light the skies of my life
I swear, I will make you my wife
I'm waiting, until you love me
Miss Sweeney
