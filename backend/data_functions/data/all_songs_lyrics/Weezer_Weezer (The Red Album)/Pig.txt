Pig Lyrics
When I was a baby, I was so happy
I'd play with my friends in the mud
Wilbur and Jack and Otis and Beatty
We were a gang, you got to believe me
Momma would scold us if we got too rough
She didn't care, she was proud of us
I ran around and talked to the animals
Tellin' 'em stories of savage cannibals
Then I got older and noticed a girl
First I was sure I didn't exist to her
I sulked around, but I didn't know why
Then she put her cheek on my shoulder and I
Was lookin' at her and she was lookin' at me
We started to smile, it was our destiny
Tina was her name, she was my cute-pie
Forgot about the things I used to like
I spent all my time followin' her around
My friends all made the whiplash sound
But they understood, they was happy for me
And everyone clapped when I asked her to marry me
And she said, "Yes," and we felt so fine
We lost track of the passing of time
Before I knew it we had our own babies
Gina and Shelley and Keebie and Gabe
But now, I've got to die
I lived a good life, I've got no complaints
I'd like to thank Farmer Pete
For bringin' me scraps of food that I could eat
He always had a smile on his face
He didn't want to think of this day
It's finally here
(It's finally here, it's finally here)
It's finally here
(It's finally here)
Whoa-oh-oh
They called me Pig
They called me Pig
Oh, oh-oh

When I was a baby, I was so happy
I'd play with my friends in the mudEmbed
