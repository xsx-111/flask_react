Everybody Get Dangerous Lyrics
When I was younger
I used to go and tip cows for fun, yeah
Actually I didn't do that
Because I didn't want the cow to be sad
But some of my friends did
They were all just a little bit wicked
They'd blow up mail boxes
With a baseball bat
Go for direct hits
On Halloween you can forget it
They throw rotten eggs into traffic
Toilet paper the fences
Throw the tables, chairs, and the benches
After practice
Sometimes we would break into mad fits
Causing damage
(Burning amplifiers and mic stands)

Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous
I've got a confession
That I will make if you will listen
Late in the nighttimes
We'd drive around with hairspray and sharp knives
Looking for road kills
Lighting things on fire for cheap thrills
Stab the corpses
And lick the knives like we're evil forces
Hockey games on frozen ponds
No safety pads were ever put on
Driving home on country roads
Sixty-five in a twenty-five zone
In my parents Tercel
How did we survive so well
Throw the keys and the wheel locked up
I almost killed every one of us

Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous

There must be
A guardian angel
Or some kind of destiny we have
Because we should have died
A long time ago
The way that we were living in our pasts
What will we say when our kids come to us
And ask, with a smile on their face
"Hey Dad, my friend's got some new ninja swords!
Is it cool if we slash up his place?"
Hey
Hey
Hey ("Is it cool if we slash up his place?")
And get dangerous

Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous (Boo yah!)
Everybody get dangerous
Everybody get dangerous
(Ow!)
Ow!
Ow!
Gow!
Gow! (Yee, hee ha!)
