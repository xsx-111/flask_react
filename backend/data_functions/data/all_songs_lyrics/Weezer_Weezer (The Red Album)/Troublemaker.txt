Troublemaker Lyrics
Put me in a special school because I am such a fool
And I don't need a single book to teach me how to read
Who needs stupid books? They are for petty crooks
And I will learn by studying the lessons in my dreams
So turn off the TV, 'cause that's what others see
And movies are as bad as eating chocolate ice-cream
They only sicken me, don't let me play football
I'll sack the quarterback and jack the brother of the ball

I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

I picked up a guitar, what does this signify?
I'm going to play some heavy metal riffs and you will die
You wanted arts and crafts? How's this for arts and crafts?
Wanannanananananananananananananana, that's right!
I'm growing out my hair, I'm moving out to Cherokee
I'm going to be a rock star and you are going to bear with me
Because I can't work a job like any other slob
Punching in and punching out and sucking up to Bob
Marrying a beeyotch, having seven keeyods
Giving up and growing old and hoping there's a God
I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

I'm going to be a star and people will crane necks
To get a glimpse of me and see if I am having sex
And studying my moves, they try to understand
Why I am so unlike the singers in the other bands
I'm such a mystery as anyone can see
There isn't anybody else exactly quite like me
And when it's party time, like 1999
I'll party by myself because I'm such a special guy

I'm a troublemaker, never been a faker
Doing things my own way and never giving up
I'm a troublemaker, not a double-taker
I don't have the patience to keep it on the up

Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker
Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker
Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker
Keep it on the up, I'm a troublemaker, never giving up3Embed
