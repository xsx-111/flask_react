The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn) Lyrics

You try to play cool like you just don't care
But soon I'll be playin' in your underwear
I'm like a mage with the magic spell
You come like a dog when I ring your bell
I got the money and I got the fame
You got the hots to ride on my plane
You givin' me all that I desire
'Cause down with me, I'm taking you higher

I'm the baddest of the bad, I'm the best that you've ever had
I'm the tops, I'm the thing, all the girls get up when I sing, yeah
I'm the meanest in the place, step up, I'll mess with your face
I don't care where you are, look up and follow the star

I, I'm gonna tear down the wall
I may not be here when you call, so best be givin' me your all
Ooh

After the havoc that I'm gonna wreak
No more words will critics have to speak
I've got the answers to the tangled knot
Sleep tight in your cot
Oh baby, I've been told I'm goin' crazy
Oh baby, well, I can't be held down
Oh baby, somehow, I'm keeping it steady
Oh baby, I'm tearing up this town

Hey, this is what I like
Cut my heart with a martyr's spike
Hey, this is nothing new
I've got more than enough for you

I can take on anybody, I can do my thing
I don't wanna hurt nobody but a bee has got to sting
I'ma fix it if you mix it up, hoot, hoot
Talk smack, and I'm-a gonna shut you up, hoot, hoot

I am the greatest man that ever lived
I was born to give (I was born to give)
I am the greatest man that ever lived, oh
Radioactive (Radioactive)

Somebody said all the world's a stage
And each of us is a player, that's what I've been tryin' to tell you
In Act 1, I was struggling to survive
Nobody wanted my action dead or alive
Act 2, I hit the big time
And bodies be all up on my behind
And I can't help myself
Because I was born to shine
If you don't like it, you can shove it
But you don't like it, you love it
So I'll be up here in a rage
'Til they bring the curtain down on the stage
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived
I'm the greatest man that ever lived

I am the greatest man that ever lived
I was born to give and give and give
I am the greatest man that ever lived
Radioact-dioact-dioact-dioactive
I am the greatest man that ever lived
I was born to give
Woo! Hoo! Hoo!4Embed
