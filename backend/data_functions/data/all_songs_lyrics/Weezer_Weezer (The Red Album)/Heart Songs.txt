Heart Songs Lyrics
Gordon Lightfoot sang a song about a boat that sank
In the lake at the break of the morning
A cat named Stevens found a faith he could believe in
And Joan Baez, I never listened to too much jazz
But hippie songs could be heard in our pad
Eddie Rabbitt sang about how much he loved a rainy night
Abba, Devo, Benatar were there the day John Lennon died
Mr. Springsteen said he had a hungry heart
Grover Washington was happy on the day he topped the charts
These are the songs

These are my heart songs
They never feel wrong
And when I wake for goodness sake
These are the songs I keep singin'

Quiet Riot got me started with the bangin' of my head
Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Slayer taught me how to shred
I gotta admit though, sometimes I would listen to the radio
Debbie Gibson, tell me that you think we're all alone
Michael Jackson's in the mirror, I've gotta have faith if I wanna see clear
Never gonna give you up, wish me love or wishing well
It takes two to make a thing go right, if the Fresh Prince starts a fight
Don't you worry for too long cause you know these are the songs
These are my heart songs
They never feel wrong
And when I wake for goodness sake
These are the songs I keep singin'

Back in 1991, I wasn't havin' any fun
'Til my roommate said, "Come on and put a brand new record on"
Had a baby on it, he was naked on it
Then I heard the chords that broke the chains I had upon me
Got together with my bros, in some rehearsal studios
Then we played our first rock show
And watched the fan base start to grow
Signed the deal that gave the dough to make a record of our own
The song come on the radio, now people go, this is the song

These are my heart songs
They never feel wrong
And when I wake for goodness sake
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing
These are the songs I keep singing3Embed
