Pork and Beans Lyrics
They say I need some Rogaine to put in my hair
Working out at the gym to fit my underwear
Oakley makes the shades that transform a tool
You'd hate for the kids to think that you lost your cool

I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene

I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

Everyone likes to dance to a happy song, hey, hey
With a catchy chorus and beat so they can sing along, hey, hey
Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the charts, hey!
Maybe if I work with him, I can perfect the art

I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene
I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think

No, I don't care, I don't care
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care

I'ma do the things that I wanna do
I ain't got a thing to prove to you
I'll eat my candy with the pork and beans
Excuse my manners if I make a scene

I ain't gonna wear the clothes that you like
I'm fine and dandy with the me inside
One look in the mirror and I'm tickled pink
I don't give a hoot about what you think9Embed
