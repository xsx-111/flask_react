Walk Alone LyricsI think you were wrong
You said I can't love
I was put upon this earth not by any God or master
To know you somehow
In some bar someday I would see your face
I don't believe this shit
I was doing fine without it
Now I can't walk alone
I can't walk alone
I just need a little more time
I just need a little more highs
I just need a little something from you
Baby, I was born to love
I was born to love
I was put upon this earth
I was doing fine without it
Now I can't walk alone
I can't walk aloneEmbed
