False Hope LyricsIs it still okay that I don't know how to be alone?
Would it be okay if I'd just came home tonight?
We stay in the apartment on the Upper West Side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope
A storm hits the city and the lights go out before
I can prepare
The whole of downtown looks dark like no one lives there
We stay in the apartment on the Upper West Side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope
She'll be alright tomorrow
Neither of us is gonna sleep tonight
So it'll come slow
I hear you baying through the wall
A dying animal's last call
Is it still okay that I don't know how to be at all?
There's a party uptown but I just don't feel like I belong at all
Do I?
We stay in the apartment on the Upper West Side
And my worst problem is I don't sleep at night
Woman downstairs just lost her mind
And I don't care how, I surely don't care why
Why I know false hope
Why I know false hope2Embed
