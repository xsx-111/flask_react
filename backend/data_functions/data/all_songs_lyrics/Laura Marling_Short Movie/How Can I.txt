How Can I Lyrics
We’ve been riding up mountains
Turning corners in our lives
We would have taken any buses headed for Telluride
But we stopped in the desert in the middle of the night and Looked to the stars from the old roadsides
You look at me and said
"Look at the moon, take it in
It will be gone soon’

I’m taking more risks now
I’m stepping out of line
I put up my fists now until I get what’s mine
It should have been you
But it was anyone, you see
I never miss my chance to run
I will go anywhere with you
I will go when you ask me to

How will I live without you?
How will I live?

Well I wrote you a letter, posted out of central L.A
Now if you ever come through here
Won’t you come take me away
It could have been you
But it was anyone, you see
I never miss my chance to run
And I would go anywhere with you
I will go when you ask me to
How can I live without you?
How can I live?
How can I live without you?
How can I live?

I’m going back East where I belong
Where I belong
I’m going back East where I belong
Where I belong

But how will I live without you?
How can I live?
How can I live without you?
How can I live?Embed
