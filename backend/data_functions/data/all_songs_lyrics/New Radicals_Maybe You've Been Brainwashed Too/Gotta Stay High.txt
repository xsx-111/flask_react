Gotta Stay High Lyrics
One, two, three, four
I saw your eyes
I had to run away
I fell too deep in love
There were no words to say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just had to get high
One look inside
And I knew right away
I felt too much
I did not have the strength
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I just ran to get high
But, lover, there's something about your pushing me
Pulling me that's saying don't go away
I saw your eyes
Fell back to yesterday
One lonely child
Until you let me stay
Yeah, yeah yeah
I had no one on my side
Good God, I think I'm falling
Too weak to stand
Too scared to love again
The dam has broke
My soul is spilling all over your hands
Take a look in my eyes
Lover
There's something about your pushing me
Pulling me
That's saying don't go away
Yeah, yeah
One, two, three, four
La la...
I see your eyes
I'll never run away
I fell too deep in love
I've got just five words to say
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You just gotta stay high1Embed
