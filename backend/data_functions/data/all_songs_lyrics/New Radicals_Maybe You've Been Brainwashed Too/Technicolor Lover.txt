Technicolor Lover Lyrics
She came from a world that is so far out
Roller skating into my life, I never had no doubt
She said, "Where'd you get that velvet-colored hair?"
I said, "I got lot's more somewhere
If you touch my big -"
And she said, "I come from a world that is so far out"
And I said, "So do I"

And she may not be the world's solution
But she's a world class revolution

Technicolor Lover
Take my heart
Technicolor Lover
Take my heart
Technicolor Lover
Take my heart...now

She came from a world that is so far out
Roller skating into my life, I never had no doubt
She asked, "Where'd you get that velvet-colored hair?"
I said, "I got lot's more somewhere
If you touch my big -" ahh
And she said, "I come from a world that is so far out"
And I said, "So do I"
And she may not be the world's solution
But she's a world class revolution

Technicolor Lover
Take my heart
Technicolor Lover
Sate my heart
Technicolor Lover
Rate my heart...now

She said, "Where'd you get that -" heh heh, yeah
I said, "I got so much somewhere
If you touch my big-"
Ah, yeah
And she may not be the world's solution
But she's a world class revolution

Technicolor Lover
Take my heart
Technicolor Lover
Rate my heart
Technicolor Lover
Sate my heart...nowEmbed
