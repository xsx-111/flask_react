Flowers Lyrics
It's '97, why aren't things wild?
You said you was a flower child
I can respect your soul-searching
But now's the time for questioning
I'm sure you've been misled before
And once you'd trust, they'd slam the door
But I'm everything I've claimed to be
You just need vodka and honesty

Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?

My love is real
As real as the flowers you smoke to get high
Our love is real
As real as our God who has spoken on how we can fly
Our love is real
As real as the flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers

You're 22, why aren't you free?
You're Mom and Daddy's victory
A soul that's lived a thousand lives (Oooh oooh)
Don't hide behind a child's eyes (No no no no no)
Yeah, I'm sure you've been misled before
And once you'd trust, they'd slam the door
But I'm everything I've claimed to be
You just need vodka and honesty
Yeah, right
Do you know who I am?
Do you know who I am?

My love is real
As real as the flowers you smoke to get high
Our love is real
As real as our God who has spoken on how we can fly
Our love is real
As real as the flowers, flowers, flowers, flowers

I love you, you hate me
I took math class, that ain't fair exchange
I call you, you hang up
Don't have to be bitch, get your number changed
I'm sorry, forgive me
I never meant to call you those names
But I'm lonely, so lonely, please
Ow
I love you, you hate me
I took math class, that ain't fair exchange
I call you, you hang up
Don't have to be bitch, get your number changed
I'm sorry, forgive me
I never meant to call you those names
But I'm lonely, so lonely, please
Slow that
Our love is real
As real as the flowers you smoke to get high
Our love is real
As real as our God who has spoken on how we can flyEmbed
