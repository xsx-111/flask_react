You Get What You Give Lyrics
One, two!
One, two, three, ow!

Wake up, kids, we got the dreamers' disease
Age fourteen, they got you down on your knees
So polite, we're busy still saying please
Frienemies, who, when you're down, ain't your friend
Every night we smash a Mercedes-Benz
First we run, and then we laugh till we cry

But when the night is falling
You cannot find the light (Light)
You feel your dreams are dying, hold tight

You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

I'm comin' home, baby
You're tops
Give it to me now!
Four A.M., we ran a miracle mile
We're flat broke, but hey, we do it in style
The bad rich, God's flying in for your trial

But when the night is falling
You cannot find a friend (Friend)
You feel your tree is breaking, just bend

You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give

This whole damn world could fall apart
You'll be okay, follow your heart
You're in harm's way, I'm right behind
Now set your mark

You've got the music in you
Don't let go, you've got the music in you
One dance left, this world is gonna pull through
Don't give up, you've got a reason to live
Can't forget, we only get what we give
Don't let go, I feel the music in you
You, you, you
Fly high, high
What's real can't die
You only get what you give
You're gonna get what you give
Don't give up, just don't be afraid to live

Health insurance, rip-off flying
FDA, big bankers buying
Fake computer crashes dining
Cloning while they're multiplying
Fashion shoots with Beck and Hanson
Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson
You're all fakes, run to your mansions
Come around, we'll kick your ass in

Don't let go, one dance left
Don't give up, can't forget
Don't let go15Embed
