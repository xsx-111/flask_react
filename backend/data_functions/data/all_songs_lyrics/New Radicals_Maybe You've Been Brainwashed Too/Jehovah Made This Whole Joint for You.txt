Jehovah Made This Whole Joint for You Lyrics
Ooh-hoo
Ow
Ah-ha
Ah-ha

Meet a girl I met, Carolina
Her parents jumped off Niagara Falls
She broke her hips when she was a baby
Trying to hop the Berlin Wall
It's not that she is anti-American
Although she shot a mayor at 9
He looked just like the Prez on the TV (My fellow Americans)
But didn't know in '63 he had died

Does she think this world is all wrong?
Does she think I'll rob her and run?
When I ask her, she gets her gun
And simply says, "Scat, boy, scat, scat"
But isn't it a wonderful world, Carolina?
Look at the birds in the sky
Jehovah made this whole joint for you, Carolina
So isn't it wonderful to be alive?
So original in her black lipstick
Listening to some obscure band
But isn't she pissed that all the other nonconformists
Listen to that same obscure band?
That's okay, she's helping the environment
By sipping pure water and such
Then she screams, "Let's start thinking about the ozone layer"
While tossing out a Styrofoam cup

Does she think this world is all wrong?
Does she think I'll rob her and run?
When I ask her, she gets her gun
And simply says, "Scat, boy, scat, scat"
All right (Whoo)
But isn't it a wonderful world, Carolina?
Look at the birds in the sky
Jehovah made this whole joint for you, Carolina
So isn't it wonderful to be alive?

Ooh-hoo
Oh
Ooh-hoo
The first step to a successful revolution is destroying all competing revolutionaries
Real deep shit on her mind
"Let's kill the world, take over everything"
She says, "We don't need politicians, they breed mistrust
As a matter of fact, did you steal my, my purse?"
Purse, purse
Woo-hoo
Isn't it a wonderful world, Carolina?
Look at the birds in the sky
Jehovah made this whole joint for you, Carolina
So isn't it wonderful to be a
Isn't it a wonderful world, Carolina?
Look at the birds in the sky (Hey, my, my, my)
Jehovah made this whole joint for you, Carolina
So isn't it wonderful to be a
Huh, isn't it beautiful to be a
Isn't it wonderful to be alive?

It's so wonderful
I feel like crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Crying
Dying
DyingEmbed
