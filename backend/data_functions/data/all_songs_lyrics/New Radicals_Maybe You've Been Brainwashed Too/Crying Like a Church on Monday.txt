Crying Like a Church on Monday Lyrics
I was dancin' with your shadow
Slow down memories' hall
I said, "Wait, have I been seduced and forgotten?"
You said, "Baby, haven't we all?"
Now I don't like crying
'Cause it only gets me wet
But I can't help failing
To remember to forget you
And I know it's gonna be a long time

Now I'm cryin', like a church on Monday
Prayin' for these feelings to go away
So do me a favor, baby
Put down your new God
And love me like Sunday again
Whoa, whoa

I was hidin' in your bedroom
When I saw him come inside
I can't live, oh, in his shadow
Is that where I'm dancing, till I die?
Now I don't light candles
'Cause they make me see the light
That I can't help failing
To remember to forget you
And I know it's gonna be a long time
Now I'm cryin', like a church on Monday
Prayin' for these feelings to go away
So do me a favor, baby
Put down your new God
And love me like Sunday again
Now I'm crying, like a church on Monday
Prayin' for these feelings to go away
So do me a favor, baby
Put down your new God
And love me like Sunday again
Whoa whoaEmbed
