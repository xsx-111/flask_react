Ambiguous Norway Lyrics
My suit came in the mail today
We settled on navy blue
Turns out it fits ok
Over a t-shirt & dress shoes

I’m on a 787
The rain’s coming down outside
Can’t seem to grasp what happened
I close my eyes

Landing in Oslo
There’s still something in the air
No matter where I go
You’re gone, you’re everywhere

You’re gone, you’re everywhere
Everywhere

Farewell Purplе Mountains
I see a range of cumulus
The majesty's transmutation
Distant, ambiguous
Thе skies replace the land with air
No matter where I go
You’re gone, you’re everywhere

You're gone, you're everywhere
Everywhere

The poetry
It’s not lost on me
I’m left asking
How it found me
The poetry
It’s not lost on me
I walk around alone
Laughing in the street

Laughing in the street
Laughing in the street1Embed
