Michelangelo Lyrics
I'm a three-legged dog
Workin' with what I got
And part of me will always be
Looking for what I lost

There's a fly around my head
Waiting for the day I drop dead
My DNA looks pretty strange
Can you see it on my breath?

You're a virus and you come back
At the first sign of weakness
Treatable, not curable
And I'm building up a resistance

I wanna be the blank white screen
Allow the movies to be seen
Comedy, tragedy
Come and go, but none become me

You play the villain
In the age-old tale I've been living
Since I was young, far too young
To know the role I was given
I'm Michelangelo
And I carve myself out of marble
When I donâ€™t know how to grow
Flowers out of arrows

I'm a three-legged dog
Looking for what I lostEmbed
