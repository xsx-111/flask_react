Crosshairs Lyrics
All I want is to fall apart
In the arms of someone
Entirely strange to me
In your eyes I see the panoply
Of all the people inside of me

What is it you’re looking for
In the looking glass?
It’s in the crosshairs
Of a stranger’s stare
I’m lost at last

All I want is to fall apart
In the arms of someone
Entirely strange to me
In your eyes I see the panoply
Of the people inside me

Empty space is my escape
It runs through me like a river
While time spits in my face
Turns us like stones
Into drifters
All I want is to fall apart
In the arms of someone
Entirely strange to me
In your eyes I see the panoply
Of all the people inside me
All I want is to fall apart
In the arms of someone
Entirely strange to me
In your eyes I see the panoply
Of all the people inside me1Embed
