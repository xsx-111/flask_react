New Bikini Lyrics
I see Warren every weekend
He makes a living as a fisherman
Drives in from Long Island
His mama always told him

Baby, go get in the ocean
If you’re bruised, you're scraped, you're any kind of broken
The water, it cures everything

After David passed away
My friends put me up for a few days
Off the coast of Norway
And every morning they'd say

Baby, go jump in the ocean
It's cold enough to get your blood moving
The water, it cures everything

My mom asked if I was ok
I said nothing to do about DNA
She worriеd at me
And went out and bought me a nеw bikini
Said baby, go to the ocean
The water, it cures everything
Yeah, the water, it cures everything

My friend Grey is sick again
The doctors shell out medicine
And add there might be something in
The mind/body connection

So I told him
Baby, let’s get you to the ocean
Everybody’s saying it cures everything
The water, it cures everythingEmbed
