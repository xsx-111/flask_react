Group Grope LyricsYou ask about my philosophy, baby, yeah
Dope, peace, magic
And gods in the tree trunks and a
Group grope, baby
Group grope, baby
Group Grope, baby
Back seat boogie for high school kids
Students fuck the teach
Daughters fuck the preach and
Group grope, baby
Group grope, baby
Group grope group grope baby
Down on that Kataleptic Farm
Where we farm that old asparagus
We have that K-Y community
Down on that Kataleptic Farm
And baby
Group Grope, baby
Group Grope, baby
Group grope group grope baby
It feels so good!
You ask about my philosophy, baby, yeah
Dope, peace, magic
And gods in the tree trunks and a
Group grope, baby
Group grope, baby
Group grope group grope baby
Back seat boogie for high school kids
Students fuck the teach
Daughters fuck the preach and
Group grope, baby
Group grope, baby
Group grope group grope baby
Come on Fugs, let's roll!
"Oh baby does it feel so good inside you, baby!"
"Oh, you want it, do you want more? Do you want more?"
It feels so good, I want it, I want it! Oh!"
You ask about my philosophy, baby, yeah
Dope, peace, magic
And gods in the tree trunks and a
Group grope, baby

It feels so good!
