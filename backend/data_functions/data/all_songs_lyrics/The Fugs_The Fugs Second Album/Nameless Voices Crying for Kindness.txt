Nameless Voices Crying for Kindness LyricsNameless voices crying for kindness
Nameless voices crying for kindness
One of the loving
(nameless, nameless)
One of the joy
One of the seeking
(nameless, nameless)
One eye peeping from the virginal drag
Nameless voices crying for kindness
Nameless voices crying for kindness
We've been in L.A
(nameless, nameless)
We've been on the Kremlin steps
Scalded with napalm
(nameless, nameless)
Sobered in the lonely womb
Do you wanna go to heaven
Painted walls of painted paradise?
Do you wanna go to heaven
Painted walls of painted paradise?
Do you wanna go to heaven?
Orangutangs giggle in golded cages
Soft orange bellies begging to be fondled
You'll get licked by the fabrin's purple tongue
Donkeys kissing in clover
Nameless voices crying for kindness
Nameless voices begging for a body
Thousand eyes for a thousand selves
Writing out a message with the lovesick finger
Thousand voices begging for a flesh flash
I see you in me
Nameless voices crying for kindness
Nameless voices screaming for heaven
Heaven
Heaven
Heaven
HeavenEmbed
