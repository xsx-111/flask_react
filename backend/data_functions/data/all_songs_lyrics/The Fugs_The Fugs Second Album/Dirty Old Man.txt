Dirty Old Man LyricsHangin' out by the schoolyard gate
Lookin' up every dress I can
Suckin' wind through my upper plate
I'm a dirty old man (dirty old man, dirty old man)
You fuckin' dirty old man!
Handin' out joints to the kids at school
Givin' out pictures and porn and pills
Fillin' the front of my shirt with drool
I'm a dirty old man (dirty old man, dirty old man)
He's a pre-vert!
Nervously wiggling my toes in my boots
Communist literature in my hands
Pinchin' all the bosoms I can
I'm a dirty old man (dirty old man, dirty old man)
"Hello, kiddies, here I am again on the old schoolyard!
I got thrill pills for all the little chickies
And I got funny cigarettes for all you boys
And I got dirty pictures for all of you together!
Well, I guess I better go, I see the campus cop's coming
I better split now
Remember Leon Trotsky! Hehehaha!"
Hangin' out by the schoolyard gate
Lookin' up every dress I can
Suckin' wind through my upper plate
I'm a dirty old man (dirty old man, dirty old man)
Disgusting!
Handin' out joints to the kids at school
Givin' out pictures and porn and pills
Fillin' the front of my shirt with drool
I'm a dirty old man (dirty old man, dirty old man)
Nervously wiggling my toes in my boots
Communist literature in my hands
Pinchin' all the bosoms I can
I'm a dirty old man (dirty old man, dirty old man)
P.U.!
I'm a dirty old manEmbed
