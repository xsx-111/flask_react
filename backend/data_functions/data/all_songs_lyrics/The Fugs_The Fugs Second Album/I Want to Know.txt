I Want to Know LyricsWe drink
Or break open
Our veins
Solely to know
Solely to know
Solely to know
Hunger
Drives me onward
To feel
All of the skin
All of the skin
All of the skin
The thrill
Of the knowing
Has me
Out of my brain
I want to know
I want to know
Into our eyes
Hundreds of flashes
Cause us to feel
The life in the sky
I want to know
I want to know
We drink
Or break open
Our veins
Solely to know
Solely to know
Solely to know
I want to know
I want to know
Please let me know
I have to know
Solely to know
Solely to knowEmbed
