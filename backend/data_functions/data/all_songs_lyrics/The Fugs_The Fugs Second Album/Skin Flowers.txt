Skin Flowers Lyrics
We say yes to night-long teenage legs wrapped around the body
To all hands tapping or twitching in time to a tambourine lover's beat
To walking skin flowers, ask the questions, learn the mystery of love

By every room
By every road
By all the skin
Believe me baby, love it, love it, love it
Love it, baby
Waaah!

When your breast comes out of heaven, I rejoice 'til morning
You, fair skin, are the miracles of our night-long love
I believe that golden lizards fly somewhere in sunshine

By every room
By every road
By all the skin
Believe me baby, love it, love it, love it
Love it, baby
Oh, love it, baby, oooh!
We say yes to night-long teenage legs wrapped around the body
To all hands tapping or twitching in time to a tambourine lover's beat
To walking skin flowers, ask the questions, learn the mystery of love

By every room
By every road
By all the skin
Believe me baby, love it, love it, love it
Love it, babyEmbed
