Coming Down Lyrics

I awakened in a pit of ashes
From a sky that was cloudy and bloat
With the hands that were sere and cold
And eyes where the blood was shooting
And the brain that was fallen and still
Oh, comin' down
I'm a-comin' down
I'm a-comin' down

I awakened in a pit of ashes
In despair where the lids were swollen
The heart that was pounding and writhing
And ears where the sounds were screaming
And the mind that was ashen and still
Cocaine! cocaine!
I'm a-comin' down
I'm a-comin' down

I said hello to that grief bird
"Hello grief bird, what's happening?"
"Ashes. Pits of ashes."
"Hello grief bird."
"Ashes, pits of ashes."
Ashes, ashes and screams, ashes
Ashes and shrieks, ashes
Ashes and grieving, ashes and moaning
Eyes with a vision of torture
Fright with a feeling for death
Comin' down
I'm a-comin' down
I'm a-comin' down
I said hello to that grief bird
"Hello grief bird, what's happening?"
"Ashes. Pits of ashes."
"Hello grief bird."
"Ashes, pits of ashes."
Ashes, ashes and screams, ashes
Ashes and shrieks, ashes
Ashes and grieving, ashes and moaning
Eyes with a vision of torture
Fright with a feeling for death
Comin' down
Comin' down
I'm a-comin' down
Comin' down
Comin' down
I'm a-comin' down
