Frenzy LyricsAh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

Honey don't you tremble
Baby don't you tremble
They way you got the frenzy
They way you got the frenzy

It's alright, come on up
It's alright, come on up
We've got baskets
Baskets of love

Come up here baby
Come upon us now
Standing here a-trembling and a-singing
Coaching  you with pretty words

It's alright, come on up
It's alright, come on up
We've got baskets
Baskets of love
Finger in your ringlets
When  I hold the microphone
Pretty little girls all singing
When I kiss the microphone

It's alright, come on up
It's alright, come on up
We've got baskets
Baskets of love
Baby, hmmm

Deep inside your belly
When you feel my laser beam
Screaming and a-moaning with frenzy
Patting  like a ...  beast

It's alright, come on up
It's alright, come on up
We've got baskets
Baskets of love
We've got the frenzy
(We've got the frenzy)
We've got the frenzy
(We've got the frenzy)
We've got the frenzy
(We've got the frenzy)
We've got the frenzy
(We've got the frenzy)
We've got the frenzy
We've got the frenzy
We've got the frenzy
We've got the frenzy
Got baskets!
Baskets of love!
Wooo!Embed
