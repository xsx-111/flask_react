Kill for Peace LyricsKill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Near or middle or very far east
Far or near or very middle east
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
If you don't like the people
Or the way that they talk
If you don't like their manners
Or they way that they walk
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
If you don't kill them
Then the Chinese will
If you don't want America
To play second fiddle
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
If you let them live
They might subvert the Prussians
If you let them live
They might love the Russians
Kill, kill, kill!
"Kill 'em, kill 'em, strafe those gook creeps!"
The only gook an
American can trust
Is a gook that's got
His yellow head bust
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, it'll feel so good
Like my captain said it should
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill it'll give you a mental ease
Kill it'll give you a big release
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill for peace
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!Embed
