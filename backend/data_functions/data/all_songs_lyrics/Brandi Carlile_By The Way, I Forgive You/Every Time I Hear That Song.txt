Every Time I Hear That Song Lyrics
A love song was playing on the radio
It made me kind of sad because it made me think of you
And I wonder how you're doing, but I wish I didn't care
Because I gave you all I had and got the worst of you

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)

And didn't it break your heart when you watched my smile fading?
Did it ever cross your mind that one day the tables would be turned?
They told me the best revenge would be a life well lived
And the strongest one that holds would be the hardest one to earn

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
When I woke up in the morning, I was choking on some words
There were things unsaid between us, there were things you never told
That's twice you broke my heart now, the first was way back when
And to know you're still unhappy only makes it break again

By the way, I forgive you
After all, maybe I should thank you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
By the way, I forgive you
I never will, never will forget you
For giving me what I've found
'Cause without you around
I've been doing just fine
Except for any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Oh, any time I hear that song (ooh ooh)
Ooh, ooh, hmm2Embed
