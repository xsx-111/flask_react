Harder To Forgive Lyrics
I love the songs I hated when I was young
Because they take me back where I come from
When every broken heart seemed like the end
When everyone was someone different then

But I can't be alone in a crowded room
Where my thoughts, they run like water down a flume
There are days when I will let the darkness rise
I don't always choose to stay on the sunny side

Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

Yes, my life has seen some wasted time
I have suffered for the peace inside my mind
And some things are better left unsaid
While some things work out different when they're in your head

But I'm not sorry for the things I say
Sometimes I let my mouth just run away
And I believe that all souls are born kind
And that all love lost comes back in time
Sometimes I pretend we never met (ooh)
Because it's harder to forgive than to forget
Sometimes it's harder to forgive

And even if the world is really round
And all the maps are printed upside down
So if you stand in one place for too long
Everything around you will be gone

Well, I'm not gonna miss you when I'm gone
Now the part of me that's left wants you to know
That I'm not gonna jump towards the light
The ones who believe choose the night

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh
