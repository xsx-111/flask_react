Sugartooth Lyrics
He wasn't really known for breaking the rules
When he arrived in the second year of my high school
He wasn't so much of a twist of fate
As a short turn up from a Southern state
He was born with a sweet tooth he couldn't beat
Always trying to find himself something sweet
All that he found was the trouble and me
Or maybe trouble just found him

It was hard to hide that his heart had scars
He would stay up late talking to the stars
People tried to blame him for making bad choices
When he was only listening to the voices
And searching for some kind of deeper truth
Between the lines and the Bible and living proof
There's no point now to judge him in vain
If you haven't been there, you don't know the pain

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth
His life became more than he could take
He found a bad habit he couldn't break
Nothing could tame him and nothing could hold him
He only took the pills when the doctor told him
Looking to hard for that something sweet
To make his life feel less incomplete
What in the hell are you gonna do
When the world has made its mind up about you?

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
Then life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for the sugartooth

They found him lying on his bed
With a gun in his hand and a quiet head
His broken heart, now, is finally gone
But I know that he had to hurt for too long
To think he had fought it all on his own
Just to lose the battle and die alone
After so many years of feeling the loss
He finally made his way back home
And I heard they put what was left in a box
And took it to a place called Jesus Rock
And scattered him all over jagged mound
As a symbol to all that the peace had been found
But not for a son who is left behind
With a hand stuck reaching back in time
To a place in which you can never unwind
I hope he found something so sweet

He was a liar, but not a fraud
Living proof that there was no God
Just the Devil stiff as a rod
A slave to a sugartooth

He wanted to be a better man
But life kicked him down like an old tin can
He would give you the shirt on his back
If not for a sugartooth

Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth
Ooh, ooh, ooh, a slave to a sugartooth2Embed
