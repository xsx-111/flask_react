Fulton County Jane Doe Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

Out in the middle of nowhere
With nothing much else to do
Oh, the night brought us together
And I lent my heart to you

Maybe you were running way from something
Without so much as a plan
Not a living soul to guide you
Jesus tattooed on your hand

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Somebody called you something sweet once
It was more than Fulton County Jane

And when my heart has no rest
And a thousand things are on my mind
I'll always save some room for you
I won't let you get left behind
Oh, and I always will remember
When the lonely day is through
That somewhere far from Fulton County
A stranger says a prayer for you

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Your mother calls you something sweet once
It was more than Fulton County Jane
Fulton County Jane

We came into this life with nothing
And all we're taking is a name
That's why I've written you this song
This is for Fulton County Jane

God, the whole world's gone crazy
And there's only God to blame
Your mother calls you something sweet once, darling
You're more than Fulton County, Fulton County Jane
Fulton County Jane
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, oohEmbed
