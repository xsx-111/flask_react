Whatever You Do Lyrics
If I don't owe you a favor, you don't know me
I don't believe we've ever even met
If there's a God in heaven, you can show me
Then I guess I should admit I lost the bet
There are moments I could hold you forever
And there are moments that lasted way too long
There are days when I change with the weather
To hold you in place would be wrong

There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too

I never met a morning I could get through
With nothing on my breath to hold the night
And I never said I'm sorry, but I meant to
I never met a coward I don't like
There are reasons why a body stays in motion
But at the moment, only demons come to mind
There are days when I could walk into the ocean
With no one else but you to leave behind
There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too
There's a road left behind me that I'd rather not speak of
And a hard one ahead of me, too
I love you, whatever you do
But I got a life to live, too1Embed
