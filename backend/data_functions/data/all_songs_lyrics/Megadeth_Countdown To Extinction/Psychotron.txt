Psychotron Lyrics
Psychotron...

Assassin in stealth, assailant from Hell
Impervious to damage
Computer on-board, engaged in a war
Non-stop combatant

Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

Burning inside, godspeed in glide
Battle plan running
A killing machine, just downright mean
And forever cunning

Maybe not a mutant, maybe a man?
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron


Target to destroy, arms in employ
Full assault fire threat
Sensors indicate you will terminate
Life systems disconnect

Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg
Part bionic and organic
Not a cyborg, call him Psychotron

Psychotron
Psychotron
Psychotron
