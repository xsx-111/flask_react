High Speed Dirt Lyrics
Do it if you dare, leaping from the sky
Hurling through the air, exhilarating high
See the Earth below, soon to make a crater
Blue sky, black death, I'm off to meet my maker

Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high-speed dirt

Paralyzed with fear, feel velocity gain
Entering a near catatonic state
Pressure of the sound roaring through my head
Crash into the ground, damned if I'll be dead

Energy of the gods, adrenaline surge
Won't stop 'til I hit the ground, I'm on my way for sure
Up here in the air, this will never hurt
I'm on my way to impact, taste the high-speed dirt

Jump or die!

Dropping all my weight, going down full throttle
The pale horse awaits like a genie in a bottle
Fire in my veins, faster as I go
I forgot my name, I'm a dirt torpedo


High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt
High-speed dirt, high-speed dirt!Embed
