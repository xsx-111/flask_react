Architecture of Aggression Lyrics
Born from the dark in the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below, deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Praise your architecture of aggression

Ensuing power vacuum, a toppled leader dies
His body fuels the power fire and the flames rise to the sky
One side of his face, a kiss - the other, genocide
Time to pay with your ass, a worldwide suicide

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression

Born from the dark in the black cloak of night
To envelop its prey below, deliver to the light
To eliminate your enemy, hit them in their sleep
And when all is won and lost, the spoils of wars are yours to keep

Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies
Praise your architecture of aggression
Great nations built from the bones of the dead
With mud and straw - blood and sweat
You know your worth when your enemies...
Praise your architecture of aggression4Embed
