Nobody But You Lyrics
Nobody babe
Nobody but you, darling
Nobody babe
Nobody but you, darling
On my mind

Baby
I need you, darling
Baby
I need you, darling

Nobody baby
Nobody but you, darling
On my mind

Baby
I'm on my knees
I'm begging you, babe, ah
Don't leave me, darling
If you leave me, baby
My darling
Will be in sorrow
Nobody baby
Nobody but you, darling
On my mind

Baby
I love you, girl
Baby
I love you, girl

Nobody baby, hey
Nobody but you, darling
On my mindEmbed
