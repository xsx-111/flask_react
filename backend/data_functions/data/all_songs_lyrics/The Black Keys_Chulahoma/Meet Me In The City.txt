Meet Me In The City Lyrics
Meet me, oh momma, in the city
And see everything's is so fine
We'll get together now, darling
Oh yes we will
We'll make everything alright
Now honey don't
Oh honey don't
Please, please don't leave me right now, baby
Right now, right now
Oh no no no

You got me, baby
You got me, darling
You got me where you want me, baby
Girl, I know you are satisfied
Still begging you, baby
Don't leave me here
Please, please, please don't leave me right now, baby
Right now, right now
Oh no no no5Embed
