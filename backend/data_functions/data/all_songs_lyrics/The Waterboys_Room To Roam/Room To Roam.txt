Room To Roam LyricsYou go yours
And I'll go mine
The many ways we'll wend
Many days
And many ways
Ending in one end
Many a wrong and it's curing song
Many a road and many an inn
Room to roam but only one home
For all the world to win
So you go yours
And I'll go mine
And the many many ways we'll wend
Many days and many ways
Ending in one endEmbed
