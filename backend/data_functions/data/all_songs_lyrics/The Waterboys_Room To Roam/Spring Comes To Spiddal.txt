Spring Comes To Spiddal LyricsThe lights are on in Standun's
And the spell has been broken
The roadside teahouse door
Is wide open
A sign on the wall
Says "American also spoken"
As Spring comes to Spiddal
The village girls go walking
By without their coats
The Irish gaelic college
Is alive again with folk
Farmers gather talking
Freed from Winter's yoke
As Spring comes to Spiddal
A tourist with a telescope
And a funny looking German bloke
And a billy goat
All invoke
The Summer soon to bloom
On a soft and fresh Atlantic air
A mist of pollen floats
On Galway Bay I spy
A gaily painted fishing boat
There's a rustle around the boreens
And a song on every throat
As Spring comes
To SpiddalEmbed
