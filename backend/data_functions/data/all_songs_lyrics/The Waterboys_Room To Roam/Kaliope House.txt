Kaliope House LyricsWaterboys
Room To Roam
Kaliope House
Where will I wander and wonder?
Nobody knows
But wherever I`m going I`ll go
In search of a Rose
Whatever the will of the weather
And whether it shines or snows
Wherever I`m going I`ll go
In search of a Rose
I don`t know where it`s found
But I don`t mind
As long as the world spins around
I`ll take my time
I`ll savour the softness of Summer
I`ll wrap up when Winter blows
And wherever I`m going I`ll go
In search of a roseEmbed
