Bigger Picture LyricsI'm starting to see a bigger picture
I'm beginning to colour it in
I'm starting to see a bigger picture
I'm beginning to colour it in
My soul the sky, my heart a sun
My mind a world - my only one
My thoughts the people, the world around
My dreams the kings - or the clowns
I'm starting to see a bigger picture
I'm beginning to colour it in
I'm starting to see a bigger picture
I'm beginning to colour it in
The continents and the seven oceans
Bound the range of my emotions
My time is long but not forever
My moods are the changing wind and weather
I'm starting to see a bigger picture
I'm beginning to colour it in
I'm starting to see a bigger picture
I'm beginning to colour it in
Colour it in!
Colour it in!Embed
