Knuckle Down Lyrics
Knuckle down, love his skin
It doesn't matter what color skin he's locked in, knuckle down
Knuckle down and love that skin
Knuckle down, love his race
It doesn't matter if you win or lose a little face
Knuckle down and love that race
Because
One bright morning, the world might end with a big bang
Big bang
And you'll never ever get yourself another chance
So put aside the hoodoo and some of the voodoo
About people being different
They're not so different

Take them by the arms and run to the street
Take a little drum to supply some beat
Soon the whole world will be up on its feet
And dancing

For my sake, won't you put your knuckles down, boys?
Mine, mine
For my sake, won't you put you knuckles down, boys, oys, oys
Knuckle down, love her skin
It doesn't matter what color skin she's locked in, knuckle down
Knuckle down and love that skin
Knuckle down, love her race
It doesn't matter if you win or lose a little face
Knuckle down and love that race
Be-be-because
One bright morning you just might wake when the coin drops
Coin drops
Even though you think that love is such a corny thing
You can burst the bubble, it's full up with trouble
Says that people always got to be a-fighting, not right

Take them by the arms and run to the fields
Blow on your horn until Jericho yields
Soon the whole world will lay down swords and shields
For singing

For my sake, won't you put your knuckles down, boys?
Mine, mine
For my sake, won't you put your knuckles down?
Take them by the arms and run to the streets
Take a little drum to kick up some beat
Soon the whole world will be up on it's feet
And da-da-da-da-da-da-dancing

For my sake, won't you put your knuckles down, boys?
Mine, mine
For my sake, won't you put your knuckles down, boys?
Mine, mine
For my sake, won't you put your knuckles down?Embed
