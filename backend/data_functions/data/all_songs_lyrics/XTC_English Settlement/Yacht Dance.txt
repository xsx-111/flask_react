Yacht Dance Lyrics
We, we will dance like tiny boats with cotton sails
Upon the tops of the seas
That would pull us down to depths and crush us flat
If given half a chance
No need to look back
To pictures of lost
When all was rust
We, we will skim across the surface of the mud
As if we're spinning pebbles

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
In our yacht dance, doo da dut doo da da dut
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
In our yacht dance

We, we will dance like tiny boats with cotton sails
Upon the tops of the seas
Made of people stained with scorn
Who never see the light of real love
No need to look back
Through diaries of lost
Now turned to dust
We, we will skate across the surface of the storm
As if we're wheeling sea-birds

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
In our yacht dance, doo da dut doo da da dut
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
In our yacht dance

And how they'll be jealous of both of us
In our yacht dance

We, we will dance like tiny boats with cotton sails
Upon the, 'pon the tops of the sea
Made of people stained with scorn
Who never see the light of real love

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
In our yacht dance, roo da dut doo da da dut
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
In our yacht danceEmbed
