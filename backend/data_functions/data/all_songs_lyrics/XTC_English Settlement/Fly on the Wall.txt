Fly on the Wall Lyrics
"Here we go, then!"
"Aargh!"
"1, 2, 3, 4..."

I am the fly up on the wall
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer
I just came flying through your door
You didn't notice that your number had been called

I see the mother beating the babe
I see the money, the pennies you save
Stored on computers, birth to the grave
I'm telling you
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-seeing it all

I am the fly up on the wall
You're in the index of the files that stand so tall
Although your health is rather poor
We have a place for those who cannot find a cure

I know your income, your daily crust
I know your pleasures, your passion, your lust
I know when you're living and I know when you're dust
I'm telling you
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-seeing it all
One is born and one will die, it's all undertook
The bit that's in the middle doesn't count, oh, no, don't count

I am the fly up on the wall
My prying eyes are looking through your bottom drawer
I just came flying through your door
You didn't notice that your number had been called

I see the mother beating the babe
I see the money, the pennies you save
Stored on computers, birth to the grave
I'm telling you
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-seeing it all
I'm telling you
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-seeing it all (woo!)
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-seeing it all
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-seeing it all
Fly on the wall
See-see-see-see-see-see-see...1Embed
