Down in the Cockpit Lyrics
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh-oh

Man acting like a farmer and
He's treating the woman like a poor cow
We got to treat you better from now
But man is just a baby and
He's needing your milk of kindness, I vow
To drink as much as you will allow

All the way through history
Man, machine, no miss-miss-mystery
All the way through history
Girl, have the brain to act as like the weaker sex
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Queen wants the castle
Back from the rascal
Queen wants the castle
Now, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh-oh

The girl tribe are growing up
And filling the world full with a new soul
To get so far they paid a high toll
Try not to make the same mistakes
As man has made or you'll fall in that hole
And you will see us changing our role

All the way through history
Man, machine, no miss-miss-mystery
All the way through history
Girl, have the brain to act as like the weaker sex
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Queen wants the castle
Back from the rascal
Queen wants the castle, now!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
"Oh, look, what is this picture down in the hole?"
"Well, I know that. The strange being was once abundant on this Earth. They would grow in great herds and many made important decisions. But now they are virtually extinct! Some say they were called Man!"

All the way through history
Man, machine, no miss-miss-mystery
All the way through history
Girl, have the brain to act as like the weaker sex
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Queen wants the castle
Back from the rascal
The Queen wants the castle
Throw him!
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it
Down in the cockpit
Man need the woman to pull him right out of it

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh oh oh-oh, oh-oh oh oh oh-oh
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpit
Oh-oh oh oh oh, down in the cockpitEmbed
