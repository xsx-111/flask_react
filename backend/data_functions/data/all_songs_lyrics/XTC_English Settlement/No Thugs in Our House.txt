No Thugs in Our House Lyrics
The insect-headed worker wife
Will hang her waspies on the line
The husband burns his paper, sucks his pipe
While studying their cushion-floor
His viscous poly-paste breath comes out
Their wall-paper world is shattered by his shout
A boy in blue is busy banging out a headache
On the kitchen door

And all the while Graham slept on
Dreaming of a world where he could do
Just what he wanted to

No thugs in our house, are there dear?
We made that clear
We made little Graham promise us he'd be a good boy
No thugs in our house, are there dear?
We made that clear
We made little Graham promise us he'd be a good boy

The young policeman who just can't grow a moustache
Will open up his book
And spoil their breakfast with reports of Asians
Who have been so badly kicked
Is this your son's wallet I've got here?
He must have dropped it after too much beer!
Oh, officer, we can't believe our little angel
Is the one you've picked!
And all the while Graham slept on
Dreaming of a world where he could do
Just what he wanted to

No thugs in our house, are there dear?
We made that clear
We made little Graham promise us he'd be a good boy
No thugs in our house, are there dear?
We made that clear
We made little Graham promise us he'd be a good boy

They never read those pamphlets in his bottom drawer
They never read that tattoo on his arm
They thought that it was just a boys club badge he wore
They never thought he'd cause folks any harm

The insect-headed worker-wife
Will hang her waspies on the line
She's singing something stale and simple
Now this business has fizzled out
Her little tune is such a happy song
Her son is innocent, he can't do wrong
'Cos Dad's a judge and knows exactly
What the job of judging's all about
And all the while Graham slept on
Dreaming of a world where he could do
Just what he wanted to

No thugs in our house, are there dear?
We made that clear
We made little Graham promise us he'd be a good boy
No thugs in our house, are there dear?
We made that clear
We made little Graham promise us he'd be a good boy
No thugs in our house!
No thugs in our house!
No thugs in our house, dear!

No thugs in our house!
No thugs in our house, woo!
No thugs in our house!
No thugs in our house, ow!
No thugs in our house!
No thugs in our house, woo!
No thugs in our house, ow!
No thugs in our house
No thugs in our house, woo!
No thugs in our house...Embed
