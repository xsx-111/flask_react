English Roundabout Lyrics
People rushing 'round with no time to spare
I'm so dizzy, I'm neither here nor there
'Neath this traffic jam, I just want to shout
"Let me off of this English roundabout!"

Oh-oh-oh, English roundabout
Oh-oh-oh, English roundabout
Oh-oh-oh, English rounda...
And all the horns go 'Beep! Beep!'
All the people follow like sheep
I'm full of lights and sound
Making my head go 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round

Everyone is cursing under their breath
I'm a passenger, I feel close to death
Hopeless situation, I have no doubt
Stop the madness, English roundabout

Oh-oh-oh, English roundabout
Oh-oh-oh, English roundabout
Oh-oh-oh, English rounda...
And all the cars go "Vroom! Vroom!"
And in my ears I feel a hum
The neons blind my eyes
All those tempers rise, rise, rise, rise

Cars and buses go, puffing out their smoke
Roll my window down, I begin to choke
I have had enough, I just want to get out
Let me off of this English roundabout

Oh-oh-oh, English roundabout
Oh-oh-oh, English roundabout
Oh-oh-oh, English rounda...
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round

Round, round, round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round, round, round
Round, round, round, round, round, roundEmbed
