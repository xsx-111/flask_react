Jason and the Argonauts Lyrics
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release

Oh, my head is spinning like the world
And it's filled with beasts I've seen
Let me put my bag down
And I'll tell you it all right from the start
Like the scarlet woman
Who would pick on the boys she thought were green
And the two faced man
Who made a hobby of breaking his wife's heart

Seems the more I travel
From the foam to gravel
As the nets unravel
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release like Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release

I was in a land where men force women
To hide their facial features
And here in the west it's just the same
But they're using make-up veils
I've seen acts of every shade of terrible
Come from man-like creatures
And I've had the breath of liars
Blowing me off-course in my sails
Seems the more I travel
From the foam to gravel
As the nets unravel
All exotic fish I find like Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release like Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release

I have watched the manimals go by
Buying shoes, buying sweets, buying knives
I have watched the manimals and cried
Buying time, buying ends to other people's lives
...be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release
And there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release
And there may be no golden fleece
But human...
...my head is spinning like the world
And it is filled with beasts I've seen
My head is spinning like the world
And it is filled with beasts I've seen...
...there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release
Well, there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release
Well, there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release...
...I have watched the manimals go by here
Buying shoes and buying sweets and buying knives
I have watched the manimals go by here
They're buying shoes and buying sweets...
...my head is spinning like the world
And it is filled with beasts I've seen
Oh, my head it is spinning like the world
And it is filled with beasts I've seen
Oh, my head it is spinning like the world...
...there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release
Well, there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release...
I have watched the manimals go by
Buying shoes, buying sweets and buying knives!
I have watched the manimals and cried
Buying time, buying ends to other people's lives
Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release like Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches
Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release like Jason and the Argonauts
There may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release

...there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release
Well, there may be no golden fleece
But human riches I'll release...
(Jason and the Argonauts)
...my head is spinning like the world
And it is filled with beasts I've seen
Oh, my head it is spinning like the world
And it is filled with beasts I've seen...
