Melt the Guns Lyrics
Programmes of violence
As entertainment
Brings the disease into your room
We know the germ
Which is man-made in metal
Is really the key to your own tomb

Prevention is better than cure
Bad apples affecting the pure
You'll gather your senses, I'm sure
Then agree to

Melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more to fire them
Melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more desire them
Melt the guns (you wanna)
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more to fire them
Melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more desire them
Children will want them
Mothers supply them
As long as your killers are heroes
And all the media
Will fiddle while Rome burns
Acting like modern-time Neroes

Prevention is better than cure
Bad apples affecting the pure
You'll gather your senses, I'm sure
Then agree to

Melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more to fire them
Melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more desire them
Melt the guns (you want to)
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more to fire them
Melt the guns (woo!)
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more desire them
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm
I'm speaking to the Justice League of America
The U.S. of A., hey you, yes you, yes you in particular
When it comes to the judgement day
And you're standing at the gates in your weaponry
You dead go down on one knee
Clasp your hands in prayer, start quoting me
'Cos we say...
We say...
Our father
We've managed to contain the epidemic in one place, now
Let's hope they shoot themselves instead of others
Help to civilize the race now
We've trapped the cause of the plague
In the land of the free and the home of the brave
And if you listen quietly
You can hear them shootin' from grave to grave
And if you listen quite quietly
You can even hear them shooting from grave to grave
If you listen quite quietly
You can even hear them shooting from grave to grave
From grave to grave, you do
Ever listen to 'em shooting from grave to grave
From grave to grave, from grave to grave
You should melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more to fire them
Melt the guns
Melt the guns (you wanna)
Melt the guns and never more desire them
Melt the guns (woo!)
Melt the guns
Melt the guns and never more to fire them
Melt the guns
Melt the guns (you wanna)
Melt the guns and never more desire them

Melt the guns
Melt the guns now
Melt the guns
Oh, melt the guns now
Melt the guns
Melt the guns now
Melt the guns
Melt the guns now
Melt, melt, melt, melt, melt...
Melt the guns, nevermore, melt the guns...
Melt the guns down...
Melt the guns, take the guns down, down, down
Right down
You wanna melt the guns, you wanna melt the guns on down
Melt them, melt them, melt them, melt them down
Take the guns and melt them down
Take the guns and melt them down
Take the guns and melt them down, nowEmbed
