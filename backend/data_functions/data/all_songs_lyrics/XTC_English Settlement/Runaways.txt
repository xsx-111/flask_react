Runaways Lyrics
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home)
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home)

Daddy hit you in a temper
But he's sorry now
(Please come home)
Just a quarrel had with mummy
Just a family row
(Please come home)

You caught mum chasing dad with a knife
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
You ran away to escape from the fights
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Now you're lost in a maze of neon light
And she's worried, he's worried
She's worried, oh

Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home)
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home)
Pacing street lamps on the highway
Haystack for your bed
(Please come home)
In the morning we will find you
In papers to be read
(Please come home)

You heard screams from the warmth of your bed
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
You slumbered on without being fed
(Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry, don't cry)
Now there's no more tears to be shed
And she's sorry, he's sorry
She's sorry, oh

Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home, please come home)
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home, please come home, please come home)
Oh run a, oh run a, oh runaway
(Please come home, please come home, please come home)Embed
