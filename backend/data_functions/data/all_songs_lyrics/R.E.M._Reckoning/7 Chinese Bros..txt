7 Chinese Bros. Lyrics
This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy
Woman offers, "Pull up a seat"
Take in one symphony now
We've just begun to battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel
Turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waited, hold it to you
In the colored, come another

Seven Chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain
She'll return
She will return

This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy
Woman offers, "Pull up a seat"
Take in one symphony now
We've just begun to battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel
Turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waded seven seas
Swim the color, come another
Seven Chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years to sleep away the pain
She will return
She'll return
(She will return)
(She will return) Oh

This mellow, sweet, short-haired boy
Woman offers, "Pull up a chair"
Take in one symphony, Mao
I guess we lost that battle
Wrap your heel in bones of steel
Turn the leg, a twist of color
Autumn waded seven seas
Swim the color, come another

Seven Chinese brothers swallowing the ocean
Seven thousand years the Communi did reign
She will return
She'll return
She will return
She'll returnEmbed
