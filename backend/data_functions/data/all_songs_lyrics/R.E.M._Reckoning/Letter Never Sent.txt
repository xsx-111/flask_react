Letter Never Sent Lyrics
It's been pretty simple so far
Vacation in Athens is calling me
And knock, knock, knock on wood
I thought I'd left you behind

Heaven is yours
Heaven is yours
Heaven is yours where I live

I followed the catacombs
Left my soul at home
This letter never sent

And it's so far
It's so dark
I'm so lost

Heaven is yours (Another story)
Heaven is yours (Another story for a while)
Heaven is yours where I live (Someone, show me)
When I’m moving too fast
Where’s my new address?

The water's receiving me now
The catacombs are filling in
If my soul was made of stone
No, not, not so dark, dark

And it's so far
It's so dark
I'm so lost
And it's so far
It's so dark
I'm so lost

Heaven is yours (Another story)
Heaven is yours (Another story for a while)
Heaven is yours where I live (Someone, show me)
Heaven is yours (Another story)
Heaven is yours (Another story for a while)
Heaven is yours where I live (Someone, show me)1Embed
