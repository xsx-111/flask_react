Second Guessing Lyrics
Rolling!
One! Two! Three! Four!

Why are you trying to second guess me?
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season?
Who will be your book this season?

Why are you trying to second guess me?
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season?
Who will be your book this season?

Here we are
Here we are
Here we are

Why are you trying to second guess me?
I am tired of second guessing
What will be your look this season?
Be in my club, write a book this season
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we areEmbed
