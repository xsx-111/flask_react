Camera Lyrics
From the inside room
When the front room greeting becomes your special book
It was simple then
When the party lulls
If we fall by the side
Will you be remembered?
Will she be remembered?

Alone in a crowd
A borrowed lantern bartered
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?

I fell by your bed once
I didn't wanna tell you
I should keep myself
In between the pages
Of the green light room
If we fall by the side
Will you be remembered?
Will she be remembered?

Alone in a crowd
A bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?
From the inside room
When the front room greeting becomes your special book
It was simple then
When the party lulls
If we fall by the side
I still like you
Can you remember?

Alone in a crowd
A bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?
Alone in a crowd
A bartered lantern borrowed
If I'm to be your camera
Then who will be your face?1Embed
