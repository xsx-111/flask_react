Pretty Persuasion Lyrics
It's what I want
Hurry and buy
All has been tried
Follow reason and buy

Cannot shuffle in this heat
It's all wrong
Try to put that on your sleeve
It's all wrong, all wrong

He's got pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
Goddamn, pure confusion
She's got pretty persuasion

It's what I want
Hurry and buy
All has been tried
Follow reasoning

Cannot put that in this heat
It's all wrong
Try to wear that on my sleeve
It's all wrong, all wrong
He's got pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
Goddamn, pure confusion
He's got pretty persuasion

In the light, I saw
Quite a scene in there

It's what I want
Hurry and buy
All has been tried
Follow reason and buy

Try to put that in this heat
It's all wrong
Cannot wear that on your sleeve
It's all wrong, all wrong

He's got pretty persuasion
She's got pretty persuasion
Goddamn, pure confusion
He's got pretty persua-Embed
