Harborcoat Lyrics
They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off
A handshake is worthy, if it's all that you've got
Metal shivs on wood pushed through our back
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads 'react'

They've shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
(Laoco√∂n is host)
Reddened their necks and collared their clothes
(The library hollowed)
Then we ditched the books with the middles cut out
(Friendly harbor ghosts)
She gathered the corners and collared her gown
(She wanted to tell it to you)
She said

Ooh
(Please help me, please) Find my harbor coat
(Harborcoat is long away)
Can't go outside without it
(Harborcoat is gone, woah-woah-woah-woah)
(Please help me, please) Find my harbor coat
(Harborcoat is long away)
Can't go outside without it
(Harborcoat is gone, woah-woah-woah-woah)
They crowded up to Lenin with their noses worn off
(Tell her I will send hers ahead)
A handshake is worthy, if it's all that you've got
(You'll have done no wrong)
Metal shivs on wood pushed through our back
(Would I kiss her ass?)
There's a splinter in your eye and it reads 'react'
(Would I read the signs?)
R-E-A-C-T

Ooh
(Please help me, please) Find my harbor coat
(Harborcoat is long away)
Can't go outside without it
(Harborcoat is gone, woah-woah-woah-woah)
(Please help me, please) Find my harbor coat
(Harborcoat is long away)
Can't go outside without it
(Harborcoat is gone, woah-woah-woah-woah)

They've shifted the statues for harboring ghosts
(With your feathers in)
Reddened their necks and collared their clothes
(You'll have done no wrong)
Then we danced the dance 'til the menace got out
(Friendly harbor ghosts)
She gathered the corners and collared her gown
(She went to tell her son)
She said
Ooh
(Please help me, please) Find my harbor coat
(Harborcoat is long away)
Can't go outside without it
(Harborcoat is gone, woah-woah-woah-woah)
(Please help me, please) Find my harbor coat
(Harborcoat is long away)
Can't go outside without it
(Harborcoat is gone, woah-woah-woah-woah)1Embed
