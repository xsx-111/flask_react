Time After Time (Annelise) Lyrics
Ask the girl of the hour
By the water tower's watch
If your friends took a fall
Are you obligated to follow?

Time after time after time

When he pulls on his hooves
Will you gather friends by the tower?
If you try to refuse
Will they judge your worth by the hour?

Time after time after time
Time after time after time

If you're tired and you've tried
You can find me in my room
You can stay if you want
But the third time you can't lose

Time after time after time
Time after time after time
Ask the girl of the hour
By the water tower's watch
We can fight if you want
But who will turn out the lights?

Time after time after time
Time after time after time

Time after time after time
Time after time after...Embed
