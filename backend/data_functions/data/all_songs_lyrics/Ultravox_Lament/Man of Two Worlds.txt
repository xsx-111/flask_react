Man of Two Worlds LyricsTaking shelter by the standing stones
Miles from all that moves
Breathing solitude, seeking confidence
A gift to me
Feeling spirits never far removed
Passing over me and I greet them with open arms
Hand fighting hand
As you turn to a man of two worlds
Taobh ri taobh tha sinn mar aon de dha shaobhail
Làmh nam làimh, gabhadh aithne air linn a dh'fhalbh
Reading passages of ancient rhyme
Cut so deep so old
Telling tales of travellers and mystery
Hearing spirits never far removed
Calling out aloud
When the time comes they'll talk to me
Hand fighting hand
As you turn to a man of two worlds
Taobh ri taobh tha sinn mar aon de dha shaobhail
'S mo làmh nad làimh gabhadh aithne air na tìrean chéine
Hand fighting hand
As you turn to a man of two worlds
Feel a presence moving into me
Painting pictures with its words
Seeing places that I've never seen
Like a door thrown open on a life I've lived before
Taobh ri taobh
Do làmh nam làimh
Tha sinn mar aon
De dha shaoghail
Taobh ri taobh
Do làmh nam làimh
Tha sinn mar aon
De dha shaoghailEmbed
