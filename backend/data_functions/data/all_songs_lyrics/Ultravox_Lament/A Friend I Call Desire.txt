A Friend I Call Desire LyricsYou live for love, I long for it
You give for love, I take from it
This friend of mine, desire
This lovers crime, desire
Emotion driving all the time
A burning need for things not mine
Desire
You need your love
I walk from it
You fight for love
I run from it
My enemy desire
Caressing me, desire
The torch I carried burnt my hand
I can't control what I can't stand
Desire
You give for love, I lie for it
You give for love, I shy from it
And the pain, and the lust, and the want
And the hurt, and the lies
And the fears, and the urge, and the feel
And the touch, and it's all
A friend I call desire
You give for love, I lie for it
You give for love, I shy from it
And the pain, and the lies
And the touch, and it's all
A friend I call desireEmbed
