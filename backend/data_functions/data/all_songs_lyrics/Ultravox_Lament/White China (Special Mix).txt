White China (Special Mix) LyricsWhen pale turns to pink
With a soft unnerving ease
And all you've built around
May just tumble to the ground
Will you stand or fall?
With your future in another's hands
Will you stand or fall?
When your life is not your own
When white turns to red
In the not too distant days
Will force and misery
Be the life you have to lead?
Will you stand or fall?
With your children in another's world
Will you stand or fall?
When your town is not your own
White China
White China
When crimson takes a hold
The lights go down on all you've ever known
And all you'll ever do is worked out for you
Will you stand or fall?
When the thoughts you have are not your own
Will you stand or fall?
Oh, when the freedom slips away
White China
White China
White China
White China
White China
