Building LyricsOne last smile
As we turn away in wrong directions
Feeling the kick
From a multitude of cooled reflections
Building on my life alone
One last look
As we turn our backs on deeper feelings
This new release
And think ahead to all who see
May building on my life alone
Building on my life alone...Embed
