Melatonin LyricsShe ran into the wall
So sweet and unknown
A worn comatose
After six milligrams
We're talking again
Who would know?
So sweet and so low
Who would know?
My brain doesn't produce any
I'm soaring without anything
She said I'm taking my time
But now we'll move on with everyone
I'll see my friend soon again
My brain doesn't produce any
I'm soaring without anything
We said aloud
And we said aloud
And we said aloud
That we can't pull out
And we can't pull out
And we can't pull out
And we said aloud
And we said aloud
That we said aloud
And we said aloud
And we can't pull out
And we said aloud
And we said aloud
And we can't pull outEmbed
