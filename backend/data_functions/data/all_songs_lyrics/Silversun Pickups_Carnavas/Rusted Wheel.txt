Rusted Wheel LyricsSo you can't hold a star in your hand
Though at least you can hold onto another plan
Rusted wheel
Planted still
I can tell it's summer
From the size of the bugs that fly through my window
Flying through my window
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on
I can tell it's winter
From the size of the lump in my throat
I got a lump in my throat
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on
And it feels just like the ground
Trapped in another way
Just still in the ground
And it feels just the like the ground
The ground
Trapped in another way
Just still in the ground
The ground
The ground
So you can't hold a star in your hand
Though at least you can move onto a better plan right now
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Planted still
Rusted wheel
Can't move on1Embed
