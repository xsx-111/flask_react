Lazy Eye Lyrics
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
But it's not quite right
And this 'real'
It's impossible if possible at whose blind word?
So clear but so unheard

I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time
To appear sad
With the same 'ol decent lazy eye fixed to rest on you
Aim free and so untrue

Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine
Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine
Locked and loaded
Still the same ol' decent lazy eye straight through your gaze
That's why I said I relate
I said we relate, it's so fun to relate
It's the room, the sun and the sky
The room, the sun and the sky


I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment...12Embed
