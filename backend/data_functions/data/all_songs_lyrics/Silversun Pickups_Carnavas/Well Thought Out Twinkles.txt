Well Thought Out Twinkles LyricsWhat was that scar situated from afar
What was that light integrated in your mind
What have you done it's too early for everyone
Wait for that sign spilling over and passed in time
Come join in the last hurrah with open sores and open jaw
Find one last flaw and keep it safe and free from harm
What have you done it's too early for everyone
So smile go inside come to see there is no sign
Now here we are revisiting
A time a place a whole industry well we
We promise we'll be leaving soon
We share apocalyptic views
How comforting that we feel it too
Who are we to promise we'll be leaving shortly
Come join in the last hurrah with open sores and open jaw
What was that light integrated in your mind
What have you done it's too early for everyone
Wait for that sign spilling over and over and
Over and over and over and over
Over and over and over and over
Over and over and over and over
Over and over and over and over and over and over and2Embed
