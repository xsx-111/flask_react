Checkered Floor Lyrics
Winded through monotone
One foot on checkered floor
Head hung but still watching
One dim-lit figurine

Concealed, pass it on
Appeal, play along

Please don't stop singing
Cohorts are empty jars

Concealed, pass it on
Appeal, play along

Meanwhile (meanwhile) another scene, yeah
Tracking mud while blood letting
We've been so proud

Watch how our star behaves
We'll all roll in our graves
Sink with every word
While all their backs were turned
Meanwhile our little gem, yeah
Is sleeping with sycophants
We've been so proud
But now and then we're joining in
We've been so proud
Tracking mud while blood letting
We've been so proud

We've been so proud
We've been so proud
We've been so proudEmbed
