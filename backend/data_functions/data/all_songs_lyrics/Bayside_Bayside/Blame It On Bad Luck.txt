Blame It On Bad Luck Lyrics
Pound my knuckles hard against the floor
My head against the wall
But I did this to myself
Assume it's just not worth getting back up
So I'll blame it on bad luck
And I'll shake responsibility, yeah

I spent some time in a bad place at 18
Wishing I could see something through clear eyes
Do you ever wake up to realize
That your life is meaningless?
Does it give you strength or lead you to
Your grave at a young age?

Pound my knuckles hard against the floor
My head against the wall
But I did this to myself
Assume it's just not worth getting back up
So I'll blame it on bad luck
And I'll shake responsibility, yeah

It seems that when I ran away from my past
All my dignity, my faith, my pride got left back
And now I think it's time that I realize
Self pity's meaningless
Though I'm 10 feet deep
I'll claw my way back out from in my grave
Pound my knuckles hard against the floor
My head against the wall
But I did this to myself
Assume it's just not worth getting back up
So I'll blame it on bad luck
And I'll shake responsibility
And say a hard life did this to me

Now I realize, I'd give anything I have
To walk a day in my old shoes
Wondering what my first smoke would be like
My first fuck, my next fuck up
The next band that would change my life
And it changed my life
And it changed my life

Pound my knuckles hard against the floor
My head against the wall
But I did this to myself
Assume it's just not worth getting back up
So I'll blame it on bad luck
And I'll shake responsibility
And say a hard life did this to meEmbed
