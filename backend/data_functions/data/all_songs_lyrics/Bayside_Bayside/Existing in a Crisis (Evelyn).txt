Existing in a Crisis (Evelyn) Lyrics
I'm so tired of the stupid games you play
If I sat outside would you come watch me wait?
If I had a gun and shot it at your face
Would you promise not to get out of the way?

If you happen to be able to avoid
My first attack, I'll put a knife against your throat
And cut an inch for every time I lost my self-control
And you made me do the things I did at night when I got home

But I thought you'd change, but I realize that today, today

Evelyn
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to stay away from me
I know you lied. I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to die painfully
So painfully

So this brings us to the backup of my plan
Maybe I'll just have to strangle you with my bare hands
Then you'll have to adhere to my demands
And occupy a shallow grave, as shallow as you are
But I thought they'd change but things just stayed the same, the same

Evelyn
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to stay away from me
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to die

Sometimes content leads, leads to stagnant
And stagnant leads to contempt
Contempt leads to the present
Sometimes content leads, leads to stagnant
And stagnant leads to contempt
Contempt leads to the present

But I thought you'd change, but things just stayed the same, the same

Evelyn
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to stay away from me
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to die
Evelyn
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
I'm begging you to stay away from me
I know you lied, but I'll tell you that I'm alive for the first time
And I'm begging you to leave here now
Begging you to stay away from meEmbed
