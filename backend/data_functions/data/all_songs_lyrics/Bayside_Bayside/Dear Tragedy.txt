Dear Tragedy Lyrics
I'm never waking up again
So I'll never have to find out what you did
Each day it's harder to pretend
That your eyes aren't lying as much as your mouth did
I'd grab your head by your hair and I'd hack it off
Put it on display at the front of the yard
On a stick that's decorated with a little pink bow
And a sign that says "Her friends and family
Should have taught her more about love"

Dear Tragedy, I never had anybody
But being alone wasn't half as bad as being obsessed
With a breath-taker, a smile-faker
These years alone have eaten me alive

Recounting pages in a book
That I'd torn out ashamed that one day you'd look
Afraid that once you did you'd really know how it felt
To be a sucker on a string that you dragged around wherever you'd go
I'm running around, around and it hurts
Tempted to tape up the pages I'd ripped
And although I recognize that we're attached at the lips
That you're the one in charge and that the captain's gotta sink with the ship
I never had anybody
But being alone wasn't half as bad as being obsessed
With a breath-taker, a smile-faker
These years alone have eaten me alive


Dear Tragedy, I never had anybody
But being alone wasn't half as bad as being obsessed
With a breath-taker, a smile-faker
Years alone have eaten me alive

Breath-taker, smile-faker
How could I have let you in my life?
You're a breath-taker, a smile-faker
These years alone have eaten me alive

I never had anybody
But being alone wasn't half as bad as being obsessed
With a breath-taker, a smile-faker
(Dear Tragedy, Dear Tragedy)
These years alone have eaten me alive
(You'll pay for what you did to me
You'll pay for you what did to me)Embed
