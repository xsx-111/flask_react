Half A Life Lyrics
I've been meaning to ask you
How life looks from the nose bleed seats
And to ask how it feels to bleed
Your life's a waste
And the way that I'll ask it
Will have revenge woven throughout
But will be masked with the concern that a friend would bring
You're so incomplete
Hold a mirror to show just what you've become
And read your diary to figure out where things went wrong
I don't think I'll ever understand
How a cowardly cat can call himself a man

You're all show and it's getting old
You're all show and it's getting old

As for the rest of us
We'll do fine with what we have
Making the best of what is left
And you're a naysayer
Who will never know what it's like
To really have half a life
I've been meaning to harm you
In the best way that I see fit
I'm not sure if this did the trick
But I think It did
Hold a mirror to show just what you've become
And read your eulogy to figure out where things went wrong
I hope one day you understand that
A girl on your arm won't make you a man

You're all show and it's getting old
You're all show and it's getting old

As for the rest of us
We'll do fine with what we have
Making the best of what is left
And you're a naysayer
Who will never know what it's like
To really have half a life

Keep walking down your shallow lonely road
It's dark and cold and it's yours and yours alone
If you dig too deep are you scared you'll find something?
Spoonfuls of shit will surely add up
Inside you're begging for a cure for your disease
Your life's a crime scene and it won't help to blame me

As for the rest of us
We'll do fine with what we have
Making the best of what is left
And you're a naysayer
Who will never know what it's like
To really have half a lifeEmbed
