Hello Shitty Lyrics
It seems that you're keeping me down
And it just seems pointless
To work this thing out and
What's holding me back?
A lifelong friendship's not worth it
I'll hide this one deep underground

Convenience can comfort you now
But the words that you said
You can never take back and
I'm warning you now
When you realize you made a mistake
I'll be sure to kick you while you're down

I gave you this gift (I gave you this gift)
Now I'm here alone and I'm paying for it
Our light's almost out (Our light's almost out)
But I'll smile again the day that you figure out
I was all that you hadEmbed
