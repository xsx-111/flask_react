Tortures of the Damned Lyrics
I hate myself
More than I ever let on
I'm burned out at 22
I lived too fast and I loved too much and I'll die too young
But I chose this cup that I drank from
Knew what I was getting into
But I couldn't let out what I had to keep in
I'm ashamed of myself and unspeakable sins
That I've committed and

I've made mistakes
But I'll find my way
There's no explanation for
The things I've failed at before
They can't hold my hand
It just hurts to be a man
Through the tortures of the damned
Of the damned

If I only had an axe
I'd sever the ties I've made with the world
Maybe I can be a stranger
In a strange place
If I start now, maybe I can be saved
If I only had a mask
I'd cover these bleeding eyes
They're bloodshot now but they'll be black by dawn
If I wake up now
I can be pure again
I've made mistakes
But I'll find my way
There's no explanation for
The things I've failed at before
They can't hold my hand
It just hurts to be a man
Through the tortures of the damned

Look at me now
I'm on the tracks with my back
Towards the last train leaving town
Look at me now
I'm on the tracks with my back
Towards the last train leaving town
Look at me now
I'm on the tracks with my back
Towards the last train leaving town
Look at me now
I'm on the tracks with my back
Towards the last train leaving town

I've made mistakes
But I'll find my way
There's no explanation for
The things I've failed at before
They can't hold my hand
It just hurts to be a man
(Through the tortures of the damned)
I've made mistakes
But I'll find my way
There's no explanation for
The things I've failed at before
They can't hold my hand
It just hurts to be a man
Through the tortures of the damned
Of the damnedEmbed
