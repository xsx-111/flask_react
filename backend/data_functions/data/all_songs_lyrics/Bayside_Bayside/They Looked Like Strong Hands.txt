They Looked Like Strong Hands Lyrics
This isn't who I am
From confidence to self doubt in 60 seconds
Storming stages and stereos from here to there
Trying to prove that I belong
Trying to win approval from people that I don't know

And I look so strong
When the weight of all the world
Don't take its toll
And I'd choose my sides
If I believed in what was right
But I'm all wrong

I'm not larger than life, I'm not taller than trees
Do I mean what I say, is it just this disease? Where I never go home
Never telling the truth how this life eats away
Admitting I'm fake
And I'm questioning whether this whole thing was worth it to die poor and all alone?

And I look so strong
When the weight of all the world
Don't take its toll
And I'd choose my sides
If I believed in what was right
But I'm all wrong
Just don't tell me this doesn't mean the world
'Cause my ears would bleed and my heart would hit the floor

And I look so strong
When the weight of all the world
Don't take its toll
And I'd choose my sides
If I believed in what was right
But I'm all wrong2Embed
