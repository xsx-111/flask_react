Devotion and Desire Lyrics
Trying to create something that's not there
A spark I saw as a bomb is just a means to an end
And I was just so happy to be out of my shell again
Don't think that I really cared for who or what
So for now I'll just have to keep it shut

If you're not ready, you're not ready
Please stop acting like you are

How could I know
That everything you say are lies
About devotion and desire?
And I know the spark
Inside your eyes was just the match
I used to set myself on fire

My mouth's shooting blanks
Situation's unbearable
I've gotten vulnerable
Now anyone is free to waltz right in
My temple's been invaded
And there's nobody guarding it
All over this lonely life
But what's so wrong with being all alone?
Alone's the only way I've ever known
If you're not ready, you're not ready
Please stop acting like you are

How could I know
That everything you say are lies
About devotion and desire?
And I know the spark
Inside your eyes was just the match
I used to set myself on fire

And I'm pleading
'Cause this kills and
It's still bleeding
My darling
I'm taking
My life back
To start healing

How could I know
That everything you say are lies
About devotion and desire?
And I know the spark
Inside your eyes was just the match
I used to set myself on fireEmbed
