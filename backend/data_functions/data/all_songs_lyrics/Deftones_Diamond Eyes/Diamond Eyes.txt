Diamond Eyes Lyrics
To the edge, until we all get off
I will take you away with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm

Calculate, I'll embrace
Hold on, come with me now
Run away, outer space with me
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm
Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
I will lead us to the same realm

Get set
When the coffin shakes
And the needle breaks
Come run away with me
Come on, you'll see
Once and for all

Time will see us realign
Diamonds rain across the sky
Shower me into the same realm

Time will lead us to the same realm
I will lead us to the same realm7Embed
