976-EVIL Lyrics
For a thousand days
You've been staring away
Are you fazed or
Are you thinking
Crack a smile and wink
It doesn't scare me away
Hit the brakes
I feel like cruising with you, too

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze that I'm under
Come wake me up soon

Take a bow and wave
As you're carried away
It was great
But I'm not leaving
Crack a smile and wink
It still doesn't scare me away
Hit the brakes
I feel like losing you, to you
So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze that I'm under
Come wake me up
For a thousand days
We could get carried away
Are you in? Are you in?
Are you in? Are you in?
I'd give anything
I'd give anything for you

So I gaze in your eyes
And I wonder
Can you take me on?
Your haze that I'm under
Come wake me up soon

So I gaze in your eyes
And I want her, can you take me up?2Embed
