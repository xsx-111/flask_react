Prince Lyrics
I relate to your kind, your design
Your devotion to wave
Get your brain on the prize
Then, dive inside

Mindset of a killer
With your mind out of phase

It's a game that we like, we crave
Yet, nobody wins
Any way you decide, you try
But you die

Mindset of a killer
With your gaze, you paint the room
Blood-red with your tears
Pouring from the stage

And you can't stop now
Rung by rung, almost out
Covered in black and gold
No one cares, no one knows
My gift to the world outside
It's okay, I'm alright
Now, open your empty hands
Here comes the fun, here comes the end
Click, erase the device, give thanks
Then, clear out the room
Blow kisses, wave them goodbye
Goodnight

Mindset of a killer
With your gaze, you paint the room
Blood-red with your tears
Pouring from the stage

And you can't stop now
Rung by rung, almost out
Covered in black and gold
No one cares, no one knows
My gift to the world outside
It's okay, I'm alright
Now, open your empty hands
Here comes the fun, here comes the end5Embed
