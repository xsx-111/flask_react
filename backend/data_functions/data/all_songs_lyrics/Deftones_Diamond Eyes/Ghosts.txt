Ghosts Lyrics
When the room is quiet
The daylight almost gone
It seems there's something I should know
I ought to leave but the rain, it never stops
And I've no particular place to go

Just when I think I'm winning
When I've broken every door
The ghosts of my life grow wilder than before
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind

Well I'm feeling nervous
And now I find myself alone
The simple life is no longer there
Once I was so sure
Not a doubt inside my mind
It comes and goes but leads nowhere

Just when I think I'm winning
When I've broken every door
The ghosts of my life grow wilder than before
Just when I thought I could not be stopped
When my chance came to be king
The ghosts of my life blew wilder than the wind2Embed
