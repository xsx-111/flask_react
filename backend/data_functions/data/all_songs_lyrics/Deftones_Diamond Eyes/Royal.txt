Royal Lyrics
Complex priestess, come down
Contact, reach us, go wild
I'll taste your name
I've sailed all through space
Watch this!
Come down, teach us the ropes
Your contact, it keeps us provoked

Remove your veil
Let me light you up
I'm on your team
Let's go

Face to face, light stare
My custom made nightmares
Armed with teeth in fashion
Now all we need is action
Complex priestess, come down
Contact, reach us, go wild

Remove your veil
Let me light you up
I'm on your team
I'm the antidote
Rockets taking off
Tonight it's time

Take me
I'll light you up
Take me upEmbed
