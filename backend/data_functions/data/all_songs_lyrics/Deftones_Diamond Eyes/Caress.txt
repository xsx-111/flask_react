Caress Lyrics
Gracie, we're makin babies
Yeah, we're barefoot on the tiles
We make 'em soft and small and tender
It's the biggest hazard of your gender
Hold it by yourself
Gracie, hold yourself together
It's bad now but it gets better
We're all here to help
Everything is swollen, everything is swell
Everybody's watching

Pleasure is your crime, junior is your punishment
It happens all the time, everybody rub it in
It ain't hard to find fault in anything you do
We learned to love the hard way
You're gonna learn it too

Gracie, we're makin babies
Yeah, we're barefoot on the tiles
Man, I hate your old advice, so anger evolved
Well let's see, fucking a
We all want some pressure
We all are experienced
Girl, help stitch me up
Well
Everything is swollen, everything is swell
Everyone's fucking

Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it, get it
