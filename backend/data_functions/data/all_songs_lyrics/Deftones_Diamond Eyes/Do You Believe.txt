Do You Believe Lyrics
Do you really think
That love is gonna save the world?
Well, I don't think so
I just don't think so

Do you really think
That love is gonna save your soul?
Well, I sure hope so
Oh, I really, really hope so
But I don't think so

Do you really think
That love is gonna save the world?
Well, I don't think so
I just don't think so

And do you really think
That love is gonna save your soul?
Well, I sure hope so
Oh, yes I really, really hope so
But I don't think soEmbed
