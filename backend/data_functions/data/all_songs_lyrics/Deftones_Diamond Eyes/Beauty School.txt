Beauty School Lyrics
I like you when, when you take off your face
Put away all your teeth
And take us way underneath
Because you could die if you take it alone

I watch you taste it
I see your face
I know I'm alive
You're shooting stars
From the barrel of your eyes
And it drives me crazy
Just drives me wild

I kind of like you when, when you make up the reel
Take the phone in your room
Stop the tape or resume
Well you could try if you think it will load

I watch you taste it
I see your face
I know I'm alive
You're shooting stars
From the barrel of your eyes
And it drives me crazy
Just drives me wild
Every time, every time you try
Ride, it's a beautiful ride
Why, it's a beautiful ride

I watch you taste it
I see your face
I know I'm alive
You're shooting stars
From the barrel of your eyes
And it drives me crazy
Just drives me wild5Embed
