Risk Lyrics
You can't talk, I'm anxious
I'm off the walls
I'm right here just
Come outside and see it
But pack your heart, you might need it

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

You're locked up, you exhaled
You did it before and I seen it
Come outside and breathe in
Relax your arms and let me in

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you
I know what to say to take you
Higher, higher
No one else can take you higher
But I will try

I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you
I'll find a way
I'm confused though
But I think I can try
I will save your life
I will save your life
I'll try for you

For you
For you3Embed
