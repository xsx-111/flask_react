Rocket Skates Lyrics
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet
Let's writhe, let me see you trip
One move that will keep you wet
Let's fall in a long sadistic trance
Put the keys in our hands

Guns, razors, knives
Fuck with me
Guns, razors, knives

You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet
Let's sail in this sea of charms
Let's drown underneath the stars
Let's drink with our weapons in our hands
Let's sleep in this trance

Guns, razors, knives
Fuck with me
Guns, razors, knives
You're red, soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red, soaking wet

Guns, razors, knives
Fuck with me
Guns, razors, knives

Woo!
You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red soaking wet
I'm right next to you
You're red soaking wet1Embed
