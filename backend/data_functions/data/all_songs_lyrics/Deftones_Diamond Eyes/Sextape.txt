Sextape Lyrics
Floating underwater
Ever changing picture
Hours out from land
In tune with all our dreams
The ocean takes me in
To watch you shake it
Watch you wave your powers
Tempt with hours of pleasure

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)
Cruising through the city
After hours with me
Fusing all our powers
Here's to all our dreams

Take me one more time
Take me one more wave
Take me for one last ride
I'm out of my head

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
Tonight
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
The sound of the waves collide
Tonight (We ride)19Embed
