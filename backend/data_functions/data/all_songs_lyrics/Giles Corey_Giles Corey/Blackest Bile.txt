Blackest Bile Lyrics
All around me
In the air hangs a wreath
Of blackest bile, and smoke
That only I can see

I open up my heart
And let it all in
And it kills all my love
And hope for everyone

And it hasn't been easy on you
I know that more than most
I am born to be alone
I am just some lonely ghost

All around us
Hangs an air of darkest doom
And it flows out my lungs
And slowly fills the room

I open up my heart
And stick my fingers in
But you will never want
What I have to give
And it hasn't been easy on you
I know that more than most
I am born to be alone
I am just some lonely ghost9Embed
