No One Is Ever Going To Want Me LyricsI'm armed to the teeth
Like a fucking animal
Like a fucking animal
I ruin everything
I get my bony hands on
And here we go, now
Over the bridge of sighs
We will get a cross like Christ, crucified
It's like a birth but it is in reverse
Never gets better, always gets worse
I'll gnaw at anything
New England is mine, and
It owes me a living
And here we go, now
Over the bridge of sighs
We will get a cross like Christ, crucified
It's like a birth but it is in reverse
Never gets better, always gets worse
And here we go, now
(Step one, step two)
Over the bridge of sighs
(Step three, step four)
We will get a cross like Christ, crucified
(We fall through the floor)
It's like a birth but it is in reverse
(Fall through the floor)
Never gets better, always gets worse
(Fall through the floor)
One, two, fuck you!
I wanna feel like I feel when I'm asleep
I wanna feel like I feel when I'm asleep
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel
I wanna feel like I feel when I'm asleep
Sleep! Sleep! Sleep!9Embed
