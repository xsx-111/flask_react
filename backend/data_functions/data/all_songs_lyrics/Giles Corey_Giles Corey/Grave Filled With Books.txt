Grave Filled With Books LyricsI don't know what anything means
I think I've forgotten how to sleep
And I'm not the only one
I will break my spine on the page
Like the books that will fill up my grave
I am entombed in my bed
With those words that you said, that I kept :
That I'm not the only one
That you've never loved
Boo, hoo9Embed
