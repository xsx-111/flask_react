Spectral Bride LyricsAngels singing in a choir
Oh, my Lord, I am on fire
What am I to do?
Voices singing into space
Read their verse in my lonely face
What am I to do?
Because I don't deserve you
Not even for a moment
Not even for a second will I ever be saved
My love's out to get me
And you know
You know
You know it's going to succeed
And I hope I survive this fucking week
Alone
And if I don't survive
I'll still be by your side
Just clad in ghostly white
I'll be your spectral bride10Embed
