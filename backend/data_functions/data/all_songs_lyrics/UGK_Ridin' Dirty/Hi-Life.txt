Hi-Life Lyrics
Dawg, it's real up in here
Niggas will kill you if you fuck up
You know what I'm saying?
They shoot all kinds of game
I'm just thankful the lord blessed me that I can see it a hundred miles away
You know

High life
We living that high life
High life (High life, mmm)
We living that high life, mmm

I'm tired of living fucked up, tired of living bad
Tired of hearing grandmama telling me
"When you gonna go to church, Chad?"
Now I'm tryna live up to the image that she would want to see
But I got one foot in the street
And every week I flip a ki
I never wanted to be a G but niggas depend on me
It ain't safe to hit I-10 so niggas fear wit' me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit'
Got cool wit', went to fool wit'
Out there sellin' that white shit
Pushing cocaine, niggas' whole existence
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do? It's like somebody cut my throat
Got twenty-thousand dollars trying to turn it to a hundred
And ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas tend to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch think that she can ease my mind by sucking my dick
Bitch, maybe for a minute but that shit never lasts
It's 1996, niggas is dying from laying on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Eazy-E died
And you be wonderin' why young niggas out there smokin' fry
I wish that I could tell y'all I wore a rubber every time
But if I told you that, nigga, you know that I be lying
And I've been fucking pussy since the tender age of nine
It's getting to be a full-time job just trying to stay alive
And crackers tend to smirk
Offended by the weed smoke coming off my shirt
But still I put in work and front for my folks
'Cause where I come from, nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be gettin' married, and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe? Some say that nigga's selling dope
And you know I ain't lying, that's just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the Devil poke you with his fork?
And everybody sittin' in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers just false prophets fucking hoes and getting paid
I'm looking for the
High life (High life)
We living that high life
High life (High life, mmm)
We living that high life, mmm

You only got one life to live, that's all they give us to do it
You can bullshit your way through it
Or stay true, it can be complicated 'cause niggas be gettin' shot in the cross
People and names get lost, the feeble and lame get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive
Take your possessions with pistols, bare hands and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody don't survive the dusk to see dawn
It's treacherous how we was left here to just die on these streets that we be on
Motherfuckers sleeping on them corners that you pee on
Probably 'cause society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the fuck made it this way for us?
Got all these little niggas selling that yay
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death?
Man, I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now come on, who gives a damn when you can't afford the turkey or ham?
Living off of ramen noodles, beef jerky and spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs, come off your slab
'Cause poverty'll push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your ledge
And so instead of being without, I'm hustling
Trying to get through these ungodly days
Thinking of ways to get the fuck outta this maze
A man'll commit a crime 'cause a fucking crime pays
I'm going through a phase you don't grow out
Until you a reason a motherfucker gots to po' out
His .40 on the curb, disturbed and left with no doubt in his mind
But still sometimes he don't know why
He walking around just hoping he get one more try to make it
It's bullshit he going through, but yo, he gots to take it
You can't fake it, to get the high life
High life (High life)
We living that high life
High life (High life)
We living that high life, mmm (High life)
High life
We living that high life
High life (High life)
We living that high life
High life
We livin' that high life (High life)
High life (High life, mmm)
We livin' that high lifeEmbed
