Outro LyricsDawg, sideways in the pen
Your boy finna break on out
Damn, look at this nigga
Man, that motherfucker still kissin', man, what the, oh
But that's the thing, I see it and don't see it
Up in here, dawg, before I go, it's just so crucial, man

Never whistle in the shower, in the pen
Nigga, I always need to keep these gym shoes on, you know what I'm sayin'?
Damn, a nigga go take him a shit or piss or somethin'
