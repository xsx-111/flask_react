One Day Lyrics
Well, well, well, well
Hello, baby
For one day, you here
And then you're gone
Well, well, well
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know, la-da-da-da-da
Yeah, well, well
I know, I know, I know, yeah

Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack-cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper, I gotta do it quick
Thinkin' I'm a juvenile, but they don't know who they messin' with, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live every day like it's my motherfuckin' last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game, live by the game, and in the game, I'ma die
And if I die, or should I say, if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the Come N Go
'Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a player is the penitentiary
So I'ma take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back, sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when you think about that, you say, "It'll be on"
It's a trip you're here today, but the next day, you're gone
One day, you're here, baby
And then you're gone (The next day, you're gone)
One day, you're here, baby (Woo)
And then you're gone (Baby, the next day, you're gone)
One day, you're here, baby (No)
And then you're gone (The next day, you're gone)
One day, you're here, baby (Then you're gone)
And then you're gone

This world we livin' in, man, it ain't nothing but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya
In New York niggas gettin' shot for bombers
Now they got your life in the palm of they hand like California
Niggas with dubs of hydroponic marijuana
Gang-bangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange, my nigga Pots died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died, wish it was twice, man
I remember being eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad, not givin' a fuck what we did
When we lost him, I knew the world was comin' to the end
And I had to quit lettin' that devil push me to a sin
My brother been in the pen for damn near ten
But now it look like when he come out, man, I'm goin' in
So, shit, I walk around with my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day, you're here, the next day, you're gone
One day, you're here, baby
And then you're gone (The next day, you're gone)
One day, you're here, baby (Woo)
And then you're gone

I'm up early 'cause ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets and sold three chickens 'fore the clock strike nine
Big nut holder, my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin' shife, so I look shife back
Can't show no weakness with these bitches, get your life jacked
Man, it's a trip where I stay, especially for me
Them bitches tryna lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga Donny forty, Dante nineteen
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip, you can ask Bun B, bitch, I ain't no liar
My man BoBo just lost his baby in a house fire (Oh yeah)
And when I got on my knees that night to pray, I asked God
"Why You let these killers live and take my homeboy's son away?"
Man if you got kids, show you love 'em 'cause God just might call 'em home
'Cause one day, they're here and, baby, the next day, they're gone

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Gone)
I know, you know
Well, well, yeah, ah
La-da-da-da-da
Gone, I know
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Gone, gone)
Then they gone
One day, you're here, baby (Come on)
And then you're gone
I know, you know, I know, yeah
Ah, la-da-da-da, la-da-da
Mmm, ooh
No, no, no, no, no, no (Come on, come on)
Baby, baby, la-da-da-da-da
One day, you're here, baby
And then you're gone (The next day, you're gone)
One day, you're here, baby (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And then you're gone, gone
(The next day, you're gone)
Gone, come on, don't leave me, yeah
Don't leave me, baby
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh15Embed
