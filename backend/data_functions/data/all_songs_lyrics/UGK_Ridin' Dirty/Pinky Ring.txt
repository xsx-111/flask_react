Pinky Ring Lyrics
You ain't never seen (Uh)
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (Check it out, all those pimps)
Fly women and fancy things (Player)
Fly bitches and pinky rings (Uh)
You ain't never seen (Check it out)
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (On our six)
Fly women and fancy things (Hold up)
Fly bitches and pinky rings (Uh)
You ain't never seen (What you doin'?)
A pimp that's rollin' this clean (Hold up)
Oh yeah

You ain't never met a nigga like Pimp C, ho
'Fore you come into my room, take off your shit at the do'
If you comin' to my hotel, then you game to fuck
And if you fuckin' with a Pimp, then bitch, your game is up
If your bitch get mad when you play this talk
Put her ass out on the highway, make that bitch walk
I ain't make this shit up, this shit old
Need to stop treatin' these bitches like ladies
And these nice ladies like hoes
Standin' on the front row, man, this ho a trip
She done opened up her legs and let me scope the pussy lips
Later on tonight, I'ma get behind her
I hope this bitch don't think that Pimp C payin' for no vagina
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (Pimp be rollin' so clean)
Fly women and fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen (You ain't never seen)
A pimp that's rollin' this clean
Oh yeah (Clean, clean, clean)

Well, you can catch me shoppin', checkin out the hoes boppin'
Choppin' up game to keep 'em lap hoppin'
Poppin' to the Carrington show stoppin'
Proppin' up a wheel and maybe ass droppin'
Breakin' haters off, can't be mistaken for fakin'
Fools are the ones left shakin', flakin'
Marijuana deals with Jamaicans
Bakin' up the powder to a fat cake and
Mashin' from the scene almost crashin', flashin'
Cop lights keep a player dashin'
Cash-in, on the crack course, paper stashin'
With a passion for high-priced fashion
My danky clothes and my eighty-fours clanky
God thank ye, motherfucker's actin' cranky
Stanky, attitudes be janky
I think he gon' have to feel the sting from the ring on my pinky
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (Pimp be rollin' so clean)
Fly women and fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (Pimp be rollin' so clean)
Fly women and fancy things
Fly bitches and pinky rings
You ain't never seen (You ain't never seen)
A pimp that's rollin' this clean
Oh yeah (Clean, clean, clean)

Think I ain't heavy strokin', you must be jokin'
Tokin' on some shit I don't even be smokin'
That coke and marijuana got yo' ass loc'n
Croakin', sleepin motherfuckers 'til they woken
I'm still crunk at five in the mornin'
Why yo' ass yawnin'? I'm flowin' 'til the crack of dawn and
Laughin' as you pawn your posessions
Yes, it's been worldwide tested
Showin' off my diamond investments

Rolexes ain't shit to a pimp
A twenty-ounce steak and some fried side of shrimp
A 600 S, now the 6 drop
Everything I ride original, no kits on them chops
Eighteen-inch Lorenzos, Yokohama tires
When I ride by all them bitches, get they pussy all on fire
Bitches say I highside, ho, it ain't no thang
Y'all just blinded by the diamonds, the Pimp, the pinky rang
You ain't never seen (Dallas)
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (Talkin' 'bout Houston, I mean Twoston)
Fly women and fancy things (Huh, hold up)
Fly bitches and pinky rings (Every day, talkin' 'bout the)
You ain't never seen (LA, uh)
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (In the Bay, what's happenin'?)
Fly women and fancy things (Hold up)
Fly bitches and pinky rings (I'm talkin' 'bout rollin' 'Lac)
You ain't never seen (Big 'Lac with the grill on the back)
A pimp that's rollin' this clean (Comin' down in the back)
Oh yeah (Goin' deep with my friends, hold up)
(Comin' down in the Jag) You ain't never seen
How a pimp be rollin' so clean (Comin' down, hold up)
Fly women and fancy things (Slay 'em)
Fly bitches and pinky rings (Uh, hold up, I keep it down low)
You ain't never seen (Slammin' big doors)
How a pimp be rollin' so clean
Fly women and fancy things (Holla that, holla that hoes)
Fly bitches and pinky rings (Hold up, hold up)
You ain't never seen ('96, nineteen-ninety-rich)
A pimp that's rollin' this clean (What's up, Rick?)
Oh yeah (Clean, clean, clean)

Yeah, hold up, hold up, hold up
What's up, Ree? What's up
Goodie Mob, Organized Noize, Geto Boys (Pimp be rollin' so clean)
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
OutKast (Yeah, yeah, uh)
You know Atlanta in the house
Jackson in the house and Memphis in the house (Pimp be rollin' so clean)
New Orleans in the house, hold up (Uh)
Man, I'm comin' down like that, comin' down like that
Comin' down like this, comin' down like this (You ain't never seen)
Comin' down like that, comin' down like that (Hold up, hold up)
Hold up, hold up, uh, hold up (Clean, clean, clean)
Hollerin' at the Boys off Botany (The Boys off Botany)
Dem boys off Scott, dem boys on the Scott
Hollerin' at the boys, hold up, man, hold up
Talkin 'bout the South, talkin 'bout Screw
Talkin 'bout the North, I'm talkin 'bout the North
Talkin 'bout the East, I'm talkin 'bout the West
Talkin 'bout the West, talkin 'bout the West7Embed
