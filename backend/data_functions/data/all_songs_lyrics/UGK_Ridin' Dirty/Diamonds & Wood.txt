Diamonds & Wood Lyrics
Niggas in here, man, they outta sight
And what's fucked up about it
The motherfuckers from your own city
Your little town or whatever, you know what I'm sayin'
Them be the worst ones
Niggas in here, man, can't stand to see a nigga havin' nothin', nigga
I be eatin' free world steak and shrimp
And shit like that, know what I'm sayin'?
Chokin' like a motherfucker got a bone in his throat
On that smin-oke, they can't stand it
You know?
But fuck 'em

Yeah, huh
Coming down
Dedicated to them boys riding slab
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood

I fli— I flip down the Ave., you know I'm looking tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga, never do that
Who say he going through a thang when y'all ain't never lied
I got a baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
Wanna hurt and try to hate 'cause she know the thrill is gone
Say, man, I stopped smoking with haters back in '94
But niggas thinking that a Sweet gonna get 'em through my door
And niggas talk a lot of shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now, nigga, listen to my beats and see just what I mean
Nigga, I ride dirty every day, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam ain't all what it look like
So I keep swanging out here clanging tryna live my life
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood

I fli— I flips down the Ave. and see these niggas and days go and come
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed, I grab my sess and split my Swisher with my thumb
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up
But all of my Sweets gon' blow, so killa, smoke get sucked up
I lucked up today and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say tomorrow they won't be blasting this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliffs of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year, I'm wiping away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)
But naturally, them fucking laws was always after me
So I have to be in that manor on that five-oh-three
I'm living dastardly, must be all about survival, G
These niggas passing me, streets just keep on getting live with me
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feeling that
They tried to steal a 'Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains, it's all about the 'caine
Swang and bang, peace to ESG and all the victims of the game, mane
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood

Flippin' through P.A., I'm trynna see some good
But everything is still the same in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up and smile when you down
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop comin' around
I see the jealousy and hatin' and the wicked ways
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smokin' our life away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight
My conscience fuck with me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side of selling dope and out there running the streets
And even though I'm gaining street fame comin' from this rap game
Lustful thinking and compulsive drinking is a normal thang
Some get erased and misplaced tryin' to win the race
Some try to hold on to they place by smoking wet lace
But, see, drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood
I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood (I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good)
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, nigga, diamonds up against that wood
I fli— I flips down the Ave., know I'm looking good
I'm banging Screw, aggin, diamonds up against that wood
So it's your life10Embed
