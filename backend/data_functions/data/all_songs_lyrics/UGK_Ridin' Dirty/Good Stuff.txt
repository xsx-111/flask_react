Good Stuff Lyrics
Motherfuckers kissin', man, they still kissin'
Nigga's jackin' they dick up under the cover, all of that
I don't participate in that rapin' myself, shit, fuck that
I need to get me some motherfuckin' ass, some hash, some ooh-ya-ya

Where the hoes?
Huh, where the hoes?
Lookin', lookin', tighten up, tryin' to tighten up
Where the hoes? Where the hoes?
Check it out

I'm comin' down candy, I put in my work
Got a ten-thousand dollar link medallion hangin' on a two-thousand dollar shirt
The game's been good
And all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
Bitches tryna price my diamonds, but that shit is just so common
'Cause they see a nigga shinin'
But I'm movin' too fast
Ninety-six karats if you think that you could manage
Got the drink and the salad
Now the bitch is in the Jag'
I'm comin' down Gulf Way, I'm tryin' to see what's up
I see big ass and some titties
Now we flippin' in the 'Burban to the city
The attitude too shitty, but I barred no plex
Ain't talkin' 'bout the Malcolm, but I'm ridin' on the X
The highway was so wet, I'm slippin' out my lane
The bitch was on her knees, and now she's runnin' me a game
I bet you never seen a big truck like that
I bet you never got a dick sucked like that
The bitch didn't know that I was tapin' the whole scene
Now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a five-piece screen
The glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
The chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel beaches and the hoes
I got the haters, and the jackers, and the million-dollar crackers
Tryna close me down, but I got ghetto love
I'm Pimp C, bitch, I'm comin' down richer than rich
So bitch, you know you gotta gimme good stuff
Lookin' for that good stuff
Ba-da, ba, ba-ba-da, ba, da
Tighten up on your backstroke
Ba-da, ba, ba-ba-da, ba, da
Lookin' for that good stuff
Tighten up on your backstroke
Comin' down on fresh paint
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke

We flippin' worldwide, P.A.T. International jet setters
Bigger than the Hollywood letters
But don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
Breakin' off the jealous with pitch-black Barettas
My fellas and tellers who holdin' plex against them Texas boys
Bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
Like you major, boy, you have done played yourself
Too $hort smoked you like a Newport, and you bought a one-way ticket to something bigger than you
Over your head and got scared
Exactly what I figured you'd do
Now who you kiddin'? I'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
Busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
As I sit in the lap of luxury
D.E.A. is tryna stick bugs to me
Undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
What could be more throwed?
Mafioso's puttin' bombs under my load
Never show no weakness or signs of declinin'
Now I'm comin' down shinin'
Pieces and chains full of diamonds
I'm winin' and dinin' at Caligula
Pretty boys gettin' off the hook
Them bitches sayin' "But I'm diggin' ya"
But I know that make her-make her crunk
And make her-make a man to make a nigga wanna pop trunk
Got skunk from the Rasta, eatin' pasta, steak and lobster
Like a mobster and gots to be lookin' for the good stuff
Lookin' for that good stuff
Ba-da, ba, ba-ba-da, ba, da
Tighten up on your backstroke
Ba-da, ba, ba-ba-da, ba, da
Lookin' for that good stuff
Tighten up on your backstroke
Comin' down on fresh paint
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke
Lookin' for that good stuff
Ba-da, ba, ba-ba-da, ba, da
Tighten up on your backstroke
Ba-da, ba, ba-ba-da, ba, da
Lookin' for that good stuff
Tighten up on your backstroke
Comin' down on fresh paint
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke (Smoke, smoke)
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke
Lookin' for that good stuff
Tighten up on your backstroke1Embed
