Touched Lyrics
Dawg, I'm just lookin', man, lookin' 'round, I see two niggas kissin', man
Shit out of sight, motherfuckers tongue-kissin', hahaha
Listen up, I got a story to tell
Ayy, fool, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, dawg, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, man, listen up, I got this story to tell
On the cool

Now, once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
Now, this was not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, tryna push me
He used to hold dick, now he wanna be in my shoes
Hatin' like a baby mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryna hold on to my little chunk but now the punk in the parking lot bumping his gums
With his ki's in the trunk, oh what, I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump?
You aimin' that bitch in the sky, you chump
Point that motherfucker this way and dump
Oh, what, you scared to go to the pen? Thinkin' them niggas gon' tap your rump
Man, I thought he played bold but he ain't even fuss
Man, the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to buss
But his trigger stayed cold I wasn't surprised
I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise, a sheep in wolf's clothing on the prey
Who tried to hunt the hunter and got hunted down his goddamn self in PA
Nigga, 'cause where we stay, ain't none of that kiki'ing or playin'
So see A or E about your life 'fore you test yourself
And make a nigga break you off some peace to rest yourself
Oh, yes, your health is what's in question
And I hope that this ass whippin' teach you a motherfuckin' lesson
Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South, boy's comin' up cold
Talkin' down on my name and what it's all about
You niggas better be gettin some paper and get my name out yo' mouth
'Cause, uh, I don't know why you got flex with me
Testin' me, but I'ma pull my shit and let you see
That all that carry the jack ain't able to survive
So you haters need to quit with that po' hustlin' and take another ride

Niggas often cross the line
The movies got these boys fucked up in the mind
Not to mention the wine and codeine syrup combined
Easy access to 9's, and shit talkin' hoes that's fine
And all they got time for is four, switch a dime
Committing crimes amped off water and some exaggerated rhyme
So if bein' hard ain't in your heart
Then don't start, niggas'll tear yo' weak mind apart

Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school
He don't know I hang with killers, we'll erase that fool
Wouldn't give a fuck about him, but he kin to my son
If you think that I'm that nigga, then you picked the wrong one
'Cause I live by the gun, die by the gun
Hot bullets burn, some say that them bitches stung
So raise your own children, don't try to raise mine
And when you see me step with caution 'cause I'm buckin' for mines, bitch
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You done crossed the line, now you gon' get fucked
I already told you before but you ain't barring that
So this time I'm handlin' mine and gon' erase you off the map (Huh)
Such a shame but it's all in the game
And since the early '60s, ain't a damn thing changed
We got haters over here and haters over there
But I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air

I see you trippin' off that water and you feel like you bad
'Cause yo' bitch done chose a pimp and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt 'cause I fucked your girl
Put big dick in her world, bust nuts in her curl
When I hit it from the back she said, "Baby, I can't take it"
Push my dick up in her harder, bitch, I'm straight up tryna break it
You a simp-ass nigga, you told that bitch that you love her
But I'm straight up fuckin' that pussy like that nigga off  that Colors
But I ain't gonna get shot 'cause you ain't shootin' shit
The best thing you can do is go and try and beat that bitch
'Cause this man's style, showstopper, pistol popper, you ain't ready
If I let this hot thing hit you fool, your stomach like spaghetti
Fool you talkin' loud but you move too slow
Tellin' niggas all your plans, got you tied up in a van
Nigga what the fuck is up? (Up) In the place to be
First I want the money, nigga, then I want the fuckin' ki's
Kidnap, robbery, 'cause you said you wanted me dead
Since you want a nigga dead, buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40, nigga, I be comin' fed
Got the sawed off pump with night vision, infrared
So play me like a pussy and you will get fucked
Nigga, I'm hangin' out the truck b-buck, buck
Hit your nigga in the leg, hit yo' bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay so your ass will get touched
Speak the wrong words, I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched 'cause yo' ass deserve
To get done real bad in front of yo' kids
To show 'em what real type of bitch you is
And, uh, it's that boy named 3 to the 2
Forever stayin' true, just a player makin' do
And I gotta tell it to the whole wide world
How you got bitched, razor necked, just like a motherfuckin' girl

Little, motherfuckin' girl
That's what you're actin' like, bitch
Eat my dick, haha3Embed
