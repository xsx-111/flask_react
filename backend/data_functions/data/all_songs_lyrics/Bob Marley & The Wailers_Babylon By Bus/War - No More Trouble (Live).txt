War / No More Trouble (Live) LyricsUntil the philosophy
Which holds one race superior and another
Inferior
Is finally
And permanently
Discredited
And abandoned
Well, everywhere is war
Is your war
And until there’s no longer first-class and second-class citizen  of any nation
Until the color of a mans skin is of no more significance
Than the color of his eyes
I’ve got to say ‘War’, yeah
And until the basic human rights are equally guaranteed to all
Without regard to race
Is your war, hey
But until that day
The dream of lasting peace, world citizenship
And the rule of international morality, yeah
Will remain but a fleeting illusion to be pursued
But never attained
Well, everywhere is war
Is your war
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south, yeah
Yes, you want a war
And the rumors of war
And, until the ignoble and unhappy regime
That holds our brothers in South Africa, yeah
South Africa, yeah
Sub-human bondage
Have been toppled, yeah
Utterly downstroyed
Well everywhere is
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere, everywhere
War in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south, yeah
Yes, you want a war
And the rumors of war
And until
And until
And ’til all these things have a meaning
’Til man learns
There’ll be always war, now
There’ll be always war
And the war in the east
War in the west
War up north
War down south
Some winning
Some losing
Some dying
Some crying
Some singing
We don’t need
No more troubles
We don’t need
No more troubles
No more troubles, no more troubles
No more troubles, eh
What we need is love
To guide and protect us on
If your hope looks down from above
Help the weak if you are strong
We don’t no trouble
What we need is love
We don’t need
No more troubles
No more troubles
No more troubles
No more troubles
No more troubles
We don’t need
We don’t need
No more troubles
No more war, no more war, no more war, I say
Speak happiness
Sad enough without your woes
Good morning, speak love
Sad enough without your foes, yeah
We don’t need no troubles
What we need is loveEmbed
