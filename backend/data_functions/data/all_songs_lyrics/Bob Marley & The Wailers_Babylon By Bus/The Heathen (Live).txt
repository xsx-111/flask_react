The Heathen (Live) Lyrics
Rise up fallen fighters
Rise and take your stance, again
'Tis he who fights and run away
Live to fight another day

And the heathen…
(Heathen back, they, upon the wall)
Jah, Jah put the heathen back
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back they on the wall
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back
(Heathen back, they on the wall)

As a man sow shall he reap
And I know that talk is cheap
But, the hotter the battle
How much sweeter Jah victory

And the heathen back
(Heathen back, they upon the wall)
Jah, Jah put the heathen back
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back, on the wall
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back on the wall
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
Rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up, rise up
Rise and take your stance again
It's he who fights and run away
Live to fight another day

And the heathen…
(Heathen back, they, upon the wall)
Jah, Jah put the heathen…
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
And the heathen back..
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
Jah, Jah put the…
(Heathen back, they on the wall)

I'm sayin':
As a man sow shall he reap
And I know that talk is cheap
But, the hotter the battle is
How much sweeter Jah victory

And the heathen…
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
(Heathen back, they on the wall)
(On the wall)
(On the wall)
(On the wall)
(On the wall)Embed
