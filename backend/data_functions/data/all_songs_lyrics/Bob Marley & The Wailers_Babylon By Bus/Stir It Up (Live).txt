Stir It Up (Live) Lyrics
Ooh, stir it up
Little darling, stir it up
Come on and stir it up
Little darling, stir it up

It's been a long, long time
Since I’ve got you on my mind
And now you are here, I say it's so clear
To see what we could do honey, just me and you

Oh, we could stir it up, little darling
(Stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Come on and stir it up, ooh, little darling
(Stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)

I'll push the wood
(Stir it, stir it, stir it together)
I blaze your fire
(Stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Then I will satisfy your, your heart's desire
(Stir it, stir it, stir it together)
Said, I stir it, yeah, every minute, yeah
(Stir it, stir it, stir it together)
All you got to do, honey, is keep it in,  and…
Stir it up, little darling
(Stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Come on and stir it up, ooh, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Yeah


Ooh, will you quench me while I’m thirsty
Or, would  you cool me down when I am hot
Your recipe darling is so tasty
And you sure can stir your pot, so…

Stir it up, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Come on and stir it up, ooh, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Come on and stir it up, oh, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Stir it up, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Stir it up, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Come on and stir it up, oh, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)
Want you to stir it up, oh, little darling
(stir it up, little darling)
Stir it up (Stir it up)Embed
