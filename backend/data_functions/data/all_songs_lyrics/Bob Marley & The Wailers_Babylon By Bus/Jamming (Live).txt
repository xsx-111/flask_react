Jamming (Live) Lyrics
Ooh, yeah
Well, alright
We're jamming, see
I wanna jam it with you
(I wanna jam it with you)
We're jamming, we're jamming
And I hope you like jamming, too
(Hope you like jamming too)

Ain't no rules, ain't no vow
You can do it anyhow
‘Cause I and I will see you through
(I and I will see you through)
But everyday we pay the price, we're the living sacrifice
Jamming 'til the jamming's through
(jamming 'til the jamming's through)

Ooh, yeah, we're jamming, hey
To think that jamming was a thing of our past
(Jamming was a thing of our past)
We're jamming, we're jamming
And I hope this time it's gonna last
(And I hope this time it's gonna last)
No bullet could stop us now, we neither beg nor we will bow
Neither can be bought nor sold
(Neither can be bought nor sold)
We all defend the right, Jah , Jah children must unite
Whose life is worth much more than gold
(Whose life is worth much more than gold)

Ooh, yeah we're jamming
And we're jamming in the name of the Lord
(We're jamming in the name of the Lord)
We're jamming; we're jamming
And we're jamming right straight from yard
(Jamming right straight from yard)

Hey, Holy Mt Zion
(Zion)
Holy Mt Zion
(Zion)
Jah seated on Mt Zion
Everywhere rules all creation

Here, we're ramming
(Ramming)
I want to tell you that we're here
And we're jamming
(Jamming)
I really feel it
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna jam it
(I wanna jam it with you)
Ramming, jamming
And, I hope you like jamming too
(Hope you like jamming too)
Oh, well, I hope you like jamming
I hope you like jamming
I wanna, I want, I wanna jam it
(I wanna jam it with you)
Jamming, jamming
Hope you like…
(I hope you like jamming too)
Well, well, well, well
(Jamming, jamming, jamming, jamming)
(I hope you like jamming too)
(Jamming, jamming, jamming, jamming)
(I hope you like jamming too)

Holy, Holy
Holy, Holy, Holy
(Zion)
Ohhh
