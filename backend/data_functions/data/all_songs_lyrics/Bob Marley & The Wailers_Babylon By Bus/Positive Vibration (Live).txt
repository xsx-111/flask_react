Positive Vibration (Live) Lyrics
Greetings in the name of His Majesty, Emperor Haile Selassie-I.  Jah!   Ras Tafari.  Ever living, ever fearful, ever sure Selassie-I the First
Yes
Yes
Ras Tafari
Ever living
Rastaman vibrations, positive

Rastaman vibration, yeah!
(Positive!)
Live if you wanna live.  I and I vibration, yeah!
(Positive)
Got to have a good vibe!   I-a-man I-ration, yeah
(Irie ites!)
Positive Vibration, yeah
(Positive!)

If you get down and you quarrel everyday
You are saying prayers to the devil, I say
Why not help one another on the way?
Make it much easier
(Just a little bit easier)
Hey, we just could not live in that negative way
You know what I mean
Make way for the positive day
'Cause it's a new day
And it's a new time
Yes, it's a new feeling
Said it's a new sign
Oh what a new day
Picking up
Are you picking up now
Picking up
Are you picking up now
Oh, Jah love, Jah love protects us
Oh, Jah love, Jah love protects us
Oh, Jah love, Jah love protects us

And I say
Rastaman vibration, yeah!
(Positive!)
I and I vibration, yeah!
(Positive)
I-a-man I-ration, yeah
(Irie ites!)
Positive Vibration, yeah
(Positive!)
(Just a little bit easier)
'Cause it's a new day
And it's a new time
Said it's a new feeling
Said it's a new sign
Oh what a new day
Picking up?
Are you picking up now?
Picking up?
Are you picking up now?
Oh, Jah love, Jah love protect us
Oh, Jah love, Jah love protect us
Oh, Jah love, Jah love protect usEmbed
