Kinky Reggae (Live) Lyrics
I went downtown
(Said, I went downtown)
I saw Miss Brown
(Said, I saw Miss Brown)
She had brown sugar
(Had brown sugar)
All over her booga-wooga
(All over her booga-wooga)
I think I might join the fun
(Think I might join the fun)
But, I had to hit and run
(But I had to hit and run)
See, I just can't settle down
(Just can't settle down)
In the kinky part of town

Ride on
Don't you know I've got to ride on
Ride on
See, I just can't settle down
Ride on
I'm a-leaving town

(Kinky reggae)
All I've got to say
(Kinky reggae, now)
Take it or leave it
(Kinky reggae)
Deceive it
Kinky reggae, now
Kinky reggae
Kinky reggae, oh
Kinky reggae, give it up
Kinky reggae, now
Would you ride on
Ride on
Ride on
Ride on
Ride on

Ay, I went down to Piccadilly Circus
Down there I saw Marcus
He had old candy tar
All over his chocolate bar
I think I might join the fun
(Think I might join the fun)
But, I had to hit and run
(But I had to hit and run)
See, I just can't settle down
(Just can't settle down)
In the kinky, kinky part of town

Nice one
That's what they say
Nice one
But, I'm a-leaving you today
Nice one, oh, mama please don't play
Nice one, oh mama say, mama say
Kinky reggae
Kinky reggae, now
(Kinky reggae)
Give it up
Kinky reggae, now
Oh
Kinky reggae
All I've got to say is kinky reggae, now
Kinky reggae
Kinky reggae
Would you ride on

Ride on
Ride on
Ride on
See, I just can't settle down
Ride on

All I want is somebody that would say
Reggae is this thing I leave you all today
Whoa, yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Kinky reggae, yeah
Kinky reggae
(Kinky reggae, now)
(Kinky reggae)
(Kinky reggae, now)
This is the nice one

Nice one
Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice one
(Nice one)
Nice one
(Nice one)
Yeah, well, nice one, nice one, nice one
(Nice one)Embed
