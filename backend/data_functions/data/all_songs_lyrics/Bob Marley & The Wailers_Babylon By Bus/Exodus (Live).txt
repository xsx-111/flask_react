Exodus (Live) Lyrics
(Exodus)
(Movement of Jah People)

Men and people will fight you down
When you see Jah light
Let me tell if you're not wrong
Well, everything is alright
So we're gonna walk
Through the roads of creation
We, the generation, tread through great tribulation

In this exodus
Good God of Reggae
Movement of Jah People
Exodus
The movement of Jah People

Eh, well, well, well, open your eyes
And look within
Are you satisfied
With the life you're living
We know where we're going
We know where we're from
We're leaving Babylon
We're going to our Fathers' Land
In this exodus
Movement of Jah People
Exodus
