Oh lively up yourself, and don't be no drag
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
Reggae is another bag
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
And don't say no
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
‘Cause I said so
You want to…
You rock so, you rock so
(you rock so, you rock so)
Like you never did before
You dip so, you dip so
(you dip so, you dip so)
’Til you dip through my door
You skank so, you skank so
(you skank so, you skank so)
Oh yeah!
You come so, you come so
(you come so, you come so)
Come alive today, yeah
Then lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
Ah-la-da, ah-lah-da, ah-lah-da, ah-lah-da
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
Did you hear me? Did you hear me?
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
‘Cause if you don’t do, ain’t nobody gonna do it for you
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
And don’t be no, don’t be no, don’t be no, don’t be no drag..
What you got that I don't know
I'm trying to wonder, wonder why you
Wonder, wonder why you act so
(lively up yourself)
And, don’t be no drag, yeah…
(lively up yourself)
For reggae is another bag
(you rock so, you rock so)
(you dip so, you dip so)
(you skank so, you skank so)
(you come so, you come so)
(lively up yourself)
(lively up yourself)
(lively up yourself)
Don’t be no, be no drag
(lively up yourself)
For reggae is another bag
You’re gonna rock so, you rock so
(you rock so, you rock so)
You dip so, you dip so
(you dip so, you dip so)
Yeah
You’re gonna skank so, you skank so
(you skank so, you skank so)
You come so, you come so
(you come so, you come so)
Lively up yourself
(lively up yourself)
Your woman in the morning time, y’all
Keep lively up your woman when the evening come
(lively up yourself)
And take her, take you, take you, take you there
(lively up yourself)
C’mon baby, I wanna be lively myself
(lively up yourself)
C’mon baby, I wanna be lively myself
Lively up yourselfEmbed
