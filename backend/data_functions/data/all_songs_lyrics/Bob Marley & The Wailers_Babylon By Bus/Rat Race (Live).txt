Rat Race (Live) Lyrics
(Oh, what a rat race)
(Oh, what a rat race)
(Oh, what a rat race)
(This is the rat raceâ€¦.rat race)

Some a-lawful
Soma a-bastard
Some a-jacket
Oh, what a rat race
Rat race

Some a-gorgon
Some a-hooligan
Some a-guinea-gog
In this here rat race, yeah
Rat race
I'm saying

When the cat's away
The mice will play
Political violence fill your cities, yeah
Don't involve rasta in your say-say
I'm saying, rasta don't work for no C.I.A
Rat race
Rat race
Rat race, yeah
Rat race
I'm saying

When you think it's peace and safety
A sudden destruction
Collective security, for surety, yeah
Don't forget your history
Or your destiny
In the abundance of water, the fool is thirsty

Rat race
Rat race
Rat race
Rat race
Oh, it's a disgrace
To see the human race
In a rat race
Rat race
You got the horse race
You got the dog race
You got the human race
But, this is a rat race
Rat race
Some a chicken
Some a scratch it
Some a bunch it
Some a bastard
In this here rat race
Rat raceEmbed
