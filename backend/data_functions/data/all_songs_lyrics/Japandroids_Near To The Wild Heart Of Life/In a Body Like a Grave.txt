In a Body Like a Grave Lyrics
Christ will call you out
School will deepen debt
Work will sap the soul
Hometown haunts what’s left
Love will scar the heart
Sun will burn the skin
Just the way it is
And way it’s always been

And it’s all in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave

Christ will call you out
School will deepen debt
Work will sap the soul
Hometown haunts what’s left
Love will scar the heart
Sun will burn the skin
Just the way it is
And way it’s always been
And it’s all in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave

And age is a traitor and, bit by bit
Less lust for life, more talking shit
But remember there’s heaven in the hellest of holes
And a drink for the body is a dream for the soul
Well, time will tell, but best beware
Cause time is money and money swears
So break the bank like you’re breaking a bill
And love so hard that time stands still
If your name is shamed, or your love is lost
Swap the city’s lights for the southern cross
Gather the gang and make that night
An ultimatum to the universe, fuck or fight
From a mere mirage to the moment of
Your cum of cums with your love of loves
It’s all in a lifetime, but here and now
Only god knows where and devil knows how
And it’s all in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave

And it’s all in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
All in a lifetime
And all in a body like a grave
And it’s all in a lifetime (all in a lifetime)
And all in a body like a grave (in a body like a grave)
All in a lifetime (all in a lifetime)
And all in a body like a grave (in a body like a grave)Embed
