True Love and a Free Life of Free Will Lyrics
Flesh is foreign, friends are far
Decks run deep, sleep is minced or marred
And it’s all out war for the soul between
Dreams that are hungry and the fears that feed
But I’ll carry it, by chariot, through blood and blows
Under starless skies of fire, into great unknown
Living on the lam and the frontier of
A free life of free will for the thrill of your love

Spill your secrets and paint my days
Passion is your palette, your canvases cafés
And null my nights in the harbour and hell
Of the cantina’s counsel and meals of mezcal

Plans to settle down
Plans to up and split
Plans loose as the morals we are planning with
Baby be the beast, but free what burdens be
And I’ll love you if you love me

All life long, ’til I’m gone
All life long, ’til I’m gone
Cigarettes, sorcery, and Biblical sins
Hangovers, heathens, harlots, and anti-heroines
The cabarets, the getaways, and the afterglow
A little money and whatever’s on the radio

Plans to settle down
Plans to up and split
Plans loose as the morals we are planning with
Baby be the beast, but free what burdens be
And I’ll love you if you love me

All life long, ’til I’m gone
All life long, ’til I’m gone
All life
All life
All life
All life
All life long, ’til I’m gone
All life long, ’til I’m goneEmbed
