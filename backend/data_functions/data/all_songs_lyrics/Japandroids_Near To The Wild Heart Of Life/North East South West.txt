North East South West Lyrics
Bated breath and the guts to go
Criss-crossing the continent all aglow
Leaving lovelorn, dating destiny
And living for the moment that she marries me
Started this song in the southern states
Rays by the river, sinning at The Saint
Hot and heavy when I hit the hay
In N-O-L-A, USA

Coast of California, the highway high
Noise, narcotics, and the New York night
An unshaven shaman shaking down the day
And all manner of madness standing in my way
Down in flames with dice to roll
Up in smoke, running roulette road
And, man, America made a mess of me
When I messed with Texas and Tennessee

North, east, south, west, coast to coast
Baby, the trouble that I get into
North, east, south, west, coast to coast
It ain’t shit compared to loving you
North, east, south, west, coast to coast
Baby, the trouble that I get into
North, east, south, west, coast to coast
It ain’t shit, it’s just kicks
And like the road, I’m going on and on and on
Flayed and gutted, so I’ve got to go
Back home, hungry for a hand to hold
And no matter how much I fan the flames
Canada always answers when I call her name
Down and out, drinking Dundas dry
Up against the wall of a winter’s night
Toronto, I’m trusting you to the cut the cane
‘Cause I’m saving Vancouver for a rainy day

North, east, south, west, coast to coast
Baby, the trouble that I get into
North, east, south, west, coast to coast
It ain’t shit compared to loving you
North, east, south, west, coast to coast
Baby, the trouble that I get into
North, east, south, west, coast to coast
It ain’t shit, it’s just kicks
And like the road, I’m going on and on and on

Learn to let it go, baby
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
Shake, rattle, and roll, baby
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
Out of the city you’ve seen
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
And into some trouble with me
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
We’ll go north, east, south, west
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
We’ll go north, east, south, west
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
We’ll go north, east, south, west
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
We’ll go north, east, south, west
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)
(Whoa oh oh, oh oh oh)Embed
