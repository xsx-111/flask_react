Midnight to Morning Lyrics
Born to marry the bottle in a
Ceremony that lasts forever and
Cursed to carry on, abuzz and all alone
Weak and weary on the run and on the road
But if you’ll hide me and heal me in your
Sanctuary, I’ll stay forever so
Leave the light on, I’ll leave the bottle to its own

So many miles
So much to lose
A devil by my side
And right between us two
And I pray those yellow lines on the I-5
Bring me back home to you
Bring me back home to you
Bring me back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you

Born to marry the bottle in a
Ceremony that lasts forever and
Cursed to carry on, abuzz and all alone
Weak and weary on the run and on the road
But if you’ll hide me and heal me in your
Sanctuary, I’ll stay forever so
Leave the light on, I’ll leave the bottle to its own
So many miles
So much to lose
A devil by my side
And right between us two
And I pray those yellow lines on the I-5
Bring me back home to you
Bring me back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Bring me back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you

So many miles
So much to lose
A devil by my side
And right between us two
And I pray those yellow lines on the I-5
Bring me back home to you
Bring me back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to you
Bring me back home to you
Back home to you
Back home to youEmbed
