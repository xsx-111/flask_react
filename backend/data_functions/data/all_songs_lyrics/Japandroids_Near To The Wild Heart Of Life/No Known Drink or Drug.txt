No Known Drink or Drug Lyrics
Passport, past life, a drifter’s demons
Alone, lost, and fast running out of reasons
For not falling in with the Foreign Legion
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

Cold, kicking the can around town one evening
Streets all abandoned, bars barely breathing
A whirlwind, a woman, and a famous feeling
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

A cool, hard beauty, christened with composure
Boots, skirt, blouse, shawl over her shoulders
Skin soft, lips colored crimson clover
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

A slow-burning sermon to have and hold her
But ever since she started sleeping over
Oh, Lord, I’m living like a Holy Roller
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

A red animal romance in the summer heat
In parks, on patios, and in the streets
On mission, making moments into memories
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
And when winter’s off the leash and on the loose
We ward off the weather with a witches' brew
Of dominoes and prose and Delta blues
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
And no known drink
No known drug
Could ever hold a candle to your love
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
And no known drink
No known drug
Could ever hold a candle to your love
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)

(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
And no known drink
No known drug
Could ever hold a candle to your love
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)
And no known drink
No known drug
Could ever hold a candle to your love
(Sha na na na, sha na na na na)2Embed
