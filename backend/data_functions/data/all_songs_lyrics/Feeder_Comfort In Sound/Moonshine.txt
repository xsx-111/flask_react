Moonshine Lyrics
Floating in the Everglades
Faces lit in sun
A moon that lights a thousand ways across
Is company for one

Ooh won't you come back to me
Ooh won't you shine out for me

Falling down from grace
In houses made for one
Holding matches 'til they burn away
Ashes to the wind

Ooh won't you come back to me
Ooh won't you shine out for me

Only you, it's only for you
Always true
But time is passing by
Only you
Always you
But every time we cry
We wave the sun goodbye
Moonshine
Desolate the renegades
Poisoned tongues persuade
Take the hand that carried you above
Oceans to the grave

Ooh won't you come back to me
Ooh won't you shine out for me

Only you, it's only for you
Always true
But time is passing by
Only you
Always you
But every time we cry
We wave the sun goodbye
Moonshine

Tear yourself, you tear yourself .... (repeat)
Going over every minute every second in your mind
Turning over catching fragments of a life before you die
Going over every second, every minute left behind ...
It's only for you
Always true
But time is passing by
Only you
Always you
But every time we cry
We wave the sun goodbye
Moonshine

Only you, it's only for you
Always true
But time is passing by
Only you
Always you
But every time we cry
We wave the sun goodbye
