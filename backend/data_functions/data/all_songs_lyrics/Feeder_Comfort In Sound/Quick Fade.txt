Quick Fade Lyrics
Time, time on your mind
A conscience ticking
Images passing by like picture slides arranged
Love will survive
It twists and turns you
A circuit inside your head reminds you that it's fine

I miss you more than words can say
A part of me has torn away
A china heart will always break
A fracture to a twisted face
But things are gonna heal again
Eyes once blind will see again
I miss you more than words can say
I miss you more than words
Quick fade

Try, learning to fly
Reach new sky
Find a new place to be and watch life pass you by
Try to get high
Jumped so you could feel it
You're living inside a dream
As waterfalls surround
I miss you more than words can say
A part of me is torn away
China hearts will always break
A fracture to a twisted face
But things are gonna heal again
Eyes once blind will see again
I miss you more than words can say
I miss you more than words
Quick fade, fade, fade, fade

Glide, Glide over tides
And waves that pull you
Oceans divide us once and bring you home again
Love will survive
It twists and turns you

He's gone, gone, quick fade
It's gone, gone, quick fade

I miss you more than words can say
A part of me is torn away
China hearts will always break
A fracture to a twisted face
But things are gonna heal again
Eyes once blind will see again
I miss you more than words can say
I miss you more than words
