Child In You Lyrics
Talk about it, you dream about it
You feel that there's no place left to glow
Operatics, break the habits
You feel that there's no place left to grow
You gotta reach inside yourself and let it go

So close your eyes and drift away to some place new
Where the skies are blue brings back the child in you
Cross a lonely field as birds begin to speak

It's alright
It's okay
Blue, true
Blue, true

Cry about it shout about it
You feel that there's no sense in going on
Late November, change in weather
The cold has got a hold of you again
That river's gonna drag you down again

Close your eyes and drift away to some place new
Where the skies are blue brings back the child in you
Cross a lonely field as birds begin to speak
It's alright
Its okay
Its alright
Blue

Nothing was stopping you
Nothing was stopping you
Nothing was stopping blue
Blue, true, blue, true, miss you
Child in youEmbed
