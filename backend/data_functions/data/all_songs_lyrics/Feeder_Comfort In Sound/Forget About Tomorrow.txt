Forget About Tomorrow Lyrics
Calling
Distorting
Reach the ends for you
Put a hole right through
Talking
We keep talking
Fill an empty space
In this lonely frame
As the image fades in to one

Today it all feels fine
An' a sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Just breathe the air inside
And bring on back that lonely smile
Can't think about tomorrow

Twisting
Constricted
On the edge for you
You know I'd jump right through
Falling
We keep stalling
I can see the ground
Some place new to land
As the image fades into one

Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Just breathe the air inside
And bring on back that lonely smile
Can't think about tomorrow
Can't think about tomorrow

Because you feel yourself fall apart again
You hold your face inside your aching hands
The angels just come flooding down again
Bring us back again

Yearning
Returning
To this empty street
As the city sleeps
Tearing
Despairing
As the day comes in
As the morning sings
As the image fades into one

Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Just breathe the air inside
And bring on back that lonely smile
Can't think about tomorrow
Today it all feels fine
A sense of freedom fills your mind
Can't think about tomorrow
Can't think about tomorrowEmbed
