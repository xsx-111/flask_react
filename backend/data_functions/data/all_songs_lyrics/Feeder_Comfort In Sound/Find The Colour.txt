Find The Colour Lyrics
Find the colour, sight and sound
A new exposure comes around
Anaesthetic for the mind
Hear the voice that soothes away the pain
Television, satellite
Conversation running dry
Sending back another text
Holding on to words you might regret
You know you might regret

Cause now I can see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
(Find the colour
Find the colour)

Looking for something new
A taste of life to pull you through
Defences down your feeling low
A change in feeling comes around again
Its coming round again
Cause now I can see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
So damn good


I read the papers yesterday
They say that the bubble boy's okay
Another day of rain to come
We're sitting back still waiting for the sun
Waiting for the sun

Cause now I can see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn good
Now I see that I love all the things
That you do with each day
And it feels, so damn good
Every second that passes me by
With the blink of an eye
It just feels, so damn goodEmbed
