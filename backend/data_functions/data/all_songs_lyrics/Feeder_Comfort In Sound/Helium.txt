Helium LyricsFuel emotions, killing me
Pure devotion, cut and bleed
Your the crystal, the ecstasy
The drug that keeps feeding me
So come on
Torn together we sow the seed
Bring the pleasure back for free
The world is frozen but
I can taste new life every time I breathe
So come on, get in
Take a ride, till you sink
Come on, get in
Let's feel a new high kicking in
Change the system, break the shape
New connection hands to make
Find the honey and learn to taste again
Bring it back again
So come on
Burn forever, learn to feed
Find the pleasure it's yours to keep
The world is frozen
But I can taste new life every time I breathe
So come on, get in
Take a ride, till you sink
Come on, get in
Let's feel a new high, kicking in...
Get in
Take a ride, till you sink
Come on, get in
Let's feel a new high kicking in...
Come together, feel the heat
Suck the life left right out of me
The world is frozen
But I can taste new life every time I breathe
Every step I take
Every drop I bleed
So come on, get in
Take a ride, till you sink
Come on, get in
Let's feel a new high kicking in...
Get in
Take a ride, till you sink
Come on, get in
Let's feel a new high kicking in...
Get in
Take a ride, till you sink
Come on, get in
Let's feel a new high kicking in...Embed
