Face Up Lyrics
You turn my head
I spin my wheels
Running on empty
You know how that feels
I'm on a roll now
Or is it a slide?
Can't be too careful
With that dangerous pride
If I could only reach that dial inside
If I could only reach that dial inside
If I could only reach that dial inside
And turn it up

Face up...Face up or you can only back down
Face up...Hit the target or you better hit the ground
Face up...There's still time to turn this game around
Face up...Turn it up
Or turn that wild card down
Face up...Turn it up

Don't complain
Don't explain
I don't think my new resolve
Can stand the strain
I'm in a groove now
Or is it a rut?
I need some feedback
But all the lines are cut
I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut
I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut
I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut
And turn it up
Face up...Face up or you can only back down
Face up...Hit the target or you better hit the ground
Face up...There's still time to turn this game around
Face up...Turn it up
Or turn that wild card down
Face up...Turn it up

You get all squeezed up inside
Like the days were carved in stone
You get all wired up inside
And it's bad to be alone
You can go out, you can take a ride
And when you get out on your own
You get all smoothed out inside
And it's good to be alone
Turn it up
x2
Face up...Face up or you can only back down
Face up...Hit the target or you better hit the ground
Face up...There's still time to turn this game around
Face up...Turn it up
Or turn that wild card down
Face up...Turn it up
Or turn that wild card down
If I could only reach that dial inside
Turn that wild card
If I could only reach that dial inside
Or turn that wild card down
If I could only reach that dial inside
Turn it up
Or turn that wild card
If I could only reach that dial inside
Turn it up
Or turn your wild card downEmbed
