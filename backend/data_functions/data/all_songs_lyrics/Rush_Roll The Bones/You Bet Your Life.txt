You Bet Your Life Lyrics
Just another hunter, like a wolf in the sun
Just another junkie on a scoring run
Just another victim of the things he has done
Just another day in the life of a loaded gun

The odds get even
You name the game
The odds get even
The stakes are the same
You bet your life...

Just another winner, pours his life down the drain
Just another island in a hurricane
Just another loser, like a cat in the rain
Just another day in the path of a speeding train

The odds get even
You name the game
The odds get even
The stakes are the same
You bet your life...
Anarchist reactionary running dog revisionist
Hindu muslim catholic creation / evolutionist
Rational romantic mystic cynical idealist
Minimal expressionist post-modern neo-symbolist

Armchair rocket scientist graffiti existentialist
Deconstruction primitive performance photorealist
Be-bop or a one drop or a hip-hop lite pop metallist
Gold adult contemporary urban country capitalist

Just another gypsy with a plastic guitar
Just another dancer with her eyes on the stars
Just another dreamer who was going too far
Just another drunk at the wheel of a stolen car

The odds get even
The odds get even
You bet your life...
