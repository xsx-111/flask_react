The Air We Breathe LyricsDo you feel the air we breathe?
Do you feel the things I see and do you feel you're close to me?
Do you feel the air we breathe?
Do you feel the things I see and do you feel you're close to me?
Out of the street lights
Up on the top of a hill
I was dreaming
My head just needed to chill
I'll get it together
I'll speak to you briefly
And open your mind in a cheap suitEmbed
