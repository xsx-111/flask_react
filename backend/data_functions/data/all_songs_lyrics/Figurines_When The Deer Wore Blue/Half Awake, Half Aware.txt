Half Awake, Half Aware LyricsOh, when up there, the people we knew
Home bound but on the blue
Now and then when it happens I'll do
Eight weeks to make it through
I'd like to give it over
Like to give it over
Things you never knew
I'll share with you
I'm gonna tell you 'bout the moments we've shared
Long days without a care
I suppose I could meet you out there
Half awake and half aware
I'd like to give it over
Like to give it over
Things you never knew
I'll share with youEmbed
