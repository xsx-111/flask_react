Childhood Verse LyricsAll alone
All alone
I love it I love it I lie
We're alone
But from this day I promise together we'll try
On your own
All alone
You love it you love it you lie
What if we had a chance
What if we had a chance
Will you get what you wanted in the afternoon
Falling trees
Blocking an empty road
I promise together we'll die
Another will turn off the lights
Move away
On our own
I love it I love it I lieEmbed
