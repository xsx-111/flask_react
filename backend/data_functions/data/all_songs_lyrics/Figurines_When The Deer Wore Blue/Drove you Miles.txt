Drove you Miles LyricsHave to feel the evergreens and the tip of dawn
Have to feel the evergreens and the tip of dawn
I'll write and change what I said and pick a tone
I tried to stay but ent away
What have we become?
I drove you miles
Take a seat here by me
Look, a movie is on
In this scene a man is trapped and he thinks of home
He'll write and change what he said and pick a throne
He tried to stay but went away
What have we become?Embed
