Not on Drugs Lyrics
Shiny, happy, see my world in new colors
Higher fire, fly my rocket through universe

I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue
I live in the sky, you can live here too
I'm Queen of the Clouds, make my wish come true
I sing to the night, let me sing to you

Baby, listen please, I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs, I'm just in love
Baby, don't you see I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs, I'm just in love
You're high enough for me

Lighter, brighter, pick the biggest stars I find
And I'm trip, trip, tripping in my empire state of mind

Ooh, I'm up with the kites in a dream so blue
I live in the sky, you can live here too
I'm Queen of the Clouds, make my wish come true
I sing to the night, let me sing to you

Baby, listen please, I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs, I'm just in love
Baby, don't you see I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs, I'm just in love
You're high enough for me
(High...)
You're high enough for me

Baby, listen please, I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs, I'm just in love
Baby, don't you see I'm not on drugs, I'm not on drugs, I'm just in love
You're high enough for me

(High...)
You're high enough for me
(High...)
You're high enough for me
(High...)20Embed
