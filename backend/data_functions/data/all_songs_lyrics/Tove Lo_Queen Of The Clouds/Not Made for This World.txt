Not Made for This World Lyrics
So you fought off a thousand gangsters
Ready for the war
And you hang with the stones round the world on tour
And you bought me a million diamonds
But lost them by the shore
Cause if I’d to believe you, I’d look in the water

And the wide-eyed loving monster who feeds my every lie
Cause I need to pretend it's you and I
And I know my head is twisted but it keeps me sane at times
That I know I can keep you in my mind

Dream till I'm dead, then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend, we'll soon be expired
We would be not made for this world
Not made for this world

So I tell you a little secret
Who knew that I could fly?
I'm the queen of the world in the trees up high
And if you wanna come with me
You just say the word
I'll be waving my wand and we both turn into birds
And the wide-eyed loving monster who feeds my every lie
Cause I need to pretend it's you and I

Dream till I'm dead, then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend, we'll soon be expired
We would be not made for this world
Not made for this world

We got a happy place
Where nobody else can go
You and I

Dream till I'm dead then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend, we'll soon be expired
(And we were not made for this)
We would be not made for this world
Dream till I'm dead then set me on fire
Flames and the smoke keep taking me higher
Love and pretend, we'll soon be expired
(And we were not made for this)
We would be not made for this world
Not made for this world
Not made for this world
Not made for this world
We would be not made for this world7Embed
