Run on Love (QOTC Edit) Lyrics
(We can run on love for a while)
(We can run on love for a while)

I had one mission
But I committed treason
I can't believe I caved for you
So I am now a failure
Everything I gave you
Let's elope and live like you

Trapped inside each other
We don't even bother
Naive say it's a beautiful thing
Hope we live forever
Doesn't sound too clever
Works as my protective wing

We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love till it dies
Till it dies again
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love till it dies
Till it dies again
And together we fall

I had one mission
But I committed treason
I promise I would stay away
From you and your bad tricks
You are my quick fix
I can feel it fade away

Suddenly the day came
We started to place blame
Driving us right out of our heads
You say it's my error
I say look in the mirror
The reason why the flame is dead

We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love till it dies
Till it dies again
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
We can run on love for a while
Till it dies
I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back to you
I always go back
I always go back to you
Together we fall5Embed
