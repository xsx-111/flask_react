Got Love Lyrics
(Lo-o-ove)

When I breathe and I breathe into you and I feel you right to the bone
And I give what you give and we go even higher than we are strong
And the cracks in the walls covered up by the sheets we live underneath
All the sex, all the nights we stay up yeah we're stuck, but we're more than free

Ooooh, Aaaah
Oooooh, Aaaaah
Got the world in our hand like a land

Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love, we got love
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that we'll never die
We got love, we got love

I can feel that you feel what I feel and I feel it all in your hands
When we touch it's too much and you're making me move yeah, now you make me dance
Going body to body for good saying nobody gets it right
We don't plan, we don't care got the fume and the flame we don't let it die
Ooooh, Aaaah
Oooooh, Aaaaah
Got the world in our hand like our land

Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love

(Lo-o-ove)
Perfect like a picture I know we are one and the same
(Lo-o-ove)
Perfect like a picture even when they look through the grains
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)

Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now know that will never die
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)
We got love, we got love
(Lo-o-ove)20Embed
