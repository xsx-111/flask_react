This Time Around Lyrics
I used to take your breath away
I used to make your laugh about anything
I used to be your getaway
Your getaway, your dream, I was every thing you needed

You used to lean your eyes on me
You used to open up and share your world
You used to lose yourself in me
Let the hours pass, oh, running by so fast

But now, what I'm doing
I don't know, what I'm doing

Cause I don't even feel it
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
And I don't even mean it
Got my hands all over you, but not a sound
I'm always so in love, all in
Till I start going numb thinking
Thought you'd make me feel it
Thought that I'd be different this time around
This time around
We started out as lonely hearts
We started with a promise built on highs
You said I was the missing part
Looked into my eyes said "You're my fix for life"

But now, what I'm doing
I don't know, what I'm doing

Cause I don't even feel it
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
And I don't even mean it
Got my hands all over you, but not a sound
I'm always so in love, all in
Till I start going numb thinking
Thought you'd make me feel it
Thought that I'd be different this time around
This time around

Don't know what I'm doing
This time around
This time around
Don't know what I'm doing
This time around
This time around
Ooooh
Cause I don't even feel it
Bodies growing colder with the distance now
And I don't even mean it
Got my hands all over you, but not a sound
I'm always so in love, all in
Till I start going numb thinking
Thought you'd make me feel it
Thought that I'd be different this time around
This time around

Don't know what I'm doing
This time around
This time around
Don't know what I'm doing
This time around
This time around
