Habits (Stay High) (Hippie Sabotage Remix) Lyrics
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh, ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Oh, ooh
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, uh, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end
Oh, ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain
Oh, ooh

Stayin' in my play pretend
Where the fun ain't got no end, uh, oh-oh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay high
All the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
High all the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time, to k-, high, to k-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
