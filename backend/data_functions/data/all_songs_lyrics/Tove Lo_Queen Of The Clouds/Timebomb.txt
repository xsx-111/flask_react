Timebomb Lyrics
You made your way in as I was leaving
You cut in line just as I was getting my stuff
And I couldn't decide if you were the most annoying human being I'd ever met
Or just the best thing that ever happened
Just the best thing that ever happened

You took the key out of the ignition
I could hear the rain on the windows
Right then and there I made up my mind to just go with it
Thinking what's the worst thing that could happen?
When the worst thing that could happen could be the best thing ever

We're not forever, you're not the one
We're not forever, you're not the one
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I could be the best thing ever

We're not happily ever after, we don't got what it takes
And we don't make plans 'cause we're never gonna last
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb
I shut the door and I don't look back
When something this good comes along
You're better off letting the first time be the last time
But really, what's the worst thing that could happen?
When the worst thing that could happen could be the best thing ever

We're not forever, you're not the one
We're not forever, you're not the one
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I could be the best thing ever

We're not happily ever after, we don't got what it takes
And we don't make plans 'cause we're never gonna last
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb

Ooh-ooh
We could be the best thing ever
Oh we, could be
We could be the best thing ever
The best, thing, ever
We could be the best thing ever, ooh, ooh-ooh
Forever
We could be the best thing ever
Oh, we
We're not forever
Could be
You're not the one
The best
You and I, we're a timebomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
We're not forever, you're not the one
You and I, we're a timebomb16Embed
