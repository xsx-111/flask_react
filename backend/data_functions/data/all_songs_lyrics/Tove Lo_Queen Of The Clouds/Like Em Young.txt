Like Em Young Lyrics
Hey boy, you're too young for me, but I
Don't care cause you're all I see
I like em young
I, I like em young
Eyes wide, oh you're so naive, thinking
No one knows better than me
I like em young
I, I like em young

People make me wonder
Age is just a number
That they don't think about
That's all I think about

I like 'em young
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
Young like me, with a mind so easy
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
Young like me, with a mind so easy
Hey girl, why you judgin' me, when your
Your guy's turning 53
I like 'em young
I, I like 'em young
I don't know what really gets you more, is it
That my guy's gonna live out yours
I like 'em young
I, I like 'em young

They say they don't care, but I
I can tell you're lying
'Cause we're all slowly dying
Trying to work it out
And all I think about

I like 'em young
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
Young like me, with a mind so easy
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
Young like me, with a mind so we see

Life! I live mine
Love! Not one kind
All is fair in love and war
My manners out the door, what do I need them for

I like 'em young
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
Young like me, with a mind so easy
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
I like 'em young
Young like me, with a mind so easy
I like 'em young7Embed
