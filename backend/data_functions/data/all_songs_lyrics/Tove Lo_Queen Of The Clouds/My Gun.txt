My Gun Lyrics
Heads turn, your body burn rip off your clothes for me
Make out, lash out keep dancing naked, feeling free
That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)

Last night, you were who you prefer, because of me
Wake up, messed up but you're still happy as can be
That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)

Do you think I'm easy?
Oooh-oooh
Boy, if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy
Oooh-oooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently
You're fine, you're mine, I'm the mistake you wanna make
Hey-ho, let's go, it's one more chance you gotta take
That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)

I'm ace in space and, oh, I know you want to fly
My tune, your moon jump on my cloud and we go high
That's my gun
That's my gun
That's my gun
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)
Mmmm (mmm-mmm)

Do you think I'm easy?
Oooh-oooh
Boy, if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy
Oooh-oooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently
Do it gently-y-y
Gently-y-y
Gently-y-y-y-y-y-y
Gently-y-y
Gently-y-y
Gently-y-y-y-y-y-y

That's my gun...

Do you think I'm easy?
Oooh-oooh
Boy, if you're gonna shoot me down
Do it gently
I'm not easy
Oooh-oooh
But go ahead and touch me now
Do it gently

Do it gently-y-y
Gently-y-y
Gently-y-y-y-y-y-y
Do it gently-y-y
Do it gently (for me)
Gently-y-y-y-y-y-y23Embed
