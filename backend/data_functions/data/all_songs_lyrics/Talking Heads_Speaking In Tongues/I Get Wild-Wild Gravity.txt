I Get Wild/Wild Gravity LyricsFooled around enough with numbers
Let's not be ourselves today
Is it my imagination?
Is it just someone's face?
Pleasantly out of proportion
It's hard to hold on to the ground
Now I didn't come to run, and this is everything
And gravity lets you down
And I get wild, wising up
I just can't let go
I get wild when I get ready
And I can hardly talk
Living lights, special lights
Yellow turns to blue
And I get wild, it's automatic
And I can hardly move
Go ahead and pull the curtains
Check to see if I'm still here
Let me lose my perspective
For something worth waiting for
Somewhere in South Carolina
And gravity don't mean a thing
And all around the world, each and everyone
Playing with a heart of steel
I get up, climbing out
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Beautiful, beautiful
Climbing up the wall
And I get by on automatic
No surprise at all
No one here can recognize you
Here is everything that you like
Feelings without explanations
Some things are hard to describe
The sound of a cigarette burning
A place there where everything spins
And the sound inside your mind is playing all the time
You're playing with a heart of steel
And I get wild, wising up
I just can't let go
I get wild when I get ready
I can hardly talk
Red and white, black to gold
Yellow turns to blue
And I get wild, it's automatic
And I can hardly move
And I get up, pushing up
How did I get home?
I'll survive the situation
Somebody shut the door
Shut the door, shut the door
Climbing up the wall
I get by-y-y-y on automatic
No surprise at all2Embed
