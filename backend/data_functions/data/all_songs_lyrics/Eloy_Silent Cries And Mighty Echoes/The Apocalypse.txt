The Apocalypse Lyrics
Now we gotta find out
That summer's evening's gone
We lived a daydream
Embracing home
Now we gotta wake up
Do we really think the world to be a
Creative oversight
Do we really think of senseless power
Odd forces will reveal - expose
The true essence of things
The reason of all
That has come to existence
No more silent cries will be able
To divide all our lonely inner nights
Fragrances of truth will call for us
Will we ever find out, what means: To be
Will we spread it out, the day we see
While we're exploring thousand mighty miles
In the lost, new-born
Only true kingdom

The counterfeit master of the world
Will call for his empire
He's the demon of illusion, sorrow
Darkness, mourning, and appearance
Forests will explode and on red wings
Spirits will ascend into the sky
Cities will catch fire and they'll carbonize
Silent, hot and dry
These corroding flames, they will seize
Surround us too
You is the victim - the dormant peace
We will burn
The air will be afraid of our mortal frame
Ethereal we are, the air we breathe
The storm that's stirring up all fire
I see, our life and limb will still
Not come to harm at the moment
That's the reason why we still think
Of everything to be alright
But our hidden souls already dwell
In seas of flames, red hot solution
How will we stand the fire tomorrow
