Pilot to Paradise LyricsWe contain a light - it's a twinkling fire
We're in possession of the golden key
Enormous ignorance surrounds the liar
But our spirit could really tell us prodigy
Will-o-the-wisps, so countless by our side
Try to make us stumble wanderin' and glide
Pilot to paradise - open our eyes
Pilot to paradise - make us wise
Milleniums ago, Adam swallowed the key
Now it dwells inside of our inner secrecy
To discover the guardian of harmony
We gotta immerse into our inner sea
It animates us, makes us wonder and act
And it only depends on us - as a natural fact
Whether it is far as the farthest star
Or it is near, so clean and so clear
So, let's look for the pilot
Leading through our night
At the tunnel's end - I am sure -
We'll discover the light
And I know there's someone to hold us tight
Man's damned to fight, love and truth
Will bring us the light
Open our eyes
Make us wise
