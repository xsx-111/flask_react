Child Migration LyricsYou are the bows from which
Your children as living arrows are sent forth
The archer sees his mark
Let your bending be without fear
You may give them your love, but not your thoughts
You may house their bodies, not their souls
They dwell in the house of tomorrow
Standing so far you'll never visit
For life goes not backward
Nor tarries with yesterday
Rain clouds of grey
Gather slow behind your eyes
Child of today
Don't forget to sail the skies
All things are in colours
Tunes of different age
Softer message from life's flower
Hills of long gone yesterdays
Distant hands in foreign lands
Rhythm remains unbroken
All unseen from where we stand
Mind vibration
Child Migration
Dreams are the blossom
Of your courage it is said
That truths long forgotten
Echoes lost within our heads
All things are in colours
Tunes of different age
Softer message from life's flower
Hills of long gone yesterdays
Distant hands in foreign lands
Rhythm remains unbroken
All unseen from where we stand
Mind vibration
Child Migration
Rain clouds of grey
Gather slow behind your eyes
Child of today
Don't forget to sail the skies
All things are in colours
Tunes of different age
Softer message from life's flower
Hills of long gone yesterdays
Distant hands in foreign lands
Rhythm remains unbroken
All unseen from where we stand
Mind vibration
