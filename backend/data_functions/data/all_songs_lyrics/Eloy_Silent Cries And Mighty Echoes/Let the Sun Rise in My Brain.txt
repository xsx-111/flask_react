Let the Sun Rise in My Brain LyricsThe words of wise man
The words of the wisdom
Who's red in your nets
The mindless direction
I come not to feel
Your ease and take weight
That's not with our gift
And feel not your grave

Now the gift is the sun
Let it rise in your brain
It's already began
To light up your face
They who always fought
With the sun at their begs
See only the shadows
A ghost but in black
That you's who's them facing
Or to the sun's power
Gift to life's found him
That'd be in the flower

Now the gift is the sun
Let it rise in your brain
It's already began
To light up your faceEmbed
