De Labore Solis LyricsI suffered thousand nights
My spirit cried, I lost my dream
My sense of life was locked
Beyond a secret silent stream
I was lost in the wasteland
Of dwelling in loneliness
Prepared to die, strange visions
Have been my only guests
But close to the end all my pleas were heard
By a dancing, singing, humming bird
Planet earth became motionless
I was embraced by devoted breath -
By a gold-princess
Inexpressable vibrations moved me
When I saw your eyes
No human word can ever tell
How deep I sympathized
My heart bled a tear so red
Full of joy and deliverance
Your spirit and mine
United at once in the cosmic dance
Nubien light, yes it shone so bright
Torture and fight disappeared that night
Jesus walked through our deserted heart
Nothing on Earth will ever tear us apart -
Nevermore
Now I dance at secret stream
With angelic elf at my side
Soft siren, you're my resurrection beam
Beloved face, you are my pride
While your light caresses my skin
We dwell in oceans of eternity
Your golden aura drones all sin
Forever we are - The blossom and the beeEmbed
