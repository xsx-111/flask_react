Master of Sensation LyricsIt is here, it is near, it's by our side
It is you, it is me, it's our guiding light
It is real, so unreal, it's the magic sign
Make us rise, makes us kneel on the edge of time
Here dwells the lord of creation
Here comes the master of sensation
We know pain, we know fear, we know loneliness
We're the grain of the year, lost in emptiness
'Til the spirit of the age gives the final sign
For us to rise, for us to kneel on the edge of time
Here dwells the lord of creation
Here comes the master of sensation
It is here, it is near, it's by our side
It is you, it is me, it's our guiding light
It is real, so unreal, it's the magic sign
Make us rise, makes us kneel on the edge of time
Here comes the lord of creation
Here comes the master of sensation
We know pain, we know fear, we know loneliness
We're the grain of the year, lost in emptiness
'Til the spirit of the age gives the final sign
For us to rise, for us to kneel on the edge of time
Here comes the lord of creation
Here comes the master of sensationEmbed
