Traditional Snowfall LyricsYou said I was your favorite
You are my favorite
I look young but I'm an old soul
Thank you
I want to rip out your lower back
And suck the air out of your lungs
And wrap my hands around your neck
And collapse your throat
And squish your thorax
And kiss you
The cuts in my head I can't feel
Friends are everywhere but I'm always leaving
Dismantling us with rumors
You have some fucking weird friends
Always taking photos and collecting numbers
What do they do with all that stuff?
I barely remember your face
But I think of you constantly
But each repetition becomes submission
Becomes more abstract
It's that time is destroying us
This job of mine
Is just depression and longing
I feel sick again
Fleshstone
Please don't admire me
I'm sick again
These fleshstones are bruised
The cuticles are white and sting
Moments have
Moments have consequences
The devil is waiting
Perpetual
Wrap my hands around your neck
And collapse your throat
And kiss you
The cuts in my head I can't feel
Friends are everywhere but I'm always leaving
You have some fucking weird friends
Always taking pictures
But there was nobody outside
But each repetition becomes submission
Becomes more abstract
True rumors
Better than betrayal
I said I wanted children but not now
They stopped taking the trash
Time is destroying usEmbed
