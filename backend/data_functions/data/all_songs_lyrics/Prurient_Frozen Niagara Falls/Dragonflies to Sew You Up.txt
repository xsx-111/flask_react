Dragonflies to Sew You Up LyricsIn August
You're overdressed
Plywood broken
Upon impact
The meat
Is thinly sliced
Car horns
Blare outside
In August
You're overdressed
Plywood broken
Upon impact
Key twists
Inside the lock
Kitchens are
Murderous places
Are you going mad in there?
Are you rotting in there?
Are you going mad in there?
Are you rotting in there?
Are you going mad in there?
Are you rotting in there?
Rough scarecrow
Caught on fire
I promise
I will
Only fuck prostitutesEmbed
