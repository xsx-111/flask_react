Every Relationship Earthrise LyricsThe bulb flashes
We are nude
In the most important
Photograph ever taken
Frozen in time
Before the mirror of the void
Glass eyes are breaking
Aperture opens
Shutter flaps
Flutter out light
Like blinding doves
Against the backdrop
Of the burnt carcass
Of the phoenix
Consciousness is rising
Heaven goes silent
Rain comes
Full of mystery and nostalgia
Lucifer
At work in the world
Beating down
On familiar corners
In summer we left New York penniless
I gathered stones from the vineyard
You took clay from the cliffs
I'll make a deal with you
The angel never attacks
You die first
Go towards the light
I'll make a deal with you
The angel never attacks
You die first
Go towards the lightEmbed
