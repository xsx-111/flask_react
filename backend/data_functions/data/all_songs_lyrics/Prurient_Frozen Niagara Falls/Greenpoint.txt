Greenpoint LyricsYou don't want to hurt anyone
You don't want to burden anyone
You just want to disappear
You're an honest-to-god alcoholic
Waking up again in Beth Israel
You left your mother's ashes in his apartment
Now he can't sleep at night
And wants me to take them
What should I do with them?
Should I scatter them in the East River?
I remember you talked about that;
"The East River isn't romantic anymore, you know
That's where the suicides go"
Or maybe that's what you wanted in the end
To be mixed together and reunited with your mother
Mercury in retrograde
Didn't you hear they found titanium in the ocean?
Around Sheepshead Bay where it's hard to breathe
They're wearing masks, some even take off their clothes
And cover their mouths with conch shells
Others say they're just doing it to get high
Wallowing through heavy waves, eroding
Your cheek bones suck in like jellyfish
Words slide in and out
Your teeth are yellow sponges
Your tongue, a ragged seaweed
Will you sink beneath the bridge
And leave a bloodless body like smashed masonry?Embed
