Falling Mask LyricsWhat do we do?
We invite pain
It's okay to be hungry
Hunger is normal
I'll meet you there
Burn off
What do we do?
We invite pain
It's okay to be hungry
Hunger is normal
I'll meet you there
What do we do?
We invite pain
It's okay to be hungry
Hunger is normal
I'll meet you there
What do we do?
We invite pain
It's okay to be hungry
Hunger is normal
I'll meet you there
What do we do?
We invite pain
It's okay to be hungry
Hunger is normal
I'll meet you thereEmbed
