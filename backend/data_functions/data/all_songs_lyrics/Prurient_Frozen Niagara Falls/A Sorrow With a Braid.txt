A Sorrow With a Braid LyricsWindows don't lie
Men are with you
Bridge lamps spy quietly outside
Open the camera
What you remember isn't the way it was
Red cross in the background
Of our pantheon
No one scatters to the sound
Of coins clattering across the marble floor
Windows don't lie
Men are with you
Bridge lamps spy quietly outside
Open the camera
What you remember isn't the way it was
Red cross in the background
Of our pantheon
No one scatters to the sound
Of coins clattering across the marble floor
Men are with you
Bridge lamps spy quietly outside
Open the camera
What you remember isn't the way it was
Red cross in the background
Of our pantheon
No one scatters to the sound
Of coins clattering across the marble floorEmbed
