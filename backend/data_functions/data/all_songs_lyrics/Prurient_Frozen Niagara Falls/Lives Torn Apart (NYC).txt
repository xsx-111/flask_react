Lives Torn Apart (NYC) LyricsOf you, nullified
The work of the cross too
What did I gain?
Like water over the backs of shellfish
Green memories of you
Inequity sets in
Words make the dinner cold
Apostles sit around the table
Apostles sit around the table
Forgive us for our deeds
Let us carry on your work
Amen
I put you in a tabernacle of clay
So I could recognize you
Under all the caliché
Monumental blue
Bound, needy
You turned water to wine
Never again
Bound, needy
You turned water to wine
You turned water into wine
Never again
Never again
You turned water into wine
Never again
I put you in a tabernacle of clay
So I could recognize you
Under all the caliché
Monumental blue
Green memories of you
Inequity sets in
Words make the dinner cold
Forgive us for our deeds
Let us carry on your work
Amen
I just want out of all this
Of you, nullified
The work of the cross too
What did I gain?
Like water over the backs of shellfish
You turned water into wine
Never again
Never again
You turned water into wine
Never again
I put you in a tabernacle of clay
So I could recognize you
Under all the caliché
Monumental blueEmbed
