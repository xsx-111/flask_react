Cocaine Daughter LyricsI discovered all the water has gone to your brain
Your womb is surprisingly dry
How many more children will it take
To fill your empty soul?
There's an anchor at the bottom of your pelvis
Like a bald-faced hornet trapped in amber
Let it go
I discovered all the water has gone to your brain
Your womb is surprisingly dry
How many more children will it take
To fill your empty soul?
There's an anchor at the bottom of your pelvis
Like a bald-faced hornet trapped in amber
Let it goEmbed
