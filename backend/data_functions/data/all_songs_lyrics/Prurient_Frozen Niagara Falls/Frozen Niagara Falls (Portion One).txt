Frozen Niagara Falls (Portion One) LyricsOut of mythology he come
Carbon son
The boat bearer
His musculoskeletal living face
Laughs and agonizes
The way out of hiddenness
He emerges
Warning me
The story has no end
There is a mystery in the bottom of this
Of these falls
Who is the gardener?
Who is it that grills the fish?
What are those appearances all about?
Coming through walls
Recognizing him
Not recognizing him
Hanging from a single chain
Incense fills the air
He releases me from claustrophobia
Behind the thurible smoke
He sings the evensong
And I disappear
He was not killed for who he was
But for who he might one day become
His head in the sands of obedience
Eucharist factory of cells
Mineral origin
Quartz and feldspar
He lifts his hands through crucifix
Behind the waterfall
People come apart
The legs of the spider disappearEmbed
