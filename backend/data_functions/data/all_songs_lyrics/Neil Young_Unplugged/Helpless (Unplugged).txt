Helpless (Unplugged) Lyrics
There is a town in North Ontario
With dream, comfort, memory to spare
And in my mind, I still need a place to go
All my changes were there

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes

Leave us
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

Well babe, can you hear me now?
The chains are locked and tied across my doors
Baby, baby sing with me somehow

Blue, blue windows behind the stars
Yellow moon on the rise
Big birds flying across the sky
Throwing shadows on our eyes
Leave us
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless
Helpless, helpless, help-helpless

Helpless, helpless, help-helplessEmbed
