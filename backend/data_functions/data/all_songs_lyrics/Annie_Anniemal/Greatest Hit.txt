Greatest Hit Lyrics
It's been a long time since I last saw your face
I know you still want me
Can't seem to fight the way that I feel
You're my greatest hit

We dance and groove in the disco lights
I want you alone with me tonight (me tonight)
Can I hold you, make you feel all right (feel all right)
Really want to stay here all the night (stay here all the night)

Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it
Thought I had to look all over for it
It's not easy but I have to admit
Come on baby, you're my greatest hit
Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it
Thought I had to look all over for it (yeah)
It's not easy but I have to admit
Come on baby, you're my greatest hit

Boy, you make me feel I'm your only star
(Boy, you make me feel like I'm your only star)
When we're together, darkness seems so far
(When we're together, darkness seems so far)
Take my hand and show me who you are
(Take my hand and show me who you are)
On a moonlight drive in a red old car
(On a moonlight drive in a red old car)
Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it
Thought I had to look all over for it
It's not easy but I have to admit
Come on baby, you're my greatest hit
Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it
Thought I had to look all over for it (yeah)
It's not easy but I have to admit
Come on baby, you're my greatest hit
Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it
Thought I had to look all over for it
It's not easy but I have to admit
Come on baby, you're my greatest hit
Keep it comin' baby, can you dig it
Thought I had to look all over for it (yeah)
It's not easy but I have to admit
Come on baby, you're my greatest hitEmbed
