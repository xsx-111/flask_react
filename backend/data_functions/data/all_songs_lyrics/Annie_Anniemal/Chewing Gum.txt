Chewing Gum Lyrics
Hey Annie, well look at you
Is that a new boy stuck on your shoe?
Come on Annie, how is it so?
You've always got a new bubble to blow

I'm gonna tell you how it's gonna get done
I'm just a girl that's only chewing for fun
You spit it out when all the flavor has gone
Wrap him round your finger like you're playing with gum

Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, a slip of the tongue
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no

Was there anything else?

Hey Annie, you used to be
The only girl to take it seriously
Come on Annie, tell us your trick
On how you keep on getting boys to stick
Okay I'll tell you why I never look back
It's my selection, it's my pick of the pack
Well hot dog, I'm a chewing machine
It makes me smile and it keeps my teeth clean

Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, a slip of the tongue
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum (I just wanna chew gum)
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, no you're not the one
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no

I don't want to settle down
I just wanna have fun
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna chew gum
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna have fun
I don't want to settle down
I just wanna chew gum
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, a slip of the tongue
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, you've got it all wrong
You think you're chocolate when you're chewing gum
Oh no, oh no, no you're not the one
You think you're chocolate but you're chewing gum
Oh no

La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la
Oh no!Embed
