My Best Friend Lyrics
My best friend, where are you?
Tell me, where are you?
Can't seem to find you anywhere
Will I ever meet you?

Thought I saw you last night smiling at me
Thought I heard your voice calling for me
Did I imagine it, was it a dream?
What do you look like, are you just like me?

My best friend, where are you?
Tell me where are you?
Can't seem to find you anywhere
Will I ever meet you?

Thought I saw you last night smiling at me
Thought I heard your voice calling for me
Day after day looking for something new
Closer and closer the ones that we knew

My best friend, where are you?
Tell me, where are you?
Can't seem to find you anywhere
Will I ever meet you?
Oh will I ever meet you?
Want you to know
You're not alone
You'll find a way
There's always someone out there
There's always someone out thereEmbed
