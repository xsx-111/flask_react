Heartbeat Lyrics
There was a time everybody was around
And I was dancing with you
We all went down to the party Friday night
And had a drink there or two
Oh, what a heat of a love and heartbeat
That's electricity
Majestic sound, 'round and 'round and 'round
I'm glad you're next to me

Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
Like the symphony
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
Like a melody, come see
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
Like the symphony
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
Like the melody, come see

Time after time, everybody came around
And I was dancing with you
Don't know your name, making me ashamed
To feel the way that I do
The lights went out, couldn't leave without you
It was a place to be
I won't forget, the greatest times I had
When I was dancing with you
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
We all want it now
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
We all want it now somehow
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
Like the symphony
Feel my heartbeat, drumming to the beat
Like a melody, come see
Feel my heartbeat, feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat now
Feel my heartbeat, feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat now, somehow

There was a time, everybody was around
And I was dancing with you
Don't know your name, making me ashamed
To feel the way that I do
The lights went out, couldn't leave without you
It was a place to be
I won't forget, greatest times I had
When I was dancing with youEmbed
