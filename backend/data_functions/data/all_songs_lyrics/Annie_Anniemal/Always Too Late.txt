Always Too Late Lyrics
Oh, I should have known
You're late again
No, no, no, no
And now I'm here
Will you appear?
I don't think so
Every single day
The same again
You keep me waiting
For somebody who don't care
At all

I don't wanna wanna
Be no primadonna
Tired standing waiting feeling like you never wanna
Say you're trying trying
Boy I know you're lying
Telling me we'll never be too late 'cause I was crying
You're so tricky tricky
Yeah now mister wicky
Now it's been an hour
Make me feeling freaky freaky
I can't take it take it
You stole my time and now it's...
Now it's too late
Now it's too late
Now it's too late
You didn't wait
What a mistake
Always too late
Ah...
Always too late
You didn't wait
What a mistake
Ah...
I can't take it
You can change it
Why you did so
Wrong?
Why you did it?
I can change it
Oh you did so
Wrong

Where are you today
You said you'd call
You said you'd meet me
10 o'clock, it was no shock
You were not there
Foolish, 'cause I am
But then again
I keep on waiting
For somebody who don't care
No no
I don't wanna wanna
Be no primadonna
Tired standing waiting feeling like you never wanna
Say you're trying trying
Boy I know you're lying
Telling me we'll never be too late 'cause I was crying
You're so tricky tricky
Yeah now mister wicky
Now it's been an hour
Make me feeling freaky freaky
I can't take it, take it
You stole my time and now it's...
Now it's too late
Now it's too late
Now it's too late

What do I gotta do?
Take some look or two
To get over you
You treat me like a fool
Careless is your rule
That's why you're so cruel

You didn't wait
What a mistake
Always too late
Ah...
Always too late
You didn't wait
What a mistake
Ah...
I can't take it (what do I gotta do?)
You can change it (take some look or two)
Why you did so (to get over you)
Wrong?
Why you did it? (every single day)
I can change it (the same, the same again)
Oh you did so (doo doo doo doo doo)
Wrong
Now it's too lateEmbed
