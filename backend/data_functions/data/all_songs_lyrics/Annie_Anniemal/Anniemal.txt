Anniemal Lyrics
She's a little girl
In a rich man's world
Everything she'll do
She'll do for you
He's a monster mash
Living on fame and cash
Badly spoiled
A living dead

Some might say just give it up
There's no more hope, no fair
Move the limits
Ooh wake up the Anniemal in you


Some might say just give it up
There's no more hope, no fair
Move the limits
Ooh wake up the Anniemal in you

Girl, can't you see?
Come on now, set him free
Try open up his eyes
And make him realize his misery
He do not care
Sittin' over there
Get up, stand up now
Wake up the Anniemal inside of you
I think it should be inside
