Dome Lyrics
(Wheezy Beatz)
Yeah, okay

I got like 5 million and 12 hundred thousand hoes (Racks)
They drippin' all over my motherfuckin' clothes (Sheesh)

Let's go off the dome (Woah), I can't make it home (No)
I fucked her, I boned her (Yeah), she leave an aroma (Skrt)
They calling my phone up (Brrt, brrt), my girl like "What's going on?" (Brrt, brrr)
She sucking, put me in a coma (Slurp), I nut on that fish on my sofa (Yeah)

Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What's brackin'? (Yeah)

Dickie suit, chucks
Flag hanging to the right
Put that young bitch in a bucket
Kid Cudi, fuck her all day and all night
Okay, I'm in this bitch with Lil Duke, Longway
You can be with me, you too, four way
Put that bitch off from my deuce, slow day
I'ma sell at least like two
Thugga Thugga, what it do?
Riding in the fast lane, I'm eluding (Skrrr)
All these drugs that we abusing (Drugs)
Addicting to winning, not losing
I'm in the kitchen just cooking (Cook it up)
Middle finger to a bookin' (Fuck 'em)
Fuck running off, fuck nigga I took it
Diamond so wet, I might need to douche it
Diamonds they shower, they shower me
Yes that lil' nigga I got with me
When it's war my niggas count on me
Beyonc√©, bitch, I'm a bumble bee
This the beehive, this my turf, bitch, you can't sting on me
Jingle bells, baby, you can ring on me
Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa

Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What's brackin'? (Yeah)

458 California 'Rari, I got that old money, call it Atari
Let's go off the dome, I trap by the Dome, keep a couple grams in my fifth pocket
Keep a pocket rocket on me, ain't no guessing if I'm gon' pop it
Got a lot of blood homies, and guess what? It ain't no stopping
Hop in the car and I'm wyling, I'm styling, I hop out and cuss out my driver (Skrrt, hop in)
Fuck nigga try me, no Eddie Bauer, I'ma pull up and make it rain, showers (Ahh, grah, grah)
I'm a lil' kid when it come to that pussy, I hop up like the Icy Tower (Hop up, yeah)
I would rather be a coyote than be a coward (Damn)
I creep right up on them, hit 'em with the AK, 7 in the morning (Pew, pew)
No Christmas Eve, caught him by surprise, he was still yawning (Ahh!)
I'm running the city, you riding in that loaner, I'm running with owners
I'm running with armor, I'm not even thinking I'm right off the dome
Let's go off the dome, I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa

Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeeeeeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
What's brackin'? (Yeah)43Embed
