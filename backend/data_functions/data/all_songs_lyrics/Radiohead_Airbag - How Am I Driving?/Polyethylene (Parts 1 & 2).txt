Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2) Lyrics

Go!

Tears of joy now scare ourselves
From all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
Round inside your place
If I get scared I'll just call you
And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel
I will always be-

-a'right
One, two, three
Four

So sell your suit and tie
And come and live with me
Leukemia schizophrenia
Polyethylene
There is no significant risk to your health
She used to be beautiful once as well
Plastic bag, middle class
Polyethylene
Decaffeinate, unleaded
Keep all surfaces clean
If you don't believe me, sell your soul
If you don't get into it, no one will

Oh
Obtain
