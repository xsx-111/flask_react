Palo Alto Lyrics
In a city of the future
It is difficult to concentrate
Meet the boss, meet the wife
Everybody's happy, everyone is made for life

In a city of the future
It is difficult to find a space
I'm too busy to see you
You're too busy to wait

But I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay, too

Every one of those days
When the sky's California blue
With a beautiful bombshell
I throw myself into my work
I'm too lazy
I've been kidding myself for so long
I'm okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
I'm okay, how are you?
I hope you're okay, too12Embed
