Pearly* Lyrics
How'd you get your
Teeth so pearly?
Dew-drop dentures
White-washed fences

She runs from the third world, pearly

Vanilla (Feel it crawl to me) milkshakes (Crawl back again)
From Hard Rock (Whatever you say) Caf√©s (Make it go away)
That's where (I feel it crawl to me) she got her (Crawls back again)
Sweet tooth (Make it go away) for white boys (Whatever you say)

She runs from the third world, pearly

Use me, darling use me
Darling use me, darling use me3Embed
