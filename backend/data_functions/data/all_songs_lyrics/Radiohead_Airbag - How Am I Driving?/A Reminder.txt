A Reminder Lyrics
Ukončete výstup a nástup, dveře se zavírají
Příští stanice, Jiřího z Poděbrad

If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this
Remind me that once I was free
Once I was cool, once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song

Knock me out, smash out my brains
If I take a chair, and start to talk shit

If I get old, remind me of this
The way that we kissed, and I really meant it
Whatever happens, if we're still speaking
Pick up the phone, play me this song12Embed
