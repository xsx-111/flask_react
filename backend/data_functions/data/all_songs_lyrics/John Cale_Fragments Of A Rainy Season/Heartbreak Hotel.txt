Heartbreak Hotel Lyrics
Since my baby left me
I found a new place to dwell
Down at the end of Lonely Street
Heartbreak Hotel

Oh feeling so lonely baby
Feeling so lonely baby
Feeling so lonely baby, I could die

The bell hop's tears keep flowin'
The desk clerk's dressed in black
They have been so long on Lonely Street
They never will get back

Oh, 'cause they're feeling so lonely baby
Feeling so lonely baby
Feeling so lonely baby, they could die

So if your baby leaves you
And you have a tale to tell
Why not just take a walk down Lonely Street
Straight to Heartbreak Hotel
Where you could be so lonely
And I could be so lonely
And we could be so lonely, we could dieEmbed
