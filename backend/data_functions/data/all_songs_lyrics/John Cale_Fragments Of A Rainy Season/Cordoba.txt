Cordoba LyricsA man was sleeping under a tree
He wrote to me from Cordoba
After the theatre, we went to his house
He's a very generous Cordoban
We waited at the door, but he didn't come
According to his father, he's very ill
There was a long line of cars in front of me
I came as soon as I could
I left without paying, a suitcase under my arm
I won't see you until Sunday
I'll come as soon as I can
I'll meet you alone in the shoe shop near the bakery
By the two-storey house, very pretty, like a villa
The lift stops between two floors
You start to walk towards the station
I walk towards the bus
We'll have to wait at the station
Leave the parcel on the top deck
You start to walk towards the station
(repeats)
I'll walk towards the bus
You walk towards the stationEmbed
