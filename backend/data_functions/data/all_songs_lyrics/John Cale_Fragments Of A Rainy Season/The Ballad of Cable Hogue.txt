The Ballad of Cable Hogue LyricsTraffic moving slowly Monday morning
Money talks, people hoping
Cable Hogue where've you been
Cable Hogue where've you been
Something inside me tells me you won't show
I know you're carrying heat
What for God only knows
Cable why'd you leave me
Cable Hogue where've you been
I just wanted to say goodbye
So much to say goodbye
Wanted to say goodbye to all my friends in case I die
Need to go to Georgia, got a bank to blow
Living ain't easy, but it's much harder when it's slow
Cable wish you were with me now
Cable Hogue where've you been
You know they're looking for you down south
And all you've got to do is go down there
And open your big fat mouth
Cable you can't leave me here like this
Cable please...Embed
