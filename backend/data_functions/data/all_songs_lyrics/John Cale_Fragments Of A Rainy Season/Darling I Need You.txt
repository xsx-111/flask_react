Darling I Need You Lyrics
Woke up early this morning
Something wrong inside my head
Took a look around for breakfast
First thing I see is you're not there

Oh where were you, where were you?
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you, where were you
When I needed you to see me through?

Oh something wrong, now what's gone wrong here
Looked in the mirror, broken white
Lucky to be alive and kicking
Kicking a lot of life around here

But where were you, ah where were you?
Yeah where were you when I needed you?
Where were you, where were you
When I needed you to see me through?

Ah, 'cause darling darling darling I need you
Yeah darling darling darling I do
Darling darling darling I need you
Yes you know I do

Shefton brought me the message
Said you got out of Galveston
Church of Christ Jesus, Kentucky
Rattlesnakes and strychnine and prayer

So, where were you, where were you?
Yeah where were you when I needed you?
Where were you, where were you
When I needed you to see me through?

Oh darling darling darling I need you
'Cause darling darling darling I do
Oh darling darling darling I need you
Yes you know I do
Darling darling darling I need you
Yeah darling darling darling I do
Oh oh darling darling darling I need you
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I do
Oh darling darling darling I need you
Darling, darling, darling, darlingEmbed
