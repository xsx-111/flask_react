Everybody Needs Love LyricsSay you wanna be loved?
But you won't let me love ya
Say you want someone to trust in you?
Can't you see that's what I'm trying to do
I know you've been hurt before
And you're afraid to try love once more
Without love by your side, you're only half alive (Doo doo doo)
Cause everybody needs love, oh yeah
Everybody needs love
Say you wanna be kissed? (Wanna be kissed)
But you won't let me kiss you (No no no)
Say you wanna be missed?
Can't you see how my arms are missing you
It's got you hurtin' so inside...
That now from love you're trying to hide
Without love by your side - without love you can't survive (Doo doo doo)
Cause everybody needs love, oh yeah
Everybody needs love, yeah yeah yeah
Eww ewww You need love
And I need love
Everybody needs love
So you wake up in the morning (Wake up in the morning)
Feeling all empty inside (Yeah yeah yeah)
I'll bet you I know what your trouble is...
You need someone like me by your side
And I know you've been hurt before
But don't be afraid to try love once more
Cause without love you'll find you'll have no peace of mind (Doo doo doo)
Cause everybody needs love, oh yeah
Everybody needs love - Hey
You need love (yeah)
I need love (yeah)
Everybody needs love, love
Now now now now
You need love (yeah)
I need love (yeah)
Everybody needs love
Hey hey hey
You need love (yeah)
I need love (yeah)
Everybody needs love
Now now now now
You need love (yeah)
I need love (yeah)
Everybody needs loveEmbed
