Bluff LyricsI'm calling your bluff
There's no way that you really leavin'
One word, and you on the defense
I'm calling because
You already taken a beating
And all that you need is
Just a bit of this love
There you go
Holding onto something
I'm gonna prove you wrong
I'm gonna prove you wrong
Here we go
Jumping in the deep end
I'm gonna prove you wrong
I'm gonna prove you wrong
I'm calling your bluff
I'm calling your bluff2Embed
