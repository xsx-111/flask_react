Altadena Lyrics
Now that you're up, my love
Let me remind you
Those dreams you have
Before they all came true

Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you
Nothing to be said or done
There's a place for everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you

In the middle of your week
When you get your head down
I hope you think of me
And how I moved it around
Wrote a thousand poems today
Still, I got nothing to say
Except I'll never forget
All it took

Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you
Nothing to be said or done
There's a place for everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you
Where can, where can I go, go?
It's taking, taking a hold
And now I think I know
That I don't know nothing at all

Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you
Nothing to be said or done
There's a place for everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you, babe

Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you
Nothing to be said or done
There's a place for everyone
Let me remind you

Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you, let me remind you
Nothing to be said or done
There's a place for everyone
Let me remind you
Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you (There's a place)
Nothing to be said or done
There's a place for everyone
Let me remind you

Nothing to be said or done
It's not just me, it's everyone
Let me remind you...3Embed
