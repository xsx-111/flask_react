Blue Light Lyrics
Falling, falling
Falling, falling

Although I've hardened
Darling, my guard is down
When I know you're around
Only one that fit the crown

When I need love I run to you
You're the only one I want, want you now
Silly shit we go through

I'm on my way right now
Promise I won't be long
Baby, keep the blue light on
My chains, they come falling down, down
My chains, they come falling down
My chains, they come falling

I'm begging your pardon
Told myself I needed time
But my discipline is slipping
Head first
'Cause, baby, with your love around
I could save the world
For better now
I want you where you are right now

I'm on my way right now
Promise I won't be long
Baby, keep the blue light on
Chains, they come falling down

I'm on my way right now
Promise I won't be long
Baby, keep the blue light on
My chains, they come falling down
My chains, they come falling down
My chains, they come falling
My chains, they come falling down
It's all falling down
My chains, they come falling down

Gold in the offering
Darling, my guard is down
When I know you're around
Only one that fit the...
