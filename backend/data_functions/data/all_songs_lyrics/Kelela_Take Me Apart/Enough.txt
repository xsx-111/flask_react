Enough Lyrics
Hitting me up while you're sitting by yourself
Taking me up so I still endure
When the high dies I fall apart
And you're sorry, I see it in your eyes

But it's not enough
It's not enough right now
Hold her hand
You've had enough
I've had enough right now
Hold her hand
Will your love ruin my heart?

Can't you see, love, that I'm standing by myself?
Boy, you and I, we miss each other now
I'm so tired but I can't ignore

But it's not enough
It's not enough right now
You've had enough
I've had enough right now
Hold her hand
Boy, you always manage to change my mind
Boy, you always manage to change my mind
Hoping that it wasn't just a waste of time
Hoping that it wasn't just a waste of time
Said it once before, you'll leave her behind
Said you'll leave her behind
Probably telling her the same damn thing
At the same damn time

But it's not enough
It's not enough right now
You've had enough
I've had enough right now
Hold her hand
Will your love ruin my heart?
Will your love ruin my heart?
Will your love ruin my heart?4Embed
