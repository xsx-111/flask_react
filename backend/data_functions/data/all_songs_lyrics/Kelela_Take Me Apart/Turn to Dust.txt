Turn to Dust Lyrics
First off, I'm not new to this
Is it a consequence of time? Do I let go, do I grind?
Everything is problematic, I'm trying my best
I know what's inside, hot water under ice

Hey, you're moving slow
But I can't shake you off
This something for nothing
What can I show for it?
You got my time and my body, might get my soul
The thing on my mind that's taking its toll
I'm tired of trying
I'm 'bout to walk out the door

One look at you and I turn to dust
One look at you and I turn to dust
One look at you and I turn to dust
To dust, to dust, I turn to dust

Dust, dust, dust, dust
Dust, dust, dust, dust
Dust, dust, dust, dust
Dust, dust, dust, dust
That other thing is you keep holding back
All the light you keep brings out the darkness in me
You're so bottled up inside
Spill it out before we divide

Hey, you're moving slow
But I can't shake you off
This something for nothing
What can I show for it?
You got my time and my body, might get my soul
The thing on my mind that's taking its toll
I'm tired of trying, I got my hand on the door
And I can't take it, I'm walking out the door

I turn to dust
One look at you and I turn to dust
I turn to dust

Boy, you're moving slow
But I can't shake you off
I can't shake you off
It's raining inside, you're in your head
Late for my friends, one more layer to shed
Now they asking where I am, I wanna say goodbye
But one look at you and I turn to dust
One look at you and I turn to dust
One look at you and, and I turn to dust
To dust, to dust, I turn to dust4Embed
