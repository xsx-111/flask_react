Truth or Dare Lyrics
T-shirt off, tease me
It's getting dark, stay or leave
It's round 3, would you tell me your fantasy?
Don't you take it back or lie to me
I can tell that you wanna take
My body, my body, baby, tonight, yeah

Truth or dare
We both know why we're playing
Truth or dare
K-k-keep us in this moment
Truth or dare
You're in a tough position, I put you there
Truth or dare

Nothing on, just music, music, music
It's your turn to be daring
So turned on like I've never been touched before
Could you lick it back? I need more
I'mma raise my hands, you adore
My body, my body, baby, tonight, yeah

Truth or dare
We both know how we're playing
Truth or dare
K-k-keep us in this moment
Truth or dare
You're in a tough position, I put you
Or dare
You're in a tough position, I put you
Or dare
You're in a tough position, I put you there
Truth or
Here comes another
Dare you to go under
You're my favorite lover
Take your time and get it right
Here comes another
Dare you to go under
You're my favorite lover
Take your time and get it right

Truth or dare
Baby, we're thinking of love
From a secret, secret place
Truth or dare
It's a game of truth or
It's a game of truth or dare
A game of truth or
Game of truth or dare
It's a
It's my turn now
Game of truth or

You have to do exactly what I say
Truth or, truth or dare
No, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, there's no turning back now
Truth or
