Better Lyrics
We got back, it's not the same
And I'm afraid to say it out loud
Then you replied, "Could I have done something?"
You've got some nerve asking me now
Though I'm in love with it, I will amputate
I care enough not to keep you around
Is it rough for you? I can't bear the way
You look at me when I let you down

Tell me, is this how it goes when you let someone know
That they gave it their best but you still gotta roll?
Remember, I told you that we would be closer
If we took some time further apart

Didn't it make you better?
Aren't we better now?
I know it made me better
Aren't we better now?

Been six months, it's my birthday
And it feels good to hear your voice
We took a ride through the hills
Replayed all of the reasons I made that choice
We go around the bend only to reveal
What we couldn't see before
We're better off as friends, baby, you can't stay
We both know I'm not there anymore
Tell me, is this how it goes when you let someone know
That it's all for the best? We cut and we grow
Remember, I told you that we would be closer
If we took some time further apart

Didn't it make you better?
Aren't we better now?
I know it made me better
Aren't we better now...

That we been around the block once or twice?
Breaking down  in the middle of the night, no ride
And then somehow we fixed it
Glad we're talking when we used to fight
Still bail me out when my money ain't right, oh no
And now we're riding through the night
All the things I had to keep at bay
Stopped you but I could've waited all day, all night
Could've been forever
Told you that I needed time to hate
But there's a lot to think about while you wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Tell me one more time
Didn't it make you better?
Aren't we better now?
I know it made me better
Aren't we better now?

No, no, no, no, no, no, no1Embed
