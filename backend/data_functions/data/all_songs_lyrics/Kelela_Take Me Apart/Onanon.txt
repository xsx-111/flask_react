Onanon Lyrics
We was cool and now you're talking back at me
Like there's something wrong
Open up my mind and show me something new
Or I'm gon' fight with you

Fight off the tears, I got the taste down
The type when your life is deep into the ground
The only one I'm thinking of, you know this
So why you wanna fight now?
If you know I'm giving my best
Then fill in the rest and slow your pace down
The tears try to fall, I won't let them down

A promise we made to do it our way
We're not in a race, you're running away
Tomorrow we break, it's like an earthquake
And then we go 'round
Got nothin' to say, you open my heart
We leave it behind just to bring it on back
It's not a breakup, it's just a breakdown
We're spinning around

Ain't nothing wrong
We go on and on and on
On and on and on and on
There's nothing wrong
We go on and on and on
We go on and on
Don't know why I'm always singing something blue
When there's nothing wrong
It doesn't help I watch your every single move
Like I wanna fight with you

Fight off the tears, I got the taste down
The type when your life is deep into the ground
The only one I'm thinking of, you know this
So why you wanna fight now?
If you know I'm giving my best
Then fill in the rest and slow your pace down
The tears try to fall, I won't let them down

A promise we made to do it our way
We're not in the race, you're running away
Tomorrow we break, it's like an earthquake
And then we go 'round
Got nothin' to say, you open my heart
We leave it behind just to bring it all back
It's not a breakup, it's just a breakdown
We're spinning around

Ain't nothing wrong
We go on and on and on
On and on and on and on
When I know, and I know, and I know we argue all the time
We go on and on and on
We go on and on
You don't know why you always react
I don't know why I always fight back
There's a second in time when the shit hits the fan
We get thrown and lose track
You don't know why you always react
I don't know why I always fight back
We go on and on and on

And on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
There's nothing wrong
And on and on and on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
There's nothing
We go, go on and on
We go on and on and on
There's nothing
We go on and on
We go, we go on and on and on
There's nothing
We go, we go on and on
We go on and on and on
There's nothing wrong
There's nothing wrong
Nothing wrong
Nothing wrong6Embed
