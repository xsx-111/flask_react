Jupiter LyricsIt's hard to hear
You're in and out
I can tell you're running
Oh, it never ends
Better off or better out?
Body lover or wrecker?
There's a lot still to live for
There's a lot going on, let it out
Find a light in a cold color
Finding me, finding a bed of roses
I think I know me now
I think I know
I think I, I think I know
I think I, I think I know3Embed
