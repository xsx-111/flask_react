S.O.S. LyricsI’m feeling a lot of pressure
Only you can help me out
Was tryna make it easy
Now your finger's in my mouth
So, I lay and wait
I don’t take it lightly
That you’re far away
But I need it nightly
When I’m full I take another
Never been so greedy with a lover
Will you come around
Before it’s too late?
I could touch myself, bae
But it’s not the same
If you could stop and help me out
But I’ll take it slowly
There’s no use in rushing
The more I wait, the more I build up
So, you better put it down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down1Embed
