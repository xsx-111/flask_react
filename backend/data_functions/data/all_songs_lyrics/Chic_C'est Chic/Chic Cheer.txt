Chic Cheer LyricsChic (repeat)
Everybody strut
Chic (repeat)
Everybody strut
Come on everybody
Give me a C C
Give me an H H
Give me an I I
Give me a C C
If your friends are chic
Consider yourself unique
Just one favour we ask
We hope it's not too hard a task
If you don't mind, would you please
Get up off of your seat and repeat
Chic
