Sometimes You Win LyricsTake a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
And don't you know that life is just a game
That you play, win or lose, it's all the same
Open your eyes, you better
Look before you leap, take heed
And watch the signs of life
Don't play the cheat
The wheel of fortune just may take its toll
Be a gambler, play your ace in the hole
You'll never know
You might wind up way ahead
Shoot your best shot
Take a little chance before you're dead
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose
Here you come with that smile on your face
I assume that even time cannot erase
Confidence is the most important thing you need
To look inside yourself, you can succeed
All the time you better watch out for the trap
Be careful or first time out
You might roll crap
One mistake and life comes tumblin' down
All around, like galloping dominoes
That's how it goes
Take a little chance
It don't mean nothing
Sometimes you win, sometimes you loseEmbed
