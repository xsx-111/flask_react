Where the Giants Roam / Field of the Nephilim Lyrics
I can feel your heart around me
Can you feel it all 'round you?
Nothing in this world I know
Can you tell me who you are?

Fantasy of life all around
Way too real, how it feels
I'll ask the Lord to keep my soul
Lay my head down to rest

Where the giants roam
Down in your mind
Somewhere between space and time
Watching, waiting for their time5Embed
