Beautiful Bluebird Lyrics
One morning when I was riding in my old pickup truck
A beautiful bluebird came flying down
My eyes caught the color, as it lead me down the road
Dipping and bobbing in the sun

Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
Beautiful bluebird, see how she flies
Looks like she's always going home

I've never seen that blue before, except in one place
And she's not here with me right now
And just like a lover, I watched her fly away
And that's what I remember now


If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying back to you
If heaven had a window where the sun came shining through
Like a beautiful bluebird, I'd come flying home to youEmbed
