No Hidden Path Lyrics
Sometimes when I go walking among the tall trees
I feel the light coming down on me
Under moon, under sun, I feel the chosen one
Through the mist, come walking here with me
And the leaves on the ground make a rustling sound
In the wind now blowing in my face
It's that cool wind again, I feel my missing friend
Whose counsel I can never replace

Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
(Show me the way)
No more darkness, no more wasted time
(Show me the way)
Let me stay here with this heart of mine
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path
No hidden path

How you change, how you change
And how you rearrange, everything that touches me
Now you're her, now you're her
She's sleeping here with me, everything that touches me
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sand wash over you
Giving all that you can give
Will the Northern lights still play as we walk our distant days?
Giving all that we can give
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
Show me the way
And I'll follow you today
(Show me the way)
There's a cold wind blowing through my mind
(Show me the way)
But I'm holding on to the threads of time
And with you I feel no hidden path
No hidden path, no hidden path, no hidden path

Will the Northern lights still play as we walk our distant days?
Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sun wash over you

Ocean sky, sea of blue, let the sun wash over youEmbed
