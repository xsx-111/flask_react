The Believer Lyrics
I'm just a believer, babe
And those dreams of mine
You see, they just keep on coming
In a long, long line
Oh yeah, I'm a believer
Like that songbird singing
Whether it's red or blue
Just like those church bells ringing
I'm keeping my faith in you

(I believe in you)
Oh yeah, I'm a believer
(I believe in you)
Oh yeah, I believe in you

And though the seas may rise
Until they do
I keep doing the things I'm doing
And believe in you
I'm making the change
I'm keeping my faith in you

Sure is a windy road
That I walk with you
Look how the trees are bending
Their leaves are falling too


I remember my mama saying
I want to be
On this windy road
For eternity
I'm making the change
I'm keeping my faith in you


Oh yeah, I'm the believer
Oh yeahEmbed
