Spirit Road Lyrics
There's a long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
When you're alone, you cheat yourself
You paint yourself in a dark, dark place
You get your shoes and get your hat
Get out of here, while you still can
There's nothing right that you can say
You keep on talking anyway
And everyone seems to turn on you
There's nothing right that you can ever do

Spirit road
Spirit road
Spirit road
Spirit road

Now you're on that long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you had to find
You're headed home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
You stop to eat, you start to drink
But you don't stop and you don't think
You lost your keys, you're on your knees
You're on your back and looking up in the trees
And the night swirls for a little girl
A speck of dust in the giant world
There's a spirit road that you must find
A long highway in your mind

There's a long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
Don't feed that snake that turns on you
You starve it out, that's what you do
And it makes you lie, it makes you cheat
It steals your shoes and cuts your feet
The snake keeps feeding through the night
You lose your soul without a fight
There's nothing right that you can say
You keep on talking anyway
There's a long highway in your mind
(Spirit road, spirit road)
The spirit road that you must find
(Spirit road)
Peace again, peace again
(Spirit road)
A long highway in your mind
The spirit road that you must find
To get you home to peace again
Where you belong my love lost friend
When you're alone, you cheat yourself
You paint yourself in a dark, dark place
Get your hat, get your shoes
Get out of here while you can still choose
