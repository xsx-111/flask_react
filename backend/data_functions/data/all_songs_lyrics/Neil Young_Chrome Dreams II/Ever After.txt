Ever After Lyrics
When you hear that rooster crowing
In the dawn, in the dawn
There's really no way of knowing
What goes on, what goes on
The world is full of questions
Some are answered, some are not
The only faith you're keeping
Is the faith that you still got
I love the sound of laughter
And music in the air
And in the ever after
I know it's always there
A man had many boxes
And he liked them quite a lot
But they would not be opened
Because the value would be shot
Sometimes when I go walking
In the trees, in the trees
That's where I do my praying
In the trees, in the trees
The world is full of answers
Some are right, some are wrong
The one that I believe in
Is a wish in a song
I love to see you smiling
And hear your voice so fair
And in the ever after
I know you're always thereEmbed
