Dirty Old Man Lyrics
I'm a dirty old man
I do what I can
Trying to make a living
I'm a dirty old man

I like to get hammered
On Friday night
Sometimes I can't wait
So Monday's alright
It's a battle with the bottle
I'll win it alright
But I lost another round
In the bar last night


Yeah, I'm going to get fired
For drinking on the job
Got caught with the boss' wife
In the parking lot
I'm going to get killed
For doing this again
But I just can't help it
It's under my skin
I'm a dirty old man
I do what I can
I'm going to get hammered
And do it again


Got a bag of frozen peas
I use on my knees
I injured from begging
And trying to please
If you believe that
I'm losing my fat
Got a workout program
And a new rubber mat

I'm a dirty old man

It's a battle with the bottle
I'll win it alright
But I lost another round
In the bar last night
I'm a dirty old manEmbed
