Sunlight Lyrics
I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
But whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight, oh
But it is sunlight

All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that’s born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
And at last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight, oh sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight, sunlight

Oh, all these colors fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight
Oh, all these colors fade for you only
Hold me, carry me slowly, my sunlight

Each day, you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I’d meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight

Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight4Embed
