Dinner & Diatribes Lyrics
Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eyes
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer Hell if you’d tell me
What you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me, ah

That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar I am, upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what you'd do to me tonight
Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That’s the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love
(That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
Ah, oh-oh-oh, ah
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of19Embed
