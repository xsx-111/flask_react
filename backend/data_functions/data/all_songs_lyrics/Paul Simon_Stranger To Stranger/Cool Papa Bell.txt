Cool Papa Bell LyricsIt turns out to be
A great thing for me
I don't worry (and)
I don't think (because)
It's not my job to worry or to think
Not me
I'm more like
Every day I'm here, I'm grateful
And that's the gist of it
Now you may call that a bogus, bullshit
New-Age point of view
But check out my tattoo
Says 'Wall-to-Wall Fun'
Does everyone know everyone?
Mr. Wall-to-Wall Fun
Meet Dr. Well, Well, Well
And Cool Papa Bell
The fastest man on Earth did dwell
As Cool Papa Bell
Motherfucker!
Ugly word!
Ubiquitous and often heard
As a substitute for someone's Christian name
And I think yeah, the word is ugly, all the same
Ugly got a case to make
It's not like every rodent gets a birthday cake
No, it's, 'You're a chipmunk, how cute is that?'
But you, you motherfucker, are a filthy rat!
And well, well, well
Is it true, Papa Bell?
That the beauties go to heaven
And the ugly go to hell
Cool Papa Bell?
(Let the tubas cry!)
Have you all heard the news?
'Heaven Finally Found!'
Okay, it's six trillion light years away
But we're all gonna get there someday
Yes, we're all gonna get there one day
(Ah, we all gon-na, get, we all gonna get, we...)
But—but not you
You stay and explain
The suffering and the pain you caused
The thrill you feel when evil dreams come true
And check out my tattoo
It says 'Wall-to-Wall Fun'
Does everyone know everyone?
Mr. Wall-to-Wall Fun
Meet Dr. Well, Well, Well
And Cool Papa Bell
The fastest man on Earth did dwell
As Cool Papa Bell
And you’re never gonna stop him
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop him
I’m never gonna stop
You never gonna
Never gonna stop
Never gonna stop
No, no, you
Ah, you're never gonna stop, you're never gonna stop
