The Werewolf LyricsMilwaukee man led a fairly decent life
Made a fairly decent living, had a fairly decent wife
She killed him, a sushi knife
Now they're shopping for a fairly decent afterlife
The werewolf is coming
The fact is most obits are mixed reviews
Life is a lottery, a lotta people lose
And the winners, the grinners with money-colored eyes
Eat all the nuggets, then they order extra fries
The werewolf is coming. (Extra fries)
The werewolf is coming. The werewolf's coming, the werewolf's coming, yes, the werewolf is coming
I hear her howling, prowling on the hills
The werewolf's coming, Bill
Ignorance and arrogance, a national debate
Put the fight in Vegas, that's a billion dollar gate
Revenues: pay per views, it should be pretty healthy
The usual productions, and it all goes to the wealthy
Still, the werewolf's coming
Eh, the werewolf's coming
I'm not complaining, just the opposite my friend
I know it's raining, but we're coming to the end
Of the world, of the lyin' and the spyin' through
Oh, you don't know me?
OK, I don't know you, too
The werewolf's coming. Werewolf's coming up
The werewolf's coming, and the The werewolf's coming
The werewolf is coming, too
I hear her howling, prowling on the hills
The werewolf's coming Bill
You better stock up on water, canned goods off the shelves
And loot some for the old folks who can't loot for themselves
The doorbell's ringing, could be the elves
But it's probably the werewolf. It's quarter to twelve
And when it's midnight, and the wolf bites
It's a full moon, she really got the appetite
The werewolf's coming
(The werewolf, the werewolf)
The werewolf's coming
(The werewolf, the werewolf)3Embed
