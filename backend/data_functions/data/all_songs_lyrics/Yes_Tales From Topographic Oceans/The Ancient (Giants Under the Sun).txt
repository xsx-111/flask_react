The Ancient (Giants Under the Sun) LyricsAs one with the knowledge and magic of the source
Attuned to the majesty of music
They marched as one with the Earth
Sol, Dhoop
Sun
Ilios
Naytheet
Ah Kin
Saule
Tonatiuh
Qurax
Gunes, Grian
Surie
Ir
Samse
So the flowering creativity of life
Wove its web face to face with the shallow
And their gods sought out and conquered
Ah Kin
Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn
Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white
Does a shadow come between us in the winter
Is the movement really light
And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the stories that they had heard about
Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
Along without you, along without you
Where does reason stop and killing just take over
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead
Are there many more in comfort understanding
Is the movement in the head
And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the story that they had heard about
Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
Along without you, along without youEmbed
