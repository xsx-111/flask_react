The Revealing Science of God (Dance of the Dawn) LyricsDawn of a light lying between
The silence and sold sources
Chased amid fusions of wonder
In moments hardly seen forgotten
Coloured in pastures of chance
Dancing leaves cast spells of challenge
Amused but real in thought
We fled from the sea whole
Dawn of thought transferred through moments
Of days undersearching earth
Revealing corridors of time provoking memories
Disjointed but with purpose
Craving penetrations offer links
With the self instructor's sharp
And tender love
As we took to the air
A picture of distance
Dawn of our power we amuse
Redescending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as
To reveal passion chasing
Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean
Dawn of love sent within us
Colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age
As the links span our endless caresses
For the freedom of life everlasting
Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine
Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array, I ventured to see
As the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well?
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this moment, moment
The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun
And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well?
Did we forget what happened surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this, moment, moment
Moment
Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons
They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you
Getting over overhanging trees, let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home
Getting over wars we do not mean or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion
Clearly to be home
They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone to tell you
And I just can't believe our song will leave you
Skyline teacher, warland seeker
Send out poison, cast iron leader
And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past
Young Christians see it from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past
They move fast, they tell me
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone, to tell you
A course towards a universal season
Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home
Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home
We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well?
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this moment, moment
Past present movers, moments we'll posses the future
But only through him we know, send flowered rainbows
A piece apart chased flowers of the dark and light
Of songs to follow and show all we feel for
And know of cast round
You seekers of the truth
Accepting that reasons will relive
And breathe and hope
And chase and love
For you and you and you3Embed
