Tough Guys LyricsShe doesn't like the tough guys
They think that they can do anything they please
But they're gonna get a surprise
When she brings them to their knees
'Cause she doesn't like the rough guys
They think that they can have any girl they choose
They've got tricks, but my baby's got wise
So in case you haven't heard the news
She doesn't like the tough guys
She doesn't like the rough guys
So find someone your own size
'Cause she's not afraid of you
She doesn't like the tough guys
She says that they've got brains all where they sit
They think they're full of fire
She thinks they're full of shit
'Cause she doesn't like the tough guys
She doesn't like the rough guys
She's gonna call your bluff, guys
And you better believe it's true
She don't like you, no
Ooh, she doesn't like the tough guys
They think that they can do anything they please
But they're gonna get a surprise
When she brings them to their knees
'Cause she doesn't like the rough guys
They act like they can have any girl they choose
They've got tricks, but my baby's got wise
So in case you haven't heard the news
She doesn't like the tough guys
She doesn't like the rough guys
So find someone you own size
'Cause she's not afraid of you
She doesn't like the rough guys
She says she's heard enough lies
She's gonna call your bluff, guys
And you better believe it's true
Tough guys
Tough guys
Ooh, tough guys (you might as well forget her)
Tough guys (ooh, you know, you know she loves me better)
Tough guys
