I Wish You Were There Lyrics
I know a place where you can go
When you're flyin' high or layin' low
And I've got the time
I've got plenty to spare
Yes, I've got the time, and I've got the place
I just wish you were there

I've got the will (yeah) to have you around
Whether you're up, or whether you're down
And I know the way
To make you shine (oooh, yeah)
I've got the will, and I've got the way
I wish you were mine

Oooh, I know a place where you can go
When you're flyin' high or layin' low
And I've got the time (I've got the time)
I've got plenty to spare
Well I've got the time, and I've got the place
I wish you were there (Wish you were there)
Oh, I've got the time, and I've got the place
I wish you were there
Oooh, I wish you were there
I wish you were there
Oooh, I wish you were thereEmbed
