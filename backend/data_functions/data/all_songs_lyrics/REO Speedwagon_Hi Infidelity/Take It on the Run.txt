Take It on the Run Lyrics
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another
You been messin' around

They say you got a boyfriend
You're out late every weekend
They're talkin' about you
And it's bringin' me down

But I know the neighborhood
And talk is cheap when the story is good
And the tales grow taller on down the line

But I'm telling you, babe
That I don't think it's true, babe
And even if it is keep this in mind

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun
So you take it on the run
You're thinking up your white lies
You're puttin' on your bedroom eyes
You say you're coming home
But you won't say when

But I can feel it comin'
If you leave tonight keep runnin'
And you need never look back again

You take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun
So you take it on the run

2:04 - 2:53

Take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun
So you take it on the run
Take it on the run baby
If that's the way you want it baby
Then I don't want you around
I don't believe it
Not for a minute
You're under the gun
So you take it on the run

Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from a friend who
Heard it from another
You been messin' around10Embed
