Legal Kill LyricsI only know what I believe
The rest seems so absurd to me
I close my eyes so I can't see
But the picture just gets clearer everyday
I read somewhere to learn is to remember
And I've learned we all forgot
There was peace in her before
But that was yesterday
But I can see the beauty that is here for me
The chance to live and walk free
From a legal kill
I know your side so very well
It makes no sense that I can tell
The smell of hell is what I smell
And you hand it out with handshakes everyday
I have trouble with the persons, with the signs
But I feel the need to make my own
Yes there's two ways to be
And truth does not depend on me
But I can feel the fight for life is always real
I can't believe it's no big deal
It's a legal kill
I can feel the fight for life is always real
And I can't believe it's no big deal
It's a legal kill
And I can see the beauty that is here for me
The chance to live and walk free
From a legal killEmbed
