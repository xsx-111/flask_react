Mr. Wilson Lyrics
Hey, Mr. Wilson
I'm glad to shake your hand
And it's nice to see you, too
And yes, I understand

That I'm not to take it personal
Although we look like people
And it could be my son on the chopping block
But I'm sure he'll understand

You're at the table
And you seem nice enough
(Oh, it's daddy, he was mad, he came and took my ball and bat, he)
I just can't figure
Are you for real or not?
(Called me brother, sister, mother, shook my hand, now calls me "sir")

And I'm not to take it personal
Although we look like people
And it could be my wife on the chopping block
But I'm sure she'll understand
I'm sure we'll understand

And I'm not to take you personal
Although we look like people
And it could be my head on the chopping block
But I'm sure I'll understand
I'm sure we'll understand
No! We don't understand!

Hey, Mr. Wilson
Do what you have to do
(Lay the pipe, the apple's ripe, I'm going to Japan)Embed
