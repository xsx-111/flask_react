We Were Born to Be Loved LyricsI could shout from a rooftop how I really feel
Do you really want to know, do you really care
I could silently scream so you never hear
Somebody said you must rise above it all
We were born to be loved
How the screaming changes when the meaning hits your ears
Do you really, do you really wanna know
Can you count the reasons why we have so many fears
Somebody said you must rise above it all
We were born to be loved
Somebody said read the writing on the wall
We were born to be loved
A big heart, lonely eyes
A child plays with toys to soon to realize
To stop playin take it all inside
All he wanted was love
He remembers how that nobody cared
He was alone with everybody there
Took a chance and got outta there
All he wanted was love
The mouth of the fool was a whip on his back
He's got the scars to prove it
A broken heart, a matter of fact
But he knows how to use it
Happy endings are not just for tv
Broken hearts
Don't lose one piece of the puzzle
And The Beatles said all you need is love
I could point the finger but there's too much inside here
Somebody said you must rise above it all
We were born to be loved
Somebody said read the writing on the wall
We were born to be lovedEmbed
