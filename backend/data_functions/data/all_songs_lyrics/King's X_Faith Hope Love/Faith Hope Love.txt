Faith Hope Love LyricsWe've all seen the evil of this world
And we feel so helpless with all the lies
Everyone believes somewhere there's love
Darkness is just a speck in the light
We are children trapped in time
We are strong
You see the word brings no lies
I believe it has a name
I believe he is alive
Bad luck we hide it oh so well
Just enough to tell you I can't see my eyes are blind
If I look then surely I will find
If I learn my lessons when I'm older I'll be wise
We are children trapped in time
We are strong
You see the word brings no lies
I believe it has a name
I believe he is alive
We are children trapped in time
We are strong
You see the word brings no lies
I believe it has a name
I believe he is alive
Listen to me very closely
There is more heaven than hell
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
We've all seen the evil of this world
And we feel so helpless with all the lies
Everyone believes somewhere there's love
Darkness is just a speck in the light
We are children trapped in time
We are strong
You see the word brings no lies
I believe it has a name
I believe he is alive
Faith, hope, love
Faith, hope, love
