Moanjam LyricsI sing this song because of you
'Cause of you
I sing this song because of you
You're the story
It's you, it's you
What could I say, what should I do
Oh for you
What can I say, what should I do oh
You're the glory
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on now, yeah
Alright
Hey
I sing this song because of you
Because of you
Oh what could I do, what should I, should I, should I do
You're the glory
It's you, it's you
It's you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
