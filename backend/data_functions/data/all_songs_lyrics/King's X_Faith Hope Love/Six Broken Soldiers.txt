Six Broken Soldiers LyricsI don't care if you're sick
What can I possibly do
With an american library
And a contract on you
Got six broken soldiers in the trunk of my car
Two of them speak, four go to bars
Rods in the closet, a six shooter in hand
A caged up gorilla and three local bands
Three local bands
Fluently the parrot speaks
Six languages not known to men
A sixpence and a quarter
As the audience he scans
Got six broken soldiers in the trunk of my car
Two of them speak, four go to bars
Rods in the closet, a six shooter in hand
A caged up gorilla and three local bands
Six broken soldiers in the trunk of my car
Two of them speak, four go to bars
Rods in the closet, a six shooter in hand
A caged up gorilla and three local bandsEmbed
