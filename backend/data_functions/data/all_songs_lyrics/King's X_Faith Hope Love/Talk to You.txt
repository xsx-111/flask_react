Talk to You LyricsEarly in the morning I hear my neighbors stereo
The telephone should start to ringing as usual
I listen to my answering machine, screening all my calls
Solicitor, wrong numbers and some I just don't know
I don't know what to say
But how are you today
I mailed your letter the other day
But it's got so far to go
Someone backed into my car now there's a dent in the door
Now I can't stand eating breakfast early in the morning
Now there's someone knocking at my door
It's a friend who's getting married
I hope this one lasts longer than the one before
I don't know what to say
But how are you today
I got the blues this morning
Oh-oh just trying to make it through
To live and to love you, sometimes suffer
My neighbor called it payin' dues
Oh yeah
Another day just a fading memory
Flashes across my eyes
Here and there happy sad
Oh lord got to make this rhyme
Nothing much to tell you
But there's so much on my mind
Guess I'll put this pencil down
Sincerely, your friend, I...
I don't know what to say
But how are you today
I don't know what to say
So how are you todayEmbed
