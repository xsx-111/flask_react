We Are Finding Who We Are LyricsForever is a mountain we've yet to climb
Tears are a part of what is yet to leave behind
Strength in numbers all you need is two
Everyone's a winner while still so many lose
We are finding who we are
We can see forever
We are finding who we are
We can see forever
The volume of emotion erupting in our souls
A quiet revelation quickly takes a hold
Patience is a virtue but she won't always wait
Dissension is the tension it's what we've learned to hate
We are finding who we are
'Cause we can see forever
We are finding who we are
We can see forever
It was late September I remember well
Memories of living, the old man told the tale
Of rising and falling and cruelty and kind
The thing the old man told me truly blew my mind
We are finding who we are
'Cause we can see forever
We are finding who we are
We can see forever
We are finding who we are
We can see forever
We are finding who we are
We can see forever
We are finding
We can see, yeah
We are finding
We can see
(We are)
I know it's been said so many times before
(We can)
I once was blind but now I see
(We are)
And sometimes it just don't makes no sense
(We can)
But I believe yeah
Forever is a mountain we've yet to climb
Tears are a part of what is yet to leave behind
Strength in numbers all you need is two
Everyones a winner while still so many lose
The volume of emotion erupting in our soul
A quiet revelation quickly takes a hold
Patience is a virtue but she won't always wait
Dissension is the tension it's what we've learned to hateEmbed
