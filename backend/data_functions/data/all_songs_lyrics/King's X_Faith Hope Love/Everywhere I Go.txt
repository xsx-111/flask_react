Everywhere I Go LyricsI've been in tears, I've been the clown
I've had my doubts, what if I'm wrong
I've been in love then maybe not
I crossed my heart and then forgot
Everywhere I go I see you there
Aah
I read the story said you died
I turned the page you were alive
With hope and love and mostly faith
One day I'll see you face to face
Everywhere I go I see you there
Aah
Everywhere I go I see you there
Aah
Everywhere I go I see you there
Aah
Everywhere I go I see you there
Aah
Everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see you
Everywhere I go I see youEmbed
