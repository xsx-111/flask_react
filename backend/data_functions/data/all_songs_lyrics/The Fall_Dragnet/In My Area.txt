In My Area LyricsIn my
A dwarf plays pool to prove his height
People play games when they lose in life
There's no sport life, just acid tension stomach flash
The madness in my area
I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
I understand time till I'm asked about it
Days cross-check, years become a tick
Can't remember who I sacked, just stupid faces looking back
The madness in my area
I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
And former friends suck on the Fall
Genuine white crap article
Your future cries of broken pain
Are idiot victims
Just adds to the madness in my area
I have seen the wooo woooo
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
You've got comic fools in full bloom
McCarthy reincarnate soon
See the bones of the two-late faces
The me generation
See the traces of
The madness in my area
I have seen the birth of bad
I have seen declining tracks
I have seen the madness in my area
I have seen the madness in my area
In the writer
In the fighter
In the mirror
In the '77 shit pile
The doppelganger
The new satire (boozed satyr?)
Blood and sand
Your highs are contrived
The bands are getting too contrived, recent
Your audience is not even decentEmbed
