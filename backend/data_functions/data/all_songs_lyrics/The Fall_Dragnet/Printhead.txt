Printhead LyricsHey badges tinkle
T-shirts mingle
Hey you horror-face!
I'm a printhead
I go to pieces
I'm a printhead
I go to pieces yeah
End of catch-line
End of hook-line
We had a two page
It's what we needed
I'm an ill head
My face increases
How my head increases
Real problems, biz
So how is it, yeah
That I've reached here
I thought this game
Would do me good
How could printed vinyl bring you out to here?
We laughed with them
When it was take-the-piss time
I'm no egghead
But I'm an ex-worker man
W.C.-hero friend - and not water closet!
There's a barrier between writer and singer
Uh-huh he's a good man
Although a lazy one
The singer is a neurotic drinker
The band little more than a big crashing beat
Instruments collide and we all get drunk
The last two lines
Were a quote, yeah
When we read them
We went to pieces
We went to pieces, yeah
We went to pieces, yeah
Regularly
One day a week
I'm a printhead, yeah
Twenty pence a week
Dirty fingers
Printhead X 3
With print you substitute an ear
For an extra useless eyeEmbed
