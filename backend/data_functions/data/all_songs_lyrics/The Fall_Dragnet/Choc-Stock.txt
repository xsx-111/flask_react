Choc-Stock Lyrics(spoken) Are you doing what you did two years ago?
Yeah? Well don't make a career out of it
Up tonight
You are chock, you are pop, you are pop-stock
(backing vocals) (Mix my pop-stock)
Pop-stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, mix my pop-stock
We like pop-sick stickers
We like weak TV
We like chocolate animals
We eat porky piggies
Pop stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, try my pop-stock
Pop-stock, buy my pop-stock
Now all the bourgeoisie
They hate our crazy scene
'cause we dig pop-sick stickers
We like weaker tea
But they're the product of the same systems
Beyond their control
They stayed on at school
And tolerate bad manners
Pop stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, try my pop-stock
Pop-stock, buy my pop-stock
Now come on kids
You don't need a '77
You don't need Lee Cooper
You don't need three cosmic boots
You don't need no cosmic shit
Lets get this thing together
And make it bad
Why are you smiling
Why are you laughing
At or with this song
It's not like your scene, your scene
Pop stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, mix my pop-stock
Pop-stock, try my pop-stock
Pop-stock, buy my pop-stock
