Flat of Angles LyricsDragnet for gun-blast man
The papers had a father
Holding up a picture
His son-in-law killed her
Yes he killed his wife
She was wasting his life
His veins are full of evil serum
But what's done is done
Now he's trapped in flat of angles
Hiding in flat of angles
Right down to its gables
And sometimes bell bust under
The rings from many callers
Coupon and gas-board man
Dragnet for gun-blast man
Who's trapped in flat of angles
Rented cage is flat of angles
Right down to its gables
And first he started on the floorboards
120 degrees from window
Doors open to specification
And keeps out stupid neighbours
Very safe is flat of angles
Cheap rent too his flat of angles
Down to its gables
Here he fights to type
Story of murder in his life
Or soap operas all day
In rooms of dirty laundry
But I'm in flat of angles
Hiding in flat of angles
Right down to its gables
And the sun dragged him out one day
From his laundry
He saw mercenary eyes
The streets are full of mercenary eyes
Well stretched in flat of angles
Not long left in flat of angles
Down to the gables
There's a big reward for gun-blast man
A big reward for gun-blast man
A big reward for gun-blast man
Let us go up and (..) write stories
Dragnet
