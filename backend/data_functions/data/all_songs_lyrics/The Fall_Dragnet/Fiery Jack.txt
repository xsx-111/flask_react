Fiery Jack LyricsMy face is slack
And the kidneys burn
In the small of my back
Will never learn
Well I'm not going back
To the slow life
Cos every step is a drag
And peace is a kite
Of materials you never catch
Come up for a snatch
Up from hell
Once in a while
Cause I am Jack
From a burning ring
My face is slack
And I think think think
I just think think think
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
Just burn burn burn
I sat and drank
For three decades
I'm 45
Cause I am Jack
From a burning ring
And my face is slack
And I think think think
I just drink drink drink
Too fast to write
Too fast to work
I just burn burn burn
A store man from the slack
They are smart
They are (mod)
Their brains are half
They never end
Just follow trends
But I am Jack ...
And put down left-wing tirades
And the musical trades
And all free trade
I said eat this grenade
Cause I am Jack
From the burning ring
My face is slack
And I think think think
Just think think think
Too fast to work
Too fast to write
I just burn burn burn
And put down left-wing tirades
And the musical trades
And all free trade
I said eat this grenade
I said Doncaster eat this grenadeEmbed
