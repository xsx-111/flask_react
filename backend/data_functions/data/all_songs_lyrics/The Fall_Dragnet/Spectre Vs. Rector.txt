Spectre Vs. Rector LyricsMR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Part one: spectre versus rector
The rector lived in Hampshire
The spectre was from Chorazina
Inevil dust in the air
The rector locked his doors
Part two: detective drives through Hampshire
Stops because of the fog there
And thinks a visit to the rector
And meanwhile and meanwhile
Spectre possesses rector
Rector becomes spectre
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Enter inspector
Even as he spoke a dust devil suddenly arose and struck him
Part four: detective versus rector
Detective versus rector possessed by spectre
Spectre blows him against the wall
Says "Die latin this is your fall
I've waited since Caesar for this
Damn Latin my hate is crisp
I'll rip your fat body to pieces
MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway (blah blab)
Scene five, scene five
Comes a hero
Soul possessed a thousand times
Only he could rescue rector
Only he could save inspector
And this hero was a strange man
"Those flowers, take them away" he said
"They're only funeral decorations
And oh this is a drudge nation
A nation of no imagination
A stupid man is their ideal
They shun me and think me unclean
Unclean"
I have saved a thousand souls
They cannot even save their own
I'm soaked in blood but always good
It's like I drunk myself sober
I get better as I get older
MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Part six:
That was his kick from life
That's how he pads out his life
Selling his soul to the devil
And the spectre enters hero
But the possession is ineffectual
But the possession is ineffectual
And the possession is ineffectual
And MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
I said Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Last scene:
Hero and inspector walk from the scene
Is the spectre banished forever?
The inspector is half insane
The hero runs back into the mountains
The hero goes back into the mountains
He was an exorcist but he was exhausted
An exorcist but he was exhausted
He racked on his bed all night long
MR James be born be born
Yog Sothoth rape me lord
Van Greenway (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
Sludge hai choi (blah blah)
(chorus ad lib)Embed
