A Figure Walks LyricsA figure walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
Days of booze and roses
Shine on us, free us all
Who is not irascible
He is no genius
A figure walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
The old golden savages
Killed their philosophers
Thought brought the drought about
Something followed me out
Goes out again
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
And if it grabs my coat tail
I will turn and hit it
It may remove the pegs
Keeping my eyes open
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
It's got eyes of brown, watery
Nails of pointed yellow
Hands of black carpet
It's a quick trip to ice house
A quick trip to ice house
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
A figure walks behind you
A shadow walks behind you
And tales of terror
Which my father told me
They never scared me
But not only is it the blind
Who cannot see
That figure behind you
Behind you, you
That figure kept on walking
Behind you
There's a man on my trail
He's also behind you
Behind you
That figure kept on walking
Behind you
