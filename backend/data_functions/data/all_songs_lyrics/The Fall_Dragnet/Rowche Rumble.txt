Rowche Rumble LyricsLast orders half past ten
This is a groovy number ah!
Rowche Rumble
Is valium
Valium
Valium
Rowche Rumble
I said rumble
Loads of wives around the world
Are given them by doctors, who think they're little girls
The doctors need prescriptions
The wives need their pills
So Rowche Rumble
Menopause wives are hard to handle
No culture or love, no gambles
The  manage, especially smashed
On Rowche Rumble
Rowche Rumble
Physician, heal thyself
Why don't you heal yourself?
The promoter is a jerk
The promoter is a jerk
Our government's built on expense accounts
Once in, never out
A step to Rowche
Force feeding
What are the people around you taking?
Rowche Rumble
Physician heal thyself
Why don't you heal yourselves?
Now I've tried crazy things
Abusing my body to a quick end
But I'll never never never never do it again
I said I'll never never never never do it again
Rowche Rumble
Musician, heal thyself
Loads of people across the land
Do a prescribed death dance
While condemning speed and grass
They got an addiction like a hole in the ass
For Rowche Rumble
Rowche Rumble
Physician heal thyself
Why don't you heal yourselves?
Rowche Rumble
I send 70 pounds instead of 70 p to
Pharmaceutical company Rowche AG
The lorry arrived the next day
Swiss gnomes dealing out potions
They're gonna kick your liver in
You gotta treat it like a bin
Beer and speed is okay
But the full use of your body isn't
Rowche Rumble
It's valium
