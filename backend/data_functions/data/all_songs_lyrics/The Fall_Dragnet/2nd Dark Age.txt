2nd Dark Age LyricsFat conference women
Clap return of glass house
And the Arabs have it made
Oil is women in veils, eyes glazed
Second Dark Age. Death of the USA
Return of the family
The scooter cabbages
And the commune crapheads sit and whine
While the common near my birthplace is now a police college
It's a second dark age
No Psalm Sunday or any day
The city is dead
Bust. Ghost-dance rite. Tepid
I could join a pray-peace group
Spy in Norway
Cause groups can change the world
And meet Ms. Fjord and Benny.*
"Hi I am Benny
Go where the brave prance
No Czechoslovak food queues are a party, fool
A mediocre anti-Jew
And single people are screwed
In the Second Dark Age
I am Roman Totale, 17
The bastard offspring
Of Charles I and the Great God PanEmbed
