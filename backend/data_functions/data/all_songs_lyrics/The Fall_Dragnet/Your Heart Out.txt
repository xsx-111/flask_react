Your Heart Out LyricsJust take for instance
A time of great depression
Fade out of reason
Bad time's in season
Don't shut your heart out
Don't cry your eyes out
Don't cry for me, Mexico
Or Savage Pencil
I'm nearly healthy
And they try to take my eyes out
Friends try to work my soul out
But I don't sing, I just shout
Heavy clout, heart out
Now here's a joke
To cheer you up:
Old times no surgeon
Just magicians and dungeons
There they take your heart out
With a sharp knife
It wasn't fake
They had no anesthetic
That joke's pathetic
Just look at me
Too much speed
But very plain
You're lucky, friend
You've got one to take out
You know what I'm talking about!
I don't sing I just shout
All on one note
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Look at me, I just ding
Heart is out, out, it's outEmbed
