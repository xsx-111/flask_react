Put Away LyricsBa da ba da ba da ba daaa!
Late 20th Century was late and just said yes or no
And was mistaken for sarcasm, even belligerent
Now to fight!
They're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be back someday
Prisoner for a year and a day
Putting me away but I'll be back someday
A bust doorbell sound and the door broken down
A doorbell sound and the door broken down
They rang and rang but I never went down
And now they're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be boo ba ba boo ba ba bow..
Verse second
(Peel session:
I thought I would follow a friend
Red banner, split end
Follow a friend or some local men
I used to drink a bottle of vodka a day)
They rang and rang but I never went down
People ring I never go down
All metal walls now I'm sent down
And they're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be back someday
And my night sight's gone but it won't be long
I see see long now it's gone
Just two girls and a millionaire
And they're putting me away but I'll be back someday
Putting me away but I'll be boo ba ba.......
Put the heat on
Putting me away
No sex or records for a year and a day
They're putting me away
I've been bunged up, I've been banged up
I've been moved up, I've been banged up
I said ba da ba da ba da badaaaaa
MES: You make it (..)
Riley: That'll be right thenEmbed
