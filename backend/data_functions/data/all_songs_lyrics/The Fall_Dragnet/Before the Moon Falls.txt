Before the Moon Falls LyricsShhhh
We are private detectives onward back from a musical pilgrimage
We work under the name of the Fall
Who would suspect this?
It is too obvious
Our office is secluded
Those there to suspect
Would not see the wood for the trees
We were six like dice but we're back to five
Up here in the North there are no wage packet jobs for us
Thank Christ
While young married couples discuss the poverties
Of their self-built traps
And the junior clergy demand more cash
We spit in their plate and wait for the ice to melt
I must create a new regime
Or live by another man's
Before the moon falls
I must create a new scheme
And get out of others' hands
Before the moon falls
I could use some pure criminals
And get my hands on some royalties
Before the moon falls
A problem of this new scheme
Is answering obscene phone calls
Before the moon falls
Gotta stop drifting around
Kill this ugly duckling
We've got the power
And must not misuse it
Cos life is short and full of thought
I use the power
And will forever end this reign of terror
Before the moon falls
Before the tide subsides
Before the moon falls for the fifth time
Before The Fall swoonsEmbed
