Now LyricsWell it was way back in the 40's from the western part you came
And in them rocky fields of Connacht our ancestors were no more than slaves
But once we knew higher things and that comes out in you
Your tearful voice, your natural grace and your sad Irish face
ATTACK ATTACK
Oh I know that I've been crazy and that cannot be denied
But inside of me there's always been a secret urge to fly
You see I dreamed about things, the brightest things
I know(I know?) You know what I mean
Cos in my youngest years it seemed to me that anything was possible
(I got to, you got to) We all got to do "our" thing now, I got to make a life that's right for me
(I got to, you got to) Everybody's got a different role now, one thing I got to say to make you know," I love you so"
I was always dreaming of some way (Some way?) that I could be (you know?)
Another look, I knew his style of some life fantasy
And though i did not make my dreams come true, I did the best that I could do
(everybody say)
(I got to,you got to) We all got to do "our" thing now, I got to make a life that's right for me
(I got to, you got to) Everybody's got a different role now, one thing I got to say to make you know," I love you so"
I got to go...
I got to go...
We've got to go...
I don't want to go...
WE'VE GOT TO GO!!!
I wanna go..no?
I don't wanna go!
WE'VE GOT TO GO!!!
YOU'VE got to go!
Oh alright then....Embed
