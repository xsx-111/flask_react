Me LyricsThere's something wrong with me, people don't respect me
Don't seem to like me no, they want to hurt me so
There's something wrong with me, I can't let no-one see
I pretend I'm ok until I find my way
Cos if they see that I'm weak I know what they'll do to me
They'll only hurt me and I know that they will take her from me
I mustn't let them know, I mustn't let it show
They'll take the piss out of me or talk down to me
And if she sees she'll know, cos If I'm weak she'll go
Well I know what I'll do I'm gonna be someone
And then no-one can put me down cos I will be number one
'cause this is alright, I like this, alright, how's it going? what's happening?
Yeah!, no I'm alright, Is this it? It's empty man, there's nothing here
And They will all want from me, and everyone looks at me
But they wouldn't know my leave or even speak to me
And now all these people are depending on me and that man who was my friend
I think he's robbing from me
I don't know where to go, I don't know who is friend or foe
I can't handle this, I don't want to handle this, what the fuck happened?Embed
