She Got A Wiggle LyricsListen
She got a wiggle, she got a wiggle that makes me melt
The problem is that I don't know if she even likes me
She's such a woman, she's such a woman, she's all I need
And I'm the one who loves her so, and now you know, and here I go
I love her face and her soft brown hair
And the poses she strikes when she's standing there
She is woman and I just want her
And in her mind she says; (I'm mad about you)
She's mad about me
She got a voice that's soft and moist
Caresses my ears while heightening my senses
Sexy and warm and tender, I like it
She got a wiggle, she got a wiggle that makes me melt
But I'm afraid to let her know, that I'm the one who loves her so
I love her and in my mind she said(I'm mad about you)
She's mad about me
But it's only a dream
Got to make this real
(Can't live without you)
Do you know what I mean?
(I'm mad about you)
She's mad about me
But it's only a dream
She got a wiggle, she got a wiggle that makes me melt
And I'm somehow gonna find a way to make her love meEmbed
