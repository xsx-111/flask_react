Free LyricsAt first I didn't know how I would be without somebody loving me
Would I be lost inside?
Then from finding out that we could not fix me
No-one can heal that part of me, I'm better off alone
I can't fucking wait to go outside and live my life
Unless I'm free and then I'm going to be the man I'm meant to be
They say (If you don't marry you will be lonely) Yeah
(All good men raise a family) yeah, that's not what I see
In truth some of them they don't seem so happy
They tolerate their misery, well that is not for me
I can't fucking wait to go outside and live my life
Unless I'm free and then I'm going to be the man I'm meant to be
I'm free
Sometimes I think I should get some manogamy
I try and fit into society, just be like everybody
But i can never be the same as them
I don't want to be like them
I'm a man who must be free
I can't fucking wait to go outside and live my life
Unless I'm free and then I'm going to be the man I'm meant to be
I'm free
Why would I buy a book when I can join a library?
It doesn't make any sense to meEmbed
