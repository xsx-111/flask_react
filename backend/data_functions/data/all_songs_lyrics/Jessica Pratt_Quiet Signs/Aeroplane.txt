Aeroplane Lyrics
Reflection of your memory in the window
And beneath the plane, city lights are a-twinklin'
And you wear them for a crown, over the neon, how
Soft, my morning comes, oh, when they lose their glow

Oh yes, and I don't wanna touch down
Treasures luminous and divine
Savior's light, oh

You know I couldn't break or wait it through
And the roses that you came with sure had a thorn or two
But still this blood runs blue, cut it red and loose for you
Fast our northern star, paler then out of view

Oh yes, and I don't wanna touch down
Treasures luminous and divine
Savior's light, oh

Fate must be on my side
There's something close behind
Far away, I see myself
And it's come today, but tomorrow may turn me out
Oh, ooh, ohEmbed
