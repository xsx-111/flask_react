As the World Turns LyricsI know this world is turnin'
Burnin' on the wild words, can't seem to explain
More than just an outline born of fear
I won't find solace here
There's one thing wrong, chosen few
I need soul to keep the whistle blown
And it's so long before my future's come
Drawn in sand and on, on
Mmm, la-di-di-di-la
Mmm, la-di-di-di-la-oh
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I know this world is turnin'
Burnin' on the wild words, can't seem to explain
More than just an outline born of fear
I won't find solace here
There's one thing wrong, chosen few
I need soul to keep the whistle blown
And it's so long before my future's come
Drawn in sand and on, on
Mmm, la-di-di-di-la
Mmm, la-di-di-di-la-oh, mmmEmbed
