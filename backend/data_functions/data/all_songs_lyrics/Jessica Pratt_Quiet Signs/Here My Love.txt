Here My Love Lyrics
He's sincerely worn this weary heart
Here my love, near my love
Try to keep my worries safe from where they'll do you harm
But I can't be sure, endeavors I'm depending on

Your love had a tender tone, would ease my own
Fear my love, here my love
Solemn advice that I've asked of you to counsel me through
If I were in contemplation, I'd stay for a while

Oh, I've thought of it time to time
Our stolen city sighs
I'll lose him, how do I?

He's sincerely worn this weary heart
Here my love, near my love
Try to keep my worries safe from where they'll do you harm
But I can't be sure, endeavors I'm depending on

Your love had a tender tone
A sentimental end, I know
Solemn advice that I've asked of you to counsel me through
If I were in contemplation, I'd stay for a while
Oh, I've thought of it time to time
Our stolen city sighs
I'll lose him, how do I?

He's sincerely worn this heart of mine
He's not really gone, he's in my mindEmbed
