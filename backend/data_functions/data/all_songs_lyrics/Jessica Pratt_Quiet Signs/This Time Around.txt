This Time Around LyricsThis time around
Has it gone so gray that my faith can't hold out?
Haven't you heard
There's a somber wind gets my head away now?
Hallowed be thy name, had you come to claim it?
Too hard, too hard, ahh
All upon her face were the lost and strange years
Too hard, too hard, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
I don't wanna try no longer
Your songbird singing the darkest hour of the night
I don't wanna find that I've been in marching
Under the crueler side of the fight
It makes me want to cry
Well, I won't tell, the halfway blues hang on
Sure enough a sorry angel
Hurrying a song on her way
This time around
Has it gone so gray that my faith can't hold out?
Haven't you heard
There's a somber wind gets my head away now?
Hallowed be thy name, had you come to claim it?
Too hard, too hard, ahh
All upon her face were the lost and strange years
Too hard, too hard, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh
I don't wanna try no longer
Your songbird singing the darkest hour of the night
I don't wanna find that I've been in marching
Under the crueler side of the fight
It makes me want to cry
Well, I won't tell, the halfway blues hang on
Sure enough a sorry angel
Hurrying a song on her way3Embed
