Fare Thee Well Lyrics
Fare thee well, yes, and further on
We come to tell the story's end along in the wind
I've been keeping up again
Pacin' on and nobody tends to wander in your way
Soft and gray love
Sail on, your season in
Certain summers bring her delight, a quiet in the din, la-la-da

I've been years on the wrong side and I
I used to see a cause and a call
Now, I know it's over now
Hard to notice you in the crowd, ahh
La, la, la, la, la-da-dum, la-da-dum

So, then it goes beyond the dust of ages old
A seabird laughs alone in the dark
Hour to hour, child of stone
Seen and only heard now and again
Seldomly spoken, oh
There on the ocean, silvering on the waves again
Fought the light and while I pretended, I said

I've been years on the wrong side and I
I used to see a cause and a call
Now, I know it's over now
Hard to notice you in the crowd, ahh
La, la, la, la, la-da-dum, la-da-dum
La-da-la-la-da-la-da-la-da-dum
La-da-dum-da-da-da-dumEmbed
