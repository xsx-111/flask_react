Throwing Back the Apple LyricsDon't fall too deep
Don't try and sleep
Beneath the vines we dream
It's coming through
Taking over you
It's coming through
Pouring into you
It hurts so much
But you're close enough
To step outside again
It's coming through
Taking over you
It's coming through
Pouring into you
It's coming through
Taking over youEmbed
