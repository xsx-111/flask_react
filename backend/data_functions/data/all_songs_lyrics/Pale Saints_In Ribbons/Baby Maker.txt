Baby Maker LyricsBreaking through
Into the water's heat
It won't be long
It's impossible to understand
There's no way of knowing
And no way out
Take a breath
And tear it up
It's not enough
As the sky gets nearer
So does time
You'll never know what
You left behind
The only way is down
As the sky gets nearer
So does time
You'll never know what
You left behind
The only way is downEmbed
