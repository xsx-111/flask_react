Featherframe LyricsLosing everything
The frame on which you hang
The comfort
The source of pain
Losing everything
Enchanted she will bring
A glass eye for Moses' sake
He says
Wake him up
Depart
Tell him beside the sea
Moving space is left to take your place
Soft colours against the grain
Breathing Atropine
Where's light? Don't feelings ring?
Feel glass eyes against the Seine
He says
Wake him up
Depart
Tell him beside the sea
He says
Wake him up
Depart
Tell him beside the seaEmbed
