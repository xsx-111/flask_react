Shell LyricsClimb inside your mind and hide
Throw the keys away
No one could ever
Know the pain
You're going through
But i'll remember you
Yes i'll remember
Run and hide in your mind
Run and hide
Don't know why
Don't eat
Don't move
You don't sleep
Empty where you lie
Gets farther every
Time is still
You're just a shell
You do not exist the way you used to
Run and hide in your mind
Run and hide
Don't know why
Learn to cry
Learn to flyEmbed
