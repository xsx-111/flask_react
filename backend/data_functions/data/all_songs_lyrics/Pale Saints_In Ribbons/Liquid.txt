Liquid LyricsSilver head
What makes you
Sick inside
She stood by you
Seasons hand
Holds your dream
???
Ways you can be
All meanings can frame
The pattern of your fins
?
Swims and lights
??? truth
All other wise
Golden things
Twists and writhes
??? fish
Caught in your eyes
All meanings can frame
The patterns of your finsEmbed
