Thread of Light LyricsPaper sleep
The beauty hidden in the pain
I smile and i bleed
Body rain
Between the scenes
You should hold someone
Every piece of time
You've undone
Pretty gold
Everything lost and still a sound
Of mother's arms and soul
Can be found
Between the scenes
You should hold someone
Every piece of time
You've undone
Between the scenes
You should hold someone
Every piece of time
You've undoneEmbed
