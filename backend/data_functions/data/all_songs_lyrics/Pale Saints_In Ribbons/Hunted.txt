Hunted LyricsNever alone
Sticks fast to him
As shadows loom
It tracks him everywhere he goes
Surgeon's hands
The only way
To free him from
The one he begs will disappear
Feels free in his sleep
But there's no such peace
Waits for him to awake
Laughs in his face
Falls to his embrace
Never alone
Says to him
Shadows loom
Shadows everywhere
Feels free in his sleep
But there's no such peace
Waits for him to awake
Laughs in his face
Falls to him
Feels free in his sleep
But there's no such peace
Waits for him to awake
Laughs in his face
Falls to his embrace1Embed
