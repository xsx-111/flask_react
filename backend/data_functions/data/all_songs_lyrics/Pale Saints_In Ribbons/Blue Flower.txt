Blue Flower LyricsWaiting for a sign from you
Waiting for the signal to change
Have you forgotten what your love can do?
Is this the end?
Walking through the city
Your boots are high heeled
And are shining bright
The sun was sparkling on the shaft of your knife
Glowering in the morning rain
Dying in my hands
Was it all in vain?
Superstar in your own private movie
I wanted just a minor part
But i'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart
Keeper of the key
Nothing seems to bring you down
It's not that cool when i'm around
Flower in the morning rain
Dying in my hands
Was it all in vain?
Superstar in your own private movie
I wanted just a minor part
But i'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heartEmbed
