Sword Box Lyrics
What kind of bastion of trust
Hit the stage with a straight-face and jacket full of doves?
Where daisy-chained hankies vanish into plastic thumbs
It was classic misdirection sold as magic to the young
Via masters of deception
The full force, court of volunteer
Pull a quarter out his ear in a recession
Pull a rabbit from a Stetson, as a rapper
Though it's basically the same exact profession
Watch, con artist, give a fuck who the mark is
Whether gorgeous or New Yorkers through the eye of Diane Arbus
No outstanding warrants, nothing up his sleeve
I need you feeling weak and needing something to believe
I need you feeling freakish, that's when I really flourish
I wake up in a sword box, I brush my teeth with bullets
Underneath some cosmic retrograde where patsies get their signals flipped
Hold on to your crystal pouch, step up to the thimble rig

And for my next trick
I'll make a dollar bill climb up out your wallet
Disappear and reappear inside my pocket
I never really do these things twice
But if y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
It goes scarves into wands
Into flowers over common sense
I'm all heart, rib cage housing a Svengali deck
Pick a card, tricky turn a vic' into a bobble-head
Absconders into clingers-on, Klingons into Romulans
Saw myself in pieces for purveyors of the strange
Put the pieces back together though I'm never quite the same
We undermine the infantry with trickery that range
From weighted dice to blowup dolls up in the carpool lane
I'm charcoal with the art school lames
I'm skateboarding with heshers
Seen scepters shaped like feather pens and '57 fenders
Carving knives and camera parts and canvas over stretchers
And whatever make that project in the cellar go Excelsior
At the whim of older bones that magically predict the weather
He like his eye of newt with pinch of pepper
The nerd rage scurry out a collapsible bird cage
Ace in the palm at the workplace, jerkface

And for my next trick
I'll make a dollar bill climb up out your wallet
Disappear and reappear inside my pocket
I never really do these things twice
But if y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just might
If y'all ask nice I just mightEmbed
