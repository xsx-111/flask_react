Burn Last Sunday Lyrics
Another season crashes to an end
The branches you thought you'd break
Well, they just bend
They just bend

Now jumping off your northern wall
Sixteen air mattresses bursting as you fall
And when you hit the ground, you'll see
The fall you meant to carry sets you free

Let's burn last Sunday
Let the week go by
Let's burn last Sunday
Watch the ashes fly
Let's burn last Sunday
Any section's fine
Let's burn last Sunday
Let me close my eyes

'Cause if you burn last Sunday
Well, if you burn last Sunday
Well, that fire's back sometime
???? that be
Don't fool me
I was before, seconds ahead
Landmines and porcupines
It's all in your head

Let's burn last Sunday
Let the week go by
Let's burn last Sunday
Watch the ashes fly
Let's burn last Sunday
Any section's fine
Let's burn last Sunday
Let me close my eyes

'Cause if you burn last Sunday
Well, if you burn last Sunday
Well, that fire's back sometime

Let's burn last Sunday
Let's burn last Sunday
Well, if you burn last Sunday
Well, that fire's back sometimeEmbed
