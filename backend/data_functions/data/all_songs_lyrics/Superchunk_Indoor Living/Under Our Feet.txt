Under Our Feet LyricsRemember
Remember
Remember
"Watch my fingers," she cried
As he hammered down hard on the stake
Into the frozen ground
Like it was her heart
By the frozen lake
It was his first mistake
And it rotted out from under our feet
Yes, it rotted out from under our feet
You were a song in the dark
Swan in the sleet
And it rotted out from under our feet
He pulled the rope hard across the ravine
So hard it would never break
It would never bend
It would never end
At least that was the plan
And it rotted out from under our feet
Yes, it rotted out from under our feet
You were a song in the dark
Swan in the sleet
And it rotted out from under our feet
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Meet you in the middle of the swinging bridge
Meet you in the middle of the swinging bridge
Meet you in the middle of the swinging bridge
Meet you in the middle of the swinging bridgeEmbed
