European Medicine LyricsWaking up with you, foggy windows spoiled my view
All our wine just froze, so much for your sunny coast
Old faxes torn in two, one drummer turning blue
Well he's alright you know, drinking kills both parasite and host
Continental clouds
Buying friends with pounds
Passed out on the ground
Continental clouds
We're rolling down the isle, pop bottles and a smoked out smile
Another stormy day, the ferry heaves once and pulls away
How do I speak to you, cold tongues and eyes of icy blue
Smashed and shattered now, one more hand they'll have to put me down
Continental clouds
Buying friends with pounds
Passed out on the ground
Continental clouds
Hold my hand steady while I write
Look over my shoulder all night
Hold my hand steady while I write
Look over my shoulder all night
I think we can squeeze you in
I care about the dumbest things
I think we can squeeze you in
I care about the dumbest things
I care about the dumbest thingsEmbed
