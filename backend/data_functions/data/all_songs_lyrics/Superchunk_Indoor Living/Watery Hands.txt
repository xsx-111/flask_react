Watery Hands Lyrics
When you leave this coast
Take me with you 'cause I can't live with your ghost
She's too much like you
She's building pyramids
On water skies
And we both know that I've got bad knees
Some tricks I won't do
So I'm swimming back to you

Soaking wet
And fully intercoastal
But I still can't forget
Your farewell toast to our dead
On the beach
If I read these
You dropped anchor and you dropped me
Now my flag flies blue
So I'm swimming back to you

You're made of water
I'm made of sand
Don't grit your teeth
Just let me kiss your
Watery hands
You're made of water
I'm made of sand
Don't grit your teeth
Just let me kiss your
Watery hands
Stop washing me away
Stop washing me away
Stop washing me away

You're made of water
I'm made of sand
Don't grit your teeth
Just let me kiss your
Watery hands
You're made of water
I'm made of sand
Don't grit your teeth
Just let me kiss your
Watery hands

Stop washing me away
Stop washing me away
Stop washing me awayEmbed
