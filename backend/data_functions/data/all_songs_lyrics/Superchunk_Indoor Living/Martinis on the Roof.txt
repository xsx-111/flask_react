Martinis on the Roof LyricsYou left a cooler at our house one night
So we're keeping it full of ice
On your advice
Blue ribbons and red wine
You know it's hard to find the right vine
It does justice to the crime
Now the justice has declined
To take the stand this time
And the waste of space is mine
Yeah I hardly have the right
To sing about it
Twelfth night and Halloween
An April Fools bad dream
Cigar smoke over the room
And you were leaving way too soon
Cheetos and 100 proof
Martinis on the roof
Cheetos and 100 proof
Martinis on the roof
And you were leaving too soon
You caught every book they threw at you
And your single malt recruits
Well the pipe shirt over your suit
And the judges they love you too
And you're crying in the house
Watching basketball on the couch
Well we'll try to work it out
Yeah we're all trying to work it out
But you would not have us pout
So sing about it
Twelfth night on Halloween
An April Fools bad dream
Cigar smoke over the room
And you were leaving way too soon
Cheetos and 100 proof
Martinis on the roof
Cheetos and 100 proof
Martinis on the roof
And you were leaving too soon
Yeah you're leaving too soon
You left too soonEmbed
