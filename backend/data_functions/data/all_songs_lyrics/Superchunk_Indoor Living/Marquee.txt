Marquee LyricsSneakin' into the balcony
Velvet curtains on the walls
Well I might jump or I might fall
I am not decided
Stare into your selfish  screen
Film is melting happily
Brown is turning into gold
I'm falling through these holes
Gracefully
You hit your mark
While acting is naive
The arc of lights
Above your head
Is not to be believed
Oh your marquee!
Your marquee!
And your publicist was great
She got me this date
And although I can't complain
I do not like champagne
You love the trading cards of fame
And what rhymes with insane?
And I lie about the champagne
Yeah I lie about it
Gracefully
You hit your mark
While acting is naive
The arc of lights
Above your head
Is not to be believed
Oh your marquee!
Your marquee!
Will I see you in the parking lot?
Can I see you in the parking lot?
Will I see you in the parking lot?Embed
