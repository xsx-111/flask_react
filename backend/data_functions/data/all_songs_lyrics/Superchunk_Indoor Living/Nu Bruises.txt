Nu Bruises LyricsWhen you came my paint was still wet
Plastering horsehair in relief
Pulling bristles off the wall
You're like mosquitoes in the fall
You signed your name, you used your teeth
Grass stained knees and sand in my shoes
Sore like I'd recently been rode
I've been to parties at your place
Where you explained the steeplechase
Smooth hedges and a secret code
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Resting by the channel rapids
Delivery room into the shore
I saw you floating down this way
Dove in and kicking all the way
Is nearly drowning not a sport?
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Nu bruises aren't all bruises
Nu bruises aren't all bruisesEmbed
