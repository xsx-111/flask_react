Mind Is On My Mind Lyrics
Chasing speed but not like you used to
Pacific coast highway is an old friend that I once knew
Reservations at the Hotel Britania
Wanna make a cancellation
Cause it's so nice to have you around
Fog crept in to my yard last night
Like a magic carpet
Fresh for the dawn to ride
Gotta go I got a flight to catch
Struck me baby like lighting a god damn match

See me in the morning and I won’t make a sound
Believing all the typos in the letters that I found
And when noon comes around it’s back to the daily grind
Where my mind is on my mind is on my mind is on my mind

In the morning I'll see that you are better
In the morning I will see that you have gone
In the morning I'll  see that you are better
In the morning I will see that you have gone

I’m leaving today
Whats love it breaks just like an egg
When I’m with you
In a way it’s the sun that kept me lonely
So to the moon I pray
Patterns like stars lead hands to thighs to miss you
No change for the phone
Just a lie that I told
Hung from the rope to see if you would grab for me
But I’ve seen it all
As the letters start to fall
What visions made us swallow dreams
But if you want me to go then I’ll just go
And you won’t stop meEmbed
