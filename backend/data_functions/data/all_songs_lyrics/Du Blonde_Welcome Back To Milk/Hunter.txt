Hunter LyricsWell baby I don't mind
If my name is not the kind of word you're looking for
I can stay away, no I don't need to lay myself before your door
Baby I won't cry if I never see your eyes again before I'm done
No I won't feel no pain if I hear down the chain that you're moving on
Baby when the stone rolls and powders your bones
I hope that she keeps you happy at home
I tried but I just couldn't be
Baby when the glory hunts you down
You don't have the strength to carry the crown
I hope that you're happy to be
Baby if it's true that I was bad for you
Then I apologize
I only ever tried to keep you satisfied
While you analyzed
Everything I said seemed to drop like lead before your haunting eyes
All I ever did was love you like a kid now with no disguise
Baby when the stone rolls and powders your bones
I hope that she keeps you happy at home (like I know you want it)
I tried but I just couldn't be (your meat)
Baby when glory hunts you down
You don't have the strength to carry the crown (like I know you want to)
I hope that you're happy to be, just freeEmbed
