Raw Honey LyricsCalifornia gold got a hold
Upon my limbs
Take it up to Hollywood
And let them
Feast upon the bones of this beast
Oh boy it's a strange admission
For the court to be hearing
That your love has gone missing
No I ain't gonna wait
For fate or your permission
To love you (2x)
It's quite a life
Raw honey dripping from
The gilded edges of his
Ever twisting knife
He's quite a man
But he don't know the true
Extent of all the damage
He commands
Wake up, take a trip
Up north to Malibu
There's a man out there
The whole world thought they knew
Trying to make a life beyond
Cold fame's name brand
It's a long road home
If you're walking on your hands
Oh boy it's a strange admission
For the court to be hearing
That your love has gone missing
No I ain't gonna wait
For fate or your permission
To love you (2x)
It's quite a life
Raw honey dripping from
The gilded edges of his
Ever twisting knife
He's quite a man
But he don't know the true
Extent of all the damage
He commands1Embed
