Four In The Morning LyricsWhat a change in the morning light
When you wake with somebody who treats you right
Just drive, call it coincidence
Buying smokes at the station with the last of our sense
Cause it's four in the morning now
Close your eyes in the motel miles out of town
Yeah it's four in the morning now
And time has worn you out
Oh call me your baby love
For a week or two then we can  break it up
But for now show me the open road
The sky turns green as the leaves turn gold
It's four in the morning now
Close your eyes in the motel miles out of town
Yeah it's four in the morning now
And time has worn you out
Hell, I know your alibi
Time wasn't right, but at least you tried
Boy we'll talk again some day
You're free to go, although I wish you'd stay
Cause it's four in the morning now
Close your eyes in the motel miles out of town
Yeah it's four in the morning now
And time has worn you outEmbed
