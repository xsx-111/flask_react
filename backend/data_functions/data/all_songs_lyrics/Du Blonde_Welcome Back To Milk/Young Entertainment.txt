Young Entertainment Lyrics
Is it me or are you voodoo
Black magic son of God knows who
A cauldron circulating all the girls you end up hating (repeat)
Do you ever feel like pushing
Your skull through a brick wall
And making space for him to say you mean nothing at all
He called me baby does that mean he loves me so

What is like what is like to fuck your mistress with her hands tied
What is like what is like to fuck your mistress with your hands tied

Oh see the flares of fortune
Engulf the red brick road
The peeling paint of everything and everyone you know
A (?) that grew hair
Your friends are not your foes
And when they leave your side itâ€™s too late to back out you'll know
He kissed me softly when he said he had to go


Did he love me
Or did he just think of me
Young entertainment as he looked down from up above me
