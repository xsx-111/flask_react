Black Flag LyricsShow down baby, who'll fall in love again?
You can't blame me for wondering, for wondering when
You'll replace me with another and then
Raise your flag in the morning, black flag for my mourning
Hell no, baby no need to hesitate
Tryina play me
And throw your, and throw your weight
(Bullseye) baby, I know you aim is true
Keep it burning, red flag
Is it coming for you?
All fours baby down to the riverside
(Graze my knees) And my paws baby, and burn my, and burn my pride
Can you feel me?
Are you sure I'm alive? In the morning
Black flag for my mourning
Why'd you do this?
I know that you know better
We've been through this
You're a real sunsetter baby!
Well said baby, now tell me something new
You slay me with what you say and what you do
Don't try me, cause I'm not in the mood
(Raise your flag) in the morning, white flag
I surrender to you!
Packed up baby, I got a ticket booked
Got a lot honey, I know you're, I know you're hooked on hurt
Baby, you like to keep it blue
In the morning black flag, I'll be mourning for you!Embed
