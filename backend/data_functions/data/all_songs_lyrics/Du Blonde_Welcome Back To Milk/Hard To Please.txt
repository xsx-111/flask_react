Hard To Please Lyrics
Wire your jaw shut, wash your clothes and get a job
Pull your socks up, believe me love it ain’t that hard
So take a seat and let me bore you
Flee the white walls play to please and bleed the blues
Calm the cat calls faceless words don’t define you
So take a seat and let me bore you
It’s not enough that I adore you

Was it always so that you were hard to please?
Love to the nth degree
Was it always so that you were hard to please, love?

Take your girl out
Dress her up and buy her shoes
What’s the problem? spend some cash and make it new
So take a seat and let me bore you
Slam the phone down lay the blame and walk away
You don’t own this town you’re not why I want to stay
Shut the f*ck up let me bore you
I’m not so sure that I adore you

Was it always so that you were hard to please?
Love to the nth degree
Was it always so that you were hard to please, love?
Was it always so that you were hard to please?
Love to the nth degree
Was it always so that you were hard to please, love?

Was it always so that you were hard to please?
Love to the nth degree
Was it always so that you were hard to please, love?Embed
