Mr. Hyde LyricsStick em up, lick it up
Can't be getting by
Without enugh duff-doers
Misting up our eyes
What a weep fest
What a fucking nightmare
Turned my heels to the ground
You were still there
Pile it up and pull it back
And let it go boy
Catapult, it's your fault
You got no more joy
What a shit storm
What a fucking nightmare
Turned my heels to the ground
You were still there
What did you say?
I didn't hear
It's the same today
As it was last year
Suck it up, though it out
Best behaviour
He's a saint, they say
Oh he's a real saviour
Guess they never saw
From the other side
Jekyll's in the kitchen
Sucking off Hyde
Is it so bad?
I don't believe it
I guess the air feels fresh
Until you breathe it
What a bad taste
What a bad man
Baby close the door
As fast as you can
What did you say?
I didn't hear
It's the same today
As it was last year
Where did you go?
I didn't see
So why do I feel
Like you're following me?
Go to sleepEmbed
