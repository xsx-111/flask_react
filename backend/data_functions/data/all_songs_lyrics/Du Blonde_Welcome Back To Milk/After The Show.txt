After The Show LyricsWhere did you go?
I can't see you
Hiding behind your charade
Was it hard to
See that I would
Carry your weight
When the road was too dark
To navigate, love
Heard me crying
In the bathroom
Lay there dreaming
Didn't you, well didn't you know
All I needed was my best friend
To come back from wherever he'd go
Babe when we ran through the halls of hotels
And the love that we made was a love hotter than hell
And your arms were my blanket at night
The touch of your lips was my paradise
All of this time I should have stuck up for myself
It's a crime, was so bad for my mental health
I remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect
Babe there were times I felt lonely
Lying next to you at night, that wasn't right, no
Should have let go of your ego
Turned to see the girl you loved when we first met
Babe when we ran through the halls of hotels
And the love that we made was a love hotter than hell
And your arms were my blanket at night
The touch of your lips was my paradise
All of this time I should have stuck up for myself
It's a crime, was so bad for my mental health
I remember you asking what did I expect
All I needed was a little of your respect
I was still there
Hiding somewhere
Beneath my anxiety
Forgot to breathe
It was so hard
Just to let you know
Caught up in your adrenaline
After the show
Babe it's a shame that the game went the way it did
I've loved you forever
Both you and your kid
I'd have remained faithful even in your old age
Long after the last time that you leave the stage
Cause I loved you for everything, all that you are
The man sat at home, the lonely superstar
All I wanted was time with your soul
Skin to skin, my best friend, my lover
And my companion
I remember you asking
What did I expect
All I needed was
A little of your respectEmbed
