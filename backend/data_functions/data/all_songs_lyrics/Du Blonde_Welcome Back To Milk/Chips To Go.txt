Chips To Go Lyrics
Hope and glory don't you know you have got me over your shoulder
There’s a better life waiting there for me
As far as I can see
In the morning when I wake
Before I begin the give and take that life holds out for us
Even if we must
Let's not feign the fuss
In time our weather systems meet and bring the rain
(I got a bet on us that our two heads will breed a hurricane)
In time these falling leaves build nests within our town
(If love is just a word for us then why’d I god damn let it hold me down)
What is it we learn in class
No time for fun just focus on the past
It’s all we’re ever told
You're worth your weight in gold
Prepare to be sold
Is it so hard to believe
The more you give the more you will receive
For all that we know
Life is but a show
Get your chips to go
In time our weather systems meet and bring the rain
(I got a bet on us that our two heads will breed a hurricane)
In time these falling leaves build nests within our town
(If love is just a word for us then why’d I god damn let it hold me down)
In time our weather systems meet and bring the rain
(I got a bet on us that our two heads will breed a hurricane)
In time these falling leaves build nests within our town
(If love is just a word for us then why’d I god damn let it hold me down)Embed
