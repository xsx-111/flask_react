Another Grey Morning LyricsWhen I feel as though my love is sinking down
The sun doesn't want to shine
And when it feels like she won't face another day
Life is unkind
She's frozen in time
And here comes another grey morning
A not so good morning after all
She says "Well, what am I to do today
With too much time and so much sorrow"
She hears the baby waking up downstairs
She hears the foghorn calling out across the sound
Repetition in the morning air
Is just too much to bear
And no one seems to care
If another day goes creeping by empty and ashamed
Like an old unwanted memory that no one will claim
The clouds with their heads on the ground
She's gonna have to come down
She said "Move me, move me
I'm locked up inside"
Well, I didn't understand her
Though God knows I tried
She said "Make me angry
But just make me cry
But no more grey morning
I think I'd rather die"Embed
