Looking for Love on Broadway LyricsNeed a reason to be here
Hoping to find it tonight
Walking alone on Broadway
Watching the people
Watching the town go down
Broadway's a river to me
Fat fish in the big city sea
Taxi cabs, limousines, submarines
Got my mind on a sweet dream
Keeping an eye on this street scene
Cause I'm open for love in the middle of town tonight
Had my fill of self-pity
I brought all my blues to the city
Guess I'm pressing my luck in the middle of town tonight
See me waiting on you to smile back on me, child
It looks like tomorrow
It seems like the end of a dream
Dawning on me on Broadway
In the morning light it's a dream
I'm just a fool looking for love on BroadwayEmbed
