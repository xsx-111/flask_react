I Was Only Telling a Lie LyricsGot the one room suite in the downtown motel
Got a lovely view
Classic shot of the parking lot
An off ramp of route 72
Half flat six pack of lukewarm beer
So lay down by my side
Like to whisper sweet nothings in my filthy ear
Until I'm satisfied
Baby-bootie
Juicy-fruity
Truck-stop cutie
Roadside-beauty
I'm in love with you
Hope it don't last too long
You got the mackerel eyes
Brought the side of fries
You got me hypnotized
I'm in love again
Now baby when I told you that I love you
I was only telling a lie
I'll be long gone come the crack of dawn
And I believe the word is good-bye, bye baby, bye, bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
I was only telling a lie
There ain't no need to act like I shot your dog, no
I was only telling a lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
A-ha a-ha a-ha a-ha
Said no need, no need
Said no need, no needEmbed
