Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Book LyricsFortune presents gifts
Not according to the book
Fortune presents gifts
Not according to the book
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
What various paths are followed
In distributing honours and possessions
She gives awards to some
And penitent's cloaks to others
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
Sometimes she robs the chief goatherd
Of his cottage and goat pen
And to whomever she fancies
The lamest goat has born two kids
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
Because in a village a poor lad
Has stolen one egg
He swings in the sun
And another gets away with a thousand crimes
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles1Embed
