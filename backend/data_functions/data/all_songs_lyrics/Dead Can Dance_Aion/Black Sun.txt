Black Sun LyricsMurder! Man on fire
Murder! I've seen the eyes of the living dead
It's the same game. Survival
The great mass play a waiting game
Embalmed, crippled, dying in fear of pain
All sense of freedom gone
Black sun in a white world
Like having a black son in a white world
I have a son, his name is Eden
It's his birthright beyond estranged times
Give me 69 years, another season in this hell
It's all sex and death as far as eyes can tell
Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock of a brave new world
Our god-forsaken lot
And I feel that's all we have ever needed to
Know until worlds end and the seas run cold
Give me 69 years, another season in this hell
There is sex and death in mother nature's plans1Embed
