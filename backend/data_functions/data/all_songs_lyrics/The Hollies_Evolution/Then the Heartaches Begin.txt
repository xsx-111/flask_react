Then the Heartaches Begin LyricsMy sadness it is growing
I'm sure it's started showing
This feeling's getting stronger
I can't hold back out much longer
It's swelling deep inside
Emotions I can't hide
Then the heartaches begin
I'm telling you
The heartaches begin
I need someone to guide me
Someone to reconcile me
To take away this pain
Before it starts again
But no one listens to me
Can't control what's set in deeply
Then the heartaches begin
I'm telling you
The heartaches begin
Four stone walls surround me
An empty shell's all you see
My former self's departed
A man who's broken hearted
Loneliness is what I fear
Holding on to all that's dear
Then the heartaches begin
I'm telling you
The heartaches begin
I'm telling you childEmbed
