Lullaby to Tim LyricsWould you like to slide down a rainbow
Catch a falling star in your hands
Chase a moonbeam right by your window
Close your eyes and you'll be there
In a land of dragons and castles
Be a knight in armor that shines
On a horse with trappings of silver
Close your eyes and you'll be there
You will be there
Hoping that no one
Will come and wake you up
You will be there
While the mooning is peeping
As you lie a-sleeping
In your dream world
In a land of dragons and castles
Be a knight in armor that shines
On a horse with trappings of silver
Close your eyes and you'll be there
See the witches fly on their broomsticks
Stirring cauldrons casting their spells
Kisses changing frogs into princes
Close your eyes and you'll be
Close your eyes and you'll be
Close your eyes and you'll be thereEmbed
