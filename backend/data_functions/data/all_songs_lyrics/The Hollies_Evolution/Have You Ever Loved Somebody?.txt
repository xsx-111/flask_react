Have You Ever Loved Somebody? LyricsYou say that you want me and now that you've got me you're gone
Think what you're doin' or else you'll regret what you've done
Don't come back tomorrow and say what we did wasn't right
You'll cry on your pillow and find it hard to sleep at night
Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night all night
Remember what happened the last time that you said goodbye
Remember the saying that once bit and I'll be twice shy
It's no use me crying there is no denying it's right
When thinking has ruined the feeling that we had to fight
Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night all night
If you hear people talking now
Will you laugh or cry
If you cry I'll sympathize with you
If you laugh I'll die
If you laugh I'll die
You say that you want me and now that you've got me you're gone
Think what you're doin' or else you'll regret what you've done
Don't come back tomorrow and say what we did wasn't right
You'll cry on your pillow and find it hard to sleep at night
Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night all night
Have you ever loved somebody
Don't you know just what it's like
Hurting someone that you're close to
Have you ever loved all night all nightEmbed
