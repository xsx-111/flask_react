You Need Love LyricsWhen you love somebody that means a lot
And so you give the best of what you've got
It's a reason for living to have someone
Without a love in your life you can't go on
You need love I need love
When you're tired and worn out she'll run to you
And calm your restlessness and comfort you
You need love I need love
No wonder that I always say
I can't live another day without you
I tell my friends I'm feeling fine
Then they know that I'm not lying about you
All your life you'll know that your trust was right
When you're holding her close to you at night
You need love I need loveEmbed
