Heading for a Fall LyricsYou say that you want me
I've no cause to doubt you
My friends tell me different that's all
They say that I'm blind
But I know all about you
I know that I'm heading for a fall
I know that I'm heading for a fall
I seem to be hypnotized by all your beauty
A subject to your beck and call
Your arms magnetize me
When I'm here beside you
I know that I'm heading for a fall
I know that I'm heading for a fall
Or am I wasting my time
Or am I wasting my time
Or am I wasting my time
Or am I wasting my time
What is it about you that tempts me and taunts me
I can't understand it all
If I try to leave you I know that you'll haunt me
I know that I'm heading for a fall
I know that I'm heading for a fallEmbed
