You Lyrics
I, I, love, love
And I, and I love you
Oh you, you, yeah you

And you, you, love, love
And you, yes you, you love me
Yeah you, you, yeah you

And when I'm holding you
What a feeling
Seems so good to be true
That I'm telling you all
That I must be dreaming

And I, and I, I love you
Oh you, oh oh you, yeah you

And when I'm holding you
What a feeling
Seems so good to be true
I'm telling you all
I must be dreaming
I, oh I, love, love
And I, yeah I, I love you
I love you, oh you
You, oh you
You, oh oh oh
You know that I love you, oh oh oh
You know that I love youEmbed
