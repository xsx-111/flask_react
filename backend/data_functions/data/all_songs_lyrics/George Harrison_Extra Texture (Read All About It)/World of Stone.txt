World of Stone Lyrics
Wise man, you won't be
To follow the like of me
In this world made of stone
Such a long way to go

We may disagree
We all have the right to be
In this world made of stone
Such a long way to go
Such a long, long way from home

And we may disagree
We all have the right to be
In this world made out of stone
It's such a long, long way to go

The wiser you may be
The harder it can be to see
In this world made of stone
Such a long, long way to go
Such a long way from home
In this world made of stone
Such a long, long way to go
And such a long way from OMEmbed
