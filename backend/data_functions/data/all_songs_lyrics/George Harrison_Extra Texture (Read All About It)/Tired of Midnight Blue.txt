Tired of Midnight Blue Lyrics
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

The sun came into view
As I sat with the tears in my eyes
The sun came up on you
And as you smiled, the teardrop, it dried

Don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home alone with you
Tired of midnight blue

The sun came up so high
And as it shone, I realized your love
The sun shone in your eyes
And as you smiled, you realized it too

Don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Tired of midnight blue

I don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Tired of midnight blue

The sun went down the sky
Way up the clouds told me that they knew
The moon came up so high
And as you smiled, I knew that you knew too

Don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Tired of midnight blue
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I don't know where I had been
But I know what I had seen
Made me chill right to the bone
Made me wish that I'd stayed home with you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohEmbed
