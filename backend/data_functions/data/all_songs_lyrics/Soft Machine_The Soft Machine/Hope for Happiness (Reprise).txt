Hope for Happiness (Reprise) Lyrics
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happiness

Out of the East, the sun flew West
Trailing its golden spray
My heart burns, when fortune turns
The trail to light my way

Days go by, I watch the sky
My eyes forever quest
The sun returns, though my hope yearns
Forever things point the rest

Sun heart burns
Moon glow turns
Stars will trade
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happinessEmbed
