Hope for Happiness Lyrics
I... I can tell (I can tell)
I can tell by the ring of a bell (by the ring of a bell)
A chime that is clear and true
But if it's cracked (a chime that is clear and...)
The sound is flat (a chime that is— a chime— a chime that is—)
(A chime that is clear— a chime— a chime that is clear—)
Like my happiness that's untrue

Out of the East, the sun flew West
Trailing its golden spray
My heart burns, when fortune turns
The trail to light my way

Days go by, I watch the sky
My eyes forever quest
The sun returns, though my hope yearns
Forever things point the rest

Sun heart burns
Moon glow turns
Stars will trade
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happiness
Flowers grow wild, just for the child
Sniff this sprinkling bloom
When you grow up, hope colours up
The things that cause us gloom

Tell can you now how fun is made?
It's how happiness is really found
Look for advice, be told more than twice
By people all around

Sun heart burns
Moon glow turns
Stars will trade
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness
Hope for happiness, happiness, happiness
