Why Am I So Short? Lyrics
You may laugh at me
Say I don't deserve
All the things I've had
Sad...

I've got a drum kit and some sticks
So when I'm drunk or in a fit
I find it easy to express myself
I hit the drums so hard I break all the heads
And then I end the day in one of my beds

I'm nearly 5'7 tall
I like to smoke and drink and ball
I've got a yellow suit that's made by Pam
And every day I like an egg and some tea
But best of all I like to talk about me!

You may laugh at me
Say I don't deserve
All the things I've hadEmbed
