A Certain Kind Lyrics
A certain kind of love, I'd say
Exists for me, and every night
Your kind of love sets me alight
And I know it's real
It's what I feel, what I feel

And loving you the way I do
Makes everything seem right again
And when you're near I know
I know you just can't tell the time
When you... it's just not right

And so our love I see in you
The things today, the things we do
And when you're near I know
You just can't see... well
I know it's real
It's what I feel

And loving you the way I do
Makes everything seem right again
And when you're near I know
I know you just can't see
All the time of day
I know you're mine
And all the timeEmbed
