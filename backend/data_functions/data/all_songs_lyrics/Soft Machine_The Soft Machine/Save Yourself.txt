Save Yourself Lyrics
My, my, my bed you're lying on
And it's my, my, my bed you're dying on
But if it's my head you're relying on

You gotta save yourself – save yourself
Don't enslave yourself – save yourself
Just to save yourself – save yourself
In your own bed at night

Because, girl, you know
That if I try to feed you
And keep you all weak to make you feel secure
That you won't leave my bed
Though you wanna stay fed
Will your heart remain pure?
You know you can't make it
Without tryin' to fake it
And I believe, baby

You gotta save yourself – save yourself
Don't enslave yourself – save yourself
Just to save yourself – save yourself
Stay in your own bed at nightEmbed
