Lullabye Letter Lyrics
I've got something to tell you
Hold on, I wanted to thrill you
It's nice, makes you feel better
It's called a Lullabye Letter
Hold tight, I'm not trying to con you
Get ready, I'm going to lay it on you

You're the sweetest thing I see
I'm telling you it's no lie

I've got lights in my brain, girl
We'll have fights in the rain, girl
You'll be good/bad together
Writing songs and call that the weather
If you've got something to sing me
Four o'clock's the best time to ring me

You're the sweetest thing I see
I'm telling you it's no lie

I've got something to tell you
Hold on, I wanted to thrill you
It's nice, makes you feel better
It's called a Lullabye Letter
Hold tight, I'm not trying to con you
Get ready, I'm going to lay it on you
You're the strangest scene I see
I'm telling you it's no lie
You're the sweetest thing I see in my life...Embed
