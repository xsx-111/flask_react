Fool for Your Love LyricsHey Mama, say what you wanna
Tell me it's all up to you
I know you've been runnin' all over town, honey
But what should I do?
Love can run hot, love can turn cold
Break your heart in two or so I've been told
Yes I know, oh baby, I want you to hear what I say
I'm a fool for your love
Yes I am
Your live is vicious, slightly malicious
Coiled like a snake in your heart
Man is a hard one, cold as a handgun
Like I was at the start
But I keep lettin' love get the better of me
My head is spinnin', honey
Can't you see what I need
Oh baby, I want you to hear what I say
I'm a fool for you love
Oh baby, I want you to hear what I say
I'm a fool for your love
I'm a fool for your loveEmbed
