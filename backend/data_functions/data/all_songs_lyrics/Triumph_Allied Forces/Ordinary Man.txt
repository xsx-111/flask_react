Ordinary Man LyricsLook in the mirror tell me what do you see
Or can you lie to yourself like you're lyin' to me
Do you fall asleep real easy feelin' justified and right
Or do you wake up feelin' empty in the middle of the night
You want to think you're different, but you know you never can
You're just another ordinary man
Hey politician, can't believe a word you say
Almighty media, whose truth d'you serve today?
Watchdog of justice, who keeps their eye on you?
Con man, song in hand, who you singin' to?
The more I get to see, the less I understand
I'm just another ordinary man
CHORUS:
Ordinary man
Ordinary man
Just another ordinary man
Comes a time to take a stand
No rest for the wicked - they get it while they can
The preachers and the teachers and your local Congressman
Everybody plays the game they played since time began
Lawyers and accountant - your media man
Everybody's talkin' but nothin's gettin' said
You're looking for the truth you better look inside your head
I see the flash of lightnin'
I hear the thunder roll
A hungry knife, a slice of life
It cuts another soul
Power finds a way to those who take a stand
Stand up ordinary man
Once I thought the truth was gonna set me free
But now I feel the chains of its responsibility
I will not be a puppet I cannot play it safe
I'll give myself away with a blind and simple faith
I'm just the same as you I just do the best I can
That's the only answer...for an ordinary man
CHORUS
No such thing as easy answers
You play to win and you take your chances
CHORUS
Here's to health, here's to wealth
May you never doubt yourself
