Allied Forces LyricsI've got something on my mind
I want you to know
Rock troops are on the move
It's startin' to show
Paratroopers everywhere
Can't you see
Strategic weapons
Are something we don't need
CHORUS:
Allied Forces in every nation
Allied Forces gonna take control
Allied Forces of my generation
Allied Forces of rock 'n' roll
Youth culture in overdrive
Mass frustration
Too much, too little, too late
Class alienation
Denim armies working
Consolidate the might
War games, maneuvers
Rehearsals in the night
CHORUS
I've got something on my mind
I want you to know
Rock troops are on the move
It's startin' to show
Paratroopers everywhere
Are ready to fight
We're mobile allies
Marchin' every night
