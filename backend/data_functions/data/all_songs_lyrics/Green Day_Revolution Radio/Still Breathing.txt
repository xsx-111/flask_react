Still Breathing Lyrics
I'm like a child looking off in the horizon
I'm like an ambulance that's turning on the sirens
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a soldier coming home for the first time
I dodged a bullet and I walked across a landmine
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive

Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, my way to you

I'm like a junkie tying off for the last time
I'm like a loser that's betting on his last dime
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive
I'm like a son that was raised without a father
I'm like a mother barely keeping it together
Oh-oh-oh, I'm still alive
Am I bleeding?
Am I bleeding from the storm?
Just shine a light into the wreckage
So far away, away

'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, away

As I walked out on the ledge
Are you scared to death to live?
And I've been running all my life
Just to find a home that's for the restless
And the truth that's in the message
Making my way away, away

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
'Cause I'm still breathing
'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away
(My way to you) 'Cause I'm still breathing
(My way to you) 'Cause I'm still breathing on my own
My head's above the rain and roses
Making my way away, my way to you17Embed
