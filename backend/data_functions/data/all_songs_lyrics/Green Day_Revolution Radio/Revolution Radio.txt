Revolution Radio Lyrics
Scream! With your hands up in the sky
Like you wanna testify
For the life that's been deleted
Scream! Like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated

We will be seen, but not be heard

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"

(Gimme) Rage! Like there's tear gas in the crowd
Do you wanna live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing
Rise! Of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves
For the anti-social media
(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"


We will be seen, but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

(We are) Revolution Radio
Operation "No Control"
And the headline (Headline)
"My love's bullet proof"
Gimme cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline (Headline)
"Legalize the truth!"8Embed
