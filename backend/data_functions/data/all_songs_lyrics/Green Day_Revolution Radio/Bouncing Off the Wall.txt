Bouncing Off the Wall Lyrics
Concrete dream (Hey!) I'm gonna make a scene
Radio covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse, and everybody's bouncing off the walls
Bombs away (Hey!) It's just another day
Of idle threats, the secret alphabet
I wouldn't sweat it, everybody's bouncing off the walls
I'm bouncing off the walls! Alright!

Concrete kiss (Hey!) Come on and do the twist
The radio, my little exorcist
We're all getting pissed, and everybody's bouncing off the walls
I'm bouncing off the walls!

'Cause it's all that I want, and I wanna be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks, and we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

Hey!
Hey!

'Cause it's all that I want, and I wanna be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks, and we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
Hey!
Hey!3Embed
