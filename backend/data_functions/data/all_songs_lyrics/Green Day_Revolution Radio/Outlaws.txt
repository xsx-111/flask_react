Outlaws Lyrics
Life after youth, faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love, first forgiveness, we were delinquents
Freaks of a fading memory

Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever

Scars, broken hearts, breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls, bottle rockets, all that we wanted
It's for our life beyond the stars

Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

I've got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirit's place to roam
I plead my innocence, I plead my innocence
But that's my best defense when you are young

Outlaws, when we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption, baby
Hooligans, we destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever

I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train, and you can't go back
Forever now, forever now, you'll roam9Embed
