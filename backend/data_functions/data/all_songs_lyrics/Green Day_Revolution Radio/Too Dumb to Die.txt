Too Dumb to Die Lyrics
Oh-oh, I love you, oh-oh, I do
I got a sentimental illness for you
Please don't go away, oh yeah

I was a high school atom bomb
Goin' off on the weekends
Smokin' dope and mowing lawns
And I hated all the new trends

Me and my friends sang, "Woah-ooh-whoa-oh-oh" (Whoa-ooh-whoa)
"Here's to the middle of the road
At least it's better than here"

Looking for a cause
Well all I got was Santa Claus
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high (Whoo! Way up high!)
Too scared to dream, but too dumb to die

My daddy always was on strike
Going off with the teamsters
He said that "Everything'll be alright
Not every Sunday can be Easter"
The picket line screamed, "Woah-ooh-whoa-oh-oh!" (Whoa-ooh-whoa)
"Don't cross, don't cross the line because
You'll be a scab, not a martyr!"

Looking for a cause
Well all I got was camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high (Whoo! Way up high!)
Too scared to dream, but too dumb to...
Haha... Hehe... Yeah... Hey!


Looking for a cause
Well all I got was camouflage
I'm hanging on a dream that's too dumb to die
I feel like a cello
Lost somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high (Whoo! Way up high!)
Too scared to dream, but too dumb to die10Embed
