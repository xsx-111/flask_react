Bang Bang Lyrics
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution
The blue stash of men, they claimed responsibility for the executions
Described as severely mentally disturbed
It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group
Deserve to be annihilated

I get my kicks, and I wanna start a rager
I wanna dance like I'm on the video
I got a fever for the violent behavior
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo

Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (Ah-ah)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or give me head (Ah-ah)
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier

I testify like a lullaby of memories
Broadcasting live, and it's on my radio
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam
I love a lie just like anybody else
Bang! Bang! Gimme fame!
Shoot me up to entertain (Ah-ah)
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy
You're dead! I'm well fed!
Give me death or give me head (Ah-ah)
Broadcasting from my room and playin' with my toys

I wanna be a celebrity martyr (Ah-ah)
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!) Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier
I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen
It's my private movie (Holy War!)
Oh, baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta
For this is love, or it's World War Zero!
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah


I wanna be a celebrity martyr (Ah-ah)
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!) Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier
I wanna be a celebrity martyr (Ah-ah)
The leading man in my own private drama
Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!) Hoorah! (Bang! Bang!)
The hero of the hour
Daddy's little psycho and Mommy's little soldier!33Embed
