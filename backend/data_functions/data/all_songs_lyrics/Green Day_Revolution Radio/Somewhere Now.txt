Somewhere Now Lyrics
I'm running late to somewhere now
That I don't want to be
Where the future and promises
Ain't what it used to be
I never wanted to compromise
Or bargain with my soul
How did a life on the wild side
Ever get so dull?

(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) I put the "riot" in "patriot"
And we all die in threes

I got a seat in the middle of the road
I'm gonna take my time
I shop online so I can vote
At the speed of life
I'm like a drone way up in the sky
I'm a shooting star
There's a soldier that's freaking out
P.S. This is war
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All grown up and medicated
I'm high on cellular waves
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) I put the "riot" in "patriot"
And we all die in threes
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) All we want is money and guns
A new catastrophe
(Ooh, ooh-ooh) Here comes nothing, there's nothing to lose
It's a small price we pay
When we all die in threes

(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh) Somewhere now!
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh-ooh) Somewhere now
(Ooh, ooh ooh, ooh) Somewhere now!


(Ooh) Hallelujah, I found my soul
(Ooh) Under the sofa pillows
(Ooh) Congratulations, I found myself
(One, two!) Somewhere now
Somewhere now, somewhere now4Embed
