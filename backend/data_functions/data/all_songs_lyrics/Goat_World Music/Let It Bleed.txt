Let It Bleed LyricsI m faded, I touch the block
Machine gun, through the lot
They walking past, famous peep
Gotta go, let it bleed
I gotta fall, for me at first
Let it burn, put to rest
Keep for beast, keep for us
Does it mean...
Gotta go, let it bleed

Let it bleed, bleed, let it bleed
Let it bleed, bleed, let it bleed
Let it bleed, bleed, let it bleed
Let it bleed, bleed, let it bleed
Let it bleed, bleed, let it bleed
Let it bleed, bleed, let it bleedEmbed
