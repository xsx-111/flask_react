Crawler Lyrics
Why
Searching for my way
Am
Find another way to advance
Anticipating your 
I decide
Oh, what a feeling to be
I
One that seems falsified
Making decisions of
Wanting disciples of
Making revisions of
So
But if we can flip entire lives
Till you know
The men we train, the last recall
Lost?
Oh, before it's passed down the neck
You wanted fast sand
Go in the past, boy
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?
Why am I so lost?Embed
