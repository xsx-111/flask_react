Frontier Lyrics
Don't listen to what the silvers say
Their world is long gone
A leap or push, a path of love or of blood
Break from the past or a hunt

Don't hesitate, my love, you've gone this far
Their road leads to fire
This earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe
A frontier of green or of dust

Son, it's the right time, never be afraid
The run is tonight
Move fast, stay low, be the first for they all know
Our world sends the mothers' kisses light

Do it right, mine and run, then go dark, son
Do it right now, now the light will die
Do it right, your way, love
Take the rest of me

Don't hesitate my love, you've gone this far
Son, it's the right time, never be afraid
Their road leads to fire
The run is tonight
This Earth doesn't care for what we need, what we breathe
Move fast, stay low, be the first for they all know
A frontier of green or of dust1Embed
