Last Gasp Lyrics
Paid protection at the wall
Who to turn to?
An art to life
In the line, alive

Steel my reflection, dazed
Feel my complexion on your face
I belong to you
I belong to you

Building vassals without shares
Shifting forward without aims
Are we really here?
Alive, alive

And it was in the light, you were blind
I can long too
Alive, alive
And if it's not the life you were vowed, you know

Last gasp of a dying man
Timeâ€™s on my side
Last gasp of a dying man
Ripping fibres apart
One last time before it's gone
Chilling pyres without love
Oh, the line, far beyond the wall

Picture us, you should know
You should know, know, baby, babyEmbed
