Alienation LyricsAlienation
Hey, baby, while you're dying to get inside
Who knows our name?
Who knows, who knows our name?
They take me longer
I have no feeling inside 
I've come now
You've seen me holding on
My love, please say, from the heart
 this time
Hey, baby, while you're dying to get inside
Who knows our name?
Who knows, who knows our name?
We don't have to stand without eachother
We don't have to stand without eachother
 want to without eachother
I've come now
Hey, baby, while you're dying to get inside
I've come now
Who knows our name?
Who knows, who knows our name?
They take me longer
I have no feeling inside 
I've come now
