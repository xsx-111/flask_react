SWIM Lyrics
I need to belong
I feel inside touching inside
This hoping was impossible to bear
We have an endless sadness
To watch the world dissolve
Some beginning to break
We've suffered long enough, truth

I could cry, I feel like
Why?
I could cry

I need to belong
I feel inside touching inside, why?
I know it's been rough
We have an endless sadness
To watch the world dissolve

Belong, belong, belong, belong
Belong, belong, belong, belong
Why?Embed
