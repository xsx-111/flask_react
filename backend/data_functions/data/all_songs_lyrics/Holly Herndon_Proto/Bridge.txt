Bridge LyricsHead under
Noah, an agile boy
Monkey's mad, says I'm bean mean
Okay, jayhole
Leave me be
It pours, man, it pours
F'real
This isn't even mine, it's old
I'll lose my head
Ask the guides for help, it hurt so bad
Light a da Moon, power a da ocean
Damn head, thank you
I love the Sun on my face
Now fall apart, freeze
Fight comes first
Stay here, alone, all alone
Leave me be, stay here
I remember being touched at chances
He helped train
Two kisses in row one short one long with their organs
Bruce
Press lightly
Tap, pat, feel, stroke, fondle
Why is it raining?
Nothin' like they say it is
If it gets close, kill
It hurts
Head
Have an ugly feeling about you
Bow my head
Lookin' for money on the groundEmbed
