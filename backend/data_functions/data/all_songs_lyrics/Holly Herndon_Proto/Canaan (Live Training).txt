Canaan (Live Training) LyricsHello my friends, we're bound for Canaan
We travel through the wilderness
Your company may be essential
We hope to know her tenderness
We go ahead in song and willing
Joy beyond what we understand
We give thanks for our every pleasure
Salvaged souls and restored landEmbed
