Eternal Lyrics
Love, physical love
Craving, oh love
Love in your arms
Don't stop without
Our yesterday
Eternal, eternal love

Visible you
Right in front of my eyes
Powerful
How's it possible?
Nothin' in the way now
Right in front of my eyes, eyes
I do, you belong too

Oh, I'm right here
Every night, light new
Oh, love
Baby, take a listen
Feel the sun in your eyes
Up, up
Have you a fool?
It's overflowing love for you
Wrap myself around you
Lean, lean on, on, radiate
From my fate
It belongs to you
Want to go before it all fades away
With love and contradictions so
Too much to be contained
Wrap myself around, around, around

Oh, love
Visible love
Right in front of my eyes
Wonderful
How's it possible?
It belongs to you
Right in front of my eyes, eyes, eyes with you
Baby, holding you1Embed
