Eaten by the Monster of Love Lyrics
Don't let it get me
Don't let it get me, oh

Well, it's Saturday and I'm still free
I ain't never gonna be
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)
It's hard to fight it off much more
I hear it drooling by the door
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)

It ain't a pretty site to see the way it leaves them
It chews them up and spits out creatures with those
Goo-gooey eyes, sick sickly smiles
It just ain't right

And my father said "don't worry son"
But look at him, he should've run
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)
Well, it's worse than war, it's worse than death
There ain't too many left who ain't been
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)
Buy a dog and that might help
Thought sometimes a dog gets grabbed and
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)
It ain't a pretty site to see the way it leaves them
It chews them up and spits out creatures with those
Goo-gooey eyes, sick sickly smiles
It just ain't right

Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)
Let it huff, let it puff
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me)
I hate to gripe, but I just ain't the type

Well I've known some really good good people
Overcome, and piece by piece they were
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me) (Love love love)
Sometimes it takes a nip at me
But I'm too quick to be ever
Eaten by the monster of love
(Don't let it get me) (Love love love)Embed
