Mickey Mouse Lyrics
Can you raise both your hands and clap 'em
Can you say, "sure, I'll always try"
Can you make friends among people and animals
Basically, everything is easy
Give it a try, you'll see I'm right
Cause if a mouse can be special, well so can you

And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, California

Let's have a party and be happy
Can we invite our closest friends
We can ask Donald Duck, Pluto, and all the gang

And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, California

Well, you should try to smile, dear
Get yourself a pet, deer, dog, cat, bird, pig, lamb, horse, cow, fox, wolf
Snake, ox, fish, goldfish, mouse
And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, California

Did you raise both your hands and clap 'em
Did you say, "sure, I'll always try"
Cause you look hesitant, wary, or am I wrong
You can go off and be a loner
Maybe you can't believe a mouse
But when you feel the need, come back
I'm here...for...you...and you

And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, California
And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, California
And my name is Mickey Mouse
To my right is Minnie Mouse
And we own a little place in Disneyland, CaliforniaEmbed
