Sherlock Holmes LyricsFog matters to you and me
But it can't touch Sherlock Holmes
Dogs bark and he knows their breed
And knows where they went last night
Knows their masters too
Oh baby, hold me tight
Just pretend I'm Sherlock Holmes
Just pretend I'm Sherlock Holmes
Just pretend I'm Sherlock Holmes
(Uh-oh, Uh-oh, Uh-oh)
Stay, don't give me that same old act
I can call in Sherlock Holmes
He'll want your biography, and pictures of you in lace
And satin looking great
Oh baby, hold me tight
Spend the night with Sherlock Holmes
Hold me tight like Sherlock Holmes
Just pretend I'm Sherlock Holmes
(Uh-oh, Uh-oh, Uh-oh)
Do you want to have fun
Do you want a good time
Do you want me to laugh
Do you want me to cry
Do you want me to dance
Do you want me to sing
Do you want me to joke
Should I be more like him
Oh yeah
I can dance like Sherlock Holmes
I can sing like Sherlock Holmes
But can't be Sherlock Holmes
(Uh-oh, Uh-oh, Uh-oh)
I can dance like Sherlock Holmes
I can sing like Sherlock Holmes
But I can't be Sherlock Holmes
(Uh-oh, Uh-oh, Uh-oh)1Embed
