The Decline and Fall of Me LyricsNow I stutter, now I dribble
Other than that, I'm lots like I was then
The decline and fall of me
I just shaved my nose off, oh well
Other than that, I'm lots like I was then
The decline and fall of me
If I had a hammer I would drop it and break it
Look at the pieces
Now I've got a hobby, I collect frozen pizzas
Check out my pizzas
Now your jokes seem really funny
Other than that, I'm lots like I was then
Ooh, the decline and fall of me
Where's my mouth, man, this eating is rough on the shirts
Gee, I'm sorry about the thermometer, nurse
Would you tell me again, which are girls, which are guys
Gee, I thought that this finger meant so long, goodbye
Chart position, bubbling under
Drowning and goodbye future Mrs. Mael
The decline and fall, decline and fall
Decline and fall of me
I'm fading away
I'm fading away
I'm fading awayEmbed
