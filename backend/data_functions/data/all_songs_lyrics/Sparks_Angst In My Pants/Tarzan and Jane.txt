Tarzan and Jane LyricsThere's a riot in Room 42
It was Chemistry, now it's a zoo
And they kicked out the teacher, Miss Prune
Tuned the heat up to one hundred two
Tarzan and Jane
Tarzan and Jane
Now they're ripping their shirts and their tights
Now they're swinging from fluorescent lights
Look at Bob, he was getting straight A's
Who's he carrying 'round on his face
Tarzan and Jane
Tarzan and Jane
Now they've called in the men wearing blue
There's a cameraman from Channel 2
On the news at eleven does Edgar Rice Burroughs
Get royalties on local news
Tarzan and Jane
Tarzan and Jane
Well, tomorrow at 7:04
As the principal says "shut the door"
They'll be 25 Tarzans and 25 Janes
And a chimp from Zoology 4
Tarzan and Jane
