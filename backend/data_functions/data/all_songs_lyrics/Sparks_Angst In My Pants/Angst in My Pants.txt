Angst in My Pants Lyrics
I hope it doesn't show
It'll go away
It's just a passing phase
It'll go away

You can dress nautical
Learn to tie knots
Take lots of Dramamine
Out on your yacht
But when you're all alone
And nothing bites
You'll wish you stayed at home
With someone nice
But when you think you made it disappear
It comes again, "Hello, I'm here"
And I've got angst in my pants
You can be smart as hell
Know how to add
Know how to figure things
On yellow pads
Answer so no one knows
What you just said
But when you're all alone
You and your head
What's the computer say, it's mumbling now
It says, "Hey, Joe"
It's spelled it out
And you've got angst in your pants
You've got angst in your pants
(But when you think)
But when you think you've made it disappear
You're sure you made it disappear
And you've still got angst in your pants

I hope it doesn't show
It'll go 'way
It's just a passing phase
It'll go 'way
I hope it doesn't show
It'll go 'way
Give it a hundred years
It won't go 'way

And I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pants
I've got angst in my pantsEmbed
