I Predict LyricsYou're gonna take a walk in the rain
And you're gonna get wet
I predict
You're gonna eat a bowl of chow mein
And be hungry real soon
I predict
Are my sources correct?
I predict
They're gonna find the Queen is a man
But that Philip don't care
I predict
Lassie will prove that Elvis and her
Had a fleeting affair
I predict
Are my sources correct?
Are my sources correct?
Yes, I know they're correct
I predict
Men, if you say your prayers
You'll never lose your hair
L.A. is safe
Ain't gonna quake
Ain't gonna quake, I predict
And somebody's gonna die
But I can't reveal who
Cold beer will cure a cold
Cold beer and pretzels takes care of cancer
Moscow will march to France
They'll do the Can-Can dance
Don't worry, it'll work out
Maxim's will throw them out
They're gonna stop Saturday night
So you better have fun now
I predict
They're gonna stop having the sun
So you better get tan now
And this song will fade out
Yes, this song will fade out
And this song will fade out
I predict
And this song will fade out
Yes, this song will fade out
And this song will fade out
I predict
And this song will fade out
Yes, this song will fade out
And this song will fade out
I predict
And this song will fade out
Yes, this song will fade out
And this song will fade out
I predict
And this song will fade out
Yes, this song will fade out
And this song will fade out
And this song will fade out
Yes, this song will fade out
And this song will fade outEmbed
