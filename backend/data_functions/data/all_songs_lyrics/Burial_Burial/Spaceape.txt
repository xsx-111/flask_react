Spaceape Lyrics
Victims themselves of a close encounter
Desperate abducters, constructers become infected, vexed
By an alien virus, so alien, so viral
Living spaceapes, creatures, covered, smothered in writhing tentacles
Stimulating the audio nerve directly
You wanna come flex with me?

Hallucinating senses individually, insidiously
Are in any combination, rhythmically
Shifting gears, focus upon intensity
Wait, big people a talk nobody try fuck with i-man clarity
Mind starts slippin' to familiar tracks
Bending warping, interfering with the facts
Sensory language leaves us with no habit for lying
We are hostile aliens, immune from dying

Don't harass me for not behaving correct
I only want to slide my arm round your neck
Interpretation, electro-chemical stimulation
The sensation you feel is entirely real
All that we share is our struggle for silence
We don't wanna bother with no arms house business
No shooting no violence
Sensory language twist snake like a limb
Flexible, versitile, curious like twins
Transparent in the way that it moves
With sufficient memory
To cut clean through you
Victims themselves, from a close encounter
Desperate abductors, constructors, becoming infected, vexed
By an alien virus, so alien, so viral
Living spaceapes, creatures, covered, smothered in writhing tentacles
Stimulating the audio nerve directly
You wanna come flex with me

Hallucinating senses individually, insidiously
Are in any combination, rhythmically
Mind starts slippin familar tracks
Bending warping, interfering with the facts
Sensory language leaves us with no habit for lying
We are hostile aliens, immune from dyingEmbed
