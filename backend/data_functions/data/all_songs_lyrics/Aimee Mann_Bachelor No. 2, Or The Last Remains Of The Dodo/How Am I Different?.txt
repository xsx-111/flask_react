How Am I Different? Lyrics
I can't do it, I can't conceive
You're everything you're trying to make me believe
Cause this show is too well designed
Too well to be held with only me in mind

And how am I different?
How am I different?
How am I different?

I can't do it, so move along
Do you really want to wait until I prove you wrong?
And don't tell me, let me guess
I could change it all around if I would just say yes

But how am I different?
How am I different?
How am I different?

And just one question before I pack
When you fuck it up later
Do I get my money back?
I can't do it and as for you
Can you in good conscience even ask me to
'Cause what do you care about the great divide
As long as you come down on the winner's side

And how am I different?
How am I different?
How am I different?

Just one question before I buy
When you fuck it up later
Do I get my money back?2Embed
