Rage in Eden Lyrics
We sit and watch these lifeless forms
Stark and petrified
The high suspense of an empty stage
Drawing in clutching to its breast
With murmured words we sigh and focus on the main facade

Beyond the hard reluctant windows
News from magazines
We wrote their names on books we'd borrowed
As if to bring us closer still
And threw it all away to focus on the main facade
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence
But no one could see the end

(Ooo, I remember, death in the afternoon
Oh, I remember, death in the afternoon)

And they were the new gods
And they shone on high
Their heavy perfume of the night
Sucked them down in red tide
All is through the looking glass focus on the main facade
Rage in Eden jigsaw sequence
But no one could see the end
(Ooo, I remember, death in the afternoon
Oh, I remember, death in the afternoon)

Disciples of the new way
Portraits in the sand
See when they run their longest mile
Holding caps in wet hand
Eyes upon them try to focus on the main facade
Rage In Eden jigsaw sequence
But no one could see the end

(Ooo, I remember, death in the afternoon
Oh, I remember, death in the afternoon
Ooo, I remember, death in the afternoon
Oh, I remember, death in the afternoon
Ooo, I remember, death in the afternoon
Oh, I remember, death in the afternoon
Ooo, I remember, death in the afternoon
Oh, I remember, death in the afternoon)
