Treat Her Right Lyrics
I wanna tell you a story
That every man oughta know
If you want a little lovin', yeah, ha
You gotta start real slow, huh, hey

Now, if you just treat her right now
Then she'll love you tonight now, ha

Squeeze her real gentle
Ah, just make her feel good and
Tell her that you love her
Just like you know you should

'Cause if you just treat her right
She's gonna love you tonight now, ha


You got to practice my method
Just as hard as you can
You're gonna win a reputation
As a one woman man, ha
'Cause if you love her tonight
She's gonna treat you right
