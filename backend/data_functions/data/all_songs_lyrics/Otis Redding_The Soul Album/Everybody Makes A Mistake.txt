Everybody Makes A Mistake Lyrics
Out in the street, late all night long
While that one who love me
Man, she was sitting at home
Oh, I've been worried
I was a fool
Paying the bills and running around heavy, gone, man
I know everybody makes a mistake sometimes

But when I got home, oh
My baby, she was gone
And I found a letter
Right there on the kitchen floor, it read:
"I tried to wait for you to come, honey
But like a fool you were running around, doing me wrong"
I'm sorry, I know, baby
Everybody makes a mistake sometimes
I know I make one

And oh
"So if you are running around with somebody else
Try to satisfy, man, you can't satisfy your selfish self
So, uh, man, you gotta take heed
Listen to every word I'm saying
'Cause that same thing, man, might happen to you one day
And you know that everybody
Man, I know that everybody makes a mistake sometimes
I know, because I've made mine
I made a great big one
Man, I made a, I made a great big one
I can't do it no more
No, I'm never gonna do it
I want you to come back to me, baby
And help me if you would, baby
I love you, darling
I love you, baby
Honey, I won't stay out in the street all night
I won't stay out in the street, baby
I'll just sit home with you, darling
And hold your trembling hand
So just come back to me, babyEmbed
