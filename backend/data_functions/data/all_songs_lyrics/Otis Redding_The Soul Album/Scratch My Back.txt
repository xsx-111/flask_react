Scratch My Back Lyrics
I'm itchin'
This Black guy don't know where to scratch
Come here, baby, ha
Ah, and scratch my back
Well, I know you can do it, honey
So baby let's get to it

Ooh, I'm itchin'
Itchin' all over
Come on
Not so hard, scratch the back, baby
Scratch it, scratch it

You know what to do
Oh, you hit me, baby
Scratch it, scratch it, honey
Ah, it's making me feel good
I know that you know how to do that
Now come on and scratch it right there
Scratch it, scratch it, scratch it, baby
Come now, come on, and just keep on scratchin' there, baby
Come on, come on, do it right here, baby
Come on and scratch it hard, huh
Come on and make me feel good
Just like a rooster would - you know how they scratch it, ha
Scratch scratch, scratch scratch, scratch
Scratch scratch, scratch scratch, scratch
Scratch scratch, scratch scratch, scratchEmbed
