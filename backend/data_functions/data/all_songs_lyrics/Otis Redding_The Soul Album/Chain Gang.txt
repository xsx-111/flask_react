Chain Gang LyricsThat's the sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
They're working on the chain gang
All day long you hear them, pooh
I'm going home, just one of these ole days
Man, i'm going home to see my woman
For my love's so dear
But that means why
I gotta work right here now, huh
And that's the sound of the men
They're just working on the chain gang
That's the sound of the men
They're working on the highways and the biways
That's the sound of the men
Working on the highway and biway
All day long they're going, pooh
Man, i'm going home to see that woman
For my love's so dear
I gotta see the woman
For my love's so well
But that means why
I gotta work right here now, huh
Now that's the sound of us mens
When we're working on the chain gang
Oh, it's allright now, hoo
Out there
That's the sound of the men
When they're working on the chain gang, ha
That's the sound of the men
When they're working on the chain gang
All day long you hear them, pooh
Man, i'm going home one of these ole days
Man i'm going home
I got to see the woman
Whom my love's so dear
But that means why
I've gotta sit right here now, ha
Now that's the sounds of the mens
Working on the chain gang
Working, we're working
Ah, we're working man
Got to be working
Oh, every day we work a little bit stronger
Every night, man, a few bit longer
Got to be working, man
The time is going up
We got to be working, man...Embed
