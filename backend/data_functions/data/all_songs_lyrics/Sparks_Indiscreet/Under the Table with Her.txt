Under the Table with Her LyricsNobody misses diminutive offspring
Not when there's big wigs there, there
Dinner for twelve is now dinner for ten
'Cause I'm under the table with her
I give a yelp and they throw me a cutlet
Somebody pats her hair, hair
Everyone's nice to the subhuman species
I'm under the table with her
People all around the world are having only rice and tea
Two of them should come and take the place of Laura Lee and me
Nobody misses diminutive offspring
Not when there's big wigs there, there
Dinner for twelve is now dinner for ten
'Cause I'm under the table with her
I'm under the table with her
People all around the world are having only rice and tea
Two of them should come and take the place of Laura Lee and me
Nobody misses diminutive offspring
Not when there's big wigs there, there
Dinner for twelve is now dinner for ten
'Cause I'm under the table with her
I'm under the table, I'm under the table, I'm under the table with herEmbed
