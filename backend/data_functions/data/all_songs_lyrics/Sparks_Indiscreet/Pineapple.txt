Pineapple LyricsTropical air helps us harvest all year
And serves to promote the vitamin C content
In turn yielding greater demand
Pineapple
Got to send a case to the city jail
The warden likes it because it won't conceal
Any sort of handmade weapons
That are baked right into their buns
And the taste is delectable
But won't the prisoners hit the table and shout
Pineapple, pineapple
Pineapple fulfills every need
Pineapple (shares are gonna divide)
Pineapple (if in us you confide)
Got a contract for all of the schools
They will use it for all of their meals
Sure, the kids will throw it real far
'Cause it ain't a milk chocolate bar
But you know it don't stain so bad
But won't they fling it at a friend and then shout
Pineapple (tastes too healthy to me)
Pineapple: it's filled with vitamin C
Pineapple: fulfills every need
Pineapple: to all the ships at sea
Pineapple (for the English at tea)
Pineapple (to the Siamese twins)
Pineapple: to heal those who have sinned
Ship some to the Alpine skiing team
The coach won't have to worry 'bout the calories
Sure it ain't strudel, they're nice
But it helps your balance on ice
Puts you back on the winning trail
But don't the players moan and groan and then shout
Pineapple (we get it every old night)
Pineapple (but we're winning all right)
Pineapple fulfills every need
Pineapple (shares are gonna divide)
Pineapple (if in us you confide)
Pineapple fulfills every need
Pineapple (upward trends are foreseen)
Pineapple (so invest in Big P)
Pineapple fulfills every need
Pineapple (and the tins can be used)
Pineapple (for anything that you choose)
Pineapple, pineapple
So, we'll jet you there, breathe the Hawaiian air
Where hula is life, and luaus are for the wife
So visit our factory soon1Embed
