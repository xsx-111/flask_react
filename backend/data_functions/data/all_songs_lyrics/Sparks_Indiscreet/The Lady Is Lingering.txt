The Lady Is Lingering LyricsEvery word pronounced distinctly, slowly
There are no contractions, nothing slurred
Unprepared you watch in rank amazement
As she lights her cigarette and stirs
Every motion is complete, no editing of anything
Encouraging, encouraging, and not the
Customary bill of fare
Can't you see the lady is lingering (lingering)
This lady's lingering, and you cannot believe the reason why
Every sip is of the smallest quantity
That still denotes apparent thirst
Every question is a means to draw long answers
Play the fool, it doesn't hurt
Splitting, splitting headache coming
Get up early in the morning
Where are the funny phrases
That are always followed by goodbye

Is it now all up to you, do you now
Guide the evening, or do you await
A further signal, a look, a touch, a sigh

Risky business, all this waiting, wondering
A risky business, all this waiting, wondering
A risky business, all this waiting, wondering
A risky business, all this waiting, wondering
