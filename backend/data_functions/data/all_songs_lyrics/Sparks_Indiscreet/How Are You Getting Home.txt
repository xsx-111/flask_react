How Are You Getting Home LyricsHow are you getting home
It's on my way, so let me take you home
Home, home sweet home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home, I'm curious
No, I'm really only curious
How are you getting home
Get away from here
Let's get away from here
I hope you live a million miles away
I could take you half way home tonight
Tomorrow you'll be home
Tell me how you're getting home
We got one thing in common baby
We're too good to be at this party
We're too good to be anywhere but
Inside my car
How are you getting home
It's on my way, so let me take you home
Home, home sweet home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home, I'm curious
No, I'm really only curious
How are you getting home
Well, get away from here
Let's get away from here
I hope you live a million miles away
I could take you half way home tonight
Tomorrow you'll be home
Tell me how you're getting home
Don't let me push you baby
What I like is your independence
Real spunk, real independence
And there's my car
How are you getting home
It's on my way, so let me take you home
Home, home sweet home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How are you getting home
It's on my way, so let me take you home
Home, home sweet home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home, I'm curious
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home, I'm curious
Let's get away from here
Let's get away from here
I hope you live a million miles away
Let's get away from here
Let's get away from here
I hope you live a million miles away
How're you getting home
How're you getting home
How're you getting home, I'm curious
Let's get away from here
I hope you live a million miles away
How're you getting home...Embed
