Happy Hunting Ground LyricsHappy hunting ground, happy hunting ground
They don't talk or act like you do
Happy hunting ground, happy hunting ground
No they sure don't look like you
Who, what, when, where and why everyday
Identify every disease
I drew a blank in my language
And Latin and Spanish and Greek
Thrown out, thrown out, so happy at first
I danced 'til I wore out my shoes
Now I'm in trouble, I know it
Oh, please let me back into school
Back in the happy hunting ground
Where all around are fair, fair game
I need the happy hunting ground
'Cause all around it's not the same
How to say it, and not to offend
Well, you're still inside it's OK
As soon as a girl leaves the refuge
Out go the reason they're great
Hips are spreading, and never a smile
They always demand that they drive
Well, I've got to get back inside there
Back where at least they're alive
Back in the happy hunting ground
Where all around are fair, fair game
I need the happy hunting ground
'Cause all around it's not the same
Happy hunting ground, happy hunting ground
They can sort of dance like you do
Happy hunting ground, happy hunting ground
But they just can't last like you
Some are coming to learn how to read
Others to learn how to write
But I want a better selection
It's larger but poorer outside
It's fair, fair game inside
It's fair, fair game inside
It's fair, fair game inside
It's fair, fair game inside
It's fair, fair game inside
It's fair, fair game inside
It's fair, fair game inside
Back in the happy hunting ground
Where all around are fair, fair game
I need the happy hunting ground
'Cause all around it's not the same
It's fair fair game inside
It's fair fair game inside
It's fair fair game inside
It's fair fair game inside
Back in the happy hunting ground
Where all around are fair, fair game
I need the happy hunting ground
'Cause all around it's not the same
Back in the happy hunting ground
Where all around are fair, fair game
I need the happy hunting ground
'Cause all around it's not the same
Back in the happy hunting ground
Where all around are fair, fair game
I need the happy hunting ground
'Cause all around it's not the sameEmbed
