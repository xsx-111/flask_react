Looks, Looks, Looks LyricsLooks, looks, looks
You had sense, you had style, you had cash galore
Looks, looks, looks
You employed her and dressed her in formal fashion
Still you bore her because you ain't got a
Nose that's straight, a set of perfect teeth
You got a built-in seat, that makes you look effete
You know that looks, looks, looks, are why you rely on books
Looks, looks, looks
From the eye to the brain's just an inch or two
Looks, looks, looks
From the eye to the heart's only slightly farther
The smart grow smarter, but still can't compete
And they know deep down that they are scarred for life
And that a face can launch a thousand hips
It's gonna be all right
If it ain't, don't blame me, it's your looks
At night she masquerades her passion covered by a veil of calm
Say, put on your shoes
Say, put on your shoes
No use one look at her and anyone can tell that she's on fire
Spot her error
Spot her error
Spot her error
Well, now she's all over you
Looks, looks, looks
No, it's not very hard to make history
Looks, looks, looks
Just some cavalry and a good uniform that fits in places
Where everyone tends to look and marvel
At the way you lead them on and
Look and marvel at the way you win because of
Looks, looks, looks
As long as you're long on looks
Spot her error
Spot her error
Spot her error
Well, now she's all over you
Looks, looks, looks
Far away, close at hand, it's the only thing
Looks, looks, looks
On the seas in the sand, any place is laced with those who have it
And those who can only look1Embed
