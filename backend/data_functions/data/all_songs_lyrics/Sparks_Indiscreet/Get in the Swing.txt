Get in the Swing LyricsGet in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
My friends are here
Mind if you go out and not come back again
Well, thanks a lot
Hooray, hooray
The night is younger than the girl who's got the touch
But not by much
Well, I ain't no Freud, I'm from L.A
But I know certain things
That they also serve who sit and wait
They're cheaper than paintings
And don't need explaining
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
When salmon spawn
A ton of water blocks their motion
Spoils their game
But on they go
Thrashing 'til their mission is fulfilled or else
Oh, but they have their friends
And have a warm bed waiting
Just like I do with you
I'm happy, so happy, I'm happy, oh happy
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
All for one, one for all
All for one, one for all
All for one, one for all
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Hello down there
This is your creator with a questionnaire
Hello up there
I don't have the time to fill out questionnaires
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything
Get in the swing, pal
Get in the swing
With everybody and everything...Embed
