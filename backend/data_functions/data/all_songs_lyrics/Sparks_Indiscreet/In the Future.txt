In the Future LyricsIt's winter, it's raining
You're tired, she's fainting
You're bitter, she's brooding
But don't be disenchanted
'Cause you can barely stand it
The sweep and the grandeur
The scope and the laughter
The future, the future
The future's got it covered
With what will be discovered
In the future fun is fun
In the future, lots of sun
I'll be there, it's up to you
You'll be there if you don't do nothing foolish
You'll love it, I know it
I know what you like and
You'll love it, I know it
We'll need some vintage vino
So wash your feet and stamp away
Coming soon and everywhere
Everyone will walk on air
Now it seems so far away
But each day it's getting closer and closer
Convenience and pleasure
All blended together
And culture, and madness
You think you've seen it all
You've seen it all except the futureEmbed
