Tits LyricsHarry, it's good of you to stay
Hear every word I say
And not just duck away
God, these drinks are something warm and watered down
Barkeep, how 'bout some ice
Hey, Harry sit back down
Say, that little thing there's fine from behind
They all look good after three or four
So drink Harry, drink Harry, drink 'til you can't see no more
Of anything, no more of anything
Drink Harry, drink Harry, drink 'til you can't see no more
For months, for years
Tits were once a source of fun and games at home
And now she says, tits are only there to feed our little Joe
So that he'll grow
Harry, it's really rough at home
I've caught her on the phone
Hey, who's that on the phone?
Oh, that's no one dear
The standard sort of line
Harry, you know me well
You know that I'm not blind
Hey, you ain't been drinking
Don't you know I'm buying?
They all taste good after three or four
So drink Harry, drink Harry, drink 'til you can't drink no more
Of anything, no more of anything
Drink Harry, drink 'til you can't drink no more
How well I know
Tits were only there for fun and games at home
And now she says, tits are only there to feed our little Joe
So that he'll grow
God, the room is spinning round
Hey, drive me home old pal
God, you sure get around
Harry, I know it's you who's breaking up my home
Harry, don't say a word, just drop me off at home
Harry, forgive me Harry, let's have just one more
It's all so good after three or four
It's all so good after three or four
It's all so good after three or four
So let's drink Harry, drink 'til we can't drink no more
Of anything, no more of anything
Drink Harry, drink Harry, drink 'til we can't drink no more
How well I know
Tits were once a source of fun and games at home
And now she says, tits are only there to feed our little Joe
So that he'll grow into a man
So let's drink Harry, drink 'til we can't see no more...1Embed
