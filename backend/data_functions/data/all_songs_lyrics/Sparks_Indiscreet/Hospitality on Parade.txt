Hospitality on Parade LyricsSomeday we'll have one extra coastline
We'll tire of the Atlantic
By then we'll be rid of your lot
A shot heard 'round the world will soon be shot, will soon be shot
'Til then have some tea and tobacco
Hey Jenny meet your master
Be nice, show him kindness and such
Be kind to our master
But a feeling is a-brewing that we don't need any masters
'Cause we all can be a master and we all can be a king
We speak and we sing the way that you do
And showed you our hospitality on parade
But now we are we, we're no longer you
Tara to that hospitality on parade
Today you're going to find their descendants
In places all around you
You're faced with the easiest task
How best to act a king when always treated like a king
Lunch counters, at banks and the theatre
Kind help right there to serve you
Men selling, and girls selling too
And everyone's special
We all are someone special
Yes, we all are someone special
For we all are someone special
Where the customer is king
Whoever you are, whoever you bring
You'll find that hospitality on parade
However you look, you're always a king
Wherever there's hospitality on parade
I'm special, you're special
He's special, she's special
We're all someone special
And I am the king
Whoever you are, whoever you bring
You'll find that hospitality on parade
However you look, you're always a king
Wherever there's hospitality on parade
Whoever you are, whoever you bring
You'll find that hospitality on parade
However you look, you're always a king
Where ever there's hospitality on paradeEmbed
