Miss the Start, Miss the End LyricsNeither has a predilection, neither has an afterthought
And neither chair gets warm at all and neither takes their jacket off
For this they'll pay the same money to see the event
As you and I and we'll see it all
They've never seen a curtain rise, a kick-off or the
Final gun and never have they seen the titles flashing cross the rising sun
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done, I will be silent again
Quiet now, It's all gonna begin
Miss the start, miss the end
'Cause they're such very good friends
And there are things to be loved and things to only attend
Miss the start, miss the end
The opening bars and the closing bars might as well not exist
They're not needed, needed, really needed
You and I have got to see the start
You and I have got to see the end
We need more than just each other
So much more than just each other
They don't need more than each other
Not much more than just each other
They don't need the total picture, just a drawing of each other
Hung inside their bungalow, where wondrous things are all discovered
You and I must see how it starts and ends
And tell them what they missed once again1Embed
