Hold on Till May Lyrics
She sits up high, surrounded by the sun
One million branches and she loves every one
"Mom and dad, did you search for me?
I've been up here so long I'm going crazy"

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
3, 2, 1 - Where did it go?

"Now don't be crazy, yes, now of course you can stay here"
Been in a touring band for going on ten years
"Big deal", she said, "I guess you're official."
I only said it because I know what it's like to feel burned out!
It gets you down, we've all been there sometimes
But tonight, I'll make you feel beautiful once again

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
3, 2, 1 - Where did it go?
If I were you, I'd put that away
See, you're just wasted and thinking about the past again
Darling, you'll be okay
And she said
"If you were me, you'd do the same
Cause I can't take anymore
I'll draw the shades and close the door
Everything's not alright and I would rather”

And as the sun went down
We ended up on the ground
I heard the train shake the windows
You screamed over the sound
And as we own this night
I put your body to the test with mine
This love was out of control
Tell me, where did it go?55Embed
