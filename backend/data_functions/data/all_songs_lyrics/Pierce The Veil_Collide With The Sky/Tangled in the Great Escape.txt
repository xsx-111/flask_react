Tangled in the Great Escape Lyrics
Well, don't you say that had a part of it?
Guess we'll never know
Oh, would you say that had a part of it?
Well, I guess we'll never know
Constant recovery
I see you choke and it takes my breath away
When all is good, we close our eyes

They all accept the lie
So bury what you are outside
Brother, promise you won't leave me

I know you're tortured within
Your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander, my friend

Will somebody believe in this suicide?
Am I the only one that thinks that you should stay alive?
Oh, I became the shame as you backed up on the ropes
To arm yourself and hide
So, I scream "Mayday, I'm in trouble
Send somebody on the double"
Scratching at the floor inside my mind
They all accept the lie
So bury what you are outside
Brother, please don't be afraid of me

I know you're tortured within
Your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander, my friend

I let you down
And I started to run
Never meant to be your pain
What have I become?
Show me it, show me the way back
Show me the way back
Show me the way back home

I know you're tortured within
Your eyes look hungry again
But I'll never wander, my friend
No, I'll never wander again

This is not what I want
But it’s now what I need
This is not what I want
But it’s now what I need
This is not what I want
But it’s now what I need
This is not what I want
But it’s now what I need
Can I just have one more taste?
Just to make it through the day?
You're tangled in
You're tangled in the great escape

Great escape, oh
I never meant to hurt nobody, no no, yeah
I never meant to hurt you, no no no no
I only meant to do this to myself, to myself, to myself
Great escape
Great escape
Great escape
Oh, great escape
Let me out of this, yeah
Let me out of this, yeah25Embed
