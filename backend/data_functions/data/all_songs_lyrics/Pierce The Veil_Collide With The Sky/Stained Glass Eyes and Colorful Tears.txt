Stained Glass Eyes and Colorful Tears Lyrics
I changed your mind and ended up here
Through stained glass eyes and colorful tears

Fine, maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to God, I'm gonna change the world
And I promise you, someday we'll tell ourselves
"Oh my god, this is paradise"

I cherish my American girl
She holds them down while I destroy the world
My desperate crimes, she don't seem to care, oh yeah
She bites her tongue, so we can tell each other
"Baby, this is paradise and it's so goddamn good."
Now we live like we should

Fine, maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to God, I'm gonna change the world
And I promise you, someday we'll tell ourselves
"Oh my god, this is paradise"

Fine, maybe I'll pretend right now
But I swear to God, I'm gonna change the world
And I promise you, someday we'll tell ourselves
"Oh my god, this is paradise"12Embed
