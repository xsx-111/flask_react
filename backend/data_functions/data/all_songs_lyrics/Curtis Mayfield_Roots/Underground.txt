Underground Lyrics
Underground
We now have to deal with our own self-destruction
We cannot live on the surface of our Earth any longer
There is now pollution in every natural mineral and material taken from the land
We have truly become a vast wasteland
And now, underground
How will we deal with our society of discrimination among people?
Near to Hell
It's just as well
What will become of our children?
Underground

Familiar music
Familiar sound
There's mutual thoughts
For the underground
Long-range sight
For an eternal night
Future prophecy
For the mass, you see
There'll be equal stay
And equal play
The underground
Where none can betray
The underground
The underground

There will be no light
So there can be no sight
And you'll judge your fellow man, understand
By what is right
We'll all turn black, black, black, black, black
So who's to know?
As a matter of fact
Color, creed, and breed must go

The underground
The underground

Familiar music
Familiar sound
There's mutual thoughts
For the underground
Long-range sight
For an eternal night
Future prophecy
For the mass, you see
The underground
The underground
The undergroundEmbed
