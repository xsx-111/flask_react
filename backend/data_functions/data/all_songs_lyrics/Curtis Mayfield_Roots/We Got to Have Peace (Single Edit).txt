We Got to Have Peace (Single Edit) Lyrics
We got to have peace
To keep the world alive and war to cease
We got to have joy
True in our hearts with strength we can't destroy
People hear us
Through our voice, the world knows there's no choice
We're begging, save the children
The little ones who just don't understand
Give them a chance
To breed their young and help purify the land
People hear us (People hear us)
Through our voice, the world knows there's no choice

And the people in our neighborhood
They would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land
Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

He'd say, "We got to have peace"
To keep the world alive and war to cease
We got to have joy
True in our hearts with a strength we can't destroy
People hear us (People hear us)
Through our voice, the world knows there's no choice

And the people in our neighborhood
They would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land
Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

He'd say, "We got to have peace"
Ah-hah, we got to have peace
Let the world know it
Peace, peace, peace
Ah-hah, we got to have peace

People hear us (People hear us)
Through our voice, the world knows there's no choice
Save the children
Save the children
Save the children

And the people in our neighborhood
They would if they only could
Meet and shake the other's hand
Work together for the good of the land
Give us all an equal chance
It could be such a sweet romance
And the soldiers who are dead and gone
If only we could bring back one

He'd say, "We got to have peace"
Lord, we got to have peace

Let the people say it
Peace, peace, peace
Ah-hah, we got to have peace
I say, peace, peace, peaceEmbed
