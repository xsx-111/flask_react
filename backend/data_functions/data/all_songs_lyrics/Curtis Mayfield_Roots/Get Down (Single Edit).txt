Get Down (Single Edit) Lyrics
Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood
Get down, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Get down, baby
After life and desire, there is nothing left

We're all children of the world
A hungry man in search for a hungry girl
It’s strange, so plain we're all cannibal
The most wasted and two-faced of all animals

Get down, get down
Get down, get down

Take my soul, baby
When you real I can feel so much desire
Take my soul, baby
Life unfolds from my soul and it's all afire
So get down, just get down

Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood
Take my soul, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Take my soul, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get downEmbed
