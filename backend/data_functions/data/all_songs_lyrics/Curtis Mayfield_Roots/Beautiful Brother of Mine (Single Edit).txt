Beautiful Brother of Mine (Single Edit) Lyrics
Beautiful brother of mine
Whatever may be your birth sign
We are not of the same seed
Although we are both the same breed
Together we're truly Black power
Learning to trust by the hour
Loving our women now more
Respecting what Black is now for

And we've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We've got love (We got love)

Beautiful sister of mine
I'm glad we both think it's now time
To really show what we can do
Improving Black pride is now true
At last we've outgrown Uncle Tom
Devoting more time in the slum
Showing our own a new pride
That makes us feel all good inside
And we've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We got love

At last the mass agree
As to how we want to be
With love, respect and pride
Success will be on our side, side
At last we are now on the right case
Inspiring the young of our race
Pushing all opposition out
Success is now without a doubt

We've got love
We've got love
We've got love
We've got love
We've got love
We've got love
We've got loveEmbed
