Beautiful Brother Of Mine Lyrics
Beautiful brother of mine
Whatever may be your birth sign
We are not of the same seed
Although we are both the same breed
Together we're truly Black power (Power)
Learning to trust by the hour (Hour)
Loving our women now more (We love more)
Respecting what Black is now for

And we've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We've got love (We got love)

Beautiful sister of mine
I'm glad we both think it's now time
To really show what we can do
Improving Black pride is now true
At last we've outgrown Uncle Tom (Uncle Tom)
Devoting more time in the slum (In the slum)
Showing our own a new pride (We have pride)
That makes us feel all good inside
And we've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We got love

At last the mass agree
As how we want to be
With love, respect and pride
Success will be on our side, side
At last we are now on the right case
Inspiring the young of our race
Pushing all opposition out
Success is now without a doubt

Beautiful brother of mine
Whatever may be your birth sign
We are not of the same seed
Although we are both the same breed
Together we're truly Black power (Power)
Learning to trust by the hour (Hour)
Loving our women now more (We love more)
Respecting what Black is now for
And we've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We got it (We've got love)

Three centuries ago (We got love)
Few people would know (We got love)
That we the strong Black (We got love)
Would survive the attack (We got love)
After the paying finally (We got love)
We set out to be free (We got love)
Now what have we got? (We've got love)
We got it (We got love)
We got it (We got love)
We got it (We got love)

We've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We got it (We got love)

Beautiful sister of mine
I'm glad we both think it's now time
To really show what we can do
Improving Black pride is down truth
At last we've outgrown Uncle Tom (Uncle Tom)
Devoting more time in the slum (In the slum)
Teaching our own a new pride (We have pride)
That makes us feel all good inside
And we've got love
We've got love
We've got love (We got love)
We got love

We got love (We got love)
We got love
We got it (We got love)
We got love
We got it (We got love)
We got itEmbed
