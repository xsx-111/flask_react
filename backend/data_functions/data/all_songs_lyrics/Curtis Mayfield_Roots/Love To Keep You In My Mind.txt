Love To Keep You In My Mind Lyrics
Through loving you I seem to feel a spirit
Deep inside of me, preciously guiding me
My woman of all women dear to me
Forever love me, for I need you constantly

Spirit and Holy Ghost in me
Help me to keep this love I need
She is so much like your touch divine

Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
Just love to keep you in my mind

Your face is so mysteriously kind
I bet that love is partial to your sign
Somehow I do believe that you are mine
Proving in a natural way things that I could never think to say

Spirit and Holy Ghost in me
Help me to keep this love I need
She is so much like your touch divine
Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
Just love to keep you in my mind


The magic that you secretly possess
Ooh, I must confess, must be working at its best
My love for you is one you'll always know
Wherever we may go, you will find that it is so

Spirit and Holy Ghost in me
Help me to keep this love I need
She is so much like your touch divine

Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
I just love to keep you in my mindEmbed
