Jasper LyricsTime is as weak as water
I'm kneeling on the shore
Showers, palmfronds
Cross me spilling
Silver, sidewalks
Lips so red world so wide
Around my head
Waiting
Time is as weak as water
I taught myself a lesson
I put myself to sleep
Sirens, jasmin
Jasper, flagpole
Tree top, sidewalk
Thursday night, magnolia
Along my street
Later
I taught myself a lessonEmbed
