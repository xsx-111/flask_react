Why You Hurt Me Lyrics
I know of somebody out there who had a nasty nasty
Nasty friend who wanna go around humping everybody
Can I get a ho? You know what I'm saying? So
I'mma talk about this one I had a few years ago

I had a friend named Cutie Tootie
Tootie turned tricks to get some Gucci
Known as loose bootie
Truly, she was a freak in the evenin'
And if she wasn't teasin', then give me one reason
Why she do dat? Always knew dat
She was hot as da nectar
Hector said he pecked her, disrespected her
'Cause he bang bang, swang in his dingalang
Broke his back long range
And make the ugly bitch sing

Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Cutie Tootie with her sight
And if she humped Ralph
She humped Bobby, Ricky and Mike
Tight is the way she wore her dresses
Has she learned her lesson
From all the dick testing
Now I'm guessing (Now I'm guessing)
She's laying in a casket, in a yellow basket
For a Gucci jacket
Daggit, I wish she didn't do those nasty things
'Cause he made the ugly bitch sing

Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh

Tootie didn't know the facts of life
Staying up in clinics, loosy bootie made trife
Feeling, she got the heebie geebies
Quick to give you freebies
Underneath the staircase in Brooklyn
Neighbors out the window sure was lookin'
She greasy like chicken
I don't give a cotton pick and
She can do her thing
'Cause me and her don't hang
The ugly bitch sang
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Why you hurt me?
Tell me why more
Ooh, ooh
Uh-huh

So you know what? This should be a lesson for anybody
Who's hanging with someone who's dirty, nasty, stank
Once again, going around humping everybody
Everybody and anybody and anything
That's why you make the ugly bitch sing
Ooh, oohEmbed
