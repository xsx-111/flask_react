Beep Me 911 Lyrics
Uh, uh, uh, like that, uh
Uh
Say what, say what
Say what, say what
Uh, uh, uh
Say what, say what
Uh
Missy, bring it in

Why you played on me? Wasn't I good enough for you? (Wasn't good enough)
All those other girls you've been with can't do like I do (Do, do)
Gave you all my dough when you needed it all the time (Uh-huh)
And if you planning on leaving me again
Then give me a sign (Say what, say what)

Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone (Uh)
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Say what, say what)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits, it's over, babe
(Say what, say what, say what, say what)
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone (Uh)
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Say what, say what)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe (Uh)
Why you cheating on me? Can you tell me what I've done?
I thought you was the one, but you just a hit and run
Gave up clubs and parties, I put them aside (I stopped goin' to all the parties)
Left me in the dark with no kind of sign
(Why don't you give me a sign?)

Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over
(No thinking twice)
(Say what, say what)
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over

All my friends say I can do better than you (Say what, say what)
Maybe they was right cause I feel like a fool (Fool, fool)
But I can't let you go until you take some time (Say what, say what)
To tell me why you left me without a goddamn sign (Say what, say what)
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Beep me 911 or call me on my cell phone
I'll call you back
To see what you gon' tell me (Say what)
You don't wanna date
No ifs, ands, or waits it's over babe, it's over
(Magoo, Magoo)

Type of nigga made built to last
Look homegirl, I pump like gas when
Get your friend and your girl and them (What?)
My sex drive workout like a gym, Kim (What?)
Was the girl that I used to hit
You the girl that I gotta quit
See the kitty Kit
Gotta gold it like a light
In the night you the freak come out
We don't bite
No diggity, who took you out
No doubt when I first got down
Made the bro' shout
Look out, make it live
Dip and dive, staying alive
Shoot me sugar, there it is
Now we talking square biz
I'm leaving you without arrears
But I still luh the kids
What you think, I'm hen pecked
Girl get your mind checked
Take the time, recollect
I just gave you disrespect
Ah, like that
Like that
Beep me 911, baby
Aha, aha, aha, aha...
Aha, aha
Aha, aha
Say what, say what
Misdemeanor, 702
Whatch'all gonna do?
Fellas?
Don't beep them 911
Don't beep them 911
Don't beep them 9112Embed
