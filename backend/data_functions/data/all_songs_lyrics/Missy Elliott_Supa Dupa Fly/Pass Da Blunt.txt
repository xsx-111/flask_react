Pass Da Blunt Lyrics
Ayo
It's too many producers, haha
Is giving off these fraud beats, you know what I'm saying
Your worst mistake is to try duplicate anything that Timbaland make
So, you gon' hear this beat one time and one time only
And I'm gon' just do a lil' something on it
Alright, check it

Bitches
I never wanna hang with bitches
Since I turned Missy
Every bitch wanna meet me booty lickin'
My ass they kissin'
But I feel like they way too picky
I used to know a guy name Ricky
Oh really? Don't piss me off
And son, better let y'all know y'all lucky
'Cause if I come out buckin'
The whole world better be duckin'
'Cause I roll with Puffy
No doubt, shit turned out get ugly
No matter what you still love me
Me whack, you buggin'
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
He got the beats
He got the beats that make me jump, jump, jump
He got the beats
He got the beats that make me rocky dodi dum
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
I got the rhymes
I got the rhymes to make you jump, jump, jump
I got the rhymes
I got the rhymes to make you rocky dodi dum

Niggas
I always keep a good nigga
I get him for his figures, I A-K-A gold digga
See me with him in a jewelry store buyin' glitta
Should I not or should I? I'm a get em, I'm a get em
And uh, bitches
They mad cause I be flossin'
Yeah this pussy costin' the kind that be tossin
You know I'm rockin' 'cause there will be no stoppin'
All that shit you poppin'
What's that shit you talkin?
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
He got the beats
He got the beats that make me jump, jump, jump
He got the beats
He got the beats that make me rocky dodi dum
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunt on the left hand side
I got the rhymes
I got the rhymes to make you jump, jump, jump

I got the rhymes to make you rocky dodi dum

Bam bam bam bam bili bili bom
Bam bili bili bili bili bili bili bom
I said "Pass da blunt on the left hand side
Pass da blunts on the left hand side"
