I pulls up in my stretch (Stretch)
I let my homegirls flex my 9-8
Close and closer, they follow in my limo, playin' CD's
Of when I used to hee-hee totally in my ass cheeks
They sweat these beats for any kinda jeeps
You know how I is
So freakin' hot that I siz
Geewiz, get my clothes tailored like I'm Liz Miz
I'm comin' for your ass in a min, seconds or hours
Everything I do seem to bloom like flowers
I cruise these beats like I'm drivin' Eddie Bauer (Beep beep)
Some of ya'll MC's mad I got the power
I hit you with brrrppp, take that
Niggas wanna scat when I, uh, take that
What? Mmm, take that
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh-uhh

Hard bitches be talkin' like they rah rah
Blizzy blizzy blahzah blahzah blahzay
None of y'all fools ain't got shit on me
