Friendly Skies Lyrics
Yeah
A little slow jam

Kiss me, hold me
The weatherman says it's gonna be
Cold tonight
Whatever man
Whatever whatever whatever whatever
Whatever man, you wanna do
I'll be the pilot
Don't miss your flight

I'm stewardess of the plane
Feel the turbulence and maintain
Please refrain stay in your seats
Until we reach the gate
I'm stewardess of the plane
Feel the turbulence and maintain
Please refrain stay in your seats

Take me higher
Let's just go for a little
Joy Ride
Whatever man
Whatever whatever whatever whatever
Let's stay
Buckled up
And let's make love
Across the friendly skies
I'm passenger of this plane
I feel the turbulence I maintain
I will refrain Stay in my seat
Till I reach the gate
I'm passenger of this plane
I feel the turbulence I maintain
I will refrain
I'm stayin' my seat

I want you (I want you)
Baby, I want you (Baby, you know I want)
I really really wanna (Fuck) you
Sho nuff wanna (Fuck) you
I want you
Yes I do (I want you)
Baby, baby, I want you
(I know you know what I want)
I really really wanna (Fuck) you
I really wanna (Fuck) you
Sho nuff wanna (Fuck) you
Sho nuff wanna

Is there anything that you want?
Is there anything that you need?
Call on me (Ginuwine)
Call on me (Ginuwine)
Is there anything that you want
Is there anything that you crave
Call on me (Ginuwine)
'Cause I'm a passenger of your plane
Yeah
Missy fly with me
Missy fly with me, fly with me
Missy drive with me
Missy drive with me, drive with me1Embed
