Last Exit For The Lost LyricsWould you pay life's pleasure to see me?
Does it hurt?
For I want you to remain
I run your hair through, in another decade
Sumerland holds me, in Sumerian haze
Pain in the places where the lovers mourned
Arranging the playthings, up and down the hall
Forever remain, for every day
My honour remains
Forever remain
Between the spaces, along the wall
Appearing faces, that dissapear at dawn
We're getting closer. I can see the door
Closer and closer
Kthulhu calls
Forever remain (x4)
You'll seek it
It'll take awhile
You'll seek it
If it's a thousand miles
Take what fate brings
Eternal and desire
I'll change those faces, then I'll take their smile
We're getting close now
I can see the door
Closer and closer
Or is it there at all?
Forever remain (x4)
This could be my last regress
Last exit for the lost
This could be my last regress
Last exit for the lost (x2)
Closer (x2)
And we're getting closer, for all the lost
And we're getting close now
Forever lost
This could be my last regress
Precious for the lost
This could be my last regress
Precious for the lost
And we're getting closer
And we're getting close now
Last exit for the lost
And we're getting closer
Closer and closer
Last exit for the lost (x2)
This could be my last regress
Precious
(Closer) This could be my last regress
And we're getting closer
Closer and closer
