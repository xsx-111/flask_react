Watchman LyricsInnocence is hurting
A world speaks out of tune
Promise calls and promise falls
What are we to do, with a clouded view?
You follow me through
Sadly the tides are changing
My world slips out of view
Your body falls. My body calls
What are we to do, with a clouded view?
You follow me through
My life's turning pages
I see a promised day
Watchmen never age here
They just sleep in vain
Drowning people stare here
They don't care to call, so I rebury the pages
Kthulhu calls
You'll see, you'll see her
When she starts to form
You'll see, you'll see her
When she starts to call
In the name of Jesus Christ
Won't you fear my name?
I've been around since Moses
Your preacher never came
You'll see, you'll see her
When she starts to form
You'll see, you'll see her
When she starts to call
Follow me
You sleep, you sleep
Follow me
It's just another day
Remember, I'm calling for you
Just another day
Remember, she's calling for you
Just another day
Kthulhu, I'm calling for you
Just another day
An empire has fallen from view
You sleep
You sleep
Follow me
You sleep - you sleep
You cannot follow meEmbed
