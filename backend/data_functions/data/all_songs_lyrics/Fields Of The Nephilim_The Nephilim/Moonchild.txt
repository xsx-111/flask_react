Moonchild LyricsMoonchild...
Well it's a righteous dream
But out of mind, yeah
A righteous dream
But out of mind, yeah
Tend the horses
Let 'em crawl
Put 'em in their cages
That's righteous for the soul
Open your eyes
And despite what's deep
Longevity
Well, that's righteous for the weak
Moonchild
Lower me down, lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down down down down down down
Well it's a righteous day
But out of mind, yeah
And I give your last rite
Oh, it's a righteous day
Never return, I will wait no more
Take no prisoners in the promised war
You'll die for this
Die for this
Take them
Moonchild
Lower me down, lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down down down down down down
Moonchild
Here come the silver pieces
Can't you see
You're losing me
Moonchild
Lower me down, lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down down down down down down
Moonchild
Lower me down
Moonchild
Lower me down down down down down down
Revisit to an empty hall
You can't see I've been burned before
Well they tear you down and they'll bear your shame
Longevity hear my pain
Moonchild (lower me down)
And I'm waiting, and I'm raging
And I'm waiting, and I'm raging
And a white moon falls, a black moon calls
Waiting to defy the One
Moonchild (lower me down)
Longevity, longevity
I melt down where I burned before
Longevity, longevity
I melt down where I burned before
And I know where you lay
I melt down where I burned before
And I know where you lay (down, down, down)
Okay
