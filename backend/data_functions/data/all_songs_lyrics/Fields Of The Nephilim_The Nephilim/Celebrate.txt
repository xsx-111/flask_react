Celebrate LyricsWhen the moment's right
Only moments rise
For the lesser blessed
It's all promises
When the daughters rise
From their comas rise
For a lesser blessed
It seems honest here
Celebrate give love and praise
Celebrate
For our lesser days
Obsessions in your eyes
The peril of my life
Where others fall
You came back again
With no grace in mind
For the magan blind
To a lesser god we'd seem honest here
And you'll turn
You'll find new highways
And you'll turn
But lady you'll burn
This moment's all you have it there
This moment hangs like your ragged hair
Celebrate
Give love and praise
Celebrate
For our lesser days
When the moment's right
Only moments rise
The eternal sea of silence
The shadows of mankind
And you'll turn
You'll find new highways
And you'll turn
You find new highways
Celebrate here
Celebrate here please
For all you've changed me
Celebrate here
Celebrate here
Celebrate for our lesser daysEmbed
