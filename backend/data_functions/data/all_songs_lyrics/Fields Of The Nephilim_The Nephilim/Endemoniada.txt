Endemoniada LyricsSo let it feel... Unreal
When I fall asleep at the wheel
Think about this... If looks could kill
Such a thrill... The way I feel
Now I'm falling asleep at the wheel
And I'm dreaming of the kill
We dream of familiar places here
We dream of familiar faces
Do you want a display
Just stand in my way
If you want a display
Your love in that way... Now get out
Think about this...
Well I've seen... With old eyes
And every time I turn around another dies
Think about this... If looks could kill
Vision's Black, I go to war sometimes
When I'm walking on my own
We dream of familiar places
Vision's black, I go to war sometimes
When I'm walking on my own
We dream of familiar places
And I'm dreaming
We dream of familiar things here (My heart beats, my heart beats)
We dream of familiar places
And I'm dreaming...
We dream of familiar things here (My heart beats, my heart beats)
We dream of familiar places Stop!Embed
