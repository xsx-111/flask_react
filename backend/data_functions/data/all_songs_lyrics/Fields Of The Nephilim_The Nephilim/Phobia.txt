Phobia LyricsHe drains all of my lifeforce
A body like a unicorn
Its a phobia
In this crowded room
The people just stare
Silver sun entering space
I want to just pass around
It's now in my face
All my days am I human or worse
All my days, I'm turning over
All my days, I'm turning over
There's a land
The dead has captured
It's no less beautiful
It's a phobia
In this crowded room
The people just stare
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground {... to bleed apart your ground}
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
All my days, I'm turning over
The last time around here we go
I should be in Heaven but I don't glow
All my days am I human or worse
All my days, I'm turning over
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of ground
Send my soul to lay in a patch of groundEmbed
