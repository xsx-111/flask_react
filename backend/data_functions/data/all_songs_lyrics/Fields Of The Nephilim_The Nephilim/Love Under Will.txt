Love Under Will LyricsI need to be alone today
Smother me or suffer me
Lay down I'll die today
Smother me or suffer me
When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of life's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile
I'll love her 'til i die
Then rest in peace can't you see
If you pass through my soul today
Gather all his troubles
Tomorrow's long eternal night
Gather for tomorrow
When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of earth's surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good smile
Between the cracks and hollows and bends
The earth is good, the earth is good
Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good, the earth is good
Lay down, lay down, lay down for me
Lay down, lay down, lay down with me
When I'm gone wait here
Discover all of lifes surprises
When I'm gone wait here
I'll send my child my last good bye
Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good, the earth is good
Between the cracks and hollows
The earth is good
Hey!
Embrace me
Someone's gonna suffer
Hey!
Embrace me
'cause someone's gonna suffer
Lay lay lay it on
Lay lay lay it on
Lay lay lay it on me
Someone
Hey, embrace me huge me
Someone's gonna suffer
Sweet dreams my angel, at last good bye
I need my beauty rest
Sweet dreams'
