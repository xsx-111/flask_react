The Loss and Curse of Reverence LyricsMemories of torment strikes me
Attempts were made to suffocate me at birth
Fools, I was already ancient
Thou can not kill what breeds within Thee
Alas, this agony, the emptiness of earthborn pride
Hath stirred my faithful heart which guided me to darker paths
Far away from their pestilent ways
Cleansed was I from deceitful grace
Yet, put to scorn was I
By those unclean
Enslaved by ignorance
They blindly spat upon
The deity of hate
Awake is the darkest fiend
By the fallen one I shall arise
Upon bewildered masses
To whom the indulgence of my soul portray as sin made god
I shall revile and quell the source
Whence mockery of my kind derive
This I know: Facile shalt my quest not come to pass
Deathwish be my gift to all at last
Honour. Commended no longer as virtue
Yet, shalt be extolled by light's demise
By the fallen one I shall arise
Arise
Believer
Speak not to me of justice
For none have I ever seen
By God, I shall give as I receive
Betrayer
Speak not to me at all
You and this world
Ripped my fucking heart out
Again... again... and again...
Again... and again...Embed
