With Strength I Burn LyricsDeep Green Dark Chaos
Blinded I run down these paths
By heart I know them
They lead to the soaring cliffs
Stout they stand above the water's edge
Lifeless
And this is my foundation
Cold stone
Formed only by winds and time
How invulnerable
Lifeless
Ahh...
I have longed to be at one with this
Yet, the waters call my name
For once I wish to see
The entity behind the voice
The face of this seduction
The beauty of my pain
Am I blessed or am I cursed by thy presence?
What is my crime?
What is my deed?
Is this life my redemption?
Shall I repent or proceed?
I hate my flesh
Its dimension poisoned my soul with doubt
It made me question the essence of...
The 'I'
Slaves are those of this world
Given freedom to lay the chains upon The Master
The wolf is no longer free
Release the chains and come for me
Suddenly, his mournful cries were stunned
Out of the cold mist came three enthralling ships
Sails torn by many a storm, and the bows adorned by the
Most fierce gargoyles he'd ever laid eyes upon. Yet, the
Crew they bore... Three times twelve in numbers. They
Stood motionless, wrapped in grey, worn gowns
And from behind their shadowed faces the seductive chanting
Bidding him on board. without hesitation, he accepted
And away they sailed...
Upon these seas
Wherein I drowned so many times
I scatter the ashes of destiny
Still my flame is in hunger
With fire in my heart
Shall I greet the shores ahead
Though, I know not what will burn...
Desire...
Ahh...
In the distance
I hear the waves wash over solid ground
And in this moment I am struck blind
Grant me sight so I can see
That which lies ahead of me
Cursed be my mortal eyes
For dying in this realm of death
Hear my call...
I return to the soaring cliffs
They truly shine of strength
Even though I nothing learned
With strength I burn...Embed
