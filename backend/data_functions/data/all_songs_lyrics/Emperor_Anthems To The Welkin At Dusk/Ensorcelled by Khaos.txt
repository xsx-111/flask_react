Ensorcelled by Khaos LyricsIn an endless maze begotten
To dead ends led by fools
I sought a plague
For those who smiled at walls
In humble fear
Yet, belligerent ways came to an end
No war could ease my hunger
By craving death I was
To darkness reborn
No sacrifice too great
Caught in another maze
Truly endless
Still
This maze is mine
No peace for me
No peace I seek
My quest goes far beyond
No sacrifice too great
Caught in another maze
Truly endless
Still
This maze is mine
I hail the greatest fall
Dark is the spirit of my token
Dark is my call
Still craving
Still torn
Hear me master
Of this realm to which I was reborn
Bearer of my stigma. Thou art of me
Yet, claim no gift, but guidance
For I am the giver of temptations
Thou art the executor of Thy rewards
The cosmic forces driving me
More noble, more free
Love and hate and all in between
I greet them all in ecstasy
Take me
Venus
Seduce me
Mars
Possess me
Tear my soul from sanity
No sacrifice too great
Caught in another maze
Truly endless
Still
This maze is mine
And I am thine1Embed
