Thus Spake the Nightspirit LyricsClose your eyes
And gaze into this realm
That I reveal
See where eternities are born
Close your eyes
Behold the powers of the broken seal
See the liars bound in thorns
Fear
And you shall fall
Weakness suffocates your will
Dare
Yet never fail
Wisdom guides the one
The strong who can defy
Death
So I speak
Though, am I heard?
Wasting visions on a world of blinded fools
Still I scorn
The vacant contradiction of life
If only to bewilder
The final truth shall speak my name
Thus spake the nightspirit
Nightspirit
Spirit
Embrace my soulEmbed
