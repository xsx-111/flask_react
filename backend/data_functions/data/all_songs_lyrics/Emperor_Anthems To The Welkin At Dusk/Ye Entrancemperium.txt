Ye Entrancemperium LyricsDrawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
Growing stronger once I enter my empire beyond
Emperium
Behold my coming
The fullmoon ride above me
Enlightening my realm in a silvery glow
Yet the shadows crawl beneath my storming sky
Guarding treasures from forbidden light
I still remember
Though ages ago, it seems
The first time I entered the gates
The revelation of ritual death
By which I became divine
Sacrifice of the life I had among the flesh of the light
And now I enter again
Even stronger, yet amazed by what I see
In ecstasy, I mock the world
Emperium
Emperium
Emperium
Emperium
Suddenly I memorize
Asking what I left behind
Nothing
Can I ever comprehend?
Will my longing never end?
Never!
Drawn towards these lands again
Seeking death and sacred soil
I ride the longing winds of my blackened soul
