The Acclamation of Bonds LyricsVide, ravens caw in reverence
Anthems to the Welkin at dusk
In celebration of the few, the kin
Beyond flesh, beyond words
Those of the core, beyond gods
As gods received
I float among them
On wings once broken
Now gleaming black
I share their song
Of words unspoken
Cries of the past
In times of fiendish tempest
Bloodlust turns against the coil
Hungry for the fall
I greet the pit
Blind Savage
Cursing Life
Yet, at the moment of my final step
The hands and golden chains are given
Bidding me
That which can not be deprived:
The bonds of trust and unity
Till the end
Brethren and sisters of my circle
I acclaim thee all
When guiding stars are clouded and deranged
Fear not to take my hand
The bonds of trust and unity
As gods received
Till the endEmbed
