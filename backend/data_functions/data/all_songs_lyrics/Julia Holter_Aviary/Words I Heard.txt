Words I Heard Lyrics
Frequent missile talk
Slurping on the words I heard from the wretched zone
Fortune throwing candy slow like a death crawl
Face me, gliding like a serpent, and smile

Hear the hocket babble
Save, save our souls
And laughter

Creature changes sadness doves
Thirsty beyond the games of modern time
Fools crusade in hostile fog
Fish are martyrs to the kingdom war-dogs

Hear the hocket babble
Save, save our souls

Fitful gods show no way
Fitful gods show no way
Fitful gods show no way
Dream worm formed our claws embrace
Exile leaning on decaying walls of an
Ancient king deflecting blame
I love you in the City of Man
I love you in the City of Man
I love you in the City of Man

Hear the hocket babble
Save, save our souls2Embed
