Another Dream LyricsDeath Valley sage
In the flu of the summer
I can feel this way at night
There's a green in the blue
Why claim control like gods?
In the sweet melody I can see your face
In the sweet melody I can see your face
And the wool has taken over
Around the flower tall on the side of the hill
In the salt
You relive no water pouring
Like anywhere we used to go
On these days so solitary
Always with a bowl of fever
You could maybe take a moment
In the second person in the big woe
When we see our faces again ago
Phasing out the photo like we're so surprised
Here is the great symphony of tenses
All I've got is what I'd slowly got
When they pressed a nerve
At sunset telling love
Why does summer just unroll
Patiently on the see-saw?
Memory myths are all
So good
And fortified
In the sweet melody I can see your face
In the sweet melody I can see your face1Embed
