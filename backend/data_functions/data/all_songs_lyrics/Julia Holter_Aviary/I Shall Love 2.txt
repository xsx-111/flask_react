I Shall Love 2 LyricsThat is all, that is all
There is nothing else
I am in love
What can I do?
Oh, I am in love
What can I do?
That is all, that is all
There is nothing else
Who cares what people say?
Who cares what people say?
Why do you squander?
Why do you hoard?
Why do you squander?
Why do you hoard?
In all the human errors there is something true
But do the angels say, do the angels say
"I shall love"?
I shall love, I shall love, I shall love, I shall love
I shall love, I shall, I shall, I shall, I shall love
I shall love, I shall love, I shall, I shall, I shall love
I shall, I shall, I shall, shall, shall, shall (Ooh)
I shall, shall, shall, shall, shall love
Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love4Embed
