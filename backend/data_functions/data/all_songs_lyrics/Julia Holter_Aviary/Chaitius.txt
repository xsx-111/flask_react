Chaitius LyricsOpen my wings with joy
See mo cor sun ray
To you
I feel so alove
Joi!
I can't wait
En sai butter mo cor
Eu you
Lauzeta, sweet in the melting world
Lo mon
The bananas are getting yellow
Don't let me forget
Please take my temperature
Swoop up
Lauzeta, sweet in the melting world
Love me at the moon
Jauzion
Alas
Mylas
Lauzeta
Quiet, ai last!
Who will tell me what to do?
Tell me what to say
Don't say no to feel so alove
No more to say
Chazer in here
So I fall
Chaitius
No sai on
