Underneath the Moon LyricsThis is my first time in primeval light
Testing my moves out in the big room
Words pour out
My holy body free
I repeat
That's why I say
I repeat
Flying feet over ruin
Human ruin and the
Garlands in my hair
I repeat so you absorb
That's why I say it twice
That's why I say it four times
When I feel good I sway
When I feel good I say
When I feel so bloody good
Underneath the
Dance with us to the
St. Vitus down the hall
Every stubborn bone thrown
Underneath the moon and stars
We feel our flight
The plague danza wave
Bring your fate bring your flesh
Feels better than the end
Feels so good like
Hysteria hysteria
Collapse and get up again
We're the fool but the wisest fool
We feel our flight
Leaping through the hot flames
Writhing in the laughter like
The jester's high
Shifts and rolls until we faint
Every hour of every day
Feels so good like
Hysteria hysteria
Collapse and get up again
We're the fool but the wisest fool
We feel our flight
This is my first time in primeval light
Crying
Flying
Rolling
Flying
Feet over ruin
Human ruin and the
Garlands in my hair
Mappa mundi!
Dance in the circle
Circle?
How do I know who to trust?
Where do I start?
I see no beginning
No middle
No end
I don't know
Who draws the circles?
Who made this mappa?
I see no beginning
No middle
No end1Embed
