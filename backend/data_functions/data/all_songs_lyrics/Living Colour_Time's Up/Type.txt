Type Lyrics
Stereotype
Mono type
Blood type
Are you my type?
Minimalism
Abstract expressionism
Post modernism
Is it?

We are the children of concrete and steel
This is the place where the truth is concealed
This is the time when the lie is revealed
Everything is possible, but nothing is real

Corporate religion
Televangahypnotism
Suffer till you die
For the sweet-bye-and-bye
Science and technology
The new mythology
Look deep inside
Empty
We are the children of concrete and steel
This is the place where the truth is concealed
This is the time when the lie is revealed
Everything is possible, but nothing is real
Everything that goes around
Comes around

Well I'm hypothetical
Theoretical
Circumstantial evidence
Irrelevance
Well don't think twice
Just roll the dice
Pay the price
Snake eyes

We are the children of concrete and steel
This is the place where the truth is concealed
This is the time when the lie is revealed
Everything is possible, but nothing is real

We are the children of concrete and steel
This is the place where your fate has been sealed
This is the time when your life is revealed
Everything is possible, but nothing is, nothing is, nothing is
Nothing is, nothing is, nothing is real
Nothing is real
Everything that goes around
Comes aroundEmbed
