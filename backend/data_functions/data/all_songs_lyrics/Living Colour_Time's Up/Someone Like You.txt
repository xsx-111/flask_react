Someone Like You LyricsINTRO
Lets go down that sliding board again
*children playing*

Do you remember
The times of laughter?
Children playin', life was so sweet
Before our city forgot us
And let the druglord take our street
Pacify me politician
Pacify me with your lies
Blind to the people suffering
Deaf to the children's cries

Well I know what to do
With someone like you

Police, they chased my brother
Policeman licensed to kill
Ohh, how I miss my brother
Good shoes are so hard to fill
Policeman, are you happy?
You snuffed the medical student out
Ohh, maybe he could have changed the world
I guess we'll never find out
Ohh, but I know what to do
With someone like you
Yea yea yeah
I know what to do
With someone like you

It's never too late
To change your ways
It's never too late
To change your ways

Ohh, too young
Gave her body
She was afraid of being alone
One baby having another
Ohh, sweet baby wants to be grown
But there's a, there's an angel on your shoulder
Always speaking to your soul
Listen and your heart will be glad
You'll never have to be alone

Ohh, 'cause I know what to do
With someone like you
Yeah, I know what to do
With someone like you
Ohh, I know what to do
With someone like you
I know what to doEmbed
