Solace Of You LyricsWhen it hurts to be out there
Where no one will care
I've got the solace of you
Frustrated by the people's lying
But I keep on trying
I've got the solace of you
When I can't think straight
And there's no escape
I've got the the solace of you
Gotta go inside back to where it started
Back to the beginning
'Cause that's where my heart is
Gotta go inside back to where it started
Back to the beginning
'Cause that's where my heart is
They can hurt me and jail my body
I'll still be free
I've got the solace of you
They can take my land
Tell me I'm not who I am
I've got the solace of you
A wise man said to know thyself
'Cause in the end there's no one else
Just the solace of you
Gotta go inside back to where it started
Back to the beginning
'Cause that's where my heart is
Gotta go inside back to where it started
Back to the beginning
'Cause that's where my heart is
Gotta go inside
Back to the beginning
Gotta go inside
Back to the beginningEmbed
