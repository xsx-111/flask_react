Pride LyricsWell whoa oh
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Verse 1)
When I speak out loud
You say I'm crazy
When I'm feeling proud
You say I'm lazy
I look around and see the true reality
You like our hair
You love our music
Our culture's large, so you abuse it
Take time to understand, I'm an equal man
(Chorus)
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its pride

(Verse 2)
When I'm at work you say I'm great
You watch and ponder, but can you relate?
Inviting eyes hands drop, when the music stops
Don't ask me why I play this music
'Cause it's my culture, so naturally I use it
I state my claim to say, it's here for all to play
(Chorus)
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its pride
Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah
(Instrumental Break)
(Verse 3)
It's time for a change
Concepts rearrange
Now can't you feel my rage?
Well, It's up to you to seek the truth
To know your history, the difference between me and you
Relate to me as me, not what you see on TV
(Last Chorus)
History's a lie that they teach you in school
A fraudulent view called the golden rule
A peaceful land that was born civilized
Was robbed of its riches, its freedom, its prideEmbed
