Information Overload LyricsSometimes I feel
Like my mind will explode
Sometimes I feel
Like I've got no control
Sometimes I wish
I had a heart made of steel
Sometimes I wish
I couldn't feel
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
They say the future...it's on a microchip
Don't you know we're all on a sinking ship
Only ten percent control all the rest
Only ten percent decide what is best
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
Information overload
I don't want to live like this
I don't want to live like this
I don't want to live like live like
I don't want to live like this
No, no, no
Still ain't no cure for the summertime blues
I'd like to shake these blues but I'm still paying dues
My blues is so deep you might think they're black
My blues is so deep there ain't no turning back
Information overload...Embed
