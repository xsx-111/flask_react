Elvis is Dead Lyrics
Yo, Corey, man
Yeah, man. What's up?
I saw Elvis the other day
Get outta here, man!
Tabloids scream Elvis seen at a shopping mall
That's the kind of talk that makes my stomach crawl
Picture a zombie Elvis in a tacky white jump suit
Just imagine a rotting Elvis shopping for fresh fruit
He can't 'cause
Elvis is dead (x8)
When the King died he was all alone
I heard that when he died he was sittin' on his throne
Alas poor Elvis, they made us know you well
Now you dwell forever in that heartbreak hotel
Elvis is dead (x8)
Band!
Elvis was a hero to most but that's beside the point
A black man taught him how to sing
And then he was crowned King (What?)
The pelvis of Elvis, too dangerous for the masses
They cleaned him up and sent him to Vegas
Now the masses are his slave (Slave?)
Yes, slave. Even from the grave
Elvis is dead (repeats in various languages)

Presley was a good performer, on stage he was electrifying
When he was ill, his fans got sick and moaned when he had died
To all you pimps making money on his name
How do you sleep, don't you feel the shame?
He went through the test, he's out of this mess
Be my guest and let him rest
Elvis has left the building!
I've got a reason to believe we all won't be received at Graceland
I've got a reason to believe we all won't be received at Graceland
I've got a reason to believe we all won't be received at Graceland
I've got a reason to believe we all won't be received at Graceland
No, not you, my brother, 'cause
Elvis is dead (x8)Embed
