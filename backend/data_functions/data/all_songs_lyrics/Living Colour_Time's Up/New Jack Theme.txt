New Jack Theme LyricsBuy and die/or sell and be free
We are the new Jacks/this is our reality
Do unto others/leave no one alive
This is our creed/we will survive
No control is how I'm living
On the edge with no forgiving
Things get rough when you've got time to kill
You've got the cash/then I've got your thrill
I make more money than a judge or a cop
Give me a reason why I should stop
Large is how I'm living
On the edge with no forgiving
Some people say my soul is lost
I'll lose my life if I start to turn soft
From where I am there's no turning back
Crack is the master
I am a new Jack
Can anybody see me?
Can anybody hear me?
I'll never change/I'll never stop
I've got cold cash/I'm on the top
We can get busy if you want to play
I'll have the last laugh when I blow you away
Don't you see me?
Can't you hear me?Embed
