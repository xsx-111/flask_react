This Is The Life LyricsIn another life
You might have been a genius
In another life
You might have been a star
In another life
Your face might have been perfect
In another life
You'd drive a better car
In another life
All your jokes are funny
In another life
Your heart is free from fear
In another life
You make a lot of money
In this other life
Everything is clear
In another life
You're always the hero
In another life
You always win the game
In another life
No one ever cheats you
In another life
You never have to change
In another life
Your friends never desert you
In another life
You never have to cry
In another life
No one ever hurts you
In this other life
Your loved-ones never die
But this is the life you have
This is the life you have
This is the life you have
This is the life
In another life
You're always the victim
In another life
You're always the thief
In another life
You are always lonely
In this other life
There is no relief
In your real life
Treat it like it's special
In your real life
Try to be more kind
In your real life
Think of those that love you
In this real life
Try to be less blind
This is the life you have
This is the life you have
This is the life you have
This is the life you haveEmbed
