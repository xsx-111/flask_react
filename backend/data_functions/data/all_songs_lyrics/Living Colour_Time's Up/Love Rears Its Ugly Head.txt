Love Rears Its Ugly Head LyricsYeah ehh ehh
Oh ooh ooh
Dib um dib dib dib dib dib dib
I always thought that our relationship was cool
You played the role of having sense, I always played the fool
Now something's different, I don't know the reason why
Whenever we separate, I almost want to cry
Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
And when I come home late, you don't complain or call
So as a consequence, I don't go out at all
My friends are frightened, they don't know what's going on
They think you put a spell on me and now my mind is gone
Oh no, please not that again
Love rears up its ugly head
Yeah, its ugly head
Love's not so bad they say
But you never know where love is gonna go
Does anybody really know?
Check this out
I'm standing at the altar as they play the wedding march
I'm in a black tuxedo with my collar full of starch
Oh, she looks as lovely as she's ever gonna get
I wake up from this nightmare in a pool of sweat
Oh no, no, no, no
Not that again, yeah
I'm not goin'
I'm not goin when
Love rears up its ugly head
No not me, no
No no, not me when
Love rears up its
Love rears up its ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly head
What you gonna do, Lord
What you gonna do when it comes and gets you?
