Take Some... Leave Some LyricsCan't be greedy
(Ahh yeah)
Give me some
I need some dust
The cage is bust
You can't have it all
Do you know where i'm coming from?
You can't be greedy
You gotta take some.. and leave some
I never been a cat
Who wanted it all
I'm so glad

But the pantry is big enough for everyone
You gotta take some... and leave some
(Babe! Whooh!)
(Take it all)
You take it all (Look here)
So I (Uh!)

And i just want
A piece of the pie
I hope you know where I'm coming from
You gotta take some... then leave some
Life can be so good
Life can be so sweet
Eatin' with you (Uh!)

A decent life
Good food, warm bed

The hustlers
Live and let live (Hey! Heey!)
