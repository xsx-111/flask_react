Forever Suffering LyricsAin't nobody home but us
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home but us
Daddy's gone and left us all alone
Oh, ain't nobody home
Ain't nobody home
Me and the kids, yeah, all alone
I heard her say
Ain't nobody home
I made a change for the kids sake
Oh, tell me, how long
How long do I have to suffer?
How long do I suffer for one mistake?
So tell me
Oh, how long? (Suffering)
How long? How long? (Suffering)
How long? How long? (Suffering)
How long? (Suffering)
How long? (Suffering)
Is it one day? (Suffering)
One year? (Suffering)
Nobody cares about us no more now
How long?
Make me wanna scream, owww (Suffering)
Lord, nobody cares about me (Suffering)
Make me wanna fall down on my knees (Suffering)
And just hit the floor (Suffering)
Beat my head up beside the wall, yeah
(Suffering)
Nobody don't love me no more (Suffering)
Make me wanna fall down on the ground
(Suffering)
Everybody puttin' me down
(Suffering)
Make me wanna scream and, ow
(Suffering)
Just gotta wave my kids bye bye
(Suffering)
Make me wanna holler, ow
(Suffering)
I did it all, I did it all
I did it all for the kids' sake
(Suffering)
How long do I have to suffer for one mistake?
(Suffering)
Don't make me suffer (Suffering)
I'm sorry (Suffering)
I'm so sorry (Suffering)
If I could only have one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
One more - one more chance
(Suffering)
Make me wanna fall down on the ground
Beat my head upside a wall
Make me wanna cry
What have I done?
(Suffering)
What have I done?!
(Suffering)
What have I done?!
(Suffering)
What have I done?!
(Suffering)
What have I done?!
(Suffering)
Ooowww, help me
(Suffering)
Somebody help me
(Suffering)
Need some help
(Suffering)
Need some help
(Suffering)
If I take it home
(Suffering)
Will it help me some more?
(Suffering)
If I cry
(Suffering)
If I cry, will they be satisfied?
I give you all my money
Give you my car
I don't wanna see your face
If the police come I don't wanna know who you are
Just gimme back my kids
(Suffering)
Just gimme back my kids
(Suffering)
Let me take a walk
I swear, I declare, I won't talk
(Suffering)
I'm all alone
(Suffering)
I'm by myself, I'm by myself
By myself (Suffering)
Ain't nobody home but me
(Suffering)
Ain't nobody home
(Suffering)
I don't want no harm
(Suffering)
I don't need nothing, nothing, nothing
Got everything I own
(Suffering)
Just bring me back my kids
(Suffering)
Bring me back my kidsEmbed
