Shoot Your Shot LyricsShoot the shot before you get a shot
Shot out of view
Shoot the shot before you get a shot
Shot out of view, oh shot
Oh yeah, it's mine, it's mine
Mine, ha, it's mine
This is what I wanna do
And you can't tell me, hey
Gonna give it to you
Oh, it's yours sometimes
But it's mine all the time
And I do what I wanna do
And you can't tell me
That I'm the man, man I'll save it for you
High my life had been empty
Since you went away
I feel so sad and lonely
I live from day to day
So shoot the shot before
The shot, shot out of view
It's my mess
And I do what I wanna do
I'm a dude who don't talk rude
Who really, really, really don't spend
I'll save a dollar until I need a friend
I'm trying, get on back
Trying get on over
Trying get on over
I, I, I trying get on over
Whoa trying
Trying get on back
Shoot the shot, ah, shoot the shot, ah
Shoot the shot, ah, shoot the shot, ah
Shoot the shot, whoa, shoot the shot
Shoot the shot, ah, shoot the shot, ah
Shoot the shot, shoot the shot, ah
Shoot the shot, ah
I'm the dude who don't talk rude
Who really don't, don't spend
I think of a dollar to the evil friend
Where shoot the shot
Shoot the shot, ah, shoot it, shoot it
Shoot the shot, shoot the shot
Back mue up, shoot the shot
Where shoot the shot
Shoot the shot make it count
Shoot the shot, where back me up
Go, yeah
Hit it, hit it, hit it, hit it
Whooooa
Shoot the shot
Shoot it, shoot the shot
Shoot the shot, ah
Shoot the shot, ahEmbed
