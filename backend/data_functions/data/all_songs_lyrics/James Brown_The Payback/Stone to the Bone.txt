Stone to the Bone Lyrics
I got a good thing
Ain't going to give it up
I got a mighty good thing
Ain't going to give it up

Girl, I got
Just won't quit her
She won't stop loving
For just a little bit

She's fine as wine
She's just my kind
That ever so fine
Want to make me blow my mind

I got a good thing
Ain't going to give it up
I got a mighty good thing
Ain't going to give it up

She knows how to love me
When I'm feeling bad
She knows how to send me
She makes me feel so glad
She's my sex machine
She knows just what to do
She knows how to love me
Makes me feel real good
Squeeze me when I'm feeling bad
She knows how to send me
She make me feel so glad

I got a good thing
Ain't going to give it up
I got a mighty good thing
Ain't going to give it up

She knows how to love me
When I'm feeling bad
She knows how to send me
She makes me feel so glad

She picks me up
Never letting me down
She bring me up
She moves my monkey soul up and around
Hey, I got a mighty good thing
Ain't  going to give it up
Know I got my sex machine
Ain't going to give it up
Do you want a good thing?
Don't have to give it up
Do you need a good thing?
Ain't going to give it
Everybody got a good thing
They aren't going to give it up
It's my thing
Ain't going to give it up
My thing
Ain't give it up
It's my thing
Ain't going to give it
Can I holler? Let me know
Can I holler? Can I holler?
Can I holler? Can I holler?
Can I holler? Let me holler
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
I wanna play some funky on them
Some funky on them
Some, some funky on them
Do some, some funky on them

I got a good thing
I'm not going to give it up
I got a mighty good thing
I'm not going to give it up

Got a girl
Just won't get, uh
Won't stop loving
For just a little bit
She's fine as wine
She's just my kind and
I heard somebody
She's going to make me blow my mind

She's nice like sugar and spice
Just, just, funky, funky type
Said funky, funky type
She's funky, funky type

When she loves me, takes my breath, uh
That's right, do it now
Baby, with you honey
Baby, wait a minute, damn
First you holler
Make it slow
Said don't holler
Squeeze me more

Ain't gonna give it up
This is my thing, I can't
This is my thing, I can't
Hopefully
Are you there monkey?Embed
