Doing the Best I Can LyricsI'm doing the best I can
Doing the best I can
I'm only a man, darling
My life has been empty
Since you went away
I feel so very, very lonely
I just drift from day to day
I'm doing the best I can
Trying to get over
Doing the best I can
I'm brokenhearted
It's my fault
Treated you wrong so many times
I just wanna talk
I'm just a man
Doing the best I can
Now darling
I'm doing the best I can
Each and every day
So many times
I know you gone away
Said I know you gone away
I miss you each and every day
Every, every, every, every day I just...
I get lonely, night after night
Wonder if I'm doing what's wrong or if I'm doing what's right
But I'm only a man, baby
Babe I'm only a man
I'm for real
I'm for real and I'm doing the best that I can
I'm for real
Now baby
I'm for real
Now baby
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I sit down and I wonder
I'm for real
What and who and where
I'm for real
What have I been wrong, I wonder who cares
I'm for real
Tell me now
I'm for real
Is it right for me to suffer?
I'm for real
Yeah I stand with my head hangin' low
I'm for real
Wondering which way to turn
I'm for real
I don't know just where to go
I'm for real
How long can I keep it up?
I'm for real
Tell me, tell me
I'm for real
How long, how long?
I'm for real
I need it
I'm for real
My darling, I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real, baby, but I want you to know
I'm for real
I miss you baby, darling I miss you so
I'm for real
I miss you, darling
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I'm for real
I miss you, darling
I'm for real
How long can I keep it up?
I'm for real
Night after night
I'm for real
Don't know whether it's wrong or right
I'm for real
But here I stand baby
I'm for real
With my head hangin' so low
I'm for real
Here I stand, baby
Baby do you know?
Do you know?
I remember when you were here with me
I remember when you were here
I remember when you were here with me
I remember me and Mrs. Jones
I remember me and Mrs. Jones
How we had a thing goin' on
Oh we were carryin' on
We were carryin' on
I know deep down inside I was wrong
I want you to help me
Help me, help me
Help me darling, show me the way
Come to you one more time
Show me the way
I wanna know a way
I'm standing here with my head hanging low
I'm standing here
I said I'm, I'm standing here
I'm standing here, me and Mrs. Jones
I'm standing here
I know we were wrong, I just want some help
Oh, baby
Now can you make another friend
Can you, can you make another
Can you make another
Oh, darling
Do you know what it means to have someone need you?
Want you?
Oh you cheated on me, you should not have left me here
Should not have left me here
Makes me wanna cry
I'm so lonely, but baby I'm just a man
Doing the best I can
I, I, I'm just a man
I'm just a man
I'm just a man1Embed
