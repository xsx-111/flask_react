Mind Power LyricsYou know
We’re dealing with
A very critical and crucial time
The most
Crucial and critical time that I've ever witnessed
Being as young as I am
You know
We all don't want to say nothing else, so we say “as young as we are.”
Now I want to talk about
The pronunciation
And the realization
Now the educators
They call it
E.S.P.,
Positive thinking, right?
Some of the people across the other side of the pond call it
Vibe
Vibrations
Astrology and all those different things you understand
But I call it “what it is, is what it is”
What it is, is what it is
Look here
Now you see
A brother
You see, in the ghetto you find a whole lot of crime
I can understand
Hey
I know what it means
Being nine years old before I got my first pair of underwear out of a store
You know
Putting on a half
A half pressed suit
From the pawn shop
With tennis shoes
Trying to be hip
See I know where its coming from
Like the fellow sang, “having catfish head stew”
Its just like the catfish went in there with his head and came out very quick and didn't leave nothing else!
Now, there's one thing that the educators and the politicians and the establishment
Got to remember
Now, brothers need jobs
If you don't work
You can't eat
If you don't work
You can't eat
Get hip to yourself, good god, my brother, and get it from the street
If you don't work
You can't eat
Sis
If you don't work, lord
You can't eat
So you’ve got to have Mind Power to deal with starvation
And that's what we’re dealing with
You see we can't
Go back to the biblical stories
“2 loaves of bread”
Er, “2 little fishes, 5 loaves of bread.”
“2 little fishes”, yeah
“5 loaves of bread.”
Now look here
There's too many brothers going by that
Now I want you brothers to dig where we coming from
Set your mind
Right here
Dig the JBE experience
I dug this from a young man out of New York
He said the GBE
The GBE
Now we want to take it to the JBE
The JB Experience

Mind Power
What it is, is what it is
What it is, is what it is
It is
What it is
It is what it is
It is what it is
That's what it is
It is
What it is
That's what it is
You know

Somebody needs to help us
Give us
Just give us a chance
Somebody

Brothers across the nation
Pass on that right-on
Information
