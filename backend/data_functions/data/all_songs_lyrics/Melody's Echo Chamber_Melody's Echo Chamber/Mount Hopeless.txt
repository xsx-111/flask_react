Mount Hopeless Lyrics
I hope that you don't start to lose
All the sounds I found in you

As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day it does the same
As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day that's not the same

I dare to find, you never choose
But in the calm, I find my truth

As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day it does the same
As it goes, I can't explain
Why we feel so uncertain
And as it stems it fades away
On a hopeful day that's not the same3Embed
