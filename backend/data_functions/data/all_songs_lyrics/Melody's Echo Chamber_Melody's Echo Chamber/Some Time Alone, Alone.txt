Some Time Alone, Alone Lyrics
We resigned the light to someone and hand it to the righteous
We will walk until the right motion
Some time alone, alone to wonder, change your mind, and talk
Waiting around while everyone else is moving on and on, and talk

Empty home, it’s not the same at all
Draw the line and I’m losing my mind

Baby, you’re the one, the one at least until tomorrow, surprise!
We should shine the light on and leave me down
Undergo and over through your eyes, it ain't a compromise
Used to be walking until the dawn, and on and on until the dawn

Empty home, some time alone, alone
Draw the line and I’m losing my mind
Empty home, it’s not the same at all
Draw the line and I’m losing my mind4Embed
