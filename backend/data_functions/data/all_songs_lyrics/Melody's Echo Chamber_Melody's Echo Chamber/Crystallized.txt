Crystallized Lyrics
I discovered you in whole, so terror walks, silent faults
Should have told you a million times that he changed my mind

Just before I realized that you're gone for real this time
Just before he realized that you're gone for real this time
Just before he realized

Need to cover from your eyes, they're really mine, if he ever falls
I can barely catch your eye, but it is too wrong

Just before I crystallized you were gone for real this time
Just before I crystallized you are gone of time this time
How I want to idealize2Embed
