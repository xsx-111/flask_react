Endless Shore Lyrics
Here we go again, back to the start
I am not the one that breaks your heart
Always try to hold but now I'm tired

Here I go, the endless shore
Couldn't say if I was wrong

Here I go again, back to my silence
I was such a fool to think you'd follow

Here I go, the endless shore
Couldn't say if I was wrong

Dear, it's my final word
Is it insane, this soul?
He was the honest one
I couldnâ€™t give him hope
He was the silent soul
He was the honest one
Can we rewind this?
Here I go again, this time, another cycle
Couldn't tell that you were ready for it1Embed
