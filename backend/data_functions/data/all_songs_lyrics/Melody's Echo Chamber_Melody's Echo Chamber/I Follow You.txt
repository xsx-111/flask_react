I Follow You Lyrics
I was wrong, and you were cold
I was hoping you might go
You never show me how much you cared
What was going wrong

I follow you, pretend you want me too
Living the days not there with you
I thought you trust me enough
That all the stupid things, the things I always do
This time with you, I always knew

It's been too long since you are gone
I am thinking of you alone
You never show me how much you're scared
What was going wrong

I follow you, pretend you need me too
Living the days not there with you
I thought you trust me enough
That all the stupid things, the things I always do
This time with you, I always knew
I need someone
To be close
When at night
My own demons
Sneak under my pillow
Not someone
That comes and goes wherever
I need you here
Stay and show me your love
(I just need you
I don't want to
You don't need me
I just want you)11Embed
