The flashing is a big, white light
Crash is catching up in my eye
I think she's carrying on all the lies
Empty wine bottles lying next to the bed
Drowning all them voices that I hear in my head
Dreaming and reliving all I wish I'd said
She don't need another one
She don't need nothing I don't know
She don't need another one
She don't need nothing I don't know
The flashing on the rest of light
I wish I could just sleep through the night
It mirrors and I don't know why
Empty pill bottles lying next to the bed
Silencing them voices that appear in my head
Dreaming and reliving all I wish I'd said
She don't need another one
She don't need nothing I don't know
She don't need another one
She don't need nothing I don't knowEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
