Say to You LyricsIn the night when I come
Crawling home
I want to say to you
I want to say to you
Curse the daylight, I come
Crawling home
I want to say to you
I want to say to you
Sleep
Set me free
In a dream
I am born
Apathetic, finally
I'm not sure anymore
We just take
What we need
If I was stronger I would
Play the fool
I would say to you
I would say to you
Mock the day when I come
Crawling home
I would say to you
I would say to you
Sleep
Set me free
In a dream
I am born
Apathetic, finally
I'm not sure anymore
We just take
What we need4Embed
