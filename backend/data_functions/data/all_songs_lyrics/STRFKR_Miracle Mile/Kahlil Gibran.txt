Kahlil Gibran Lyrics
Even with the lights out, I'm still feeling nervous
Keep it to myself, an island in a furnace
I don't want to say it, I just want to lay here
Always on my mind, I'd rather we just know it
Needles when I'm talking, nothing feels the same here
Pull myself together while I'm getting older
I don't wanna say it, I don't wanna answer
Keep it to myself, tonight I can't say nothing

Turn off the sun tonight, the stars look so much better
"Look in your eyes," they say
Our thoughts all blend together
Quiet and underground, the feeling was just being
Nothing but time for us Our thoughts all lose their meaning
Inside, a light for us
The days are getting shorter
And how I want to stay, just send my letters over
Keeping the sunlight out, Hearts gently beat together
Nothing was left to say, the silence is much better

Needles when I'm talking, nothing feels the same here
Pull myself together while I'm getting older
I don't wanna say it, I don't wanna answer
Keep it to myself, tonight I can't say nothing
Even with the lights out, I'm still feeling nervous
Keep it to myself, an island in a furnace
I don't want to say it, I just want to lay here
Always on my mind, I'd rather we just know it
But I, I don't want to know
But I, I don't want to know
But I, I don't want to know
But I, I don't want to know
But I, I don't want to know4Embed
