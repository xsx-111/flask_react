Golden Light LyricsFade to nothing
Golden Light
Wait forever
But alive
(I just want it to be over)
I remember
Every line
(I just want it to be over)
Fade to nothing
Golden Light
Made of nothing
Fade to nothing
We are so alike
We are so alike
Fade to nothing
Fade to nothing
We are so alike
We are so alike3Embed
