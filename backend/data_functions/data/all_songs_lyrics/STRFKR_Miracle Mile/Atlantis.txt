Atlantis Lyrics
You are the angel
I am the astronaut
You painted pictures on the fields
Dreaming your life away

Let me out
Water rising all around
Laying with my head down in the past
You knowing that I don’t stand a chance

Come on Atlantis
Mmm-it makes me sad to think of home
Sing me that song once more before
We all die alone and lonely-lonely-lonely…

Let me out
Water rising all around
We barely know what happened in the past
You know that I don’t stand a chance1Embed
