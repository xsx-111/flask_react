Leave It All Behind LyricsI will never give you everything, everything
I will never give you everything, everything
Would it matter
If I stay?
Would it matter
Anyway?
I would love to give you everything, everything
I would love to give you everything, everything
Would it matter
If I stay?
Would it matter
Anyway?
Leave it all behindEmbed
