Sazed Lyrics
I, I never had an eye
For the arts
I don't know anything
Where to start
I never had the style
Or the charm
I don't know anything
Gloria
Go Gloria go Gloria go Gloriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Go Gloria go Gloria go Gloria go Gloriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Go Gloria go Gloria go Gloriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Go Gloria go Gloria go Gloria go Gloriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

I, I never had the style
Or the charm
I don't know anything
Gloria
I never had an eye
For the arts
I don't know anything
Go Gloria go Gloria go Gloriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Go Gloria go Gloria go Gloria go Gloriaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
