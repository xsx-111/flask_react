Hear the Noise That Moves So Soft and Low LyricsHear, hear the noise that moves so soft and slow
That's the sound of freshly fallen snow
Your love is gold, your love is gold
Seems, seems as though we'll be stuck out here for days
To bang upon these drums that we have made
You never know, you never know
My one, my only one
Lies sleeping in the sun
Gave chase and so we run
Nothing breaks your stride like what's become
Oh, oh, oh
Stack, stack the frozen wood next to the shed
Pile it up so high then paint it red
Confuse the dogs, confuse the dogs
And time, time we lost is resting on the stairs
The window out reveals the cooler air
And so we go, and so we go
My one, my only one
Lied twice to keep me on
Gave chase and still we sung
Everything that ends has still begun
From the inside of my mouth
And the slow migration south
And it's not to be denied
It's not to be deniedEmbed
