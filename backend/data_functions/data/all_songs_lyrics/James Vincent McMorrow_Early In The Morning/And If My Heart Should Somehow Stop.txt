And If My Heart Should Somehow Stop Lyrics
The wind changed, the first day that you came through
Cut the corn, washed it clean
Now everything that's ever gone before, is like a blur
It's all because of you
And now i find, this city's like a stranger to me
I once was fooled by Cadillacs and honey
But no one feels like you
Not like you
Not like you
Not like you
Cause even though the flower fades something takes it's place
A marching band on a sunny day, two pretty eyes or a pretty face

Then in the forest i made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
Then if my heart should somehow stop
I'll hang on, to the hope
That you're not too late
That you're not too late

And there are times i know when i will have to chase you
The further from my side you go, the longing grows
And I will hate it, I still want you
Cause I will hate it, but I still want you around
Even though the flower dies somethings by it's side
A helping hand or a kiss goodbye, to ease it on it's way

Then in the forest i made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
Then if my heart should somehow stop
I'll hang on, to the hope
You're not too late
Not too late no,no

And in the forest i made my home
Lay down on hard and ancient stone
Then if my heart should somehow stop
I'll hang on, to the hope
That you're not too late
That you're not too lateEmbed
