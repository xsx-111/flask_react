Breaking Hearts LyricsYou can stop your crying, I'm never coming back
You can stop your crying, just walk down the tracks again
I just can't take the pressure, it's all too much for me
I just can't take the pressure, so please just let me be
See I've been, breaking hearts, for far too long
Loving you, for far too long
Making plans now, for far too long
Yes I've been breaking hearts, for far too long
Loving you, for far too long
It's time I leave, it's time I'm moving on
I'm gonna find a city, call the streets my own
I'm gonna find a city, drink until it's gone
The girls there, look so pretty, treat me oh so well
The girl there look so pretty, all just empty shells to me
See I've been, breaking hearts, for far too long
Loving you, for far too long
Making plans now, for far too long
Yes I've been breaking hearts, for far too long
Loving you, for far too long
It's time I leave, it's time I'm moving on
When I need the shelter, I'll know just who to call
When I need the shelter, I'll be knocking on your door
But when it comes to dying, I'll do it on my own
I've never been too clever, I've always just hung on
See I've been, breaking hearts, for far too long
Loving you, for far too long
Making plans now, for far too long
Yes I've been breaking hearts, for far too long
Loving you, for far too long
It's time I leave, it's time I'm moving onEmbed
