Sparrow and the Wolf LyricsSparrow and wolf lay as still as the blades of the grass
Like worn leather boots, of colour and size that would last
Caught them a lark in a trap, and each held a wing
Then they tore it apart, before that small bird could sing
Confused by the wind, bruised by the size of the rain
She turned back him, begged for love to remain
But plans have been made, all of the furniture sold
So store up your hate, use it for warmth when youâ€™re cold
For I have seen no joy, only danger
I seen no joy, only strangers
I seen no joy, seen no joy in this world
Should you, choose to go, please be careful of
Lonesome roads, men that travel them
Will not know, will not know of your ways
Still I have, seen no joy, only dangers
I seen no joy, only strangers
I seen no joy, seen no joy in this world
You should choose to go, please be faithful of
What you learned, from that little bird
Always dear, always dear to my heart
Oooh, oooh, oooh, ooohEmbed
