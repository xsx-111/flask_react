The Herald LyricsAs a single star
Glides swiftly down the night
A soft wetting note
Issues from the time-worn flute
Frowning slightly
The herald listens wistful across the night
And from way back behind
The day comes the echoed answer
The day advances oh so softly
His shadow lengthens and his voice is mute
But clear his flute
And sadly walks forward followed by the day
Herald of morning walks across the earth eternally
Oh...

Aah...
And somewhere in the black distance
Another herald puts down his flute
And the dewy dawn creeps on
And the night withdraws
The day advances oh so softly
His shadow lengthens and his voice is mute
But clear his flute
And sadly walks forward followed by the day
Herald of morning walks across the earth eternally
Oh, oh...
