The Prisoner LyricsI was mad and was accepted for treatment
At a hospital for the mentally sick
(So I am told)
I was wild and introvert
Wandering alone in the night
(So I was, so I am told)
I would scream and rage
Should someone disturb my eye peace
(So I did, so I must hide)
So they took me away and they put me here
Alone in my silent privacy
Then they gave me shock treatment
And when I awoke I was numb
And remembering nothing
Probe me, mould me
Reassemble my brain, my brain
Schizoid, paranoid
Just terms, just names, just names
Why can't you leave me?
Don't drive me insane, insane
Your minds analyse me
Your eyes penetrate me
Illusions, confusions
I'm frightened, I'm helpless
Please leave me, I long to be free
Oh, let me free!
I lie alone unable to remember
No face, no name, no eyes, my brain just an ember
Kindle me, protect my barren matter
Whose seeds may propagate yet still may shatter
They have emptied my head of its dreaming
Like paper out of a waste bin
And I yearn to be, yearn to be, yearn to be, yearn to be free
Cold is the climate, dark is the atomic night
Searching and hoping, guarding my mind from your sight
Your evil eyes watch me, your evil hands touch me, they're cold
I can stand prison, but even my conscious you hold
Let me be
Set me free
Yeah!
Ohh...
Probe me, mould me
Reassemble my brain, my brain
Schizoid, paranoid
Just terms, just names, just names
Why can't you leave me?
Don't drive me insane, insane, insane, insane...Embed
