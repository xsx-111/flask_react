Song To Comus LyricsBright the sunlight, summer day
Comus wakes, he starts to play, play, play, play
(Play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play)
Virgin fair, smiles so sweet
Comus heart begins to beat, beat, beat, beat
(Beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat)
Rise up Comus, sing your song
Bewitch the maiden, the day is long
Cast your spell sweet music crack her virtuous shell
Enchanted damsel, curious ear
Comus music dispel all fear, fear, fear, fear
(Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear)
Dainty feet, they skip so light
Comus laughs, soon comes the night, night, night, night
(Night, night, night, night, night, night, night, night)
Through the forest, dark and deep
She follows Comus dancing feet
He moves away the mossy stone
Reveals the cave, Comus home
Comus glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
Comus glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
Comus bare, bare, bare, bare, bare, bare, bare, bare!
Comus rape! Comus break!
Sweet young virgin's virtue take!
Naked flesh, flowing hair
Her terror screams, they cut the air
But no one hears her there
Comes the sunlight, summer day
Comus wakes, he starts to play, play, play, play
He starts to play, play, play, play
He starts to play, play, play, play
Ugh...
Chastity chaser!
Virile for the virgin's virtue!
Excite her exciter!
You better go before you bleed and he hurts you!
He chased the chaste!
You better leave if you value your virtue!
You better go before you bleed and he hurts you!
You better leave if you value your virtue!
All right now!
Hey! Ugh...
Hey! Ugh...
Hey! Ugh...
Hey! Ugh...
Virgin fair, smiles so sweet
Comus heart begins to beat, beat, beat, beat
Enchanted damsel, curious ear
Comus music, dispel all fear
Through the forest, dark and deep
She follows Comus dancing feet
He moves away the mossy stone
Reveals the cave, Comus home
Misty air, air, air, air, air, air, air, air
Comus glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare, glare
Comus bare, bare, bare, bare, bare, bare, bare, bare!
Chastity chaser!
Virile for the virgin's virtue!
Excite her exciter!
You better go before you bleed and he hurts you!
He chased the chaste!
You better leave if you value your virtue!
You better go before you bleed and he hurts you!
You better leave if you value your virtue!
Hymen hunter, hands of steel
Crack you open and your red flesh peel
He's gonna cut ya!
Pain procurer, eyes of fire
Pierce your womb and push still higher
Memory mauler!
Comus rape! Comus break!
Sweet young virgin's virtue take!
Naked flesh, flowing hair
Her terror screams, they cut the air
But no one hears her there
Comes the sunlight, summer day
Comus wakes he starts to play, play, play, play
He starts to play, play, play, play
He starts to play, play, play, play
He starts to play, play, play, play1Embed
