Drip Drip LyricsYou, dangling, swinging
Hanging, spinning, aftermath
Your soft white flesh turns past me, slaked with blood
Your evil eyes more damning than a demon's curse
Your lovely body, soon caked with mud
As I carry you to your grave, my arms your hearse
You stand before me defenceless
Your stare unchanging, silent, cold, intense sears my brain
Hey, hey!
Drip, drip, ugh!
From your sagging lip
Liquid red down your body spread
Your soft breast glistens, your deep navel fountains
Your shadow over chair
Your shadow over chair
Your shadow over chair like a 'plane over mountains!
Hey, drip, drip!
Hey, drip, drip!
Hey, drip, drip!
In a clearing
Where the sunrays dance amongst the forest's dense secrets
You will softly rest
Your pale beauty enshrined by the sweet glade
Your body at peace
Even the earth will fill the crack where entered my blade
Where entered my blade!

Yea, shall I cut you down?
Yes 'twould be a last physical communion
I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle
I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle, I'll be gentle
I'll not hurt you, I'll not hurt you
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na...
I'll not hurt you!

Drip, drip, ugh!
From your sagging lip
Liquid red down your body spread
Your soft breast glistens, your deep navel fountains
Your shadow over chair
Your shadow over chair
Your shadow over chair like a 'plane over mountains, yeah!
Hey, drip, drip!
Hey, drip, drip!
Hey, drip, drip!
