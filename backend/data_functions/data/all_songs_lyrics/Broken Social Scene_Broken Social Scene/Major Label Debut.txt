Major Label Debut Lyrics
I'm just coming here to come down
I could be here, I could move town
Put my suits right on the guest list
Sign my passport, became weightless

And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

Draper street caught me believing
Spilt their eyes on all the ceilings
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation: it means I love you

And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up

I'm just coming here to come down
I could be here, I could move town
Forced to live like it's a curfew
Translation: it means I love you
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked up
And I'm all hooked upEmbed
