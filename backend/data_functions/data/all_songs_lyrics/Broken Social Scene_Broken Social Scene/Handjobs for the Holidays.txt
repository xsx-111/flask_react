Handjobs for the Holidays Lyrics
Let me take you on
We'll get high just a little
Try to surface the calm
We don't come inside

Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

And is it coming alive?
Try to believe it
Was the question a point?
I don't want your love

Has it brought you closer to this?
Yeah, has it brought you closer to this?

We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see
We've got eyes that leave us in places we don't see

Let me take you on
We'll get high just a little
It kind of takes the joy away
We don't come at all
