7/4 (Shoreline) Lyrics
It's a shoreline
And it's high speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

And you're walking away
Oh, where to go to?
And you're walking alone
Oh, how to get through?
If you want to get it all
You can own what you choose
But you want to live a lie
And love what you lose

It's a shoreline
And it's high speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

While you're walking away
I will try to get through
But you've got to know the lies
From the lies they told you
If you try to do it all
It all will leave you
If you try to steal the beat
The beat will steal you
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in

It's a shoreline
And it's high speed
It's a cruel world
And it's time

It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming in hard
It's coming, it's coming inEmbed
