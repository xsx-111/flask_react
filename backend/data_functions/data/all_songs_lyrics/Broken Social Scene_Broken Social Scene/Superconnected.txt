Superconnected Lyrics
Does it come in cages? Does it come in threes?
I'm tripping on all the time, I'm tripping on high seas
Never the car ride and never the key
I've always been failing but not on my knees
And you want to believe it and you wanna conceive
There's a different suggestion I know that I'll believe
And you want to fuck this right between the knees
Get a little bit bloody, what does it have to do with me?

But I really don't want to think about those things anymore
No, I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
And I don't really think about those things

There's a section for babies, was it making believe?
They get you like creature's cocks, get you like creature's creeds
I've never been sailing, not unless it's the sea
A typical lazy eye staring for you and me
And you want to collect it and you want to conceive
Get it all connected with you and you and me
And I love the darkness, it's what happened to me
I was talking about stuff I cannot believe
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
And I don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I really don't want to think about those things
I really don't want to think about those things anymore
I don't really think about those things

This is superconnected, it's time to leave
This is superconnected, it's time to leave
This is superconnectedEmbed
