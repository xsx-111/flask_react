Swimmers Lyrics
I was
Waiting for you
I was
Standing around
I was
Getting older
I was
Going down

If you always get up late, you'll never be on time
If you always make it after work
Ba ba dadada
After work

Oh, the day never comes
And I stand up
Waiting on
I saw you down there, I know you were tired
I saw you, you looked like a swimmer

I want to be with you
All of the time
Why can't you satisfy?
You look good
But you sound better
You were the best I had
If you always get up late, you're never going to be on time
If you always get up late, you're never going to be on time
And that's a shame
Because I like you
I never see youEmbed
