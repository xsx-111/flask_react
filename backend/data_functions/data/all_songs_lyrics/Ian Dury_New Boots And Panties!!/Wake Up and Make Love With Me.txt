Wake Up and Make Love With Me LyricsI come awake with a gift for womankind
You're still asleep but the gift don't seem to mind
Rise on this occasion, halfway up your back
Sliding down your body, touching your behind
You look so self-possessed
I won't disturb your rest
It's lovely when you're sleeping
But wide awake is best
Wake up and make love with me, wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
I don't want to make you, I'll let the fancy take you
And you'll wake up and make love
You come awake in a horny morning mood
And have a proper wriggle in the naughty naked nude
Roll against my body, get me where you want me
What happens next is private, it's also very rude
I'll go and get the post
And make some tea and toast
You have a lover's sleep, love
It's me that needs it most
Wake up and make love with me, wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me
I don't want to make you, I'll let the fancy take you
And you'll wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me, wake up and make love
Wake up and make love with me, wake up and make love
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up
Wake upEmbed
