I Made Mary Cry LyricsI made mary cry
In a lonley bus shelter
I put in my laundry tongs
In the back of her leg
Severed a hamstring
In the lonley bus shelter
I payed no attention
But I made mary beg
I'm walking the floor
In a white dormatory, called barley lane hospital
I'm dreaming my dreams
In a cold iron bed shhh
Fourteen my days
In a white hospital dormetory
I shall catch up with mary
I'll fuck all your tears away
Hahahahahhahahahhahahahaha
Ha ha h ah aha
I sleep for tonight
In a lonleyl bus shelter
And with me for comfort
I shall my cuddle tongs
When mary passes through
My lonley bus shelter
I shall stick 'em right up her jacksie
I shall put ??? to her ???Embed
