Sink My Boats LyricsI've got the feeling but I ain't got the skill
And I don't like your suggestion
Will you still love me when I'm over the hill
Is another stupid question
Don't deny that I show disrespect
Ask me why I don't change the subject
Justify, but it has no effect
My reply is that I've been ship-wrecked
You try to be sly but you're so overt
And you know the main objection
If the passionate pressure that you exert
In the opposite direction
I'm afraid that it seems evident
A mistake, now it's time that you went
Don't persuade me with your blandishment
My old mates had a bad accident
Sink my boats!
Once again!
Sink my boats!
Crash my plane
Justify, but it has no effect
My reply is that I've been shipwrecked
Sink my boats!
Once again!
Sink my boats!
Sink my boats!
Once again!
Sink my boats!
Crash...Embed
