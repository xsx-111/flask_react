The Lady LyricsThe lady she had a silver tongue
For to sing she said
And maybe that's all
Wait for the dawn and we will have that song
When it ends it will seem
That we hear silence fall
The lady she had a golden heart
For to love, she said
And she did not lie
Wait for the dawn and we'll watch for the sun
As we turn it will seem
To arise in the sky
We heard that song while watching the skies
Oh the sound it rang
So clear through the cold
Then silence fell and the sun did arise
On a beautiful morning of silver and goldEmbed
