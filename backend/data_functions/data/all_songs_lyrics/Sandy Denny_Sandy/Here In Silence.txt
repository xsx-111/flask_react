Here In Silence LyricsSummer skies are gone for ever
Nothing left but to remember
Morning leaves a bed of echoes
Tears of blood in weaping meadows
Can you see me, can you hear me
Can you leave me here in silence?
Drums and flags and trumpets playing
Armies in the night are praying
Hymns of hate to have their souls blessed
For the morning's blood shed harvest
Can you reach me, can you hold me
Can you leave me here in silence?
Take my children, golden children
Grow them, train them, cut them, kill them
For the justice of your Jesus
For the service of your leaders
Can you feel me, can you touch me
Can you leave me here in silence?
Innocence is gone forever
Nothing left but to remember
Autumn cracks the leaves of pity
Winter chokes the cries of mercy
Can you free me, can you love me
Can you leave me here in silence?Embed
