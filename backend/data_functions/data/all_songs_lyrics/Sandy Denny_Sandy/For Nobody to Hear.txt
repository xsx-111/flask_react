For Nobody to Hear LyricsAlthough the flames they are so dim
I can see them from over here
But this is no time to worry now
No time to shed a tear
The people are all smiling
And the letters are all too
The flowers they are all arranged
And the notes they are all blue
Where are the words to say to you
Where do they all begin
I should not have a lot to lose
And everything to win
And I want you to be smiling
I want you not to cry
And even if I hide away
Then you'll get the notion why
A symphony I learnt at school
In pigeonholes so clear
But it made me for to write no songs
For nobody to hear
And I see you are all smiling
Even in the candle light
Just close your eyes and fall asleep
And I think you'll be alright
Close your eyes and fall asleep
And I think you'll be alrightEmbed
