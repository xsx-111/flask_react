Man of Iron LyricsWhere are you riding to Sir Knight
Alone and armed for war?
If not to fight for right Sir Knight
Then what are weapons for?
Why d'you hide your face Sir Knight
Within a face of iron?
The more you shield your eyes from light
The more you'll make them blind
Turn your horse for home Sir Knight
Your hawk and hounds are waiting
Your Lady does not sleep at night
She fears the hand of fate tonight
Turn your face towards the sun
And listen to the minutes run
Oh can't you feel the warning breeze
And hear the whisper in the trees?
Look behind you, man of iron
And your children call and do
Not find you and a wall of silent
Laughter scornes the chorus of their cries
Was this the end you chose, Sir Knight
Was this why you were born so bright?
The wolves will chew your bones tonight
It is your brother's hand you hold so tight
Your brother's blood, your brother's life
Your brother's love, your brother's knifeEmbed
