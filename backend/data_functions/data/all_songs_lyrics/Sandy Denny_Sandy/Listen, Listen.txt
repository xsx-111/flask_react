Listen, Listen LyricsThe young man rose his pretty face
All for to feel the salty spray
When storms are mustering, they say
I'll come and take you all away
I am a traveller by trade
I only have what I have made
A fortune teller too they say
And I can take you all away
Listen Listen to him do
He is the one who is for you
Listen, they say
He'll come and take us all away
And over there the young man stayed
Upon on the rocks so rough and grey
Watching the boy, watching the day
Thinking of how he came to be
A young man he, he is so real
And never more to go astray
He is of value now they say
And he can take himself away
Listen Listen to him do
He is the one who is for you
Listen, they say
He'll come and take us all awayEmbed
