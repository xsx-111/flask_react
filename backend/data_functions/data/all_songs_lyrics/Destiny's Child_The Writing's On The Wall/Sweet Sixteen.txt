Sweet Sixteen Lyrics
You couldn't tell little Jackie nothing
Sixteen, thought she knew it all
She was searching for the love she missed, yeah
And so, she ran away

Slow down (you're moving way too fast)
Sixteen (*there's so much for you to have*)

Sweet sixteen
Do you know where you're running to?
(Do you know?
Sweet sixteen)

She fell in love with a man who was so fine (so fine)
He made her promises, yeah
She didn't stop to think if he was serious, no no no
Until she had his baby
Sweet sixteen, yeah

Slow down (you're moving way too fast)
Sixteen (there's so much for you ahead, oh)
Sweet sixteen (sweet sixteen)
Do you know where you're running to?
(Feel like you've got nowhere to go)

Sixteen years (mm-hmm)
Sixteen prayers (wha-what?)
Sixteen reasons why I care (yeah, yeah)
Sixteen tears (uh-huh)
You're sixteen still (yea-yeah)
Sweet sixteen
Girl
I know you're feelin' lonely (I know you're feelin' lonely)
Who you gonna turn to? (who you gonna turn to, yeah?)
Feels like the world is closing in on you (on you)
Sweet sixteen (on you)
You need to cherish what you have
You can forget about the past
Now you can start all over
You can start all over and
Cherish your life

Slow down (you're moving way too fast, you're only)
Sixteen (there's so much more to life ahead, oh)
Sweet sixteen (sweet sixteen, oh)
Do you know where you're running to?
(Sweet sixteen)
(Girl I know, it gets hard, so take it slow)
Sweet sixteen (sweet sixteen)
Do you know where you're going to?
(Do you know, do you know, do you know where you goin' to, yeah?)
(Sweet sixteen, at sixteen)
At sixteen (do you know?)
Do you know where you're going to?
(Do you know where you're going to?)
(Where you, where you goin' to, where you, where you goin' to?)
Slow down
(You're moving way too fast)
Do you know where you're going to?
(Sweet sixteen, do you know where youâ€™re going to?)
Sweet sixteen (sweet sixteen)
(Sweet sixteen)
At sixteen (sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen)
(Sweet sixteen, ooh)
Sweet sixteen (at sixteen)

(This is for you, Ms. Ann)
Who's now with our heavenly Father
Who made the real commandmentsEmbed
