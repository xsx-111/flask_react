Get On the Bus Lyrics
Uh, uh
Hey baby, how're you?
Why ya face lookin' all sad and blue?
Don't you like the Navigator truck that I brought you?
Why you tryna act a fool?
Don't try to say you see me talkin' to your girlfriend
Ask Tonya and Cheryl then
Give me a place, a time and when
Don't try to accuse me of silly stuff that I'm doin' on the street
You gotta remember, without you, there's no me
I'm just a average man tryna make it in this cold world
So, tell me baby, why you trippin', girl?

I don't wanna fuss with you
So I'm gonna sit out on the couch
Don't try to talk to me
'Cause, boy, I am blockin' you out
I don't wanna hear a thing
Nothin' you've got to say
You should think twice
About the way you've been talkin' to me

Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus (get on the bus)
I ain't got no time for you
Talkin' all that junk (talkin' all that junk)
Me to pack my stuff
Is this what you want? (yeah-yeah)
I don't really care
'Cause there's no more us (oh-ooh)
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus (whoa-oh-ooh)
I ain't got no time for you
Talkin' all that junk (oh-ooh)
Me to pack my stuff (hey, hey)
Is this what you want? (yeah, yeah)
I don't really care (hey)
(Oh whoa-oh)
Ain't got no words for you
So you can stop callin' my friends
Tellin' them it wasn't ya fault
And why I ain't lettin' you in
Too many times before
I let you back in my life
But this is a new day
And this won't go down tonight

Better catch a cab (hey-ay)
Or get on the bus (hey)
I ain't got no time for you
Talkin' all that junk (talkin' all your fudge)
Me to pack my stuff (yeah-eah)
Is this what you want? (ooh)
I don't really care
'Cause there's no more us (there's no more)
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus (get on the bus)
I ain't got no time for you
Talkin' all that junk (baby)
Me to pack my stuff
Is this what you want? (is this what you want?)
I don't really care
'Cause there's no more us (oh-oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (do-da-da, do-da-dow)
Ooh-ooh (ooh-ooh), ooh-ooh (oh oh)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, (say ooh-ow, oh-ooh-ow, oh oh, baby baby) ooh-ooh

Say what, uh, uh, uh
Introduced you to Dolce Gabbana
Advanced you from dirt bikes to Hondas
Took you from that terrible stress
Now you tellin' me that I am a bother
What kind of mess is that to tell a man who put you on his team?
That's just like killin' a dream
"No, no, baby" - that's how it seems
I work hard to build up what I have with you
I pray to God, there's not another man between me and you
So just tell me, there's no need to lie fo' (lie fo')
Why you sleeping wit' yo' eyes closed? (eyes closed)
You don't wanna talk?
A'ight, yo! (a'ight yo)

Better catch a cab (hey)
Or get on the bus (oh)
I ain't got no time for you (no)
Talkin' all that junk (oh-whoa)
Me to pack my stuff
Is this what you want? (is that what you want?)
I don't really care
'Cause there's no more us (no-ooh)
Better catch a cab (yeah)
Or get on the bus (oh-oh)
I ain't got no time for you (hey)
Talkin' all that junk (oh-whoa-oh)
Me to pack my stuff (oh-oh)
Is this what you want?
I don't really care
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus (get on the bus)
I ain't got no time for you (no, no-oh)
Talkin' all that junk (no-oh yeah)
Me to pack my stuff
Is this what you want? (oh-whoa-ooh)
I don't really care (oh-ooh-oh)
'Cause there's no more us (there's no more us)
Better catch a cab
Or get on the bus (get on the bus)
I ain't got no time for you (no, ooh)
Talkin' all that junk (oh oh-oh-ooh, oh-oh)
Me to pack my stuff
Is this what you want? (ooh-oh ooh-oh-oh-oh ooh)
I don't really care
'Cause there's no more us1Embed
