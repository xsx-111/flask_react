Best of Both Worlds Lyrics
In the wee hours of the morning
When everything is still
I lay staring at the darkness
Trying to find the will
Only to be plagues
By roaches, scorpions and mice
Not to mention politics
That's a big cockatrice
The light became morning
The morning became day
Speaking for myself
I wish the darkness had stayed
The morning become evening
The sun is going down
But equality and justice
Is nowhere to be found
Of all this place
I've had my fill
Even in the wee hours of the morning
When everything is stillEmbed
