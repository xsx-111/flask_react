Kill Eye Lyrics
Kill eye tumbling come out of the sky
Kill eye, a fiery retreat from the stars
Kill eye, he came clambering over the wall
Kill eye, halfway to Hell and beyond
I wanna be forgiven
I wanna laugh with children
Won't you ever forgive me?
Please, please forgive me
I wanna hug my mother
And the sky above her
I want the Earth to open up
And hold me

Kill eye, shoot your way out of the bank
Kill eye, watch the security guard
Kill eye, separate a man from his life

I wanna be forgiven
I wanna laugh with children
I wanna ride the pony
Be your one and only friend
Yes, I will love you 'til the end
Kill eye, half way to Hell and beyond
I wanna hug my mother
And the sky above her
I want the Earth to open up
I want the Earth to open upEmbed
