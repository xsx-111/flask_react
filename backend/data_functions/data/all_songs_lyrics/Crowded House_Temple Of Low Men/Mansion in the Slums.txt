Mansion in the Slums LyricsI'd much rather have a caravan in the hills
Than a mansion in the slums
I'd much rather have a caravan in the hills
Than a mansion in the slums
When the taste of success only lasts you
Half an hour or less, but it loves you when it comes
And you laugh at yourself
While you're bleeding to death
I'd much rather have a trampoline in my front room
Than an isolation tank
I wish I was a million miles away from the manager's door
There is trouble at the bank
You laugh at yourself
As you go deep into debt
Laugh at yourself
While he's breathing down your neck
Who can stop me
With money in my pocket?
Sometimes I get it free
The best of both worlds, the best of both worlds
I'd much rather have a caravan in the hills
I'd much rather have a mansion in the hills
Than a mansion in the slums
Yeah, I'd much rather, what I mean is, would you mind if I had it all?
I'll take it when it comes
And you laugh at yourself
While you're bleeding to death
And somebody else is always
Breathing down your neck
Laugh at yourself
While he's hanging over your head
While he's breathing down your neck
It'll soon be over (best of both worlds)
With a mansion, mansion
(Best of both worlds) oh
(Best of both worlds) it'll soon be overEmbed
