When You Come LyricsWhen you come across the sea
Me like a beacon, guiding you to safety
The sooner the better now
And when you come
The hills will breathe like a baby
Pulled up, heaving from the bottom of the ocean
The sooner the better now
And when you come to cover me
Fresh with your kisses
Fresh like a daisy chained up in a lion's den
The sooner the better now
I'll know you by the thunderclap
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions
And that is why
I stumble to my knees
And why, underneath the Heavens
With the stars burning and exploding
I know why I could never let you down
When you come
When you come like an iceberg float in darkness
Smashing my hull send me to the bottom of the sea
I should know you better now
And when you come, your majesty to entrap me
Prince of light receding
The sooner the better now
And when you come to cover me
With your kisses hard like armour
The sooner the better now
I'll know you by the thunderclap
Pouring like a rain of blood to my emotions, hey
And that is why
I stumble to my knees
And why underneath the Heavens
With the stars burning and exploding
I know why I could never let you down
She came out of the water
Into my horizon
Like a cumulo nimbus
Coming in from the distance
Burning and exploding
Burning and exploding
Like a slow volcano
When you come
Cover the ground with ashes, with ashes
Baby, when you come
Nothing changes, now
When you come
Burning and exploding
When you come
When you comeEmbed
