Love This Life LyricsSeal my fate
I get your tongue in the mail
No one is wise
Until they see how it lies
Love this life
Don't wait 'til the next one comes
Gonna pedal my faith
The wheels are still turning round, turn round
And maybe the day will come
When you'll never have to feel no pain
After all my complaining
Gonna love this life, gonna love this life
Love this life, love this life
And so they threw you in jail
Whatever you've done
It was a million to one
And don't you just love this life
When it's holding you down?
Gonna pedal my faith
The wheels are still turning round, turn round
So maybe the day will come
When you'll never have to feel no pain
After all my complaining
Gonna love this life, gonna love this life
Gonna love this life, gonna love this life
Gonna love
Here's something that you can do
Even if you think that I hate you
Stop your complaining
Leave me defenseless
When you love this life, gonna love this life
Gonna love this life, though you'll never know why
Gonna love this life, gonna loveEmbed
