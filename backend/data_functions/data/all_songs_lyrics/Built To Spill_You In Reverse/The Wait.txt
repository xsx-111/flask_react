The Wait Lyrics
You wait, you wait
You wait for summer, then you wait for rain
You wait, you wait
You wait for darkness, then you wait for day
Yeah, you wait
You wait, you wait

And she says patience, darling
Patience, patience - it will come

You wait, you wait
You wait for August, then you wait for May
You wait, you wait
You wait together, then you wait to play
You wait, you wait
You wait for something that'll make the waiting worth the wait
You wait
You wait

And she says patience, darling
Patience, patience - it will comeEmbed
