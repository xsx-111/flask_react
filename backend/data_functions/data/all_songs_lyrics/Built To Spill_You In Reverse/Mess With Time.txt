Mess With Time Lyrics
Come on
Whats to decide?
Reveal your life
Mostly with lies
Review
What you have done
I know it's gone
Back to its sun
Finally
Something to say
Back to their lies
Not to their face
Where to
Go for your life
Back to your fire
But you don't try

Well, oh well, your mind
Still a mess with time
How can you unwind
When my hands are tied?Embed
