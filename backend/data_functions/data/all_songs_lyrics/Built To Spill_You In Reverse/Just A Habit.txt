Just A Habit Lyrics
He's more farce than fodder
He's more of a dog than dogs are
It depends, we're just dots and commas
I'd still say you got one on us

There's no reason for it
Don't despise it and don't adore it
It's just a habit
It's just a habit I formed

This one's a super sonnet
This one's got too much on it
This one's a freak
This one's for free

There's no reason for it
Don't despise and don't adore it
It's just a habitEmbed
