Symphony of Tourette Lyrics
Stutter, stutter, says the little boy
I wanna blow a hole in my head
I swear what this world wants to hear
Trapped in what we know as truth syndrome
Stutter, stutter, silence no friend

Children can be cruel she said
So I smashed her in the fucking head
Sorry, dear, that's the nature of Tourette

Stutter, stutter, nothing else but me
I twitch and turn while underneath
My contemporaries are so in control
Fuck you, fuck you, I grunt and groan
Stutter, stutter, can't keep it no more

Children can be cruel she said
So I smashed her in the fucking head
Sorry, dear, that's the nature of Tourette

Stutter, stutter, are your eyes closed?
You know a hole through which you can fall
But I can't even be bothered to hang on
When you're this numb news don't register
I just opened my eyesEmbed
