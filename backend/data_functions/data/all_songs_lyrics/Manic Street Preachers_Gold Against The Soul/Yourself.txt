Yourself Lyrics
Your ritual everyday
A mild shower soak in aftershave
Best clothes do your best
Look in the mirror go on
Belittle yourself yourself yourself
Belittle yourself yourself yourself

You go on day after day
Dreaming on a lie
That you keep locked inside
Of yourself
Yourself
Yourself
Of yourself
Yourself
Yourself

Can you sleep tonight
Cast aside for some pouting young pup
Sink into a slurred veneer
Alcoholic haze so now
Least you can like yourself yourself
Least you can like yourself yourself
You go on day after day
Reservoirs of guilt
That your fixed grin always hides
And yourself
Yourself
Yourself
Of yourself
Yourself
Yourself
And yourself
Yourself
Yourself
Of yourself
Yourself
Yourself

You look at ads all day
Everyone is perfect and you're so lame
Free scent burns your skin
But no smell can really cover sin
Too many teenage holes to fill
Too many teenage holes to fill

You go on day after day
Speak to your despised
Blanking your loved ones
And yourself
Yourself
Yourself
And yourself
Yourself
Yourself
And yourselfEmbed
