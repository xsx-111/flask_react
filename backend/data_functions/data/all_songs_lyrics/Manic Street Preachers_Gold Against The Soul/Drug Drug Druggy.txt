Drug Drug Druggy Lyrics
So much fun to be had in my head
No more sunshine
So much fun just lying in my bed
No more sunshine
I can't face the sunlight and the dirt outside
Wanna stay in 666 where this darkness don't lie

Drug drug druggy
Got a feeling sweet like honey
Drug drug druggy
I need sensation like my baby
Show me your scars you're so aware
I'm not barbaric I just care
Drug drug drug

I need a reflection to prove I exist
No more sunshine
I am a victim of designer blitz
No more sunshine
Dance like a robot when you're chained at the knee
The C.I.A. Say you're all they'll ever need

Drug drug druggy
Got a feeling sweet like honey
Drug drug druggy
I need sensation like my baby
Snort your lines you're so aware
I'm not barbaric I just care
Drug drug drug
Drug drug druggy
Got a feeling sweet like honey
Drug drug druggy
I need sensation like my baby
Drug drug druggy
Drug drug druggy
Drug drug druggy
