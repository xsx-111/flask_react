The Element of One Lyrics
Breathe me in, breathe me in

Torn, disbelieving separation
I close my eyes to see you

This is for you, everything I am
This is for you, take it from me

Torn, disbelieving separation
I close my eyes, but there's no escaping this

This is for you, everything I am
This is for you, take it from me

In your arms, in your soul, I will be rejuvenated

Breathe me in
(I'm forever)
Deep within
(I'm eternal)
Breathe me in
(I'm forever)
Deep within
(I'm eternal)
I will return to you

I am with you always, and I will never turn away from you

Breathe me in
(I'm forever)
Deep within
(I'm eternal)
Breathe me in
(I'm forever)
Deep within
(I'm eternal)Embed
