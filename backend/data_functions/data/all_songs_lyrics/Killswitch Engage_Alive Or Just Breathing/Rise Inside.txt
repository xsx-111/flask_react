Rise Inside Lyrics
Rise inside
Free your mind
Raise your fist
To signify
We stand in defiance
Of hatred and deception
If I stand alone
I'll fight for you

The time has come to
Make a difference
Why have we forsaken love
The time has come to
Raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me

Embrace what we have
It might be the last time
In this life we will rise (In this life we will rise)
If we find the strength to unify

Rise inside
Free your mind
Raise your fist
To signify
We stand in defiance
Of hatred and deception
If I stand alone
I'll fight for you
The time has come to
Make a difference
Why have we forsaken love
The time has come to
Raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me

Embrace what we have
It might be the last time
In this life we will rise (In this life we will rise)
If we find the strength to unify

Hatred is a weakness
You become the victim
I believe love will overcome

The time has come to
Make a difference
Why have we forsaken one another
The time has come to
Raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me
The time has come to
Raise our voices
So rise up and fight with me
The time has come (The time has come)
The time has come (The time has come)
The time has come to rise inside, rise insideEmbed
