In the Unblind Lyrics
Separation from the faceless majority
Step on the outside
Look on the inside

Tear, tear it apart
A prisoner only in your own mind
Individuality will bring you life
Time to rise above to freedom

So much love (So much love lost)
What have we (What have we become?)
Rise against (The oppression)
Resist (Question)

Separation from the faceless majority
Step on the outside
Look on the inside

Tear, tear it apart
A prisoner only in your own mind
Individuality will bring you life
Time to rise above to freedom
So much love (So much love lost)
What have we (What have we become?)
Rise against (The oppression)
Resist (Question)

Burn the system
Kill the system
Burn the system
Kill the system

Kill the mind state
Of indifference
Step into the unblind
Reclaim your life

Burn the system
Kill the system
Burn, in the unblind
Kill, reclaim your lifeEmbed
