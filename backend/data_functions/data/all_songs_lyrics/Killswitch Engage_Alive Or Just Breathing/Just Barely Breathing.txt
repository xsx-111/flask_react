Just Barely Breathing Lyrics
Descend into hysteria, chaos of mankind
But who is listening to the voice of hatred?
Tortured souls lost, so completely lost
Weakened in the concept of decline, deception

Descend into hysteria, chaos of mankind
But who is listening to the voice of hatred?
Tortured souls lost, so completely lost
Weakened in the concept of decline, deception

Are we alive, or just breathing?
Don't close your eyes, see the images
Are we alive, or just breathing?
Don't close your eyes, see the images

The skies weep tonight
Our bodies washed away
I am waiting for you
Deliverance
The sun falls through the clouds
Hear my cry
Are we alive, or just breathing?
Don't close your eyes, see the images
Are we alive, or just breathing?
Don't close your eyes, see the images

The skies weep tonight
Our bodies washed away
I am waiting for you
Deliverance
The sun falls through the clouds
Hear my cry

I am waiting for you, (I am waiting for you)
(For you)
I am waiting for you, (I am waiting for you)
(For you)
I am waiting for you, (I am waiting for you)
(For you)
I am waiting for you, (I am waiting for you)
(For you)
I am waiting for you, I am waiting for you, I am waiting for youEmbed
