Numbered Days Lyrics
The time approaches
(Fall)

This is the voice of the voiceless
We have learned by making choices
After persecution and delusion
We have severed a solution
To build our foundation on natural elements to preserve life
We will rise, this Babylon

Fall

Chanting inspiration for the righteous
Dislocation from the social order
Kingdoms will rise, to power
But kingdoms fall to dust
Fall, fall, fall

Chanting inspiration for the righteous
Dislocation from the social order
Kingdoms will rise to power
But kingdoms fall to dust
Fall, fall, fall
The ashes of the dead will be a sign
The time approaches
No one will hear their cries from Babylon
The time approaches

Arms raised (Raised)
Eyes gaze (Gaze)
Tongues of fire whisper
This life (life) will soon (soon) slip away
Fall

Babylon
Your days are numbered
The time
The time approaches

Arms raised (Raised)
Eyes gaze (Gaze)
Tongues of fire whisper
This life (life) will soon (soon) slip away
Fall
Babylon, you will fall
Your days are numbered
The time approaches
No one hear you cry as you fall
Fall, fall, fallEmbed
