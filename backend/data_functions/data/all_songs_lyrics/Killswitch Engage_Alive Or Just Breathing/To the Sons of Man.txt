To the Sons of Man Lyrics
You, son of man, I am here as a witness
You, son of man, can't you see what burns inside me?
This fire will consume as the flames purify
With the peace that passes understanding, this is my outcry
From dust to dust we will return
The flesh is temporary, the soul is eternal

I am here as a witness, can't you see this fire purifies
This fire will consume (This fire will consume)
As the flames purify (As the flames purify)
Son of man, can't you see?
Son of man, you can't save yourselfEmbed
