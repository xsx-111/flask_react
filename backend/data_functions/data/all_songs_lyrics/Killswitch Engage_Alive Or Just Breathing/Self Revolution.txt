Self Revolution Lyrics
I can't comprehend society's movement
The regression of human existence
This is the quest of life
Fulfill your destiny

Slow down the fast paced world
And you will see past the illusion

Breaking the foundation
Collapse the control
Building a revolution to heal the nations
It starts within you

Slow down the fast paced world
And you will see past the illusion

Breaking the foundation
Collapse the control
Building a revolution to heal the nations
It starts within you
(Reversal of oneself finding the truth)
In this search for I and I the truth is always deep inside

This is the quest of life (Quest of life)
We must find the strength (Find the strength)
In this quest of life (Quest of life)
We must find the strength
For a new movement

(Reversal of oneself finding the truth)
In this search for I and I the truth is always deep inside

Slow down this fast paced world and you will see revolution
For a new, new movementEmbed
