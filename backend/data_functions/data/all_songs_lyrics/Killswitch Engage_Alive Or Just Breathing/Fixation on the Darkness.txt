Fixation on the Darkness Lyrics
Fixation on the darkness
That engulfs this world
Drain the life force of our people
Change
Change
Fixation on the darkness
That engulfs this world
Drain the life force of our people

Return to the womb, new life
Lay your head to rest, mercy
To give you a peace of mind
Lay your head to rest

Come together inside
This body is only a shell
Change, the only way we will survive
Light, transfiguration of the soul
Of the soul, of the mind
Fixation on the darkness
That engulfs this world
Drain the life force of our people
Return to the womb, new life
Lay your head to rest, mercy
To give you a peace of mind
Lay your head to rest

Tell them
They will not hold us down
It's time for change, change
It's time for change, change
It's time for change
They will not hold us down
They will not hold us down
It's time for change
It's time for change1Embed
