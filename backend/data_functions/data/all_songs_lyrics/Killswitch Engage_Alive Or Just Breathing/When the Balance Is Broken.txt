When the Balance Is Broken Lyrics
Take comfort in these words
You are not alone
There is a purpose

Through the loneliness and depression
This is not in vain
Through the tribulation, find redemption
This is not in vain

For the frustration we've endured
The struggle continues

Don't let them drag you down
Keep your eyes wide open
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your focus unbroken

Take refuge in these words
There comes a day for retribution

Through the loneliness and depression
This is not in vain
Through the tribulation, find redemption
This is not in vain
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your eyes wide open
Don't let them drag you down
Keep your focus unbroken

All will be revealed
When the balance is broken
All will be revealed
When the balance is broken
Balance is broken
Balance is broken
Balance is broken
Balance is brokenEmbed
