Life to Lifeless Lyrics
Humanity cover me, with the ashes of remembrance
I will learn from this pain (Pain)
There is no darkness without light to teach us of ourselves
Humanity cover me, with the ashes of remembrance
I will learn from this pain

Life to lifeless, to eternity
Life to lifeless, and the cycle repeats

Death unfolds itself painfully to unmask how fragile we are
Death unfolds itself painfully, teacher of sanity

The pain drags me down, I'll rebuild me
The pain drags me down, I'll rebuild me

Humanity cover me, with the ashes of remembrance
I will learn from this pain

Life to lifeless, to eternity
Life to lifeless, and the cycle repeats
Life to lifeless, to eternity
Life to lifeless, and the cycle repeats

Life to lifeless, to eternity
Life to lifeless, and the cycle repeatsEmbed
