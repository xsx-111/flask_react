World LyricsOh it seems so very lonesome
All my friends are traveling so far away
Oh for the love of a brother
Oh it seems so very strange
The faulty one should point out what I lack
Oh for the trust of another
Everybody's pointing a finger
Won't somebody tell me when
They're gonna stop ridiculing me, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna try and find my head
Help me if you can
All I'm asking is an even break
Treat me like a man
Oh it seems so very cruel
No one can seem to get together
Oh for the peace of a nationEmbed
