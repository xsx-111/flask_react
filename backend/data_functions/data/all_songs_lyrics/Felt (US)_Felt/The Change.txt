The Change Lyrics
It makes me feel so good inside
To give somebody a secure feeling
So good
It always seems to make me smile
To think that I have helped a little
I smile
I've always been so satisfied
To sit and watch the changes happen
No more
It only takes a little while
To make a thought a complete reality
I think we should start now

Well things were changing slow
And everybody knows that this ain't helping anybody
We want some changes fast
So we can leave the past
And have a good time living
We want to break these chains and be free now
We want to open your eyes so you can see now
But we ain't got no time
Well people run us down
They throw our lives around
We're really getting tired of running
And we're dissatisfied
Are rights can't be denied
We've got a few things coming
We want to break these chains and be free now
We want to open your eyes so you can see now
But we ain't got no time
Standing up on the mountain
Watching the flames die
We're all watching the truth go
Wondering why
Cause we are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, haven't got a home
We are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, the life is gone
You said you wanted freedom
But you didn't know how
You've had your revolution
Where are we now
We are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, haven't got a home
We are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, the life is gone
We are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, haven't got a home
We are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, the life is gone
Life isn't long
Whatever's done
We can change it
Your way was wrong
So please help us try
To rearrange it
Not much is left
So just say a prayer
We're still living
We'll find a way
If we will all
Join in giving
You can do what you to
Have things your own way
We are building a new world
And we want you to stay
Cause we are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, the life is gone
We are lonely, we are lonely
We are lonely, but we are strongEmbed
