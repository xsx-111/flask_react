Destination LyricsWell every day we spend together
Has touched my heart forever
But I must leave, now or never
And seek a life that I must live
On the road lookin' for my place in life
Got no job for speculation
Help me find my destination
I must be free to suit my freeing
For better ways of being
And living long and seeing
The things this life has to give
On the road lookin' for my place in life
Got no job for speculation
Help me find my destination
Well I have thought of things concerning
My life and love of learning
And yet I'm always yearning
For more to see and more to do
On the road lookin' for my place in life
Got no job for speculation
Help me find my destinationEmbed
