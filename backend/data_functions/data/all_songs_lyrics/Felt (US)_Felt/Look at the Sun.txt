Look at the Sun Lyrics
Look at the sun
See how it shines on our lies
We were never meant to see
The truth in their eyes
All your life they brought you up
Believing those lies

Look at the sun
Doesn’t it make you feel sad
Knowing that you’ve lost
The only love that you had?
No one ever told us
Life would hurt us so bad
Besides make us glad

And the sun is like a lover
Growing bright and warm each day
And grows dim
And sinks slowly away
Refusing to stay

Look at the sun
Rising each morning anew
I would like to think
That love would rise again, too
But I know that things like that
Can never be true
For me and you
Look at the sun
See how it shines on our lies
We were never meant to see
The truth in their eyes
All your life they brought you up
Believing those lies
Those liesEmbed
