Dripping With Looks LyricsSo into the chaff
Last laughs of the traveling class
Low tide on the sand
Sad strand of the government land
I'd not be such a disgrace to
Everything that I've been through
If I had it to do
Dripping with looks like you
Private heaven blonde
Small pond of the demimonde
Want it back to lose
Soft shoes
Always something to prove
And I'd do anything once, too
Just shut up about school
I think I'd learn too
Dripping with looks like you Washing on a tide of
Laughs come and gone
Stranded and withdrawn
What's the news
Turns out the
Government knew
Small and private views
What did you want
Again?Embed
