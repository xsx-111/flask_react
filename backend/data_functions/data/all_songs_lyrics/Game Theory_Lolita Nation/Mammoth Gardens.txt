Mammoth Gardens LyricsWe were breaking in but it was an open door
And there we found the decades dancing breaking in by radio
Slingshot windows opened up the sky
Defying our defiling
We, we found a place where runaways could belong
In Mammoth Gardens
And we would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
And we would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
We would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
We would dance, we would dance
We would dance and dance and dance and dance and dance
Oh, just that one time did you really love me?
Seven years ago when we left our footprints in the dust
August stars are shining and I'm still waiting for summer to come
I heard it shatter in you voice
You, you said you can't go home anymore
In Mammoth Gardens
And we would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
And we would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
We would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
We would dance, we would dance
We would dance and dance and dance and dance and dance
Take me back on an airplane
To the deepest shadows and then pull me down
And make me remember just how hard we used to play
Name your price, name it
You know I'll pay for just one sunny day
To be dancing the way we danced
In Mammoth Gardens
And we would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
We would dance
In Mammoth Gardens
We would dance, we would dance
We would dance and dance and dance and dance and danceEmbed
