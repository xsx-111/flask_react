Chardonnay LyricsI was feeling the weight of the atmosphere
And those I know aren't looking overjoyed I'm here
Daughters about fourteen order wine
And Chardonnay shows what she knows when she decides
Couldn't tell you now what clicked inside
Or why that's what I call her
Hardly floored but still reminded
That I once could want it all, all...
I don't know any that age who've died of greed
And so was I once letting be and letting bleed
I believe David Carradine changed a lot
Eastern wisdom Kunging Fu on western thought
But was always missing that same spot
Or knew but wouldn't say
A lot of life's best things are
Further than a Zen proverb away
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
They can always put you down some way
But I can't see you being saved for one more rainy day
It was easy to think at the U-Canteen
Drunk and small-time, finishing the quarter mean
That a lot of the structure would have to fall
Haves and have-nots polarized at facing walls
I don't think I believed it all
But needed just the same
A way to deal with being shut out
Of the decent peoples' game
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
They can always put you down some way
But I can't see you being saved for one more rainy day
(Well the company found me out combing the streets
And sure I signed on, legs across the vacant seats
But I found out quick where I really stood
Love-me love-nots sounding off the neighborhood
Chardonnay, how I've done battle, girl
To come this far away
There's not a world where I can talk to you
But I know what I'd say
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
They can always put you down some way
But I can't see you being saved for one more rainy day
Well I ended up down on the dispatch line
Hugs and headaches, all my problems solely mine
Don't you laugh when I talk about loyalty
When it's all you'll
Have, and one day it might be
I will look inside but you won't see
A glum look on my face
I may not use these words my whole life
But I keep them just in case)*
Well it's harder each night, gonna take a miracle
Gonna take Ernst, Dali and di Chirico
Gonna recharge cranio-mechanical
Turning me right back into an animal
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay
Hey Chardonnay, Chardonnay
Chardonnay, oh Chardonnay...
(It's a lonelier look to the finer things
And Chardonnay sees what she needs when freedom rings
If the fog ever lifts on this final town
We may or may not find we'll want to stand its ground
Its accomplishments worn badly down
The chief exec's in jail
If it's a dollar higher this time
I think no one's paying bail
Oh oh oh
Hey Chardonnay)*
