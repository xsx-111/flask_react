Nothing New LyricsI was on the outs today
Feeling hit up for a price I thought that I'd never have to pay
Wicker old-world store displays
Sure I'll take your warm hearth autumn line
But with what for any fair exchange?
Accounting says the terms can't seem to be arranged
And girl I know it's nothing new
To find someone in love with you
And if you are so inclined to change your mind a thousand times then do
And I will wait for you
Second nature in my mind
Like a seven hundred dollar tab of unpaid traffic fines
And you can't walk the streets these days
Now I'm thinking we've all paid the price
But none too many get our way
And we give to get you till we give it all away
'Cause girl we know it's nothing new
To find someone in love with you
And if you are so inclined to change your mind a thousand times then do
And I will wait for you
Nothing newEmbed
