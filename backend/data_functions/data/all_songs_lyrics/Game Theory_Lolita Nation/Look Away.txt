Look Away LyricsThey say it comes to you
Like a light in a dark blue night
Irresistible, too clean and too bright
I tried to sleep it off
And I tried to hate it off
And I don't want to wait
I, I just don't want to wait
Every morning another darkness falls
Holds me gently but it won't let me go
And when I say I want to get away
I mean I want to get away
Well, shine the light, shine the light
I won't look away, won't look away, won't look away
I won't look away, oh noEmbed
