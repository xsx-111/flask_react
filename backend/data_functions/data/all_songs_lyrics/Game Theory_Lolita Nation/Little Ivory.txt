Little Ivory LyricsLittle Ivory
What's it going to be?
Come on the cherub lover
Exit the third degree
And oh Little Ivory
The sun going down
And who'll Little Ivory decide
To follow to town?
Oh, Little Ivory
So unsafe to see
Daddy's big guns shoot down
All hope of reasoning
And there'll be no locking him out if we please
With all of his lawyers he won't need
To use any keys
Ohhh...
Little Ivory
March in the last parade
Up north of Johnny's town
Pulling up tracks you laid
And ivory's discovering what gets her her way
And will Little Ivory decide
To leave it someday?
Never
Ohh, woah...Embed
