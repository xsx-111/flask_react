Together Now, Very Minor LyricsBecome the agile ones with legal means
The men who bring the message to Abilene
Look-at-me togs boxed up at mom's on the floor
The news came hard and has never been taken right
Top-level-cleared and riding the satellite
Girl, stretch your legs and find what besides me is new
And write the obit when you do
He never ran out when the spirits were low
A nice guy as minor celebrities go
All right all together now, very minor I know
The levee view reads like life as it used to be
But coming now the only thought striking me
Is take it in well
As eyelids of evening come down
Your beautiful longing world unwound
He never ran out when the spirits were low
A nice guy as minor celebrities go
All right all together now, very minor I know
And please don't pay attention to
A thing I do or say
It's a ploy to drag you out
And take it all away
All away, all away
All away, all away
All away, all away
All away
All away
All away
All away
All away
All awayEmbed
