Not Because You Can LyricsIf your eyes are green, you will turn and stay sixteen
Never disappointed by a show of hands
And if your eyes are soft, you can turn it on and off
You won't be shy when making your demands
And if your eyes are slow
You will always be a lonely woman
And not because you can
No, the time is now for deciding if you canEmbed
