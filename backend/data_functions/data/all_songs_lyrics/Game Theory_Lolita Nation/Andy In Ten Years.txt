Andy In Ten Years LyricsAndy don't speak I hardly think
You could live with what you'd say
And you're not the kind that likes justice blind
When it's facing back your way
Andy you're banging on the keys
But you can't flesh out a tune
You can lower your sights and read your rights
But you can't get good in an afternoon
Andy you're known for saying you don't
Speak Merit-Systemese
But to make it on friends too much depends
How eager you are to please
Andy you don't know the street
If you think that's how to live
Who's going to have cried when you've told your side?
I, I thought you were just being negative
Andy, it's such a lonely fight
Don't make it any harder than it might be
Andy, keeping the injuries slight
Your nights alone must sink like stone
Without a star to guide
You're not the kind that in ten years' time
Will have won more to your side
Andy your bratty kid abrasion's
The charm that gets you by
You can lay the blame and place the names
But you, you can't play ignorant a second time
Andy, it's such a lonely fight
Don't make it any harder than it might be
Andy, keeping the injuries slight
Andy, oh, it's such a lonely fight
Don't make it any harder than it might be
Andy, keeping the injuries slight
Keeping the injuries slight
Keeping the injuries slight
Keeping the injuries slightEmbed
