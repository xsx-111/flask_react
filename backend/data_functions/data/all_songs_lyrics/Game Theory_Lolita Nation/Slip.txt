Slip LyricsNo one twisting his arm
Okay, 1,2,3 now
Well, I should have spent tonight out finding some good ledge
It's time to look at long shots, the cheap end of the wedge
You used to hear our fights half a block away
I'm wondering now which ones I could have lost to make her stay
Well, I call a friend of mine and say I haven't heard a thing
The world has made you tired, wound down the driving spring
He says you're still a child and I hope you never change
But I can't jump at every chance that's moving out of range
Second hand slow now
I don't know how
Hours got right of way
On the verge of a perfect day
The slate I got clean won't stay clean long
And the love I got over won't stay gone
But the pain of the slip through fingers lingers on
Well, run the blacktop circuit, find the ethnic buys
Who is going to love this place when the trade route dies
Gassed to make the coast homes, roll the windows tight
Young men it's not your concern where money spends the night
I...
New top guns I say glad to shake your hand
Lots don't get so lucky and luck is what will stand
Find you've got no grip on anything that lasts
And all you party boys had best get serious and fast
Hearts at each side go
High now then low
What will make the race?
Maybe leaving without a trace
The slate I got clean won't stay clean long
And the love I got over won't stay gone
But the pain of the slip through fingers lingers on
The slate I got clean won't stay clean long
And the love I got over won't stay gone
But the pain of the slip through fingers lingers onEmbed
