We Love You, Carol And Alison LyricsAll I ate was spearmint candy
Trying to change the flavor of the days
And chasing inundation only childish ways
But oh this time the sugar was dazzling
Saying for once you might just join the game
And don't insist on always seeming less the same
With the smile and of the clique
Princess, in this context you're a freak
But you must see
In your crassest hour the charm still works on me
And will you take on our age's dream
We love you, Carol and Alison
Oh will you take us 'cause it's still a green land
And it still works as planned
And 'cause the glory is at hand
Right at hand
These evenings turn out to be such a crapshoot
Don't be such a reason not to leave
'Cause I smoke and kiss the same in all realities
And when they ask who's giving the rides
I feel as if I promised I'd look out
For all the lonely souls who still go home without
When the shoulder upstairs gets cold
If he had his way we'd all be old
And he's got nerve
Asking this Lolita nation to bow and serve
And will you take on our age's dream
We love you, Carol and Alison
Oh will you take us 'cause it's still a green land
And it still works as planned
And 'cause the glory is at hand
Right at handEmbed
