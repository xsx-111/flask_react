The Real Sheila LyricsThe word must be go easy
Showing yourself to those eyes
Criteria running high
Austere and lost? No
They're tired of themselves as I am
Watching the shows go by
Lord knows that I'm not exactly the boy of my own dreams
And if I were a girl with dreams I'd have dreams as big as you please
Sheila stay home a little longer
I'm going to phone you until I do
Sheila don't let them any closer
Worlds will be changing when I get through
And nobody knows the real Sheila like I do
Oh, Sheila stay home a little longer
I'm going to phone you until I do
Sheila don't let them any closer
Worlds will be changing when I get through
And nobody knows the real Sheila like I do
The word must be head down
And don't know a thing you're doing
And hear what the storefronts say
And dress clothes and thrill shows
Will take you like hands wherever
The word is get on your way
Where you know you're going someday
Oh, Sheila stay home a little longer
I'm going to phone you until I do
Sheila don't let them any closer
Worlds will be changing when I get through
And nobody knows the real Sheila like I doEmbed
