Jack Orion LyricsJack Orion was as good a fiddler
As ever fiddled on a string
He could make young women mad
To the tune his fiddle would sing
He could fiddle the fish out of salt water
Or water from a marble stone
Or the milk out of a maiden's breast
Though baby she got none
He's taken his fiddle into his hand
He's fiddled, and he's sung
And tho he's played unto the king
Who never thought it long
As he sat fiddling in a castle hall
He's played them all so sound asleep
All but for the young princess
And, for love, she stayed awake
At first he played a slow, grave tune
And then a gay one, too
And many's the sigh and the loving word
That passed between them two
Come to my bower, sweet Jack Orion
When all men are at rest
As I am a lady true to my word
Thou shalt be a welcome guest
He's wrapped his fiddle in a cloth of green
And a glad man was he
Then he's run off to his own house
Saying "Tom, come hither to me"
"When day has dawned and the cocks have crowed
And flapped their wings so wide
It's I am bidden to that lady's door
To stretch out by her side"
"Lie down in your bed, my good master
And sleep long as you may
I'll keep good watch, and I'll waken you
Three hours before 'tis day"
But he rose up, that worthless lad
His master's clothes did don
The collar he's got about his neck
He seemed the gentleman
Well, he didn't take that lady gay
Down to bolster nor to bed
But down upon the bower floor
Very quick he had her laid
And he neither kissed her when he came
Nor when from her he did go
And in and out of her window
The moon like a coal did glow
"Ragged are your stockings, love
Stubbly is your cheek and chin
And tangled is that yellow hair
That I saw yester' eve"
"These stockings belong to my boy, Tom
They're the first came to my hand
The wind, it tangled my yellow hair
As I rode o'er the land"
Tom took his fiddle into his hand
So saucy there he sang
Then he's off back to his master's house
As fast as he could ran
"Wake up, wake up, my good master
I fear 'tis almost dawn
Wake up, wake up, the cock has crowed
It's time that you were gone"
Then quickly rose up Jack Orion
Put on his cloak and shoes
And cast a collar about his neck
He was a lord's true son
And when he came to the lady's bower
He lightly rattled at the pin
The lady was true to her word
She arose and let him in
"Oh, whither have you left with me?
Your bracelet or your glove?
Or are you returned back again
To know more of my love?"
Jack Orion swore a bloody oath
By oak and ash and bitter thorn
Saying, "Lady, I never was in your house
Since the day that I was born"
"Oh, then it was your young footpage
That has so cruelly beguiled me
And woe that the blood of the ruffian lad
Should spring in my body!"
Then she pulled forth a little sharp knife
That hung down at her knee
O'er her white feet the red blood run
Or ever a hand could stay
And dead she lay at her bower floor
At the dawning of the day
Jack Orion's run to his own house
Saying, "Tom, my boy, come here to me
Come hither now, and I'll pay your fee
And well paid you shall be"
"If I had killed a man tonight
Tom, I would tell it thee
Or if I have taken no life tonight
Tom, thou hast taken three"
Then he pulled out his bright broad sword
And dried it on his sleeve
And he smote off that vile lad's head
And asked for no man's leave
He set the sword's point unto his breast
And the pommel to a stone
For through the falseness of that lying lad
These three lives were all goneEmbed
