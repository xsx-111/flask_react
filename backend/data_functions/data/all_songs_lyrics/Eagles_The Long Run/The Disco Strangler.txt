The Disco Strangler Lyrics
Looking for the good life
Dressed to kill
She don't have to worry
'Cause there's always someone else who will
Loose and loaded every night
Dancing underneath the flashing light saying
"Look at me, baby, look at me
I'm beautiful, I'm beautiful, I'm somebody!"
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler

He's been around here all along, baby
Been waiting for his time to come
You looking for attention, darling
He will surely give you some
He's the crimson in your face du jour
The fiddler in your darkest night
He's the melody without a cure
And Rome is burning but that's alright
Just slip into the arms of the disco strangler
Just slip into the arms of the disco stranglerEmbed
