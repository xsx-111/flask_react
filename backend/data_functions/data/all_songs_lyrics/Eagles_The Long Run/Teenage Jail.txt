Teenage Jail Lyrics
Stare out the window
You can't make the time go
You don't even know why you're here
Wait for the weekend to go off the deep end
And make everything disappear

You're lost in a teenage jail
So young and so vicious and so frail
Where something is always for sale
You're lost in a teenage jail

You're not like your mothers (not like your mother!)
You're not like the others (not like the other!)
You're not quite like anyone else (You're not quite like anyone else, no, no)
They don't even know you
Got nothing to show you
So get something good for yourself
