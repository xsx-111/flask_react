Tell Me Lyrics
Well now tell me, what in the world can be wrong
I said tell me, what in the world can be wrong
Woke up this mornin', trouble knockin' at my door
I wonder what's the trouble, great big troubles at my door
I wonder what's the trouble, great big troubles at my door
Yes I'm goin' up to Macon, don't wanna be here no more
I'd better forget it, let this trouble pass
I'd better forget it, let this trouble pass
Yes, I wonder sometime, how long my trouble gonna last


I said goodbye, goodbye baby got to go
I said goodbye, goodbye baby got to go
I ain't hangin' 'round here
Worrying where there's trouble no more

Trouble is knockin', trouble is knockin'
Trouble is knockin', trouble is knockin'
Trouble is knockin', can't be where it's at no moreEmbed
