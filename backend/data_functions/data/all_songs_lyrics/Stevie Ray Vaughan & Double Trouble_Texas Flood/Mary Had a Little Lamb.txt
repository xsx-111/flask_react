Mary Had a Little Lamb Lyrics
Mary had a little lamb
His fleece was white as snow
Everywhere that child went
Your little lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
And broke the teacher's rule
What a time did they have
That day at school

Tisket tasket baby
A green and yellow basket
Sent a letter to my baby
On my way I passed itEmbed
