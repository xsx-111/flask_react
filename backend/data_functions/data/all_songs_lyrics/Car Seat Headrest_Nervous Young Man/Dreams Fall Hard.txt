Dreams Fall Hard Lyrics
Last night I dreamed I had to tell
My parents about us
And when I woke up I was crying
Mother shook me by the shoulders
Said, “you’re ruining your life!”
I’m sorry that your bright young boy is dying
I know I dishonored
The family name
But all I ever had was my heart
And I wake up a kid
In a bed miles from home
But I’m too old to get a new start

I’ve heard I talk in my sleep
But my voice is too weak
To hear the words I say
And I’ve been trying like hell
To wake myself up
But dreams fall hard today
Dreams fall hard today
In a vision of death
You breathe your last breath
And all that I hold is cold embers
And I sing in your ear
But there’s nothing to hear
Just a night owl in burial chambers
You say that you love me
And I write it all down
So when you’re gone I’ll remember
But as I get old I find
I can’t trust my own mind
And your words all break down into laughter

I’ve heard I talk in my sleep
But my voice is too weak
To hear the words I say
And I’ve been trying like hell
To wake myself up
Dreams fall hard today
Dreams fall hard today
I watch myself falling apart
My body can’t keep up with my heart
What I see I can’t understand
Your sweet boy’s becoming a nervous old man

I wake up with tears
Not yet dried on my face
No comfort in the cold light of morning
Young men see visions
And old men dream dreams
And it all amounts to a warning

I’ve heard I talk in my sleep
But my voice is too weak
To hear the words I say
And I’ve been trying like hell
To wake myself up
But dreams fall hard today
I’ve heard I talk in my sleep
But my voice is too weak
To hear the words I say
And I’ve been trying like hell
To wake myself up
But dreams fall hard today
Dreams fall hard today
Dreams fall hard today
Dreams fall hard today
And by the time
I get it out of my mind
Night has fallen upon me again

"Hey! What are you doing in here?"
"What?"
"You need to get out."
"Oh, I'm sorry...?"
"Yeah"
"Ok, um "2Embed
