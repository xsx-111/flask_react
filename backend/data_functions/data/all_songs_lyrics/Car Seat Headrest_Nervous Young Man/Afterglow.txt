Afterglow Lyrics
(Ahh, it's so hard)
(I can change)

Mama said all your dreams will come true
If you sleep in the right bed
Tell me what time it is
I have been working on my plan
I’m gonna fall in love forever
Won’t you tell me what time it is?
How can wood live longer than me?
How can glass live longer than me
When it breaks so easily?

What are you supposed to do after sex if you don’t smoke?
How can you know what money tastes like if you’re broke?
I’m not responsible for what happens after this song
Why do you think mine are always so long?

(Mmm-hmm)
Gimme that afterglow
I’ve got to be content with what I’ve got
(Mmm-hmm)
Gimme that afterglow
I’ve got to be content with what I’ve got
(Mmm-hmm)
Gimme that afterglow
I’ve got to be content with what I’ve got
(Mmm-hmm)
I know my soul must have lost its shine
But there must still be time
I still feel fine, ‘cept when I don’t
Pray to the lord at every temptation
Just 1 More, the call letters of my station
And I try to live right, I try to keep sober
Try to keep my friends close and keep myself closer
But I break so easily

(But oh my God)
What are you supposed to do after sex if you don’t smoke?
How can you know what money tastes like if you’re broke?
I’m not responsible for what happens after this song
(But oh my God)
Why do you think mine are always so long?
(I can change)

(Mmm-hmm)
Gimme that afterglow
I’ve got to be content with what I’ve got
(Mmm-hmm)
Gimme that afterglow
I’ve got to be content with what I’ve got
(Mmm-hmm)
Gimme the afterglow
I’ve got to be content, not knowing what time it is
No theme song will greet my feet on the street
No credits sequence will rock me to sleep
So hold me in your arms cause if there’s one thing in the world
That I don’t want to end, it’s you
No theme song will greet my feet on the street
No credits sequence will rock me to sleep
So hold me in your arms cause if there’s one thing in the world
That I don’t want to end, it’s youEmbed
