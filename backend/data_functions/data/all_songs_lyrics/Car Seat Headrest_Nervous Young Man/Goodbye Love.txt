Goodbye Love Lyrics(Take one... Just kidding
Um - Take two?)
Sweet Maria, one leg out the window
Waiting to escape by light of moon
Can I spend a little longer with the other?
Does it have to run so soon?
Little Claudia, I can’t speak your language
And I don’t mean to be unkind
But when you put your hand upon your belly
I don’t want to know what’s on your mind
And you, my dear, the fairest of the blossoms
Though you only bloom at night
You’re at my side in sports and shorts in daytime
Dear Alex, let our love lie in the light
My mother used to say
You gotta find somewhere to stay
And the more you love, the more you leave behind
Well I can’t say she was wrong
And my love for you is strong
But I’m afraid I must be on, goodbye love
Goodbye love, goodbye love, goodbye love, goodbye
