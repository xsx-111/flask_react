Boxing Day LyricsThe early bird catches the worm
I have worms in mousetraps, baby
I did something bad
I’m not allowed to go outside anymore
I can only be awake at night
For the next year of my life
In the freshly dug earth
In front of the cabin
I feel so haunted
I feel so haunted
Seeing the world in petals, everything made of roses
I know cause when I close my eyes I see red spots
Seeing the world in petals, everything made of roses
I know cause when I close my eyes I see red spots
I feel so haunted
I feel so haunted
I feel so haunted
I feel so haunted
Is there some rule that guys can never talk about anything?
They just watch the girls go by
How are you tonight?
Just look straight ahead
Are you still in school?
Promise me you’ll go inside when I leave
I don’t want you hanging around
Please don’t fight, please don’t argue
I’m just looking out for you
There’s a crack in my window
All the peeping toms come and peep
Whenever I’m in the nude
They all line up down the streets
No one seems to notice
No one seems to care
It doesn’t really matter
I’ll just put on my underwear
I’m getting haunted
I’m getting haunted
I’m getting haunted
I’m getting haunted
I know I'm drunk again and I've said enough for the night
But there's a skin I'd like to steal
A house to sleep in where I won't have bad dreams
But I have so much to fear
Get some exercise, get me exorcised
But do we ever really heal?
These problems are familiar, these songs that I've been singing for
God, it feels like years
Promise me you’ll go inside when I leave
'Cause I don’t want you hanging around
Please don’t fight, and please don’t argue
I’m just looking out for you
(All together now)
Haunted
I feel so haunted
Haunted
I feel so haunted
(All together now)
Haunted
I feel so haunted
Haunted
I feel so haunted
I feel so haunted
I feel so haunted
(The early bird catches the worm...and I have...worms in fishhooks...and dogs in dog-traps...and cats in cat-traps. But baby, I still feel like I can't get outta something...
If I stacked up all the hours I wasted, I could climb straight to heaven)1Embed
