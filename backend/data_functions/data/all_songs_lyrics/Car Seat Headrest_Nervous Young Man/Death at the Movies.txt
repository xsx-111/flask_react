Death at the Movies Lyrics
It’s hard to adjust your eyes after the matinee
From the womb of the theater to the light of day
But you’ve got something to think about on the ride home
And you’ve got something to talk about if you’re not alone

Outside the walls I hear sirens
Fade to black, dramatic irony
Before my eyes, after the previews
I can relate, you do what we do
So I’m alive in the final act
The spirits did it all in an hour and a half
Bring me to pain, bring me to relief
Turn off my brain, suspend my disbelief

There’s a beautiful score I’ll never hear
When my vision blurs, it rings in my ears
I must be saved
I must be saved before the end
There’s a wonderful line I can’t remember
I can’t rewind, so I better remember
I must be saved
I must be saved before the end
The hero stands up and the blood rushes out of his head
But you can still see him breathing after he’s dead
And after the soul is gone, his body’s back to himself
And you’ll say “Oh, who is he? I've seen him in something else”

And so I pray to the movie screen
That I’ll be shown something I’ve never seen
A revelation, I can sense it
But this part don’t make any sense yet
If heaven is a film that never ends
And the characters are all my friends
Or is that what we call a tv show?
Or is that the real life that we’re living now?

There’s a beautiful score I’ll never hear
When my vision blurs, it rings in my ears
I must be saved
I must be saved before the end
There’s a wonderful line I can’t remember
I can’t rewind so I better remember
I must be saved
I must be saved before the end
Everyone left the theater
Everyone left the theater
Everyone left the theater
Everyone but me

There’s a beautiful score I’ll never hear
When my vision blurs it rings in my ears
I must be saved
I must be saved
I must be saved

Could’ve been better, had such potential
Could’ve been better, had such potential
Could’ve been better, had such potential
Could’ve been better, had such potential
Yeah, yeah
(God save our gracious Queen
Long live our noble Queen
God save the Queen
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen)Embed
