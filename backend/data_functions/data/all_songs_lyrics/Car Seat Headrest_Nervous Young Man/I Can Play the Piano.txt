I Can Play the Piano LyricsThe time has come to feel good about yourself
You have your own skin and bones to call yourself
And you will never ever be somebody else
So pay your bills
And have your children now
Now
You are endowed with your responsibilities
You’ve got to choose from all these possibilities
So when you go to bed you get down on your knees
And find a God
To give your body to
Tomorrow wakes you up
You find that it’s enough
An ample time for you
To live, to grow
To be your own
You’re an adult and you can’t starve yourself to death
You’ve got to seek help if you’re chronically depressed
But you’re the only one who can say what’s for the best
So close your ears
And do not hear me now
I can play the piano
A B C D E F G
I can play the piano
A B C D E F G
I can play the piano
A B C D E F G
I can play the piano
A B C D E F G
