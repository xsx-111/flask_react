Jerks Lyrics
Do you...
Do you want an accident to happen?
Don’t think I don’t know what you’re asking for
You think that I’m in love, punk
You’ve been a punk since the day you were born
I’ve never been good with weapons
But you want me to teach you with my bare hands
I really liked your solo album, but, punk
Don’t think I want to be in your band

Cause you’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks, oh yeah
I’m not confident
I’m not confident
I’m not confident
I’m not confident, no

I get concerned when accidents are happening
Hate is raining down like piss
Piercing my ears, yeah you’re out for blood, punk
Don’t think I want to listen to this
(Careful with the love police!)
Maybe sunglasses to cover the bruises
Maybe a hole in a bathroom stall
Maybe somebody that you’re thinking of, punk
Ain’t thinking about you at all

Cause you’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
Yeah, you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
And you’re in love with jerks
You’re in love with jerks
And you’re in love with jerks, yeah

And I’m not confident
I’m not confident
I’m not confident
I’m not confident at all, all, all, all, all

I wanna be your jerk
Cause you in love with jerks
Revival of the jerks
You waste your life on jerks
