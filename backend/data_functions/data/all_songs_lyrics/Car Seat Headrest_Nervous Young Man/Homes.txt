Homes Lyrics
A house without a piano
Just a stereo
I used to play but now I’ve
Got this stereo
You brought it with you when you moved in
So we would never be alone
Always something in the background

And I’m always almost punched
But I escape
With just a hint of a black eye
And we’re always almost over
But then we wake up
And it’s already one o’clock

And I hope I can change
I hope I can change
But oh my god
It’s so hard
And what if this
Is who I am
(It's not our fault that the cops are assholes)
Forte without piano
Never stop complaining
It’s what I love about you
You never stop complaining
Next step is buckets out
When we start raining
Let’s go out tonight
Because our home is falling apart

And you’re always almost punched
But you escape
With just a hint of a black eye
And we’re always almost over
But then we wake up
And it’s already two o’clock

And I hope I can change
People are dying, I hope I can change
But oh my god
It’s so hard
And what if this
Is who I am
(Remember when I made jokes?
The joke’s on you, motherfucker
I never made any jokes
I meant every single word)
If home is where I go to die
If home is where I go to die

And we’re always almost punched
But we escape
With just a hint of a black eye
And I’m always almost sober
By the time I have to drive you back home
And we’re always almost over
And then we are
And we’re always almost over
And then we are

And I hope I can change
I am dying, I hope I can change
But oh my god
It’s so hard
And what if this
Is who I am7Embed
