Some Strange Angel Lyrics
I don’t feel the fear anymore
Carry me through your door
When it’s too late to go home
We won’t have to be alone

We’ll keep the world on repeat
Day and night locked out on the street
Time will pass us kindly by
Losing feathers, we won’t mind

And I’m lost just thinking about it
In the clouds, some strange angel’s porch
Lost just thinking about you
In your arms, what I love you for

When all the lights are out
And you don’t know what you’re thinking about
You’ve got someone to hold your head
Hey night owl, come to bed

And I’m lost just thinking about it
In the clouds, some strange angel’s porch
Lost just thinking about you
In your soul, what I love you for
I am asking for the moon
Let the world have their sun
Let it all fall to ruin
You are my favorite one

When it’s all gone, I love you
When I'm done, I love you
When it’s all gone, I love you
When I'm done, I love you
When it’s all gone, I love you
When I'm done, I love you
When it’s all gone, I love you
When I'm gone, I love you1Embed
