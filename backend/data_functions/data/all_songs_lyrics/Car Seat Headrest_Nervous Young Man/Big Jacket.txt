Big Jacket LyricsYou can have my iPod
You can have my guitar
You can have my drum set
You can have my car
You can have my CDs
You can have my DVDs
You can have my refrigerator
You can have my secret collection of pornography
You can have my secret collection of marijuana
You can have the keys to my house
You can have my house
You can have my cat
As long as you promise to feed him every day
And let him out when he needs it
The cat's left eye is nothing to worry about
Um, the pigment - the left eye is turning from green to brown
It's nothing to worry about
It's nothing to worry about
It's nothing to worry about
It's nothing to worry about
You can have the trophies
I found in the trash can
You can have the trophies
We won in the bathtub
You can have my books
You can have my clothes, all my nice clothes
You can have my handsoap
You can have my silverware
You can have my piano
You can have my other piano
You can have my curtains
You can have my lampshades
You can have my rolls of duct tape
You can have my
Big jacket
You won't get cold when you're wearing
My big jacket
You can have my
Big jacket
You won't get cold with
My big jacketEmbed
