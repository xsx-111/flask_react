Hymn for the Dudes Lyrics
God ain't jive
For I can see his love
As it runs alive
And one by one
Through fields of rusted wire
The war has just begun

Ohhhhh
Cross over shame like the wise dove
Who cares not for fame, just for shy love

And rejoice for the king ain't lost his throne, oh no
He's still here, you are not alone

Correct your heads
For there's a new song rising
High above the waves
Go write your time
Go sing it on the streets
Go tell the world, but you go brave

Oh my
Sweet instant Christian, you are such a sly clown
Too many questions, no replies now
And rejoice for the king ain't lost his throne, oh no
He's still here, you are not alone

I got an idea
Go tell the superstar
All his hairs are turning grey
Star-spangled fear
As all the people disappear
The limelight fades away

'Cos if you think you are a star
For so long they'll come from near and far
But you'll forget just who you are (yes you will)
You ain't the Naz
You're just a buzz
Some kinda temporary


Cross over shame
Like the wise dove
Who cares not for fame
Just for shy love
Ohhhhh
My sweet instant Christian, you are such a sly clown
Too many questions, no replies now

And rejoice for the king ain't lost his throne. oh no
He's still here, and you are not alone
You are not aloneEmbed
