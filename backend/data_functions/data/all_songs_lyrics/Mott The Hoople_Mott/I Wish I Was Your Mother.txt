I Wish I Was Your Mother Lyrics
I scream at you for sharing
And I curse you just for caring
I hate the clothes you're wearing, they're so pretty
And I tell you not to see me
And I tell you not to feel me
And I make your life a drag, it's such a pity

And I watch your warm glow palin'
And I watch your sparkle fadin'
As you realise you're failin', 'cos you're so good
Now I don't mean to upset you
But there's so much crime to get through
If only I could make it easier, then I would

Oh, I wish I was your mother
I wish I'd been your father
And then I would have seen you
Would have been you as a child
And played houses with your sisters
And wrestled all your brothers
And then who knows I might have
Felt a family for a while
It's no use me pretendin'
You give and I do the spendin'
Is there a happy ending, I don't think so
'Cos even if we make it
I'll be too far out to take it
You'll have to try and shake it from my head
Oooooh

I wish I was your mother
I wish I'd been your father
And then I would have seen you
Would have been you as a child
Played houses with your sisters
And wrestled all your brothers
And then who knows I might have
Felt a family for a whileEmbed
