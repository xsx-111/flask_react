All The Way From Memphis Lyrics
Forgot my six-string razor
Hit the sky
Half way to Memphis 'fore I realised
Well I rang the information
My axe was cold
They said she rides the train to Oriole

Now it's a mighty long way down the dusty trail
And the sun burns hot on the cold steel rails
And I look like a bum and I crawl like a snail
(All the way from Memphis)

Well I got to Oriole y'know
It took a month
And there was my guitar, electric junk
Some spade said "Rock'n'rollers
You're all the same
Man, that's your instrument."
I felt so ashamed

Now it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
Through the Bradford cities and the Orioles
And you look like a star but you're still on the dole
(All the way from Memphis)

Yeah it's a mighty long way down rock 'n' roll
From the Liverpool docks to the Hollywood Bowl
And you climb up the mountains and you fall down the holes
(All the way from Memphis)

Yeah it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
As your name gets hot so your heart grows cold
And you gotta stay young man, you can never be old
(All the way from Memphis)

Yeah it's a mighty long way down rock'n'roll
Through the Bradford cities and the Orioles
And you look like a star but you're really out on parole!
(All the way from Memphis)
