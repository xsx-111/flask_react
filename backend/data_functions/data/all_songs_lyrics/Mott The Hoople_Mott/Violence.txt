Violence LyricsI'm a missing link, poolroom stink, I can't talk
(Well that's too bad)
What's going on, something's wrong, I can't work
Can't go to school, the teacher's a fool, the preacher's a jerk
(Well that's such a drag)
Got nothing to do, street-corner blues, and nowhere to walk
Violence, violence
It's the only thing that'll make you see sense
(Repeat)
Gotta fight, nothing's right, livin' nowhere
(That's so sad)
Watch out for the gun, snake on the run, hide in my hair
You keep your mouth shut, or you'll get cut. Haha - I like to scare
(Bet you're so mad)
I'm a battery louse, a superstar mouse, I don't care
Get off my back or I'll attack, 'n I don't owe you nothin' (OK)
Head for your hole, you're sick and you're old
'N I'm here to tell you something
Violence, violence
It's the only thing that'll make you see sense
(Repeat several times )Embed
