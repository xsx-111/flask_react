Skin LyricsI need your eyes
I need your smile
I want your mind
I want your life
I need your skin, skin, skin, skin
I need your voice
I ain't got no choice
I want your mind
I want your life
I need your skin, skin, skin, skin
I need your time
I cannot lie
You're on my mind
All day and night
I need your touch
I ain't asking much
Give me your mind
Give me your life
I need your skin, skin, skin, skin
I need your skin, skin, skin, skin
I need your skin
I need your skinEmbed
