When I Go LyricsWhen I go, where will I go, on my own, when I go
When I go, where will I go, on my own, when I go
And will you be waiting. Waiting for me
How will I find you, what will I say
When I go, where will I go, on my own, when I go
When I go, where will I go, on my own, when I go
And will you be waiting. Waiting for me
How will I find you, what will I say
What will I say
What will I say
What will I say
And will you be waiting. Waiting for me
How will I find you, what will I say
What will I say
What will I say
What will I sayEmbed
