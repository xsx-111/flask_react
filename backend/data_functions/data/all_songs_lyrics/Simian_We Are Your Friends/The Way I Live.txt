The Way I Live LyricsYou just don't like the way that I live
You just don't like the way that I live
The way that I live
The way that I live
The way that I live
The way that I live
Well I just don't like the way that you think
Well I just don't like the way that you think
Well I just don't like the way that you think
Well I just don't like the way that you think
You just don't like the things that I say
You just don't like the things that I say
The things that I say
The things that I say
The things that I say
The things that I say
Well I just don't like the things that you do
Well I just don't like the things that you do
Well I just don't like the things that you do
Well I just don't like the things that you doEmbed
