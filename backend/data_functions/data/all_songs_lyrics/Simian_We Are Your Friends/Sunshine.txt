Sunshine LyricsLook up in the sunshine
Look up in the sunshine
His hat is on, the burning eye
Up above, the heavens high
Hot as hell, fire is all
Give us life, give us life
Look up in the sunshine
Look up in the sunshine
Expanding warmth, we offer you
All we own. All we own
Falcon head, shed your tears
Bear us all, bear us all
Look up in the sunshine
Look up in the sunshine
Look up in the sunshine
Just look up in the sunshine
His hat is on, the burning eye
Up above, the heavens high
Hot as hell, fire is all
Give us life, give us life
Look up in the sunshine
Look up in the sunshineEmbed
