End Of The Day LyricsMaybe you'll destroy all that I've made
But at the end of the day it's the words
You say to me, to me
Maybe you will fly me to the stars
But when we fall back down what
Will you ask of me, of me
When you find it
Close your eyes
And don't you let go til its there
Then come alive
And walk around in a new place
To call your own
Maybe you will end my mortal;
Days but when we meet again
Will you recognise my face, my face
Maybe you will wipe my memory clean
But will you be the one who shows me
How to see, to see
When you find it
Close your eyes
And don't you let go til its there
Then come alive
And walk around in a new place
To call your own
When you find it
Close your eyes
And don't you let go til its there
Then come alive
And walk around in a new place
To call your ownEmbed
