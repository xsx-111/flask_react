The Swarm LyricsThe swarm is restless, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
The swarm is restless, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
We can hear buzzing, we can hear wings
We can hear running, while we sing
We can see people on their knees
We can hear praying for new born kings
The swarm is restless, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
We can hear buzzing, we can hear wings
We can hear running, while we sing
We can see people on their knees
We can hear praying for new born kings
We can see people on their knees
We can hear praying for new born kings
The swarm is restlessEmbed
