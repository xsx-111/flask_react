In Between LyricsSo we'll run away, away from what we've done
And I'll see you, when black skies turn to blue
And when we'll fall, our eyes, our eyes will see it all
A glimpse of make believe
Onwards we walk to who knows where
Don't stop or get weighed down by care
In circles we move from here to there
Just keep on going
I just don't want to know
How I came to arrive here
We should try to resolve we should try to belong here
Learn the land, like skin, it binds and keeps you in
Your mind is full, is full of what you do
And when we'll fall our eyes will see it all
A glimpse of in between
Onwards we walk to who knows where
Don't stop or get weighed down by care
In circles we move from here to there
Just keep on going
I just don't want to know
How I came to arrive here
We should try to resolve we should try to belong here
I just don't want to know
How I came to arrive here
We should try to resolve we should try to belong hereEmbed
