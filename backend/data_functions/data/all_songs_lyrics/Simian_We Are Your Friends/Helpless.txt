Helpless LyricsSomeone was looking at me
When I was looking at you
Well ain't it always that way
Please tell me how can I choose
Its gotta be you or me or me
And you and they're in the middle
Tell me what to do
Oooh oooh, oooh oooh
On every move that I make
There lies a golden mistake
Behind your make believe eyes
There lies a million sighs
Its gotta be you or me or me
And you and they're in the middle
Tell me what to do, oooh oooh, oooh oooh
Chorus
I can only help myself
But when I think of you I'm helpless, so helpless
I can only help myself
But when I think of you I'm helpless, so helpless
I'll tell myself that its true
But oh well what can I do
Cause when I'm laying at night
I see her eyes come alive
Its gotta be you or me or me
And you and they're in the middle
Tell me what to do, oooh oooh, oooh oooh
But baby it'll be o.k, I am here
I am here to stay
Just kill my troublesome mind
And clear my cloudy eye
Its gotta be you or me or me
And you and they're in the middle
Tell me what to do, oooh oooh, oooh oooh
Chorus
I can only help myself
But when I think of you I'm helpless, so helpless
I can only help myself
But when I think of you I'm helpless, so helpless
I can only help myself
But when I think of you I'm helpless, so helpless
I can only help myself
But when I think of you I'm helpless, so helpless
I'm helpless, so helpless
I'm helpless, so helplessEmbed
