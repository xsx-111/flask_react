Adventures In Your Own Backyard Lyrics
Twelve steps into your backyard
Through tall green grass, and into the world
Ain't it feel right
Ain't it feel nice
In your own backyard

A dirty winding road, around your feet
That carries me along
And into the beat
Didn't need to go so far
To find what you were thirsty for
Didn't need to go so far
To find what you were looking for
Cause it was always beside
Just right behind
Right up ahead
You just didn't know
What was in your own backyard

Twelve steps into your own backyard
Twelve steps into your own backyard
Twelve steps into your own backyard
Twelve steps into your own backyardEmbed
