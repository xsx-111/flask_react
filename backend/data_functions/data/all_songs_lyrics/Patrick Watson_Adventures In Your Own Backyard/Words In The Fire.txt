Words In The Fire LyricsPut your words into the fire
Watch them burn your heart's desires
Rise up in the air
In a cloud of silk and smoke and dust
Fade into the night
It's a confident feeling with you at my side
Let me shake your honest hands
And I'll sit down beside you now
Lean our heavy heads
Of the weight of the things that are left unsaid
Don't worry about it now
Cause in the morning they will all just be ashes on the ground
So what's been on your mind
Eating you inside
Taking all of your time
On this warm summer night
Put your words down in the fire
When we were down at sandy beach
Old man talking in young man's words
Tell me where you would like to be
Tonight don't be afraid to dream
Lean on the fire for a while
Cause in the morning it will all just be ashes on the ground
So what's been on your mind
Eating you inside
Taking all of your time
On this warm summer night
Put those words down in the fire1Embed
