Step Out For A While LyricsIt's right about time
You better pick your poisons right
Take a little walk with me
Take a little break from thinking all the time
‘Cause I need a fever darling
To make it on top
Break a little smile
To give me back the shine
Sometimes we all need to unwind
‘Cause I need a fever darling
To fill those holes
Just close your eyes
‘Cause everybody needs to step out for a while
Well it's late in the night
You're swimming out to disco dancing all the time
Give me just one more chance to raise your hand
Step out for a while
Sometimes we all need to get out from here
To fill those holes
Just close your eyes
‘Cause everybody needs step out for a whileEmbed
