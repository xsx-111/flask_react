The Things You Do LyricsOut of the rabbit hole
Looking through the whiskeys windows
And under the grass
Waiting quite faces wandering around
Who are looking for the words
Hiding in the back of the
Wait till the morning stars
Weep it
Tell me what do you see
Everybody's taking pictures
Everybody except me
Smiling at the edge of the world
Is there anybody there?
Who will pull us back together again
All the things that you do
...when we get older
I've been looking at you
...coffee for two
Is there anybody there?
Is there anybody there?
Who will pull us back together again
Tell me what do you seeEmbed
