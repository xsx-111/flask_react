The Things We Do LyricsSometimes we're bad
Past all of our sorries
Sometimes we're wrong
More than we let on
Sometimes we try
So hard we start to lose track
Sometimes we need
A little snap to bring us all back
We hide
We hide
All the things we will never have
So why do we try
Woo!
I'll keep on loving you
Giving this whole heart
But I can not ever leave
Living this whole heart
Woo...
Sometimes we go
Just a little too far from home
Sometimes we give
Shadows we can't hold on
Sometimes we fly
The way that always goes bad
When we get by
Then all we leaving behind
We'll hide
We'll hide
All the things that we'll never have
So why do we try
Woo!
I'll never, never never never wanna live in this world anymoreEmbed
