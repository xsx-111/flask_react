Blackwind LyricsDon't try too hard to catch the winds
Where they are going and where they have been
Don't try to outrun what the winds are showin'
Just gotta give in to where they are blowin'
Cause who are we?
Who are we without the ones we love?
All alone
Sometimes it blows you down
And weathers your face and leaves us no trace
And you find yourself far from home
Well it's better to move than it stands to when you don't know
While the rooftops will open the air
For the answer to our lives is blowin'
Around and flying out of control
A lot of things blowin' us up above the ground
Everybody hold on to the ones that you love
Blackwind's blowing in sight of everyday
Don't waste your time with lonely yesterdays
Everybody smile while the wind blows us around
Can't control the weather just gotta be what you need
Higher in the air everybody give in to the storm
Don't try to hide
From where they are going and where they have been
Just got to give in to where they are blowingEmbed
