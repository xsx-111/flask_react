All Our Yesterdays Lyrics(And now for your delight
The darling of Wapping Wharf laundrette
Ronald Leafy a-Lane!)
I just ain't sure, what she said you know
I just ain't sure, I know I've been a fool
I know I've got to wake, own up, I've been hung up
All the time I knew
I knew her love it just weren't true
I know I've been a fool
She took me for a green up, shake up
Knew we'd break up
Fell from out the sky, thought she was mine
Freckles on her nose, cute Miss Sunshine
It had to be this way
Sun clouded and the sky was grey
And when she went away
I knew she wouldn't come back
Look back, she'd get sidetracked
Fell from out the sky, thought she was mine
Freckles on her nose, cute Miss SunshineEmbed
