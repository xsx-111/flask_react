Things Are Going to Get Better LyricsThings are going to get better
Times change, better later than never
Being true to myself
Makes me see all the more
Things are going to get better
Times fly, so don't you upset her
And I know how I feel
And it's time for a change
Things are going to get better
I said I knew it, I want to tell everybody
The moment that I met her
And it seems that my mind
Has survived on its own
Things are going to get betterEmbed
