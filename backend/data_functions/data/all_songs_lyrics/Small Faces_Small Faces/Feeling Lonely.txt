Feeling Lonely LyricsI know that I can be lonely
So stay with me, don't play with me
Don't blow out everything
You've got to know how I feel
It's my Achilles heel, feeling lonely
Things never change, but they weaken
And I can't be, green memory
I've got to feel your smile
I feel that I am part of a wheel
It's my Achilles heel, feeling lonelyEmbed
