Something I Want to Tell You LyricsI've got something I want to tell you
I've got something I want to say
All the things that you say and do girl
Don't you know that they're not my way
I don't like what you're running after
It's not me that you're thinking of
You forget what we've found together
You forget what we've found is love
The light in your eyes has faded
And your voice has another tone
I have cried all my tears already
Once again I am all alone
I got something I want to tell you
I got something I want to sayEmbed
