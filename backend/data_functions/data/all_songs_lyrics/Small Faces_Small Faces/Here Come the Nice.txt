Here Come the Nice LyricsHere come the nice lookin' so good
He makes me feel like no one else could
He knows what I want, he's got what I need
He's always there if I need some sweet
Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (He'll make you feel so good)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
You know you should
You know you should meet the man
The man gonna help you all he can
You don't need money to be wise
Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (He makes me feel so good)
I'd be just like him (If only could)
You know you should
Here come the nice lookin' so cool
Everyone knows the nice is no fool
He'll bring you up and show you around
He's always there when your feet hit the ground
Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (God he makes me feel good)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
You know you should
You know you got to try to meet the man
This man's gonna teach you all he can
Ha! You don't need money (Money)
Money to open your eyes
Here come the nice (It's understood)
Here come the nice (God, he makes me feel good)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
Here come the nice (Oh baby, baby, baby)
Here come the nice (Here come the nice)
I'd be just like him (If I only could)
You know you shouldEmbed
