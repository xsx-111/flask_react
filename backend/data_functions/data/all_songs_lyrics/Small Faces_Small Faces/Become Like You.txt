Become Like You LyricsIf I could find a way, would I become like you, yeah?
If I could throw myself away, would I become like you?
Would I know just where I stood?
Would my heart be made out of wood?
If I could be a brick, would I become like you, yeah?
If I could give my best friend a kick, would I become like you?
Would I know just where I was at?
Would my brains be where I sat?
Would I become like you?
(hello, they're playing it again!)Embed
