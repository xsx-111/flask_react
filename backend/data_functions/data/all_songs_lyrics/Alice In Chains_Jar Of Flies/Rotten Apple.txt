Rotten Apple Lyrics
Hey-ah-na-na, innocence is over
Hey-ah-na-na, over
Hey-ah-na-na, ignorance is spoken
Hey-ah-na-na, spoken
Hey-ah-na-na, confidence is broken
Hey-ah-na-na, broken
Hey-ah-na-na, sustenance is stolen
Hey-ah-na-na, stolen
Hey-ah-na-na, arrogance is potent
Hey-ah-na-na, potent

Yeah
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawlin' back to start

Hey-ah-na-na, I repent tomorrow
Hey-ah-na-na, tomorrow
Hey-ah-na-na, I suspend my sorrow
Hey-ah-na-na, sorrow

Yeah
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawlin' back to start
Hey-ah-na-na, a romance is fallen
Hey-ah-na-na, fallen
Hey-ah-na-na, recommend you borrow
Hey-ah-na-na, borrow

Yeah
What I see is unreal
I've written my own part
Eat of the apple, so young
I'm crawlin' back to start

Hey-ah-na-na
Hey-ah-na-na
Hey-ah-na-na
