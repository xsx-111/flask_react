Swing on This Lyrics
Mother said come home
Father said come home
Sisters said come home
So my friends said come home
I said

Let me be, I'm alright
Can't you see, I'm just fine
Little skinny, okay
I'm asleep anyway

Then I heard a voice
Said "Son, you have a choice"
I then slapped my face

Let me be, I'm okay
I'm awake anyway
It's too bright over here
I can shift, cannot steer
So I drive them away
For a while, then I stay
Little skinny, okay
I'm awake anyway
Now I have to go home
Do as when in Rome

Let me be, I'm alright
Can't you see I'm just fine
Little skinny, okay
I'm asleep anyway
Let me be, I'm okay
I'm awake anyway

Toby's still laughing
It sounds fucking pretty good
I'm laughing, it's like
That's tight as shit, what are you talking about?5Embed
