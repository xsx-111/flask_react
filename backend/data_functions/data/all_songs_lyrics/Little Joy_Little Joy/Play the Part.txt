Play the Part LyricsSpending time
Convinced that it's mine
With her
Just to keep her out of mind
Still I'll take care to see
Which way the wind blows
Notice how her hair curls
Pay no mind to the clown
Who sits to your side
Content to yield despite pride
He's a fool to assume
You'd spare a thought
I'm a thief who's just been caught
I don't find it funny anymore
And so I won't play the part
I played before, no more
Not to you
I don't see you laughing anyway
And so I won't play a part
In your mistake, no way
Not unless you stayEmbed
