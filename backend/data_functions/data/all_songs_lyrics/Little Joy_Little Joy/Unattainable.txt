Unattainable Lyrics
Only when the goal is unattainable
Do I start to feel like I'm losing myself
And this deep secret that hasn't come out yet
Is buried down deep with the rest

I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy, lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead

If only songs were sung to guide the doubtful ones
Beyond the rough where not as much is good enough
Oh, if you find yourself amongst the lonely ones
I will be waiting here with open arms

I can't coerce you into this one
Jealousy, lay all your spells to bed
I'll choose unloved instead2Embed
