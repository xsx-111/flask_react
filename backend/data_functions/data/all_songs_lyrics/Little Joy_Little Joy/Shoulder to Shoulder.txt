Shoulder to Shoulder Lyrics
Shoulder to shoulder
Amused, but not advanced
He, she, you, me
It's all just circumstance
Eager, hopeful
Content to play the friend
Timid advances
With mutual regret

She can't always be wrong
He can't always be right
Not a matter of choice
Just a matter of time
Till they know where they stand
Once they reach the end

Awkward choices
With smiles from ear to ear
A fated union
That won't survive the year
Timeless series
Of blameless accidents
Oh the stubborn cycle
Of inherited mistakes
She can't always be wrong
He can't always be right
Not a matter of choice
Just a matter of time
Till they know where they stand
Once they reach the end

I'll pay mind where I place my trust
When the desert ends
I'll ask the dust
I'll pay mind where I place my trust
When the desert ends
I'll ask the dust2Embed
