Brand New Start Lyrics
Take advantage of the season
To take off your overcoat
The spirits will lift of those young men you provoke
But I'll be laughing knowing I will take you home

There ain't no lover like the one I've got
Ain't no lover like the one I've got
She and I and a brand new start
Gotta give all my love

All this time they had me thinking
Love's a boat that's long been sinking
But you made the claim
That taking a chance is embracing the change
I count my blessings knowing you will take me home

There ain't no lover like the one I've got
Ain't no lover like the one I've got
She and I and a brand new start
Gotta give all my love

I got time to hold my own
What's a day when the years are on their way?
I gotta say
There ain't no lover like the one I've got
Ain't no lover like the one I've got
She and I and a brand new start
Ain't no lover like the one I've got
Love won't bring me down, oh no1Embed
