The Next Time Around Lyrics
One too many goals
The measure of your worth
Can sink your weight in gold
Sat by the ivory sill
The further out you look
The further out you'll be

It's not enough to set the terms
If nothing ventured, nothing earned
Though odds are set against
In time, I'll belong to you, it's how it's meant to be

Settled on your own
Sweeping dust from stone
With a letter home
Back where the hour's long
The simplest things invite a thrill
If just by noticing at will

It's not enough to set the terms
If nothing ventured, nothing learned
It's how it's always been
E onde a sorte há de te levar, saiba o caminho é o fim mais que chegar
E queira o dia ser, gentil a tua mão, aberta pra quem é

In time, I'll belong to you
That's how it's meant to be, and how it's always been1Embed
