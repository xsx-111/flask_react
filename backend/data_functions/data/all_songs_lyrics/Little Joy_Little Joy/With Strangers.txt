With Strangers Lyrics
I bet you're wondering how I knew
That this would come to an end
He stole your heart from you
So you tossed me out to the wind

I keep pretending not to care
But the winter scent in her hair
Compels my hands to do
The things my heart wouldn't dare

I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
If only you, if only now

And in the twilight of this hour
When fools are mistaken for men
This shadow suits me well
My regrets, I'll face in the end

I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting lives with strangers
If only you, if only now
I'll keep holding on to you
See no use perfecting love with strangers
If only you, if only now5Embed
