Keep Me In Mind Lyrics
Read from start to end
And again
Oh, the fearlessness of thoughts in print
Strips the chord of a sensible word
And what's worse?
She left her mark
Indelible
Oh, the nature of her scripted verse
Keeps my eyes
Set on the page
And it says

"Frankly dear, I'm forced to give it up
Tried my hand and now I've had enough
Even though we have to say goodbye
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind"

Blamed in advance
For the past
With no bearing on the present tense
All that's left
Are claims that she made
When she said
"Oh dear someday
You'll learn to be
Someone better fit to pursue me
But 'til then
We'll call it the end"
And she adds
"Frankly dear, the drifters had it right
Stayed the afternoon and left at night
Even though we have to say goodbye
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind
Keep me in mind"4Embed
