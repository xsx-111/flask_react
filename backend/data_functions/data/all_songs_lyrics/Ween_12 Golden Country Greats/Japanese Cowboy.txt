Japanese Cowboy Lyrics
Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I called out your name, girl, in the heat of the night
And nobody answers, cause somethin' ain't right

Breakfast at Shoney's, at $2.99
Saved me some money and eased up my mind
I'm walkin' in circles and feelin' the pain
I'm tossin' and turnin', and cryin' in vain

Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I called out your name, girl, in the heat of the night
And nobody answers, cause somethin' ain't right
(Here we go)

I'm ridin' at midnight and crossin' the line
From the rain in my windshield and the tears in my eyes
Now the bedroom is empty and I spent my last dime
And the lovers are leavin', I got nothin' but time
I got you on my mind
Like a Japanese cowboy or a brother on skates
Like a blizzard in Georgia or a train runnin' late
I called out your name, girl, in the heat of the night
And nobody answers, cause somethin' ain't rightEmbed
