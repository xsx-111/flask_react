Fluffy LyricsFluffy, furry buddy, chewed his leg on the porch
Why¹d you do it Fluffy - on the porch
Good dog Fluffy, old friend, my pal
Fluffy¹s got his buddy, on the porch
Penny - she¹s my girlie, she sits here with me, on the porch
Penny looks so pretty, on the porch
Penny takes Fluffy -- for a walk -- out on the path
Fluffy chases the other doggies -- on the path
The pig says to Penny get Fluffy back on the porch
So me and Fluffy and Penny are on the PorchEmbed
