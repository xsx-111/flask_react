Powder Blue LyricsPowder blue, powder blue
What can ya do, she's powder blue
Powder blue, powder blue
What can ya do, she's powder blue
I'll be true (ba baa)
My powder blue (powder blue)
It's all for you (ba baa)
It's all for you
And ya know it
Powder blue, powder blue
The seventh sun of Orion with me too
Oh powder blue, how do you do?
Come walk with me now, powder blue
Powder blue (ba baa)
Powder blue (powder blue)
It's all for you (ba baa)
It's all for you
And you can feel that
Powder blue, oh powder blue
I've got this feeling, powder blue
Oh powder blue, powder blue
It's in my head for you
I'll be true (ba baa)
My powder blue (powder blue)
It's all for you (ba baa)
It's all for you

And ladies & gentlemen, I'd like to present: Muhammad Ali:
Muhammad Ali:
"Everybody stop talking now, I tell ya....I told you, all of my critics, I told you all that I was the greatest of all time...
Now just listen...I told you today, I'm still the greatest of all time...never again defeat me...never again say that I'm going to be defeated...never again bet and make me an underdog, until I'm about 50 years old. Then you might get me. But I didn't dance, I didn't dance for a reason. I wanted to make him lose all his power, I kept tellin' he had no punch, he couldn't hit, he swang like a sissy, he's missin', let me see you box, I hadn't start dancin' yet! You can't say my legs are gone, you can't say I was tired, because what happened? I didn't dance from the second round on. I stayed on the ropes. When I stay on the ropes, you think I'm doin' bad. But I want all boxers to put this in the page of boxing: staying on ropes is a beautiful thing with a heavyweight when you make him shoot his best shot, and you know he's not hittin' ya. I would've gave George Foreman two rounds of steady punchin', because after that he was mine."Embed
