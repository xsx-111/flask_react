Mister Richard Smoker Lyrics
Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bow

Mister Richard Smoker, you're a poopy poker
Chardonnay and cocaine in the spa
Cigarettes and coffee breath, little boys on crystal meth
Tonight we'll tango in the street
You eat dark meat
Mister Richard Smoker, you're a chicken choker
Tonight you're gonna let it all hang out
Pantyhose and aquanet, smokin' menthol cigarettes
Tonight we'll tango in the street
You eat dark meat

Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bow

You eat dark meat

Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bow
Mister Richard Smoker, you're an Ono Yoker
Cognac and black coffee with the boys
Dancin' in your buster browns, whirlin' to that techno sound
You hands are wet, your hair is slick
You smoke big dick
Mister Richard Smoker, you're a velvet coker
Bruce and Jeff will pick you up at ten
Going out, dancin' in the city, Friday night, gotta look pretty
Tonight we'll tango in the street
You eat dark meat

Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bow
Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bow
Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bow
Doodley baboo, doodley baboo
Doodley baboo bowEmbed
