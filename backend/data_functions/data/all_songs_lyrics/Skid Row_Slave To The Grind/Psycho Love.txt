Psycho Love LyricsCheck out Clementine
Cleanin' needles in her wine
Face down in her one-eyed world
With her brain-dead valentine
She'll be your zombie, your livin' dead
Her sweet corruption
It's gonna make you, it's gonna break you
Ohh yeah, she said...
Haunt my house of pain
And feel my psycho love
We'll shine and pray for rain
To heal my psycho love
Legs at ten and two
Chain her down that's what you do
King Tut and snake-eyed slut
In the pink but screamin' blue
I'll taste your crazy, you smell insane
I'm just another ghost
Inside your spirits hall of fame
Haunt my house of pain
And feel my psycho love
You better shine and pray for rain
To heal my psycho love
As the warm smooth soul
Chases through the cold silence of a body
A body of touch not feel
One question is she a stone in the devil's garden
Or a speck in an angel dust
Ashes to ashes
And lust to lust
She'll teach you true love
Watchin' you turn blue love
She'll wrap you in a chokehold
And suck your symptom dry
Haunt my house of pain
And feel my psycho love
Shine and pray for rain
To heal my psycho, psycho, psycho loveEmbed
