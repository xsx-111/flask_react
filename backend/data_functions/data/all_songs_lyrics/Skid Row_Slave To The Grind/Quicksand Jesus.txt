Quicksand Jesus LyricsShe caught the melting sky
It burned but still the winter passes by and by
To the other side
A slow parade of wind that blows through trees that wilted
With the season's children
Are we saved by the words of bastard saints?
Do we live in fear or faith?
Tell me now, who's behind the rain?
A maze of tangled grace
The symptoms of "for real" are crumbling from embrace
But still we chase...
The shadows of belief
A new religion clouds our visions of the roots of our souls
Are we ashamed of our own fate?
Or play the fool for our own sake?
Tell me who's behind the rain?
What do we need?
Where do we go when we get where we don't know?
Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
When faith's our shelter from the cold?
What do we need?
Where do we go when we get where we don't know?
Why should we doubt the virgin white of fallen snow
When faith's our shelter from the cold?
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away without you
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away... away
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far away
Quicksand Jesus I need you
Quicksand Jesus I believe you
Quicksand Jesus I'm so far awayEmbed
