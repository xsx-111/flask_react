Wasted Time Lyrics
You and I together in our lives
Sacred ties would never fray
Then why can I let myself tell lies
And watch you die every day?
I think back to the times
When dreams were what mattered
Tough-talking youth naivete

You said you'd never let me down
But the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time?
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what you left behind?
Is it all just wasted time?
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what you've left behind?

Paranoid delusions, they haunt you
Where's my friend I used to know?
He's all alone, he's buried deep within a
Carcass searching for a soul
Can you feel me inside your heart as it's bleeding?
Why can't you believe you can be loved?
I hear your scream in agony
And the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time?
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what you left behind?
Is it all just wasted time?
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what you've left behind


Oh, you said you'd never let me down
But the horse stampedes and rages
In the name of desperation

Is it all just wasted time?
Can you look at yourself
When you think of what you left behind?
Is it all just wasted time?
Can you live with yourself
When you think of what you've left behind?
The sun will rise again
The earth will turn to sand
Creation's colors seem to fade to grey
And you'll see the sickly hands of time
Will write your final rhyme
And end your memory, yeah
I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy
I never thought, I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy, oh no
I never thought, I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy, no
I never thought you'd let it get this far, boy1Embed
