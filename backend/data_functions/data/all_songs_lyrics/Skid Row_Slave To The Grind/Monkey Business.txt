Monkey Business LyricsWell, outside my window there's a whole lotta trouble comin'
The cartoon killers and the rag cover clones
Stack heels kickin' rhythm of social circumcision
Can't close the closet on a shoe box full of bones
Kangaroo lady with her bourbon in a pouch
Can't afford the rental on a bamboo couch
Collecting back her favors cause her well is running dry
I know her act is terminal, but she ain't gonna die, no
Slim Intoxicado drinkin' dime store hooch
Is always in a circle with his part-time pooch
Little creepy's playing dollies in the New York rain
Thinkin' Bowie's just a knife
Whoa, the pain!
I ain't seen the sun since I don't know when
The freaks come out at nine
And it's twenty to ten
What's this funk
That you call junk?
To me it's just monkey business
Get back!
Blind man in a box and he'll probably die
The village kids laugh as they walk by
A psycho on the edge of this human garbage dump
And the vultures in the sewers are telling
Him to jump
Into the fire, from the frying pan
Tripping on his tongue
For a cool place to stand
Where's this shade
That you've got it made?
To me it's just monkey business
(Monkey business) Slippin' on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back
(Monkey business) Slippin' on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back
The vaseline gypsies and silicone souls
Dressed to the society
Hypocrite heartbeat and cheap alibis
Can't get you by that monkey
(Monkey business) Slippin' on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back
(Monkey business) Slippin' on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back
(Monkey business) You can't tell me, I got no business
(Ain't your business) No monkey on my back
Yeah, yay, cool
Monkey business, ness, business
Don't give me no business, noEmbed
