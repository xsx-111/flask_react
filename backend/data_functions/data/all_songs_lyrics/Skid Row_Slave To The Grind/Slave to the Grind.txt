Slave to the Grind LyricsYou got me forced to break my lids in two
I'm still stuck inside the rubber room
I gotta punch the clock that leads the blind
I'm just another gear in the assembly line, whoa no
The noose gets tighter
Around my throat
But I ain't at the end of my rope
'Cause I won't be the one left behind
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind - get it?
A routine injection, a lethal dose
But my day in the sun ain't even close
There's no need to waste your prayers on me
You better mark my words 'cause I'm history, yes indeed
You might beg for mercy
To get by
But I'd rather tear this thorn from my side
'Cause I won't be the one left behind
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind
They swallowed their daggers by turning their trick
They tore my intentions apart brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive
You talk verbal insecticide
They swallowed their daggers by turning their trick
They tore my intentions apart brick by brick
I'm sick of the jive
You talk verbal insecticide, aaaaah!
Well, I won't be the one left behind
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind
Tear down the rat racial slime
Can't be king of the world if you're slave to the grind
I said slave to the grind
Slave to the grind
Slave to the grind!!!1Embed
