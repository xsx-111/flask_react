Rainy Day Lyrics
Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
Night was the bride of a lonely day
Time just floated
Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen

Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart, well it broke again
Time so vicious
Singing, the deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You end up with less than when you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in
Oh
Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house2Embed
