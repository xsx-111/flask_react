Life in Technicolor ii Lyrics
There's a wild wind blowing down the corner of my street
Every night there, the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming on the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming, I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes on, time only can lead you on
Still it's such a beautiful night

Love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming like a serenade of sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Gravity, release me and don't ever hold me down
Now my feet won't touch the ground12Embed
