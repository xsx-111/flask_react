Brand New Colony Lyrics
I'll be the grapes fermented, bottled and served
With the table set, in my finest suit
Like a perfect gentlemen
I'll be the fire escape that's bolted to the ancient brick
Where you will sit and contemplate your day

I'll be the water-wings that save you
If you start drowning in an open tab
When your judgement's on the brink
I'll be the phonograph that plays your favorite albums back
As you're lying there, drifting off to sleep (Drifting off to sleep)
I'll be the platform shoes, undo what heredity's done to you
You won't have to strain to look into my eyes (My eyes)
I'll be your winter coat, buttoned and zipped straight to the throat
With the collar up so you won't catch a cold

I want to take you far from the cynics in this town
And kiss you on the mouth
We'll cut our bodies free from the tethers of this scene
Start a brand new colony
Where everything will change
We'll give ourselves new names, identities erased
The sun will heat the grounds
Under our bare feet in this brand new colony
(This brand new colony)
Everything will change
Ooh, ooh
Everything will change
Ooh, ooh
Everything will change
Ooh, ooh5Embed
