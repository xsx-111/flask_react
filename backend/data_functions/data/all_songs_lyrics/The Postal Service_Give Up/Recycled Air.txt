Recycled Air Lyrics
I take a breath
And pull the air in till there's nothing left
I'm feeling green
Like teenage lovers between the sheets

Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba

Knuckles clenched to white
As the landing gear retract for flight
My head's a balloon
Inflating with the altitude

Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba ba
Ba ba ba
I watch the patchwork farms'
Slow fade into the ocean's arms
And from here they can't see me stare
The stale taste of recycled air
I watch the patchwork farms' (I watch)
Slow fade into the ocean's arms (Slow fade)
Calm down, release your cares (Calm down)
The stale taste of recycled air (Stale taste)2Embed
