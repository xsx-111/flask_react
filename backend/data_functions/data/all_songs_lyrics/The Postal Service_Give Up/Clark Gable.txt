Clark Gable Lyrics
I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London underground
When it struck me (When it struck me)
That I've been waiting since birth to find a love
That would look and sound like a movie
So I changed my plans; I rented a camera and a van
And then I called you (And then I called you)
"I need you to pretend that we are in love again"
And you agreed to

I want so badly to believe
That "there is truth, that love is real"
And I want life in every word
To the extent that it's absurd

I greased the lens and framed the shot
Using a friend as my stand-in (As my stand-in)
The script, it called for rain, but it was clear that day
So we faked it
The marker snapped and I yelled "quiet on the set"
And then called "action!" (And then called "action!")
And I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired
I thought it classic
I want so badly to believe
That "there is truth, that love is real"
And I want life in every word
To the extent that it's absurd
I know you're wise beyond your years
But do you ever get the fear
That your perfect verse is just a lie
You tell yourself to help you get by?

That you tell yourself to help you get by?
That you tell yourself to help you get by?8Embed
