Nothing Better Lyrics
Will someone please call a surgeon
Who can crack my ribs and repair this broken heart
That you're deserting for better company?
I can't accept that it's over
Then I will block the door
Like a goalie tending the net in the third quarter
Of a tied-game rivalry

So, just say how to make it right
And I swear I'll do my best to comply

Tell me, am I right to think
That there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride
And slowly growing old together?
I feel I must interject here
You're getting carried away feeling sorry for yourself
With these revisions and gaps in history
So let me help you remember
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear
I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave
So, please back away and let me go
I can't, my darling, I love you so
Oh, oh

Tell me am I right to think
That there could be nothing better
Than making you my bride
And slowly growing old together?
(Tell me, am I right?)
Don't you feed me lines
About some idealistic future
(Tell me, am I right?)
Your heart won't heal right
If you keep tearing out the sutures

I admit that I have made mistakes
And I swear I'll never wrong you again
You've got a lure I can't deny
But you've had your chance, so say goodbye
Say goodbye9Embed
