This Place Is a Prison Lyrics
This place is a prison
And these people aren't your friends
Inhaling thrills through twenty dollar bills
And the tumblers are drained and then flooded
Again and again

There's guards at the on ramps
Armed to the teeth
And you may case the grounds
From the Cascades to Puget Sound
But you are not permitted to leave

I know there's a big world out there
Like the one that I saw on the screen
In my living room, late last night
It was almost too bright to see
And I know that it's not a party
If it happens every night
Pretending there's glamour and candelabra
When you're drinking by candlelight

What does it take to get a drink in this place?
What does it take? How long must I wait?
What does it take to get a drink in this place?
What does it take? How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?Embed
