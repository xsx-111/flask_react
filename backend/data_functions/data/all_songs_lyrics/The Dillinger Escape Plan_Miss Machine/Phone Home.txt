Phone Home LyricsTake fire out of heaven's clenched fist
Cracks slip between my desire
To keep your broken heart bleeding
Just hold tight and tell another fucking joke
To pacify the urge for suicide
You know it won't keep waiting
So say goodbye
'cause I never want to hear another word about you
And I you know...you never stop
Now we started out just running
Out spreading like wings
And we are one
I pulled you right out of the gutter
When I could have bee lined
We started out just running
Out spreading like wings
And what were we supposed to do?
You belong to me
And what are we supposed to do?
Suck it in, spit it out
You know that two's a crowd?
Expectant mother's stillborn baby beauty
Cries aloud and tries to tell you what I'm about
Now don't you worry about
A little thing like this
It only hurts just a bit
I promise I'm going to take you a mile high
So don't you cry 'cause it'll just be
Baby baby baby nonstop until the end of the night
So keep your mouth shut
Now we started out just running
Out spreading like wings
And we are one
I pulled you right out of the gutter
When I could have bee lined
We started out just running
Out spreading like wings
And what were we supposed to do?
You belong to me
And what are we supposed to do?
I can tell you're a good fuck
Just by the way you wear that innocent look
Don't you know that enough is never enough
I made you now you are property I can't discard
We started out just running
Out spreading like wings
And what were we supposed to do?Embed
