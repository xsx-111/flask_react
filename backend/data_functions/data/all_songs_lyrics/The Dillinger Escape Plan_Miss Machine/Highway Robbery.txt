Highway Robbery LyricsYou'd never imagine us bringing a loaded gun to the ballroom
This party is about to kick off
Tonight is the wrong night
The devil's own are only starting up the first round of the fight
So hang on tight
Dear mother
The needle is jabbing the womb draw back and release this child of disease
This mob is a riot
The outlaw youth are only emptying the first round of the night
'cause everything's not alright
I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
Wool over our eyes
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth
Wearing your disguise
It's pretty apparent this boy is a curse
The christ of the moment so blow him away
Hey come on
And take the new number if you're next in line
Then kid I got a really big fucking surprise
There won't be a next time
I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
Wool over our eyes
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth
Wearing your disguise
I suppose you thought you had our hands behind our backs
Wool over our eyes
Now your pulse is in my palm and you stand hands to mouth
Wearing your disguise
I suppose you thought you, I suppose you thought you
I suppose you thought you put the wool over our eyes
I suppose you thought you, I suppose you thought you
I suppose you thought you put the wool over our eyesEmbed
