Van Damsel LyricsSurprise!
It's not what you thought as it runs
A dead stop light as it runs
A dead stop light you're the fool
And we won't look back
Let's tie those Ankles to the railroad
Don't stop to catch your breath
I bet your foresight never saw this
Train wreck is right on time
A fucking punk
A fucking punk rock
You fucking punk
You fucking punk
You prostitute
You fucking punk
You fucking punk rock
You fucking punk
Prostitute
Pick the open vein to shreds
You should know that you're my death wish
Bible thumping steeple
Fuck you are the worst of all scum
Train wreck right on time
You're my death wish
Yeah
We were young and we were god
Far away from us now
We don't want it, what you've got
We don't want it
We don't want it
We don't want it
We don't want it
And you've got it
She took my hand
She took my hand
But I never took hersEmbed
