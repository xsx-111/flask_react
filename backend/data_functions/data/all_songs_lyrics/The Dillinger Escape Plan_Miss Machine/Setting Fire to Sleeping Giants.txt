Setting Fire to Sleeping Giants Lyrics
First off, let me say
You look so tired
Rest your head and shut your eyes
Empty ambition
Blankets the sky
I'm thinking 'bout another world

Tonight, yeah yeah yeah
You're right, you're right, you're right

So drop the gown, the game's over
Just push your face into the fight
And it breaks my heart, like dancing up all night
Ride so high, we both start thinking 'bout another world tonight
And it feels so wrong
Like nothing we've ever felt before

Yeah, yeah, yeah
You're right, you're right, you're right

The stranger's candy
Takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Close your eyes...
Tonight
Baby, you can have it
Baby, you can have it
Oh, baby, gnaw me
Down to the bone
Soon you'll find I'm never gonna take you back home
Well, there's so much you never told me
And there's not much I want to know
'Cause your pretty face will do just fine
You'll be the star
Of my very last show
Let's go for a long ride
I'll show you places you won't ever want to leave

The stranger's candy
Takes you where you ought to be
In broken alleys, in the back of every street
Stranger's candy, broken alleys
Yeah, tonight

We could bring it all down
We could bring it all down
They think this body's a dead note
Dancing to the beat, but they'll never see this corpse
Coming 'til it kills them1Embed
