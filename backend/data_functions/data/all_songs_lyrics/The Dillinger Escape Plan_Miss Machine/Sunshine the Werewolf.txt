Sunshine the Werewolf LyricsCry your eyes bloodshot
While there's still time
'Cause soon
It's gone
And you'll be so shocked
One queen-sized coffin
That was built for two
Is your death bed
It belongs to you
Tease me, baby
Please me
With the fresh disease
Hope riding on a bullet
Alive tonight
You know we couldn't get it right
Come save your life tonight
You know we'll never get it right
Don't try to swim to shore
Because you can't go back
Say three words
Like they're the last you'll speak
Curtains drop
Concealing
Appearances of heaven
Destroyer!
There'll be another just like you
You're not the only one, I'm not the only one
Destroyer!
Watching the fallout fly back up
Walking where time stands still
See how this love
Kills
Love kills
Love kills!
Love kills!
Dropping
Curtains down
Concealing
Appearances of heaven
Without my existence
You are nothing!
Without my affection
You wilt
You wilt!
We fucked like a nuclear war
Release
Fuck off
See how I let you down
Watching
Fallout
Fly back upEmbed
