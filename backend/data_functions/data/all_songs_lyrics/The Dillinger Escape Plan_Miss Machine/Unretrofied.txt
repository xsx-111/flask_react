Unretrofied Lyrics
Is the can half-diseased or is the disease half-canned?
And is the man half-machine, or is the machine half-man?
Well, I'm unretrofied for you
Is the can half-diseased or is the disease half-canned?
Or is the man half-machine, or is the machine half-man?
I'm unretrofied for you
So come on, so come on

I'll (I'll) just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song, and leave dead in the end
Time (Time) is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again

Now they're looting our holes until there is nothing left
Calloused intentions it seems, coward's invention at best
Well, I'm unretrofied for you
Now they're looting our holes until there is nothing left
Calloused intentions it seems, coward's invention at best
I'm unretrofied for you
So come on, so come on

I'll (I'll) just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song, and leave dead in the end
Time (Time) is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again
We're all dead
Jesus can't play the music 'cause he's nailed to the cross
And over gnawed-off feet, I find that I can't walk
I can't walk
I can't even walk

I'll (I'll) just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song, and leave dead in the end
Time (Time) is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again
I'll just fake it in the end
Just save it for a new song, and leave dead in the end
Time is wasted in the end
Wood-paneled wagon carpool dragons killing me again
We're all dead1Embed
