We Are the Storm LyricsWell they said we'd tear ourselves apart
And it turns out they were right
Cause I've never seen you so weak and so far out of breath
And I never saw the tide rise so high so fast
Watch this pawn capture the queen
White picket drive-by
Gargle the stench the storm brings
You'll never get enough
Watch this pawn capture the queen
Now I can't shake you
But I can't take you
Empty skin bag you're my cum rag
And now the flood gates overflow
Now I see that too much is not enough
No this game has been playing for too long
Yeah you did it
Did you get enough?
My sweet child of fire
This love affair is so lost
This love affair is so lost
Cut through the sea
This pendulum swings near me
We are the storm
So take your ship to port
Oh it's time to let it go
Right now it's time to let it go
Time to let it go
Cause this feels like half a million years
And I know you feel the same way
I do
Don't you
Do you
Well they said we'd tear ourselves apart
And it turns out they were right
Tear ourselves apart
Turns out they were rightEmbed
