Panasonic Youth LyricsWe wrote these plans, took the order
The architecture, and followed them to the end
Until the gears ground cold and relentless
There was no remorse
We had none, we kept on with no trace of a regret
There was no remorse
(I never saw any blood)
No soul for the body
Watch them turn her scab covered skin into
Stone, like a coal in the
Sky, searching for the
Dawn, for the last time
Bloated with white eyes wide
We've come to an understanding
You lose, I profit
High noon and there ain't no secrets
No more excuses
Now our number's up, let them
Lead us by the throat now
Just smile while the rope pulls tighter, tighter
Guilty is an understatement
The hourglass is never right side up
And all the time we try to tear the script up
Forgetting all the sour for the sweet
The paragraph has never been so empty
The lifeless test tube
The mother dies with infant in arms
The lifeless test tube, look what she's done
Evolution gave us a clock that's always winding down
Evolution gave us a clock that's always winding down1Embed
