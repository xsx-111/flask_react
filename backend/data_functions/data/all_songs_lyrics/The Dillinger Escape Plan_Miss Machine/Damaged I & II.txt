Damaged I & II LyricsDamaged by you, damaged by me
I'm confused, confused
Don't wanna be confused
Stupid attempts, no conclusions
I'm confused, confused
Don't wanna be confused
Put the gun to my head, and I don't pull
I'm confused, confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
No I don't wanna see
But you can't make me long for your life and security
Don't even feel a thing
No I don't wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
Problems stick, my life drips
Feelings, stupid feelings
Stupid illusions
I'm confused, confused
Don't wanna be confused
Scars
I'm confused, confused
My emotions are bruised
Wrong in what you think
You don't feel shit
I'm confused, confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
Don't even feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
Problems stick, my life drips
Feelings start
I'm confused
You're wrong
Don't wanna be wrong
Stupid incompetence
Stupid in what you think
I'm confused
Leave me alone
Don't wanna be wrong
When I talk to you my mind falls apart
I'm confused, confused
Don't wanna be confused
Don't even feel a thing
No I don't wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
(Problems, my problems)
No longer feel a thing
Don't even wanna see
But you can't make me long, for your life and security
Problems stick, my life
Feelings, everything I know
My name's Henry
And you're here with me now
Rrraghh
My life
It's a song daaah
It's so you won't even let it happen
You won't
You won't let
Damaged!
By attacks
I'm evil attacking my mind
But you don't mind
'Cause this scheduled 13
You just sit, down
Buy the ticket
Wait your turnEmbed
