Ocean Roar LyricsOne voice heard low (One chants out)
Across the water (Between two worlds)
Through ocean roar (Walk with me)
Lost in thought
The mind wandering again
Drifting west over the hills (Pulled out to sea)
Sitting in the car
After the music stopped abrupt
We arrived in the dark
Lost and disoriented (Through a dark)
As the car cooled down (Stretch of trees)
The sound of waves rose and blanketed (The roar of the beach)
Our minds grew into a vast night air (Calling)
We made beds in the ditch
The loud breath of surf
Exhaling and constant (I thought I heard)
Sleeping on the wet ground (Some voice returning)
In a dream, I swim
(I thought I heard some voice returning)
Out past waves rolling
Broad deep skyEmbed
