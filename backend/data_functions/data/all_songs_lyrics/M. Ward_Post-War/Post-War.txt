Post-War Lyrics
Don't they love you in mysterious ways
You say yeah but this is now and that was then
Put a dollar into the machine and you'll remember when

I know when everything feels wrong
I've got some hard, hard proof in this song
I'll know when everything feels right
Some lucky night
Some lucky night

Say the money just ain't what it used to be
Man how we used to tear apart this town
Put a dollar into the machine and you'll remember how
