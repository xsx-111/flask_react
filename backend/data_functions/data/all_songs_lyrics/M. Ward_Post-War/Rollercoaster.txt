Rollercoaster Lyrics
You're like a rollercoaster
You got heavy metal wings
You could make a dead man scream
You're like a rollercoaster

Rollercoaster, we was the best of times
Rollercoaster, we was the worst of times too
Because you lift me up so high high high
It's the most unbelievable ride


Rollercoaster, can't find my friends on the ground
Just lift me up and send me spiralling down
Because you lift me up so high high high
It's the most unbelievable ride

You're like a rollercoaster
Heavy metal wings
Make a dead man scream
Rollercoaster
Rollercoaster
