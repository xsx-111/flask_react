Chinese Translation Lyrics
I sailed a wild, wild sea
Climbed up a tall, tall mountain
I met an old, old man
Beneath a weeping willow tree
He said, "Now if you got some questions
Go and lay them at my feet
But my time here is brief
So you'll have to pick just three"

And I said, "What do you do
With the pieces of a broken heart?
And how can a man like me
Remain in the light?
And if life is really as short as they say
Then why is the night so long?"
And then the sun went down
And he sang for me this song

See, I once was a young fool like you
Afraid to do the things that I knew I had to do
So I played an escapade, just like you
I played an escapade, just like you
I sailed a wild, wild sea
Climbed up a tall, tall mountain
I met an old, old man
He sat beneath a sapling tree
He said, "Now if you got some questions
Go and lay them at my feet
But my time here is brief
So you'll have to pick just three"

And I said, "What do you do
With the pieces of a broken heart?
And how can a man like me
Remain in the light?
And if life is really as short as they say
Then why is the night so long?"
And then the sun went down
And he played for me this song2Embed
