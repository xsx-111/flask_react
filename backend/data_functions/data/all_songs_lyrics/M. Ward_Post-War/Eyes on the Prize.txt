Eyes on the Prize Lyrics
Everything I've learned I have forgotten
Everything I've forgotten looks just like new
I pulled the ends out for the tie that binds
To keep my promise with you

With my eyes on the prize
And my mind on you
I put my pride on the line
My whole life too

Now anything you ask me for is yours
Now say the word and I'll lay it at your feet
I'll meet the pavements down the line somehow
If you keep your promise with me

With my eyes on the prize
And my mind on you
I put my pride on the line
And my whole life too

You say, take your axe and fashion me a kind of swing
Walkin' blues have played a number on my feet
I'll dance whatever dance you need to dance
'Cause you keep you promise with me
You'll keep your promise with me
You'll keep your promise
You'll keep your promise
You'll keep your promise with meEmbed
