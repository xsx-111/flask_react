Requiem Lyrics
Well, he stormed with his feet
And he clapped with his hands
He summoned all of his joy when he laughed
It suffered all of his joy when he cried
And sometimes when he got into talking
Man, he could rattle on and on

He was a good man and now he's gone

Well, in war he was a tiger
When it was over, like a dove
He summoned all of his strength in the climb
It suffered all of his strength in the fall
And sometimes when he got into fighting
Man, he could fight with you all day long

He was a good man and now he's gone

He put his trust in a higher power
He held his power like a Holy Grail
He summoned all of his faith in the lifting
It suffered all of his faith in the fail
His heart was stronger than a heavy metal bullet
And that's why I dedicate this song

He was a good man and now he's gone

His heart was stronger than a heavy metal bullet
And that's why I dedicate this songEmbed
