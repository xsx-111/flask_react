Poison Cup LyricsOne
One
One
One or two won't do
'Cause I want it all
And a sip
A sip
A sip or a spoonful won't do
No, I want it all
And I hope
I hope
Hope you know what I'm thinking of
I want all of your love
I need all of your love
She said "if love
If love
Is a poison cup
Then drink it up"
'Cause a sip
A sip
Or a spoonful won't do
Won't do nothing for you
Except mess you up"
And I hope
I hope
Hope you know what this means
I'm gonna give you everything
I'm gonna give you everything1Embed
