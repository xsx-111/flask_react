To Go Home LyricsHope it be my mind won't slip
Sailing on a sinking ship
Into the sunset and back
Dark night on a long highway
Little lights in the houses say
There's somebody's staying up late
Oh I'll be true to you
Oh yeah, you know I will
And I'll be true to you forever or until
I go home
God it's great to be alive
Takes the skin right off my hide
To think I'll have to give it all up someday
And if I ever treated you mean
You know that it was only because
I'm sorry I couldn't have you for my own
Oh I'll be true to you
Oh yeah, you know I will
And I'll be true to you forever or until
I go home
I go home
I, I, I, I... I go home
I, I, I, I... I go home
I, I, I, I... I go home
God it's great to be alive
Takes the skin right off my hide
To think I'll have to give it all up somedayEmbed
