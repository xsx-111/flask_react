Main Man LyricsAre you my main man
Are you now are you now
Are you my Main Man
Are you now are you now
Are you now
Are you a God man
Are you now are you now
Are you a frog man
Are you now are you now
Are you now
Heaven is hot babe
Everso everso
Heaven is hot babe
Watch it glow watch it glow
Watch it glow
Bolan likes to rock now
Yes he does yes he does
Bolan likes to rock now
Yes he does, yes he does
Is there a sane man
Anywhere anywhere
Got giraffes in my hair
And I don't care
No I don't care
No I don't care
As a child I laughed a lot
O yes I did O yes I did
Now it seems I cry a lot
O tell me true don't youEmbed
