Metal Guru LyricsAaaaawh yeah
Oaaaaah
Metal Guru is it you
Metal Guru is it you
Sitting there in your armour plated chair
Oh yeah, metal Guru is it you
Metal Guru is it true
All alone without a telephone
Oh yeah, metal Guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock'n'roll child
Oh yeah, metal Guru has it been
Just like a silver-studded sabre-tooth dream
I'll be clean you know
Pollution machine
Oh yeah, metal Guru is it you
Metal Guru is it you
Awh yeah (aaaaah)
Awh yeah (aaaaah)
(Oaaaaah)
Metal Guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock'n'roll child
Oh yeah, metal Guru is it you
Metal Guru is it true
All alone without a telephone
Oh, metal Guru could it be
You're gonna bring my baby to me
She'll be wild you know
A rock'n'roll child
Oh yeah, metal Guru is it you
Metal Guru is it you
