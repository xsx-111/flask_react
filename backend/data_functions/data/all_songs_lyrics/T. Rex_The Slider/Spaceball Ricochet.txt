Spaceball Ricochet Lyrics
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah aaah aaah aaah

I'm just a man
I understand the wind
And all the things
That make the children cry
With my Les Paul
I know I'm small
But I enjoy living anyway
Book after book
I get hooked
Every time the writer
Talks to me like a friend

What can I do
We just live in a zoo
All I do is play
The Spaceball Ricochet
Deep in my heart
There's a house
That can hold
Just about all of you
I bought a car
It was old but kind
I gave it my mind
And it disappeared
I love a girl
She is a changeless angel
She's a city
It's a pity that I'm like me, yeah

I said how can I lay
When all I do is play
The Spaceball Ricochet?

I'm just a man
I understand the wind
And all the things
That make the children cry
With my Les Paul
I know I'm small
But I enjoy living anyway, yes I do
Deep in my heart
There's a house
That can hold
Just about all of you
How can I lay
When all I do is play
The Spaceball Ricochet?
Oh baby
The Spaceball Ricochet
Oh mama
The Spaceball

Oooh, do the Spaceball...Embed
