Rock On LyricsI've been down there
Everybody's been there
Everyone everyone
Desolation angels
On the cover of my paper
Love everyone everyone
Rock on
Rock on
Mild mouthed Rita
She's a Chevvy Chase cheetah
Loves everyone everyone
Teddy's going steady
He's a silver-plated poet
Loves everyone loves everyone
Prophet pumped the car-scar
Deeper only sweeter
Loves everyoneEmbed
