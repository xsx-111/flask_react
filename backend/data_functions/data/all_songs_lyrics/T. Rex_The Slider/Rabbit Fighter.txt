Rabbit Fighter LyricsShady politician in my bed
Tying bolts of lightning to his head
Call me Rabbit Fighter, you know it's true
Babe I'll rabbit fight all over you
Tramp king of the city, he's my friend
Moondog's just a prophet to the end
Call me Rabbit Fighter, you know it's true
Babe I'll rabbit fight all over you
Call me Rabbit Fighter, you know it's true
Babe I'll rabbit fight all over you
(Yes, I will)
I saw a dude unscrewed and badly burned
Laughing 'cause he'd gotten what he'd earned (yes, he did)
Call me Rabbit Fighter, you know it's true
Babe I'll rabbit fight all over you
Call me Rabbit Fighter
Call me Rabbit Fighter, oh
Jo Jo, don't you know?
Call me Rabbit Fighter
Call me Rabbit Fighter, oh
Jo Jo, don't you know?
Call me Rabbit Fighter
Call me Rabbit Fighter, oh
Jo Jo, don't you know?
Call me Rabbit Fighter
Call me Rabbit Fighter, oh
Jo Jo, don't you know?Embed
