The Slider LyricsI could never understand the wind at all
Was like a ball of love
I could never, never see the cosmic sea
Was like a bumblebee
And when I'm sad, I slide
I have never, never kissed a car before
It's like a door
I have always, always grown my own before
All schools are strange
And when I'm sad, I slide
Oh, slide
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
And when I'm sad, I slide
I have never, never nailed a nose before
That's how the garden grows
I could never understand the wind at all
Was like a ball of love
And when I'm sad, I slide
Watch now
I'm gonna slideEmbed
