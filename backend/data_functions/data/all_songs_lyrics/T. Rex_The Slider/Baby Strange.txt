Baby Strange Lyrics
One and two and bubbly-bubbly-boo-boo yeah

I see you walking, I see you talking
With all of my friends
I'm shadowed under, you're like some thunder
Ooh, I wanna be your friend
I wanna call you, I wanna ball you
All night long
In winds of passion, my whip is lashing
I wanna get you and then

Ooh, you're strange
Don't lame me, Baby Strange, don't lame me, baby

The city's shaking, I ain't faking
Oh, baby, this is the end
I'm overloaded, my head's exploded
I wanna get you and then
I wanna call you, I wanna ball you
Ooh yeah

Ooh, you're strange
Don't lame me, Baby Strange, don't lame me, baby
Ooh, you're strange
Don't lame me, Baby Strange, don't lame me, baby
Ooh, you're strange
Don't lame me, Baby Strange, don't lame me, baby
Oh no, wowEmbed
