Telegram Sam Lyrics
Oh yeah
Telegram Sam
Telegram Sam
You are my main man

Golden nose Slim
Golden nose Slim
I knows where you've been
Purple pie Pete
Purple pie Pete
Your lips are like lightning
Girls melt in the heat

Telegram Sam
You're my main man
Telegram Sam
You're my main man

Bobby's alright
Bobby's alright
He's a natural born poet
He's just outta sight
Jungle faced Jake
Jungle faced Jake
I said make no mistake
About jungle faced Jake, Jake

Telegram Sam
You're my main man
Telegram Sam
You're my main man

Bobby's alright
Bobby's alright
He's a natural born poet
He's just outta sight
Automatic shoes
Automatic shoes
Give me 3-D vision
And the California blues
Me I funk
But I don't care
I ain't no square
With my corkscrew hair
Telegram Sam
You're my main man
Telegram Sam
You're my main man

Telegram Sam
You're my main man
Telegram Sam
Telegram Sam
I'm a howling wolf
Telegram Sam
I'm a howling wolf
Telegram Sam
I'm a howling wolfEmbed
