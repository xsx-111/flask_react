Baby Boomerang LyricsSlim lined sheik faced
Angel of the night
Riding like a cowboy
In the graveyard of the night
New York witch in the dungeon
Of the day
I'm trying to write my novel
But all you do is play
Baby Boomerang
Baby Boomerang
Well you never spike a person but you always bang the whole gang
Mince pie dog-eye
Eagle on the wind
I'm searching through this garbage
Looking for a friend
Your uncle with an alligator
Chained to his leg
Dangles you your freedom
Then he offers you his bed
Baby Boomerang
Baby Boomerang
Well you never spike a person but you always bang the whole gang
It seems to me to dream is something too wild
In Max's Kansas City you a belladonna child
Hiding on the highways on the gateway to the south
You're talking with your boots and you're walking with your mouth
Baby Boomerang
Baby Boomerang
Well you never spike a person but you always bang the whole gang
Baby Boomerang
Baby Boomerang
Well you never spike a person but you always bang the whole gang
Wow, thank you Ma'am
Ah ah yeahEmbed
