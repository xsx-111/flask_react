Count Me Out LyricsShe was only seventeen, a few months shy maybe
Boy looks in her eye, such a lover
A few weeks down the line they're tying the knot
But then a few weeks after that, it's over
If she's spending her life without him
She's calling it quits
If this what love is all about
You can count me out, baby count me out, just count me out
If this what love is all about
You can count me out, baby count me out, just count me out, oh yeah
(You can count me out yeah)
Boy come home from school to find his momma crying
He looks inside her eyes so blue
They sit down side by side, she tells him the truth
She say last night i caught your daddy having a (ugh ugh ahh!)
She's trying to wrap her mind around it
She can't figure it out (she can't figure it out)
If this what love is all about
You can count me out, baby count me out, just count me out
If this what love is all about
You can count me out, baby count me out, just count me out, oh yeah
Loneliness won't leave me alone
It's mid-July and I'm still cold
Thinking of my saddest memory, yeah
Just so I can cry
All I need is you, yeah
All I need is you, yeah
All I need is you, yeah
All I need is you, you, you, you
If this what love is all about
You can count me out, baby count me out, just count me out
(If this what love is all about
Count me out, count me out)Embed
