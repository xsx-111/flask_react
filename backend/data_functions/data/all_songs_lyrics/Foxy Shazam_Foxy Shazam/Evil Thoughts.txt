Evil Thoughts LyricsAs my lamp grows dim and I'm hardly hanging on
In this path I've been following for years
Now is not so well lit
And the pieces don't fit no more
Should I proceed or turn back around
Lord, let me know what I should do
Evil thoughts, evil powers seek my mind
I, I feel lost every time
Evil force, evil ways close behind
I, I need love, I need love, I need love
Back the way I came, nothing looks the same
And the bread crumbs I've left along the way
Now've been eaten away
By the birds that have left in my past
Should I proceed or turn back around
Lord, let me know what I should do
Evil thoughts, evil powers seek my mind
I, I feel lost every time
Evil force, evil ways close behind
I, I need love, I need love, I need love
All I know isn't always the truth, yeah
All I know isn't always the case, oh
All I know isn't always the truth
All I know isn't always the case
As the days grow long
And the sun's gone down
It's so hard for me
Evil thoughts, evil powers seek my mind
I feel lost every time, oh
Evil force, evil ways close behind
I, I need love, I need love, I need love
All I know isn't always the truth, yeah
All I know isn't always what it seems
I need love, I need love, I need loveEmbed
