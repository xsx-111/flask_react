Unstoppable Lyrics
My mother told me, "Poor boy, be strong."
Some say I won't last, I say they're wrong
And we won't back down this time
No, we won't back down this time

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable, wooh

Crawling though the dirt, you heard our prayers
Sticks and stones may hurt, but we don't care
And we won't back down this time (No we won't, no we won't)
No, we won't back down this time

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh
Yo, yo-ee-oh-a-yeah, yeah, oh

And we won't back down this time (We won't this time)
No, we won't back down this time

We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
We are unstoppable
No, we don't need a reason
We are unstoppable1Embed
