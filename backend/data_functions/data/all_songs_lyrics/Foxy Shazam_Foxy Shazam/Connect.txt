Connect LyricsOoh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me in my place
Ooh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me in my place
You coward, I can feel you making eyes in my reflection
I know what you're thinking, just say it, you don't like me
It's a fact that I'm a dad, it makes you mad the dreams I had
But I can't help it
I can't help myself
Ooh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me in my place
Ooh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me in my place
You're unfair, you got a family that has needs, no dedication
If I were there for you, well then my dreams, they don't come true
If I was there for them, I'll lose my family and my friends
What do I do?
I can't help myself
Ooh ah, you connect me, yeah
You are the one, you hold me in my place
Ooh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me, hold me in my place
You take away the space between
The two of us apart
You take away the disconnect to them guts
Heart to heart, heart to heart, yeah
Ooh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me in my place
Ooh ah, you connect me (you can connect me)
You are the one, you hold me in my place
Ooh ah, you connect me
You are the one, you hold me in my place
You can connect me
You are the one that holds me in my, holds me in my placeEmbed
