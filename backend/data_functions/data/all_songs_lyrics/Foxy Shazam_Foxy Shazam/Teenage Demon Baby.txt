Teenage Demon Baby LyricsLet's smash a couple of cocktails
And ditch this fancy party
Go and hide inside the graveyard down the street
That's where people go to get away
The dead are pounding on the ground tonight
Or maybe that's the sound of my heart
We hopped the gate
Read the tombstone date, said 1965
The night horse drags the moon into
Tomorrow's bitter morn
Yeah, I want it back
Come on, give it back
Teenage demon baby, I'm in love with you
There's no where in this world I'd rather be
Then right here next to you
We were up 'til dawn, I couldn't stop yawning
I'll never get that feeling again
It's funny how this old dead piece of land
Makes us feel so alive
The night horse drags new moon
Into the daylight's final hour
Yeah I want you back
Come on baby now
Teenage demon baby, I'm in love with you
There's no where in this world I'd rather be
Then right here next to you
Teenage demon baby, I'm in love with you
There's no where in this world I'd rather be
Then right here next to you
If I go overboard, would you set me straight
Or would you not
If I go overboard, would you let me die
Or would you not
Would you let me die
Would you let me die
Would you let me die
Would you let me die
Teenage demon baby, I'm in love with you
There's no where in this world I'd rather
Teenage demon baby, I'm in love with you
There's no where in this world I'd rather be
Then right here next to you
If I go overboard, would you let me know
Or would you notEmbed
