Intro/Bombs Away LyricsThere sure are a lot of dogs out this evening
Perhaps they can assist me in a song
Ruff Ruff Ruff Ruff
Yeaaah
Ruff Ruff Ruff Ruff
Yeeeeeah
Ruff Ruff Ruff Ruff
Yeeeeah
Ruff Ruff Ruff Ruff
Yeaaaah
I know I got that feeling
My body gets so tingly
Oh I need it, yeah I need it to be true
1,2,3,4
Hear the sun crashing down from the sky
Darkness crawls coming in from all sides
That's it, I quit
And all the targets have been hit
Our home, our vine
We'll all have vengeance time
Bombs away, bombs away
Little pieces of their bodies
Blowing in the wind
Bombs away
Bombs away, bombs away
Little pieces of their bodies
B-b-blowing in the wind, oh
Bombs away
I said bombs away
