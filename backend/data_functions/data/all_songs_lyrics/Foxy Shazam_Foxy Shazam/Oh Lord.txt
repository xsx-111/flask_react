Oh Lord LyricsJulian, it's a hungry world
They're going to eat you alive son, yeah
Oh Julian, when their fangs sink in
I'll stitch you but then I gotta throw you back in
You just try and sleep, even though you're alone
You just close your eyes, boy you dream of home
And light is always on, you just keep that in mind
When you wake in the morning you'll be satisfied

Cause there is always a wrong to your right
And there will always be a war somewhere to fight
And god knows I've had some rough fucking years
Oh lord, oh lord, keep on keeping on
Julian, I thought I told you this
But I guess I was wrong, yeah yeah
Oh Julian, it probably scares you now
In the future it counts you got to trust me, trust me, yeah
So lock this song away, for a darker day
When you're down on your knees, screaming oh lord
I am always there, you just keep that in mind
When you wake in the morning you'll be satisfied
