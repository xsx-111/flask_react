Killin It LyricsI go dancing on the ceiling sometimes
It's always fun but I get scared of the climb
Will you catch my fall, catch my fall?
The notes I play put a stain on my heart
Some songs I hate, some I hate even more
I am the fool, am I the fool?
So tell me Eric, does it hurt, hurt? (Uh-huh)
So tell me Eric, does it hurt? (Not at all!)

I'm killing life like a one way ticket to hell
I'm on a high going down, down, down
I wanna wipe that sad sad feeling away
Down, down, down
The words I sing burn my throat as they leave
Desperate measures for these times are in need
Do you feel the same?  It's such a shame
So tell me Eric, does it hurt, hurt? (Uh-huh)
So tell me Eric, does it hurt? (Not at all!)

I'm killing life like a one way ticket to hell
I'm on a high going down, down, down
I wanna wipe that sad, sad feeling away
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down

We are not
Ordinary things

I wanna play it
A little bit louder now!
A little bit louder now!
A little bit louder now!

I'm killing life like a one way ticket to hell
I'm on a high going down, down, down
I wanna wipe that sad sad feeling away
Down, down, down
Down, down, down1Embed
