Wanna-Be Angel LyricsI want my friends to think I'm awesome
Awesome, awesome, yeah
I want this world to think I care
I don't care at all
For you I wear this mask
At home I tear it off
Cause I don't need it
No, I don't need it at all

I'm a wanna-be, I'm a wanna-be angel
I'm a wanna-be, I'm a wanna-be angel
I want my fans to think I'm so punk rock
So punk rock and roll
And all you hipsters say I'm gay
Well I'm not gay at all!
For you I wear this mask
At home I tear it off
Cause I don't need it
No, I don't need it at all

Do you want to be dead?
Dude, yes I am, yes I am
You'll probably end up in heaven
And I'll be burning in hell
You'll probably end up in heaven
And I'll be burning in hell
I'm a wanna-be, I'm a wanna-be angel
Come on, everybody, come on
I'm a wanna-be, I'm a wanna-be angel
Do you want to be dead?
Dude, yes I am, yes I am
