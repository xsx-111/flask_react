Second Floor LyricsSoon as they fall asleep I'll be out of here
I'll put on my shoes and I'll sneak to the window
Brush the bird shit off the ledge
And shimmy shimmy off, shimmy shimmy
Sitting there looking down I prepare myself
Return to where I belong and betterfy myself
I hold my breath and close my eyes
I shimmy shimmy off, shimmy shimmy
As I fall to the lonely world below
(Fall down fall down, fall down)
In mid-air, floating there, I declare
So long to the second floor
It's been fun but I don't belong
Up there with the industry or
Up there with you wolves
Now I'm down here with the lower class
Down here with the idiots, yeah
I feel better now
I said I feel better now
So long to the second floor
Soon as I get back home i find the door was locked
Pretend i'm a g.i. joe and sneak around the house
I hear the dogs, they're all freaking out
I shimmy shimmy in, shimmy shimmy
As I fall to the lonely world below
(Fall down fall down, fall down)
In mid-air, floating there, I declare
So long to the second floor
It's been fun but I don't belong
Up there with the industry or
Up there with you wolves
Now I'm down here with the lower class
Down here with the idiots, yeah
I feel better now
I said I feel better now
So long to the second floor
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, no
I'm not ready to spend the night alone
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, no
I'm not ready to spend the night alone
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, no
I'm not ready to spend the night alone
I'm not ready, I'm not ready, no
I'm not ready, I'm not ready
So long to the second floor
It's been fun but I don't belong
Up there with the industry or
Up there with you wolves
Down here with the lower class
Down here with the idiots, yeah
I feel better now
I said I feel better now
So long to the second floorEmbed
