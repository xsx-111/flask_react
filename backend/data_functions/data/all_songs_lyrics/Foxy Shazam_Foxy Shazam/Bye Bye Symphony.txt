Bye Bye Symphony LyricsI'm kinda sick of losing
It makes me wanna cry
It seems everything in life I try for
I'll never get before I die
But what's the point in moaning?
Oughtta leave that for the ghosts
It's better to think it through
Find the words that bring you hope
Oh hope, I need you
Life is a bitch but she's totally doable
She'll knock you around and she'll lend you a hand
Oh, life is a bitch but she's totally doable
She may be a beauty but life, life is a bitch
So how do I stop the spinning?
I'm in need of more air
I'm dizzy from everyone around me winning
It just doesn't seem to be very fair
But I'll keep looking for the bright side
In the darkest hour of night
Keep an open eye to the sky
Try to find all my lost faith, yeah
Oh faith
Oh faith, I need you
Life is a bitch, but she's totally doable
She'll knock you around and she'll lend you a hand
Ah, life is a bitch, but she's totally, totally doable
She may be a beauty but life, life is a bitch
Bye bye symphony, you were the soundtrack to my life
Bye bye symphony, there are no sad songs left to write
Bye bye symphony, the tears I've wept have gone and dried
Bye bye symphony, because you waited I've finally died
Life is a bitch, but she's totally doable
She'll knock you around and she'll lend you a hand
Yeah, life is a bitch, but she's totally doable
She'll tell you a story but never, never believeEmbed
