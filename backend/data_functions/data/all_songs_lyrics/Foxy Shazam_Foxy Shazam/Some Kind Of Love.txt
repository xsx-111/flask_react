Some Kind Of Love LyricsEverybody has a love story
Well I have a few for you
It won't take long
Here they are
One, two, three four
Power outage on a Saturday night
Game of tag with two flash lights
Then I smell her inching closer
As our bodies heat up a roller coaster
Next thing you know we were tangled in laughter
Two teenagers hearts couldn't beat any faster
We were lost in the light, baby losing our minds
Losing our minds
Some kind of love, some kind of feeling
I have up in my heart tonight, I'm letting loose on you
Some kind of love, some kind of feeling
I have up in my heart tonight, I'm letting loose on you
Feel so perfect in this type of light
Summer storm kept us up all night
And the rain was pounding down
And the music it made it such a heavy sound
For me I'm glowing at the light it's creating fire
Let's light up the room we can see what we're making
I'm in over my head and I'm losing my mind
Losing our minds
Some kind of love, some kind of feeling
I have up in my heart tonight, I'm letting loose on you
Some kind of love, some kind of feeling
I have up in my heart tonight, I'm letting loose on you
Some kind of love, some kind of feeling
I have up in my heart tonight, I'm letting loose on you
Some kind of love, some kind of feeling
I have up in my heart tonight, I'm letting loose on youEmbed
