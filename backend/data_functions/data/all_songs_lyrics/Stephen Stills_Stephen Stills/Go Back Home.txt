Go Back Home LyricsThink I'll go back home
Think I'll go back home
Think I'll go back home
Back where I belong
Think I'll go back home
Nothin' for me here
Nothin' for me here, child, no there ain't
Nothin' for me here
People trapped by fear
And you can't get near
Lived with you I felt
Lived with you I felt, child
Lived with you I felt
I was by myself
I was someone else
Babe, come home with me
Babe, come home with me now
Babe, come home with me
And I'll make you see
Yes, I'm gonna set you free
When I woke up this morning
I found that I was alone, yeah
Till I called your number
They told me there's no one home again
Baby, what does it mean?
Is it like it seems?Embed
