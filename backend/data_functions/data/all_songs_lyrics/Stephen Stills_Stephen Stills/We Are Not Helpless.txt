We Are Not Helpless LyricsWe are not helpless, we are men
What lies between us
It can be set aside and ended
Everyday we learn more how to hate
We shut the door
And then we tell ourselves we can't relate
Only to the ones who are the same
Yet even they are different
And ever so they shall remain
All are strangers
All are friends
All are brothers
Open up, my friend and learn to hear
For even lying
Well, it has nothing you should fear
If you cannot let yourself be known
By anyone
Then you are hiding and not whole
All are strangers
All are friends
All are brothers
We, your children, we would ask you all
Please do not hide your eyes
And listen when we call
We will whisper, shout or make a scene
We are the answer
For we can live the peace we dream
All are strangers
All are friends
All are brothers
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Yes, and America's children
Are askin' everybody some questions about how it is
Yes, and America's children
Are makin' it hard to look them in the eyes
America's children
Are makin' it hard to live lies, you know it is
And America's children
Are diggin' that everywhere children
Are diggin' we live on the earth
We live on the earth, we live on the earth right now
Yes, and it's right on
Children of the earth and it's right on
Children of the earth and it's right on
Children of the earth and it's right on, right on, yeah
This is what has made our nation free
For life is change
And only blind men cannot see
The new order is upon us now
It is the children
They have the wisdom to be free
All are strangers
All are friends
All are brothers1Embed
