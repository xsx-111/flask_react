Sit Yourself Down LyricsWhen I get restless
What can I do?
When I need someone
I think about you
I got to move on
Not fade away
I'm only just growing a little each day
I got to quit this running round
Never gonna get rid of these blues
I got to find somebody to love
Slow me down, yeah
Look out now
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
When I get older
Mellow down
Get myself settled on a patch of ground
Taking it easy
Live every day
Me and the raven
We make our way
I got to quit this running round
I'm never gettin rid of these blues
I got to find somebody to
Make me slow down, yeah
Look out
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look around
Sit yourself down
Take a look aroundEmbed
