Cherokee LyricsIn my short time
I've loved, I've shined
And now I find
All my lovin' just been blind
Southern girl, come on
You and me babe, gotta move on
My fortunes mean nothing
I never cared about fame
The dark eyed Cherokee
Like the raven, she knows me
The secret she keeps
Like her soul so deep
Nothin' 'round here get to me
Like the lady from Tennessee
Like the lady from TennesseeEmbed
