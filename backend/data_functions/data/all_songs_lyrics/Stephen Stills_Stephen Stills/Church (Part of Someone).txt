Church (Part of Someone) LyricsYou see, it's my thing
To be part of someone
As a true friend
Is part of me
You know that there's so much
Oh, little girl, we've got to tell each other
About the whole world
And most especially one another, oh yeah, all right
And you know, and you know?
And it's hard, yes it is
It's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
I wonder could it be a dream? Yes
And you know that the self made man, babe
Is truly shallow
He knows he's no one
But who he wants to be
So while you still sing, baby
You got to tell me, baby, mmm yes
Is it your thing
To be part of anyone, anyone, anyone?
And it's hard, yes it is
It's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
I wonder if it could be a dream
And it's hard, yes it is
It's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
Is it a dream? Oh God, one more
And it's hard, yes it is
It's hard, yes it is
And I wonder
Now children, could it be a dream?Embed
