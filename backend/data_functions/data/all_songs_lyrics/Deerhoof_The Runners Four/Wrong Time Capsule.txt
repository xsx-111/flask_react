Wrong Time Capsule LyricsBend the machine
See the pendulum swing and go in between
When you hunger number one
It's no wonder under fun
Don't be mean to see the green
You get caught in the machine
You're caught in the machine
Here's a message she would say
Don't forget me yesterday
Cause today's no place to stay
Will you spirit me away?
You spirit me away
Bend the machine, Bend the machine
See the pendulum swing and go in between
Skip the waves, syncopate
Forwards backwards

Skip the waves, syncopate
Forwards backwards

Skip the waves, syncopate
Forwards backwards
