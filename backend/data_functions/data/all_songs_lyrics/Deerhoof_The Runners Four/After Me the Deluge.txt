After Me the Deluge LyricsHello lover, I can't do you harm
Middle lover, I did do you harm whenever I want to
Oh no, the ladder collapsing
The matter relaxing
The girl can't sing
LLLLLLLu lover running backwards now
Lover it is now
Then tomorrow crashes down
At a hundred miles an hour, and it's sour
The goodbye, the goodbye
The lover sighsEmbed
