Bone-Dry LyricsAre you a dry kind of one?
Do tell me
Show me your tongue
And I'll make you healthy
Peppercorn, peppercorn
Peppercorn, peppercorn
I'm very cold, and I'm wet
My tummy
But peppercorn, true to form
Can't help me
Wading salty waters of this river
I noticed that a heart was getting bigger-
It grew twice its size
Peppercorn, peppercorn
Peppercorn, peppercornEmbed
