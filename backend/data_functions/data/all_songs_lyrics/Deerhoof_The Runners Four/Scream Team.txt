Scream Team LyricsGuiding you, a voice is coming from behind the stage
Finding you, a voice is found on a missing page
Winding through, a plot controller from another age!
Pulling the cord of mystery
Cheating a clock
Meeting a team from history
A stranger's face is seen - but was he on our team?
The lights go out and everybody screamed - team!
A friend who was a foe
The quarter whistle is about to blow
Then I go
Tunnel under, tunnel under, underground
Enter sideways, reaching all around
In the darkness I will not be found
Invisible people doing the wave
Invisible people doing the wave
Invisible people doing the waveEmbed
