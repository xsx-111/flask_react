Odyssey LyricsPirates on an odyssey
We ask the captain 'what will be?'
When winter's gone
We might be wrong
My companions focus me
On the bright real sun
You're my reason to go
Careless whither I be led
How long will we last?
Out on the sea
Talking people happily
When they're right feel wrong
You're my real home
Out on the sea1Embed
