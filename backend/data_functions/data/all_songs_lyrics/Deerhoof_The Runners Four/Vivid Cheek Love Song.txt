Vivid Cheek Love Song LyricsBaby baby hi five
Baby baby say hi
Little little ones
Mon ami nna
Take my hands now
Walk to where you like
Streets are flowers
Kites are flying by
Winter turns summer
Sense will be hi-fi
Baby baby hi five
Baby baby say hi
Little little ones
Mon ami nna
Mon ami nna
Love, love, love
La, la, la...
Baby, you promise me
You will magic me
Magic me
Promise me
Magic me
Hearts are closer
Sing a song we like
Laugh together
I'll paint your cheek colorfully
Will you like it to be blue, red, or green?Embed
