You Can See LyricsYour legs don't work and you're caught in the light
You can see through the walls so nothing is right
There's a man in the cellar next door
And he's scratching the floor fifty miles away
You didn't know him till today
You're walking home and your heart has been drained
But you're eyes have been newly trained
And the roof is invisible now
It's incredible how you were ever blind
Now you will always find
Rooms are connected
Eyes are perfected
Hey now now hey now now you can see
Something you shouldn't be
Something suddenly free
What will happen now?
If the eyes are too strong
The horizon's too long
I can see I can see
But mama says it's wrong
In the night I'll lose it
It's not right but I'll use it
I can see I can see
As my lungs fill with air
The whole world is laid bare
What will happen to me?
The warning says you can see
You will forever riddleEmbed
