Siriustar LyricsBoom light that fire
Howl, howl, howl
Deergod's eyes
Wild music of the hoof playing in big fire
Boom light that fire
Howl, howl, howl
Lunatic night rises
Sonic of the moon flips them inside out
Glowing slowly
Sonic of the moon lifts us to higher
You got to rouse now
How, how, how?
Be a Sirius star
Nobody's no more fools you to think how
No gabs about them
No, no, no
Open your eyes wide
Breathe sets you free
Count the stars. Be blind to see
Whisper I will seek out
A luminous tonight
Sights are fading
Revive your fire
Now, now, now
We have wolf minds
Knock your door of the minds hard to wake them up
Bark to the moon loud
Shout, shout, shout
Make a wish come true
Glare eternityEmbed
