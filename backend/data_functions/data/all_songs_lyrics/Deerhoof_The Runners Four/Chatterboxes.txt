Chatterboxes LyricsIn pencil lines of ages past
Idea maps were being drawn
Over the world
Storytime in your wildest mind
What a wonderful
Magic animal
Mother to child
Singing a long song
Set sail, seaworthy vessels
Fill your holds with the sounds
Of daughters and sons
Wagging their tongues
Written down in ink so clear
Voices of a yesteryear
Dreams are whispered in an earEmbed
