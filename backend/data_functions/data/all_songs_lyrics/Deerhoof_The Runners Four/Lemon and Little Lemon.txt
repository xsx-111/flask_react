Lemon and Little Lemon LyricsFarmer wins a trophy and hands it to you
The little lemon hides its rind
Sour person's double mind
Who won't let go of you
A troubled team, a little lemon who
Still lives inside of you
The tree won't bend and make the shade
Twenty persons' lemonade
Who want too much from you
A troubled team of little lemons who
Still live inside of you
A little sibling makes the choice for two
Which one was you?
Lemon and little lemon..
Lemon and little lemon
Growing too lowEmbed
