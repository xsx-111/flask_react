Spy on You LyricsSpy on you, spy on you
Follow you, follow you
Spy on you, spy on you
After you, after you
Under investigation
I have your information
Hiding, finding, everywhere
Hiding, finding, always there
Uh oh, shadow
Someone is following, following me
Oh no, shadow
Someone is following, following you
Under investigation
I've got all the informationEmbed
