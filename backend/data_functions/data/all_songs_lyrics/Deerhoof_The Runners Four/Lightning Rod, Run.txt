Lightning Rod, Run LyricsStuck to the roof
Skinny man smiles to the skies and
Waits for a new day
Dots and a dash
Warning flash
Energy surging;
Costly vitality
Lightning rod, run
Lightning rod
Still tied down to the ground
Lightning rod, run
Lightning rod
He sees cracks in the clouds
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run
Run, run, run...Embed
