Willie LyricsHave you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Willie Deadwilder and Rebecca
They knew that they loved one another
Gonna have a real good time
No more sad, sad, bad times
It's all that they've been waiting for
Someone to knock at that door
Willie was shot once in his mind
His cry out saved his own life
The second time was through the heart
The doctors pulled the bullet from inside
He had a job to do, he said
That's his way of life
Please don't bring him down
Please don't let him go
He is on the same side as you
He's just a little bit behind
I tell you there are some people living alone
I tell you there are some people with nowhere to go
There are some people who don't believe in love
Willie and Rebecca proved them all wrong
A man named John wrote a song for me to sing
And the most beautiful flowers I have ever seen
He's a very good man
He has been an even very good man to me
I hope one day his song I will sing
Another love I still love
Familiar face to me
A standing arch above my heart
I've never been to reach
He's laid my head on the bed
And told me sweetie I'm not
Crazy like all the others said
No he's not crazy like me
Please don't bring me down
Please don't let me go
My heart is a worried thing
Memories have planted seeds of a field I now
Want to reap and sow
I'm on the same side as you
I'm just a little bit behind
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him?
Have you seen him? ...Embed
