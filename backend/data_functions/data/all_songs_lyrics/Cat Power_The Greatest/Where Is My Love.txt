Where Is My Love LyricsWhere is my love?
Where is my love?
Horses galloping
Bring him to me
Where is my love?
Where is my love?
Horses running free
Carrying you and me
Where is my love?
Where is my love?
Safe and warm
So close to me
In my arms finally
There is my love
There is my love
Horses galloping
Bringing him to me
Where is my love?
Where is my love?Embed
