Could We LyricsCould we take a walk?
Could we have a talk alone
In the afternoon?
Could we have a seat?
Why, yes, be my guest
You can hold my hand
What a dream in the grass
We kissed, fell in love too fast, too soon
Love full bloom
Should we get up?
Let's wake up, let's get dressed
I'll let you walk me up the street back home
Thank you, it was great
Let's make another date real soon
In the afternoonEmbed
