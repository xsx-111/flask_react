Dreams LyricsDream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
When I feel blue in the night
I want you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away
I need you so that I could die
I love you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
When I feel blue in the night
And I want you to hold me tight
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
I can make you mine
Taste your lips of wine
Anytime night or day
Only trouble is, gee whiz
I'm dreaming my life away
I love you so that I could die
I need you so and that is why
Whenever I want you
All I have to do is dream
Dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dreamEmbed
