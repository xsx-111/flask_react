Love & Communication LyricsLove and communication
You were here for me at this very moment
'Cause I found you on the phone
You called me and you were not hunting me
Learning more and more about less and less and less
On the edge of your seat in some dark movie
Can you memorize the scenes?
They'll be different next week
Can you tell me can you tell can you tell
If there is something better?
'Cause you know there always is
There always is
Drawn to the party like a spider filling up your guts
Don't hate the night with what you shouldn't have
Come along for the ride you just know you should
You just know you should
Can you tell me can you tell can you tell
If there is something better?
'Cause you know there always is
There always is
Hated to see you sad when I left
There's just no good in that but the good part was
That I came at all 'cause I don't venture out
Into the lives of the new
I want you to come along for the ride
How long will you stay?
For your whole life, you just know you should
Can you tell me can you tell can you tell
If there is something better?
'Cause you know there always is
There always is
Love and communication
You were here for me at this very moment
'Cause I found you on the phone
You called me and you were not hunting meEmbed
