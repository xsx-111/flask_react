Hate LyricsAnyone can tell you there's no more road to ride
Everyone will tell you there's no place to hide
There's no laws or rules to unchain your life
But the ones who didn't make it
The ones who couldn't take it
So glad they made it out alive
Everyone loves the fun
Everyone comes by
In the wind I crunch, I want to die
They can give me pills
Or let me drink my fill
The heart wants to explode
Far away where nobody knows
Do you believe she said that?
Do you believe she said that?
I said "I hate myself and I want to die."
Half of it is innocent
The other half is wise
The whole damn thing makes no sense
I wish I could tell you a lie
Hey, come here
Let me whisper in your ear
I hate myself and I want to die
Do you believe she said that?
Can you believe she repeated that?
I said, "I hate me, myself and I"
Said "I hate myself and I want to die "1Embed
