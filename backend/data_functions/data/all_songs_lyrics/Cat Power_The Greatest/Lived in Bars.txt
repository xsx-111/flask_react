Lived in Bars LyricsWe've lived in bars and danced on tables
Hotels, trains, and ships that sail
We swim with sharks and fly with aeroplanes in the air
Send in the trumpets, the marching wheelchairs
Open the blankets and give them some air
Swords and arches, bones and cement
The light and the dark of the innocent of man
We know your house so very well
And we will wake you once we've walked up all of your stairs
There's nothing like living in a bottle
And nothing like ending it all for the world
We're so glad you have come back
Every living lion will lay in your lap
The kid has a homecoming! The champion, the whores!
Who's gonna play drums, guitar, or organ with chorus?
As far as we've walked from both of ends of sand
Never have we caught a glimpse of this man
We know your house so very well
And we will bust down your door if you're not there
We've lived in bars and danced on tables
Hotels, trains, and ships that sail
We swim with sharks and fly with aeroplanes out of here
Out of here
Out of here
Out of here
Out of hereEmbed
