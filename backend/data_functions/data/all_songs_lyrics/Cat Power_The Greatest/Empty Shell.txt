Empty Shell LyricsAll that is left is an empty shell
Of my heart that is crushed
I don't never wanna see
What my mind has seen
When you loved me
Every night, every night alone with you
Every night, alone now
When she sits on your lap
Try to pretend to laugh
When she does stupid things
Just like I used to do
Do not hate her
Don't you even try
For to leave her is to love her
The same as you and I
I love you
And I miss you too
I really do love you
And I really do miss you too
But I don't know you
And I don't need you
And I don't want you anymore
Every night, every night alone with you
Every night, alone nowEmbed
