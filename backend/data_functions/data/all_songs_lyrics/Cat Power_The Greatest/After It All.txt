After It All LyricsAfter it all
When it's said and done
Will you come back to me
Tell me that it
Never was up to you or up to me
When you stand up so tall
With your back to me up against the wall
You make demands with your angry hands
You say you're sorry that you
Didn't mean to scream you say
You're back again that you still love me
And that you never meant what you said to me
Should I believe what you're telling me
To wait for you
Was all I could do
To have you back with me so peacefully
You broke your back
You left your scratch
Then you came back to me
Just to get some sleep
After it all
When it's said and done
Will you come back to me
Tell me that
It never was up to you or up to me
Back to me
Never was
Back to me
Said and done
Never was
Back to me
Never was
Back to meEmbed
