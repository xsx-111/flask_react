Islands LyricsI want to rule the islands
And I want to rule the sea
But if you're not coming back
I will sleep eternally
And I want no heavy diamonds
And pearls crush my teeth
I just want my sailor
To sail back to me
Captain has a treasure
He says I hold the key
But old mangroves and sweet winds blow songs
To you and me
I want to rule the islands
And I want to rule the sea
But if you're not coming back
I will sleep eternallyEmbed
