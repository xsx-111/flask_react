Last Day Sunday LyricsThe day I died, it was the best day of my life
And when you cried, it made me feel so good inside
I will leave my insecurities to the ones who always doubted me
I just spent my last day, Sunday
Last Sunday
I'm satisfied, I knew that I could not survive
And when you cried, I felt it on the other side
I will leave my insecurities to the ones who always doubted me
I just spent my last day, Sunday
Last Sunday
Sing my praises now that I'm away
Don't wipe your feet on me like you did on my last day, Sunday
I'm satisfied, I knew that I could not survive
And when you cried, I felt it on the other side
I will leave my insecurities to the ones who always doubted me
I just spent my last day, Sunday
Last SundayEmbed
