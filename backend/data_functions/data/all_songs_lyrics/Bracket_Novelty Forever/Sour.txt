Sour LyricsKeep me sanitized
Leave me sterilized
Give me all the blame
So I can be ashamed
I don't know how
Just cleanse me now
Leave a sour taste in my mouth!!
Cut me down to size
Tell me a white lie
I just wanna land
In the palm of your hand
I don't know how
Just cleanse me now
Leave a sour taste in my mouth!!
Aaah
Yeah!!
Crying....
Fighting....
Trying....
To be sweet
Cut me down to size
Tell me a white lie
Give me all the blame
So I can be ashamed
I don't know how
Just cleanse me now
Leave a sour taste in my
Leave a sour taste in my
Leave a sour taste in my mouth!!Embed
