Three Gardens LyricsRestful Garden, take my sweat and plant it in the ground
Restful Garden, take my life and turn it upside down
When it starts getting old
I'll stop doing what I'm told
When I start growing old
Secret Garden, take my secret, tell it to someone
Secret Garden, you're to blame for all the things I've done
When it starts getting old
I'll stop doing what I'm told
When I start growing old
Rain
Selfish Garden, take what you want like you always do
Selfish Garden, take some comfort knowing I need you
When it starts getting old
I'll stop doing what I'm told
When I start growing old
