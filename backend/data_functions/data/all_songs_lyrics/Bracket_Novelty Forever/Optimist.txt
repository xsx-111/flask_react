Optimist LyricsMy inside's turning outside
My upside has no downside
My bright side has no dark side
Trace my silver lining
Erase my silver lining
My black cloud turns to sunshine
My disease makes me feel fine
I don't mind standing in time
Trace my silver lining
Erase my silver lining
Smile with me
Trace my silver lining
Erase my silver lining
Paint my silver lining
Save my silver lining
Smile with meEmbed
