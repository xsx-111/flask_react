The Evil Bean LyricsI'll fill you in on my philosophy
Can't wait to tell you about life's tragedies
And the coffee bean will burn inside of me
We can take a walk to the coffee shop and bitch about life for a while
Read me a book, enlighten me to death
Show me your espresso dreams when you're depressed
And the coffee bean will burn inside of me
We can take a walk to the coffee shop and bitch about life for a while
It's OK. I'm awake. And it seems like I've been that way for a week
I'm all right. Say good night. If you wake me up I'll never go to sleep
Twenty-six years old, I'm feeling sixty-five
One drink from your cup I'll prove that I'm alive
And the coffee bean will burn inside of me
We can take a walk to the coffee shop and bitch about life for a whileEmbed
