Drama Queen LyricsHearsay, there say. Conversation is wearing through
Crying too loud my temper's turning black and blue
I will digest your flattery, then starve to death
I should ingest recovery and silence
I have my say, I want my way, I must be seen
And will you please stop calling me the Drama Queen
Breathing image, I'm out of breath from walking proud
Your compliment is taken well and taken loud
My misery worn on my sleeve, fashion statement
You can't believe I can't relieve my resentment
I have my say, I want my way, I must be seen
And will you please stop calling me the Drama Queen
What did I say (4x)
I will digest your flattery, then starve to death
I should ingest recovery and silence
I have my say, I want my way, I must be seen
And will you please stop calling me the Drama QueenEmbed
