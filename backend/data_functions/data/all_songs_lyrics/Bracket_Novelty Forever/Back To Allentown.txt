Back To Allentown LyricsI wish I could make it back to Allentown
Maybe I can get someone to show me around
You were right, I was wrong
I've been this way for far too long
You hate me, I love you
Show me a place where I belong
I wish I could make it back to Allentown
Maybe I can get someone to push me around
You were right, I was wrong
I've been this way for far too long
You hate me, I love you
Show me a place where I belong
You don't matter as much as you think
Or much at all
And when you become extinct
I'll watch you fall
I wish I could make it back to Allentown
Maybe I can get someone to push you around
You were right, I was wrong
I've been this way for far too long
You hate me, I love you
Show me a place where I belongEmbed
