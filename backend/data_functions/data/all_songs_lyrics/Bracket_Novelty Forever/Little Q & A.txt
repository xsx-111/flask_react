Little Q & A LyricsI've taken what was free and saved it all for me
Lost in sobriety
I try to throw it all away
I can't seem to breathe my morning breath
Terrified of playing dead
The sunset watches me instead
Too tired, to retire. Too tired, to retire
Don't keep me in suspense by laying motionless
Just treat me like the rest

Please don't answer my questions now
I don't want to know
Please don't question my answers now
Wait until tomorrow
