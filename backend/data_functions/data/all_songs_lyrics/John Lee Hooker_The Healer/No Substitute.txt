No Substitute LyricsI wanna tell you a true story
The facts of life
'cause I know all about it
'cause I been through it a many times
Ain't no substitute, there's no substitute
Substitute for love
When your woman gone
There's nothin' else can
Can take her place
But there's no substitute, substitute for love
No, no
Love will make you gamble
Love will make you drink
Make you stay out all night long
Lookin' for love
But there's no, no substitute
Substitute, substitute for love
I wanna tell you a story
True, true, true story about love
Many times, many times, over 'n over, over in life
So many people have tried, tried, to get a substitute
An' it just don't work, work on love
You may not be good looking
You may not be so fine
But love, love, love love, love, love
Is a burning thing
It's a burning thing
I know, I know, I know, I know
I been down, down, in a ring of fire
Lookin' for a love
I couldn't find, I couldn't find a substitute
Uh, for love, for love, I cried, cried
I cried, cried but it just wasn't there
Just wasn't thereEmbed
