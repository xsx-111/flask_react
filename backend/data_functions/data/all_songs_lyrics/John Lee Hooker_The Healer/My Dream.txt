My Dream LyricsDreamin', of the day, in the past
I had a dream, last night
Dream, of you, in the past, me and you
I dream, we're back together again
Me and you, me and you, in the past
My dream. my dream
I wished, I wished
It was true, was true
My dream, dream, of you
In the past, were back together, again
Had a dream, had a dream
'bout me, an' me an' you, me an' you
Together, again
When I opened my eyes
And looked over in my bed
Ha, ha, you, you was not there
You were only a dream, in the past, in the past
Woo
Dream a dream, in the past
I had a dream
We were together, again
