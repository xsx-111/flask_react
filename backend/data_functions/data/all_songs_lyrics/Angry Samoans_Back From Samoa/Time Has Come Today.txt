Time Has Come Today LyricsI have to roam
I've got no home
My mind is blown
The truth is unknown
Time has come
Time has come today
Time has come
Time has come today
I have no place to stay
Thinkin' about the subway
The rules have changed today
This world is blown away
Time has come
Time has come today
Time has come
Time has come today
I have no home
I have no home
I have no home
No place to run
I'm staring at the sun
Thinkin' 'bout the subway
This world is blown away
Time has come
Time has come today
Time has comeEmbed
