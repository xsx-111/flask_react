Not of This Earth LyricsStrange being in a distant land
I look up, there's a hole in my hand
And it really hurts
Bend down, look at the curse
I'm not of this Earth
Three knocks on my door
Come in, I don't care what for
I need blood, can barely breathe
I'll buy your vacuum, but you'll never leave
'Cause I'll put your head in a milk bottle
Bend down, look at the curse
I'm not of this Earth
Step down, look at the curse
I'm not of this EarthEmbed
