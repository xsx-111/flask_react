Homo-Sexual Lyrics(Homosexual!)
Screw your wife in the behind
Tell your kids you're doing fine
Goddamn no-good stupid liar
Suckin' dick, your pants on fire
(Homosexual) Up the ass
(Homosexual) Make it last
(Homosexual) Jerk me off
(Homosexual) Go get lost
Found out that your dad was gay
Living life a brand new way
 through Howard Hughes
 then the Jews
(Homosexual) We love you
(Homosexual) Things you do
(Homosexual) Kill Dan White
(Homosexual) Was it right?
Don't like boys, you like girls
Living in your faggot world
Talking shop with lawyers' wives
Sneaking out to meet the guys
(Homosexual) I'm ashamed
(Homosexual) That's your name
(Homosexual) Where's the blame?
(Homosexual) I can't explain
(Homosexual) We love you
(Homosexual) Up the ass
(Homosexual) Darby Crash
(Homosexual) Make it lastEmbed
