Steak Knife LyricsSteak knife, there's a hole in my head
Steak knife, you're gonna be dead
Steak knife, it's a heavy change
Steak knife, say goodbye to my brain
There's a hole, there's a hole in my heart
Dick hurts, chop it apart
Fuckin' sheep, I'm on the rag
They got my balls in a plastic bag
I think I need a doctor to look inside my head
Every time I love a girl, I stab her in my bed
I see my life in visions crimson shape
I see my life in Hell
There's no escape
There's a hole, there's a hole in my heart
My head hurts, chop it apart
Steak knife, there's a hole in my head
Steak knife, you're gonna be dead
Steak knife, it's a heavy change
