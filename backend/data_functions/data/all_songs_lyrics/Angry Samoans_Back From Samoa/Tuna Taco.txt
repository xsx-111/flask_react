Tuna Taco LyricsGo to school, I have no friends
I cannot find a book I've read
Field day full of worms
Take a peek, it's not your turn
Tell it to your sisters pass
The taco smell is on your hand
Home from school, where's the head
Because my thoughts with the dead
Hit my head, hit my head
Hit my head upside the bed
Tuna taco 'round the bend
I think I'll take the bus insteadEmbed
