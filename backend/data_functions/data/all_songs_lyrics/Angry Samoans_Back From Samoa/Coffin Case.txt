Coffin Case LyricsCoffin case 'round and 'round
Another body can't be found
Coffin case just for you
Turn you into Elmer's glue
Jump back, get down
It's time to move
He's black, downtown
He's in the groove
Get lost, your cost
You're such a joke
The world keeps going 'round and 'round
Your ash is up in smoke
This is life, no excuse
Your body has no use
Open up, throw it in
 waiting to begin
Coffin case, my new plan
To join the living dead
