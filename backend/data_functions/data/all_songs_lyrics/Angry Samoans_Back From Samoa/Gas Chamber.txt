Gas Chamber LyricsGas chamber
Where's the light?
Stay at home
Just don't feel right
I'm in my room
All the time
Trapped inside
This twisted mind
Gas chamber
Cannot breathe
Time for lunch
I cannot leave
In my room
All the time
I'm trapped inside
This fucking mind
No action
No, no!
No action
Gas chamber
No!
No action!Embed
