Lights Out LyricsThere's nothing more you can leave behind
So forget about seeing, get into your mind
Everything looks better when the world is black
Grab a fork, make your first attack
Lights out
Poke, poke, poke your eyes out
Lights out
Put a pen in your hand, poke your eyes out
I can't see too well, what's it all about?
Well, I dunno man, did you poke your eyes out?
Sure thing, I did it today
It's time to get hip to the lights out way
Lights out
Poke, poke, poke your eyes out
Lights out
Let 'em drop on the floor, roll all about
If you poke too far, you reach the front of your brain
Fork in your mind, drive you insane
Don't worry much, just let 'er rip
Donate your eyeballs to the lights out trip
Lights out
Put a pen in your hand, poke your eyes out
Lights out
Poke, poke, poke your eyes out
Lights out
Put an ax in your head, poke your eyes outEmbed
