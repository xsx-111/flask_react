To Lose My Life Lyrics
He said to lose my life or lose my love
That's the nightmare I've been running from
So let me hold you in my arms a while
I was always careless as a child
And there's a part of me that still believes
My soul will soar above the trees
But a desperate fear flows through my blood
That a dead love's buried beneath the mud

Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
Let's grow old together
And die at the same time

I said, "I've got no time, I have to go"
And I was more right than I will ever know
He said, "My heart is fate", well mine's regret
And left him crying next to the chapels steps

Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
He said
Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
Let's grow old together
And die at the same time
He said
He said to lose my life or lose my love
That's the nightmare I've been running from
So let me hold you in my arms a while (Let's grow old together)
I was careless as a child (And die at the same time)
And there's a part of me that still believes (Let's grow old together)
My soul will soar above the trees (And die at the same time, he said)
A desperate fear flows through my blood (Let's grow old together)
Our dead love's buried beneath the mud (And die at the same time)
A desperate fear flows through my blood (Let's grow old together)
Our dead love's buried beneath the mud (And die at the same time)5Embed
