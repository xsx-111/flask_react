Taxidermy Lyrics
Hang me up on your wall, above the coal fire
Keep your promises, keep your promises
Hang me up on your wall
You're such a cold liar, do what your father says
What your father says
I still remember your voice, it turns my blood cold
The kids are fast asleep, keep them fast asleep
Your soul still haunts these walls, like Taxidermy

There's no kiss of life's, no baby don't pretend
With your heart in your throat and a gun to your head
You can burn the money in the fireplace
You keep on telling white lies to the little kids
I think it's time they knew just what it means to live
You can burn your parents in the fireplace

I saw you run from the cold, out of my arms
Your mother cried for years, she cried for years
I saw you run through the cold, put ice in my heart
Now tell me all your fears, I'll be your greatest fear
You couldn't cut the smile from my face
Cause we're so proud today, we're so proud today
Our eyes will haunt these walls, like Taxidermy
There's no kiss of life's, no baby don't pretend
With your heart in your throat and a gun to your head
You can burn the money in the fireplace
You keep on telling white lies to the little kids
I think it's time they knew just what it means to live
Now burn your parents in the fireplaceEmbed
