Black Song Lyrics
I can't think straight
I've been thinking in love triangles and vicious circles
Is it the same as before?
And I said I could never lie to you but you know I always do
Is it the same as before?

And misery's like a hearse, cos you know where you're going
There's crowds at the windows, but no way of knowing
Who they've got this time, and who's going next
She always leaves a letter, and signs off with an X

I can't think straight
I've been thinking in love triangles and vicious circles
Is it the same as before?
And I said I could never lie to you but you know I always do
Is it the same as before?

And misery's like a hearse, cos I know where you're going
The waves getting higher, and I'm tired of rowing
She whispers in my ear, sings the cold black song
Hold me a while longer, she won't be gone for long
And fetch the car girl, I think it's time we got out of here
No brakes into the night
And with sadness my mistress
And with God as my witness
Just drive till it gets lightEmbed
