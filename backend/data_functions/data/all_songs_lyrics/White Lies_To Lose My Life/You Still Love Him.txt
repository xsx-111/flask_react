You Still Love Him Lyrics
I heard an angel's voice, singing in quiet prayer
It seemed to pull my heart, slowly straight up the stairs
I spent that night awake, though you lay fast asleep
I saw a teardrop fall, gently down your cheek

You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you

I crept out of the house, and tip-toed to your room
But found your body gone, and left was just a hollow tomb
I think that love's like falling into the deepest sleep
I wake and try to move again but find my body's rendered weak
I feel that trust's like walking down a railroad track
There's ghosts out in the square tonight screaming, "I want my money back"

You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you


You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away (Far away!)
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you (Far away!)
You still love him but she does too
She'll take him far away from you1Embed
