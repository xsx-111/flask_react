Death Lyrics
I love the feeling when we lift off
Watching the world so small below
I love the dreaming when I think of
The safety in the clouds out my window
I wonder what keeps us so high up
Could there be love beneath these wings?
If we suddenly fall, should I scream out?
Or keep very quiet and cling to
My mouth as I'm crying
So frightened of dying
"Relax," yes, I'm trying
But fear's got a hold on me

Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me

I love the quiet of the nighttime
When the sun has drowned in a deathly sea
I can feel my heart beating as I speed from
The sense of time catching up with me
The sky set out like a pathway
But who decides which route we take?
As people drift into a dreamworld
I close my eyes as my hands shake
And will I see a new day?
Who's driving this anyway?
I picture my own grave
'Cause fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me

Floating neither up or down
I wonder when I hit the ground
Will the earth beneath my body shake
And cast your sleeping hearts awake?
Could it tremble stars from moonlit skies?
Could it drag a tear from your cold eyes?
I'll live on the right side and sleep on the left
Thatâ€™s why everything's got to be love or death

Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me
Yes, this fear's got a hold on me4Embed
