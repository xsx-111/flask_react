A Place to Hide Lyrics
Could I sit alone and ask about my future?
When you replied I'd just turn away
I've been searching through my books to try and find some truth
Perhaps disguise is a mysterious way?
And if I made a promise
Could I stay by your side?
Would you guarantee my safety?
And say that I'd be alright?

But if Judgement Day had started tonight
At least I'd know I was right
And I'd be laughing at the end of the world
Take my hand tonight, I think we'll be alright, girl

And I can see it on the TV
There's an air attack
People on the mountains
Screaming I'll be back
And I'm banging on your door
So come on and let me in
Need a place to hide
I need a place to hide before the storm begins
If I told you all the times when I'd done wrong
Could you bathe my soul and wash it all away?
I can't forgive the things that I can still remember
So I think, my friend, these sins are here to stay
And I could make a promise
With a tear in my eye
And all the hope in my heart
But all the doubt in my mind

And if Judgement Day had started tonight
At least I'd know I was right
And I'd be laughing at the end of the world
But take my hand tonight, I think we'll be alright, girl

And I can see it on the TV
There's an air attack
People on the mountains
Screaming I'll be back
And I'm banging on your door
So come on and let me in
Need a place to hide
I need a place to hide before the storm begins
Before the storm begins
Before the storm begins
Before the storm begins
I need a place to hide before the storm begins1Embed
