Unfinished Business Lyrics
Just give me a second, darling, to clear my head
Just put down those scissors, baby, on this single bed
The sand in the hour glass is running low
I came through thunder, the cold wind, the rain, and the snow
To find you awake by your windowsill
A sight for sore eyes and a view to kill

I broke down in horror at you standing there
The glow from the moon shone through cracks in your hair
I shouted with passion, "I love you so much"
But feeling my skin, it was cold to the touch
You whispered, "Where are you?", I questioned your doubt
But soon realised you're talking to God now

You've got blood on your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
But there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to

I looked in the mirror but something was wrong
I saw you behind but my reflection was gone
There was smoke in the fireplace as white as the snow
A voice beckoned gently, "Now it's time to go"
A requiem played as you begged for forgiveness
"Don't touch me", I screamed, "I've got unfinished business"
You got blood on your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
But there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to
You got blood on your hands and I know it's mine
I just need more time
So get off your low, let's dance like we used to
But there's a light in the distance, waiting for me
I will wait for you
So get off your low, let's kiss like we used to3Embed
