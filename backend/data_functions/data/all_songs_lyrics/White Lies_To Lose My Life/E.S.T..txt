E.S.T. Lyrics
If you tell me to jump then I'll die
In my dreams I'm there
I always hoped that I'd learn how to fly
In my dreams I'm there
You can tie my hands to the walls
But you can't tie my dreams to this place
I might fall like a rock from your heart
But you won't see me fall from grace

Fate always loses hope
Like electric sparks in my heart
Fate always loses hope
Now be a good girl and do what you're told

If you tell me to jump then I'll die
In my dreams I'm there
I always hoped that I'd learn how to fly
In my dreams I'm there
I leave my memoirs in blood on the floor
And my fears with the nurse on the stairs
I'm only going where you'll be some day
So don't say rest in peace in your prayers
Fate always loses hope
Like electric sparks in my heart
Fate always loses hope
Now be a good girl and do what you're told

I hope you remember me
I hope you never pretend for me
I hope you remember me
I hope you...

Fate always loses hope
Like electric sparks in my heart
Fate always loses hope
Now be a good girl and do what you're told

I hope you remember me
I hope you never pretend for me
I hope you remember me
I hope you never forget about me...
I hope you remember me
I hope you never pretend for me
I hope you remember me
I hope you....1Embed
