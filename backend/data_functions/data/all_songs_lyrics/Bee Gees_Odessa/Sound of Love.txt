Sound of Love LyricsSee the children play the ball
See them play along the hall
It makes me cry to see them smile
I see the moon; I see the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And there's no one to share my life
I need a life to go my way
So every night I pray
Just give me someone for my life
I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And there's one thing I never found
The sound of love
See the old man walk the lane
See him walk along in pain
It makes me cry to see them smile
I watch the moon; I watch the sky
I see reflections in my eyes
And there's no one to share my life
I need a life to go my way
So every night I pray
Just give me someone for my life
I feel a clown
People try to play me down
And there's one thing I never found
The sound of love
The sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of love
Everybody loves the sound of loveEmbed
