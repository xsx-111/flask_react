Odessa (City on the Black Sea) Lyrics
Fourteenth of February, eighteen-ninety-nine
The British ship Veronica was lost without a sign
Baa baa, black sheep, you haven't any wool
Captain Richardson left himself a lonely wife in Hull

Cherub, I lost the ship in the Baltic Sea
I'm on an iceberg running free
Sitting, filing this berg to the shape of a ship
Sailing my way back to your lips
One passing ship gave word that
You have moved out of your old flat
You love the Vicar more then words can say
Tell him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again

Odessa
How strong am I?
Odessa
How time goes by

Treasure, you know the neighbors that live next door
They haven't got their dog anymore
Freezing, sailing around in the North Atlantic
Can't seem to leave the sea anymore
I just can't understand
Why you just moved to Finland
You love that Vicar more then words can say
Ask him to pray that I won't melt away
And I'll see your face again
Odessa
How strong am I?
Odessa
How time goes by

Fourteenth of February, eighteen-ninety-nine
The British ship Veronica was lost without a signEmbed
