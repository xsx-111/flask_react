Give Your Best LyricsIt's a square dance Mr Marshall
It's a square dance on the floor
It's a square dance Mr Perkins
It's a square dance to be sure, to be sure
Everybody, grab partners
I'm just a clown that used to run around
I used to have a million friends
I used to start where everybody ends
But I just give my best to my friends
I've done my shows. Everybody knows
I nearly sold all my clothes
One man can give; another has to lend
So I just give my best to my friends
And so you should
And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends
I'm just a clown that used to run around
I used to have a million friends
I used to start where everybody ends
So I just give my best to my friends
And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends
And when you think that your life isn't right
You know the day isn't always like night
You've had your peace now it's time for you to fight
Just give your best to your friends
Just give your best to your friendsEmbed
