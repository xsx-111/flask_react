Black Diamond Lyrics
Where are you? I love you
Where are you? I love you
Where are you to keep me warm?

I had a dream of a place far away
I followed a river where the dead man would play
And I'm leaving in the morning
And I'm leaving in the morning

And I won't die, so don't cry, I'll be home
Those big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea

I knew a man, who was tall as the sky
Followed a river where thousands had died
And he was leaving in the morning
Oh no, he was leaving in the morning

Said, if I come home and my woman has flown
Oh, big black diamonds that lie there for me
By the tall white mountains which lie by the sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syne
Say goodbye to auld lang syneEmbed
