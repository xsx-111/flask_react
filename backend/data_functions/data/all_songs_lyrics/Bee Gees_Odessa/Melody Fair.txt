Melody Fair Lyrics
Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign

Melody fair won't you comb your hair
You can be beautiful too
Melody fair , remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

Who is the girl at the window pane
Watching the rain falling down
Melody, life isn't like the rain
Its just like a merry go round

Melody fair won't you comb your hair
You can be beautiful too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girl

Who is the girl with the crying face
Looking at millions of signs
She knows that life is a running race
Her face shouldn't show any sign
Melody fair won't you comb your hair
You can be beautiful too
Melody fair, remember you're only a woman
Melody fair, remember you're only a girlEmbed
