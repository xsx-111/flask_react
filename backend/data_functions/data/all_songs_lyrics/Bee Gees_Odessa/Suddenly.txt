Suddenly Lyrics
How can you tell by looking at me?
How can you tell you like what you see?
Suddenly there's a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly there's a girl in the rain alone

How can you tell humans are real?
How can you tell you like what you feel?
Suddenly there's a girl in your heart, oh boy
Suddenly there's a boy in your heart, oh boy

Ah...

How can you tell by looking at me?
How can you tell you like what you see?
Suddenly there's a boy in the rain alone
Suddenly there's a girl in the rain alone
