Whisper, Whisper Lyrics
Whisper, whisper, what have you got?
I've got something that you need a lot
Stop me and buy one
You can see better, but you better not
Listen, mister, can you help me?
It's my sister, show her how to fly
Stop me and try one
You can see everything blowing by

Whisper, whisper, keep it quiet
If you like it you can try it too
Stop me and buy one
I am illegal, that means so are you
Whisper, whisper, what have you got?
I've got something that you need a lot
Stop me and buy one
You can see better, but you better not

Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper
Whisper, whisper, whisper, whisper

I am man and you are woman
Who needs marriage? We are humans all
If I could please you, arouse and ease you
Then it would please you if I should call
Doesn't matter what your name is
I can do a million things to you
No explanations, sexual patience
Most of the nation's doing it too
No, no, no
No, noEmbed
