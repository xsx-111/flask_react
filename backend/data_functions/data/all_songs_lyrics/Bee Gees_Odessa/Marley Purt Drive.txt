Marley Purt Drive LyricsSunday morning, woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the head and looked in the glass just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
That's how they are, so I grabbed out the car, convertible fifty-nine
Headed to the freeway, tried to find the Pasadena sign
Ten miles and three quarters, I wasn't feeling any more alive
'cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
I used to be a minstrel free
With a whole lot of bread in my bag
I used to feel that my life was real, but the good Lord threw me a snag
Now I'm gonna be the same as me, no matter how I try
'Cause with fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Fifteen kids and a family on the skids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Turned 'round the car and headed for home
I guess I realized my fate
Ten miles and three quarters more, I pulled up outside the gate
Twenty more kids were stood inside and that made thirty-five
'Cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
Sunday morning woke up yawning, filled the pool for a swim
Pulled down the glass and looked in the mirror just to see if I was in
Went up the stairs and kissed my woman to make her come alive
'cause with an orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday drive
An orphanage full of thirty-five kids
I got to go for a Sunday driveEmbed
