Never Say Never Again LyricsYour lips could never show a smile
You never tried you just put me in a file
I never lived inside your hole, child
I thought you needed me I never had no style
Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye; I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again
Your eyes could never show a grin
You never tried you just put me in a tin
I never lived inside your hole child
You know I needed you
And look at the shape I'm in
Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again
Your lips could never show a smile
You never tried you just put me in a file
I never lived inside your hole child
I thought you needed me
I never had no style
Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
Never say never say never again
You said goodbye I declared war on Spain
Never say never say never againEmbed
