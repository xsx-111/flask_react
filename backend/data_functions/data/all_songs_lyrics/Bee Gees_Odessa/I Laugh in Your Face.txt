I Laugh in Your Face Lyrics
The circus is coming to see you
The elephant smiles
Everybody can hear you
Say that's out of style

My brother is friendly for reasons
If I am the same
Just for four hundred seasons
We all live in rain

So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

I'll pull out your plugs, so you're small
You'll slide down the drain
On the steps of St. Peter's
You all look the same
So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm right

The circus is coming to see you
The elephant smiles
Everybody can hear you
Say that's out of style

So I laugh in your face
You're only one race
Yes, I laugh in your face
And I'm right
You lie just like the rest
But there's nobody best
So I laugh in your face
And I'm rightEmbed
