The Vampire LyricsShall I tell you of the night
It was long ago
Late November and the snow
Just about to fall
And the moon was big and bright
Cold and sharp and clear
And the air was biting
Softly, swiftly down the road -
Never made a sound-
Someone came from far away
Someone tall and old
As I looked into his eyes
No reflections came
And I gave him bedding
Oh my little rosary
How I miss you so
Never used you very well
Now I never will
I am farther from you now
Than the two ends of Eternity
Now I do his biddingEmbed
