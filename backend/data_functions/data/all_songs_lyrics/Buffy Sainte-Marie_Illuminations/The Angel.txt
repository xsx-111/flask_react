The Angel LyricsCome now, and now my love
And leave your dying desert to the rains give up your treasured wounds
Let go the tempting memory of the pain
Give up the vows you've taken
And you will live, and you will learn to fly away
And you will fly
And you will live my love
And see the stars regain your starless night
And you will find your sun
And learn the magic meaning of it's light
All souls will be yours to cherish
Rising, falling, in their earthly flight
And you will fly
And i would love my love
And he would seek a refuge in my eyes
But no resource of love
Could keep him from the fire where loving dies
And i would reach out my hand as he was
Falling, falling to his home on high
And he would fly
Give up your treasured wounds
Let go the tempting memory of the pain
Give up the vows you've taken
And you will live
And you will learn to fly again
And you will flyEmbed
