Mary LyricsYonder I see a star
Oh see how bright it's burning
Joseph my time is come
The Son of God is yearning
To come, to come
Ask the man for some room to spare
And a candle dimly burning
Joseph my time is come
The Son of God is yearning
To come, to come
Pain of birth is surely great
And yet my fate's been told me
Do I see an Angel bright
Descending to behold me
He comes, he comes, he comesEmbed
