Better to Find Out for Yourself Lyrics
Every little baby that's ever been born, been spanked and made to cry
Every young woman that's ever been loved, been shaken and made to sigh
Every young woman that's ever been loved has told me, told me true
"Take his heart and run away as he would do to you"
Every young man I've ever seen been mean as he could be
Every last one, I've loved and run as he would do to me
Take it from me that a man can be more trouble than you'll ever know
He'll love you some and when he's done, he'll laugh and let you go

So they told me and they told me little else
But I tell you, better to find out for yourself

Handsome stride and shoulders wide disguise a heart of stone
Lovers' wiles and tender smiles are better left alone
With his head hung low and his shoulders down and a tear in the bottom of his shoe
He'll beg and tease and vow on his knees and then betray you, true
He'll say, "I'm tired, I'm broke, I'm sick, I love you," while he cries
He'll say I'm sorry through his tears and all the time he lies
Shudder and sulk when he's at his best, try one if you will
You can have mine and all the rest, you know I've had my fill

So they told me and they told me little else
But I tell you, better to find out for yourselfEmbed
