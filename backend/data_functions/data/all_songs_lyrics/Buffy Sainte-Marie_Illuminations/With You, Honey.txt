With You, Honey LyricsIt's about your potty mouth
And the way you stand
It's about your steady eyes
And your steady hand
May you never miss a beat
Do you, honey
Hey you're just so honey sweet
Yes sir, honey
Hey they say you're kind of weird
With your baggy clothes
And your heavy hair hang down
Heaven only knows
Disco ball and pointed hat
Magic signs and things like that
Yes sir, honey
It's about your honesty
In a sense of Satan
It's about your perfect love
And your perfect hating
Honey, honey long and tall
Coming like a cannon ball
What a pleasure just to fall
With you, honey
Honey, honey
Its about your magic name
Frills and chills and shivers
Its about your slanty eyes
And how you do it better
Take me to your teepee (?)
Have me, honey, take me down
What a pleasure just to brown
With you, honeyEmbed
