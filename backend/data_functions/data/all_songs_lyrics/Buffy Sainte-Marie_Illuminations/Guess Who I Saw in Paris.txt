Guess Who I Saw in Paris LyricsLa da da da da da
La da da da da da
Guess who I saw in Paris
Guess who I saw in Paris
Standing in the street with his thumbs hooked in his belt
Standing with his thumbs hooked in his belt
Standing in the street with his thumbs hooked in his belt
Looking all of seventeen
Guess who invited him up to her room
Guess who made him some tea
Guess who got spaced with him, played his guitar
Guess who fell asleep on his arm
Guess who got lost in his eyes
Guess who kissed him goodnight
Guess who phoned me up this morning while I was still asleep
Not like waking up at all
La da da da da da
Been dreaming of
La da da da da da
La da da da da da1Embed
