The Dream Tree LyricsLo how the dream tree is sighing and shaking
Pretty dreams fall down on thee
Oh how my poor heart is crying and aching
Longing for one who is longing for me
I'll sit at home with a light in the window
Back to the fire and eyes to the sea
I'll sit at home with my hand on the cradle
Rocking the love he has given to me
Long are the hours and long is the waiting
Many the candle to stand and be burned
Women of whalers and women of sailors
Soon learn the meaning of worry and yearn
Women sing their songs of
Safe returning for their men
Let him only, one day, some day
Touch my hair again
Lo how the dream tree is sighing and shaking
Pretty dreams fall down on thee
Oh how my poor heart is crying and aching
Longing for one who is longing for meEmbed
