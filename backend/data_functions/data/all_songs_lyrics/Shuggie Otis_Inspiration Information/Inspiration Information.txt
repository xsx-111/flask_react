Inspiration Information Lyrics
We had a rainy day
I'm in a sneak-back situation
Here's a pencil pad
I'm gonna spread some information

You making me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be heavier
'Cause I am happier
When I make you

In my little sinfonia
(Singing blue Anna)
I get a dark blue ring
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I get a snapback raincoat
(Fourth of blue yonder)
I get a purple sting
('cos he is in tune)
Beside the whistle cat
(Singing the hour)
Along the frosty roadside
(Always in time)
I get another ring
(Making me happy)
That'll take me for another ride
(Up in the sky)
Oh, haven't you seen her?
(Riding by, she knows the high)

You making me happier
Now I am snappier
While I'm with you
I got to be heavier
'Cause I am happier
When I make you

Inside a dream storm
(Dreaming in and out of style)
Upon an eight o'clock sit down
(Dreaming for the other half so I can get on down)
Out in the country field, smiling
(Smiling, laughing, jumping fun)
I feel the love of a pretty sun
(Shining on me)

Laughing, having fun
Dreaming, laughing, smiling, having fun
Laughing, smiling, loving, get on down
Smiling, loving, burning, get on down2Embed
