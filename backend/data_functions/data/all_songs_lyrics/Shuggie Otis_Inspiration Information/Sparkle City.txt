Sparkle City LyricsSun is up and greets with a grin
Let me know that I was in
Go outside with a smile on my face
Jump in my car and leave this place
I heard all the news
There is no offer that I wouldn't refuse
Now come time for me to run
Sorry, people, but I'm not the one
So I think I have to split a match and think about it
I'm on the run for fun, don't have to shout it
Just like I'm never in the Saturdays around it
Try calling when you think that you found it
Enjoying all the sites throughout the ride
Let my cheer be my guide
Come 7 p.m, I wanna brighten up the city
Some crystal clean here and I swear it's a pity
City sparkle, flashing twilight
Just like a big daydream in the middle of night
Smooth jumping fun as I head uptown
Going on second tonight
I said, this time I take time the place may be done
Arriving at my destination
Never know worries or frustrations
Cool as I want, in a easy chair
Happy just to know that I'm gonna be there
