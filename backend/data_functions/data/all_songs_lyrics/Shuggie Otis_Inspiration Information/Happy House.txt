Happy House Lyrics
It's a happy house
In the summertime
I gotta get there
I gotta take a ride
To the happy house

Happy time for occasions
Checked out, no limitations

Just a-smile a mile
And a smile for me
From you
And your momma too
Just a-finally kind
Of another time
Down the road a bit
I been walkin' it

Happy House
Ok, recording
Here I go again
Shots roll all the way
To the happy houseEmbed
