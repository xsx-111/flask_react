Afterglow (Live) LyricsLike the dust, that settles all around me
I must find a new home, home
The ways and holes that, used to give me shelter
They're are all as one to me now
Oh but I, I would search everywhere
Just to hear, your call
Or walk upon stranger roads than this one
In a world, I used to know before
Cause I miss you more
Oh, Oh...
Than the sun, reflecting off my pillow
Bringing the warmth of new life
Oh, Oh, Oh!
And the sounds that echoes all around me
But I caught a glimpse of in the night
Oh but now, now Iâ€™ve lost everything!
I give to you, I give to you, my soul
In the meaning of all that I believed before
Escapes me in this world of none, no thing, and no one
And I would search everywhere
Just to hear your call
Or walk upon stranger roads than this one
In a world, I used to know before
For now, now, now, now, now I've lost everything
I give to you my soul
In the meaning of all that I believed before
Escapes me, in this world of none
Cause I miss you more
I miss you more!Embed
