Duchess (Live) LyricsTimes were good
Well she never thought about the future, she just did what she would
Aw but she really cared, about her music
It all seemed so important then
She dreamed of time she performed
When everyone would cry for more
Then all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar
And on the road
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge
She battled through
Aw, against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds
Now everytime that she performed
When everyone would cried for more
Soon all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar
And all the children cried, you're the one we’ve waited for
Oh...
The time went by
Things weren't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong
Yes times were hard
It was too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want
And then there was a time when she performed
When nobody called for more
Soon every single time she stepped into the light
They really let her know the score
But she dreamed of the time when she sang her songs
And everyone would cry for more
When all she had to do was step into the light
For everyone to start to roar
And all the children cried, you’re the one we've waited for
Oh...Embed
