The Age of Revolution LyricsIt's the Age of Revolution
Princes and lawyers
Played with the English elite
Years of repression
Started a noise from the streets
Age of revolution
The age of revolution
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
Go and get your baton
Take your place in the sun
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
It's the age of revolution
It's the age of revolution
Mankad in Madras
Suddenly Sunil is king
Kids in the valleys
Bats bound together with string, oh yeah!
Time to take the new ball, the dollars and the rubles
Stormont to the Oval, we're all going global
Age of revolution
The age of revolution
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
Go and get your baton
Take your place in the sun
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
It's the age of revolution
It's the age of revolution
It's the age of revolution
It's the age of revolution
Here's to the future
Punjab and Tamil Nadu
Always remember
The passion of '32. Oh yeah, yeah!
Always denied entry, by the English gentry
Now we're driving Bentley's playing 20/20
The age of revolution
The age of revolution
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
Go and get your baton
Take your place in the sun
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
The age of revolution
The age of revolution
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolution
Go and get your baton
Take your place in the sun
From Bangalore to Kingston
The age of revolutionEmbed
