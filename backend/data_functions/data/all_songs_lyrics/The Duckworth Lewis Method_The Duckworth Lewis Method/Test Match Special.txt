Test Match Special LyricsGive me the sun and a big tv
Give me a chair positioned beautifully
Give me a hat trick from the SCG
Give me a Test Match Special
And set me free
Show me the outfield from a zeppelin
Show me the coin toss that we never win
Peruse the paper, sip some Earl Grey tea
And let the Test Match Special
Set you free
Test Match Special
Will set you free
The Test Match Special
It's time for drinks!
And now we're back on the field of play
And we'll be here for the next five days
Look there's a streaker (*whistles*) running through the crease
Only the Test Match Special
Can set you free
The Test Match Special
Will set you free
The Test Match Special
Will set you free
The Test Match Special
It's gonna set you free
Test Match Special
