Meeting Mr Miandad LyricsWoke up from a dream Thursday morning
Mr. Miandad to me was calling, yeah
Got Duckie on the phone and when he'd stopped yawning
I said "Pack up your bags we're going to Pakistan" cause...
We're meeting Mr. Miandad, meeting Mr. Miandad
When we get to Pakistan in our VW camper van
We're meeting Mr. Miandad, meeting Mr. Miandad
It's our historical phantasmagorical destiny
Everywhere we go people know us
When we lose our way people show us
When we break down people tow us
And send us on our way with a smile and a little wave
Hey Hey Hey!
We're meeting Mr. Miandad, meeting Mr. Miandad
When we get to Pakistan in our VW camper van
We're meeting Mr. Miandad, meeting Mr. Miandad
It's our historical phantasmagorical destiny
It's gonna take a while but when we get there
Mr. Miandad will be met there
We'll shake him by the hand and he'll say
"Wait there, while I get my guitar I'm a rock'n'roll star like you"
Woo Hoo Hoo!
We're meeting Mr. Miandad, meeting Mr. Miandad
When we get to Pakistan in our VW camper van
We're meeting Mr. Miandad, meeting Mr. Miandad
It's our historical phantasmagorical destiny
It's our historical phantasmagorical destinyEmbed
