The Sweet Spot LyricsI can hit the sweet spot; hit it oh so fine
I can hit the sweet spot; like the sweetest wine
I'm down on my knees just to please you all the time
When I hit the sweet spot, I see it in your eyes
When I hit the sweet spot, you win the sweetest prize, oh yeah
Don't ever stray, 'cause there ain't no compromise
Find the sweet spot
Hit the sweet spot
Find the sweet spot
Hit the sweet spot
Find the sweet spot
Hit the sweet spot
Find the sweet spot
I can hit the sweet spot; sweet as apple pie
I can hit the sweet spot; hit you really high
My aim is true, gonna hit you out of sight
I can find the sweet spot; sweet as sugar love
I can find the sweet spot; the diamond in the rough
No I ain't gonna share though I just can't get enough
Find the sweet spot
Hit the sweet spot
Find the sweet spot
Hit the sweet spot
I can hit the sweet spot; hit it oh so fine
I can hit the sweet spot; like the sweetest wine
I'm down on my knees just to please you all the time
My aim is true, gonna hit you out of sight
Don't ever stray, 'cause there ain't no compromise
I'm down on my knees just to please you all the timeEmbed
