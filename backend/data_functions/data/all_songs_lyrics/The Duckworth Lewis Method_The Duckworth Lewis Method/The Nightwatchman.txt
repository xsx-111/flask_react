The Nightwatchman LyricsI’m the nightwatchman
I lie awake
Wondering what’s gonna happen when the dawn breaks
I’m the nightwatchman
I take the fall
I’ll always be around when you call
'Cause all that I have is yours
I’d give it all and more to be by your side in the morning light
I’m the nightwatchman
Alone in my bed
Fighting the ghosts and the demons inside my head
Morning has broken and I’ve got to go
How it’s gonna end I don’t know
But all that I have is yours
I’d give it all and more
When they let you down, call me I’ll be around
'Cause all that I have is yours
I’d give it all and more to be by your side
In the morning light
In the morning lightEmbed
