Mason on the Boundary LyricsOn a sunny summer's day
We'll enjoy a full day's play
Out on the boundary
All of Mason's friends are there
Lily with the sunflower hair
Out on the boundary
There's no surprise
Mason resides
On the boundary
Whistling an old world song
Mason knows that he belongs
Out on the boundary
Drinking in the history
In the shade of a willow tree
Out on the boundary
Mason's gone to Zanzibar
Underneath his panama
Out in the boundary
Fading in the evening sun
Hopelessly panglossian
Out on the boundary
There's no surprise
There's peace in his eyes
On the Boundary
Mason on the boundary...Embed
