Tight Like That LyricsWoke up this morning, put on my Sunday shoes
Don't ask me why, it's just the nature of my groove
I larged down the boulevard, came under attack
But I rocked them senseless, cause honey it's tight like that
I hung a left down to Lemans' Avenue
Stagger Lees everywhere, trying to bring me doom, oh no
And that Old Scratch, he tried to purchase this soul
That don't confront me, cause I'm never in the need of a payroll
Heck, yeah
Amen, do it all again
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Spit shine and a three piece suit
Good Lord I got to thank you cause you do it like you do
Hallelujah, all the people in the back
Hallelujah, it's tight like that
Hallelujah, all the people up front
Tight like that, rapture, rock
And all you know-it-alls with politic views
Ideals don't situate themselves in His groove
So if you want to know, you just got to ask
But if you don't lose that skin, you'll never be tight like that
Watch me work, yeah
Amen, do it all again
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Spit shine and a three piece suit
Good Lord I got to thank you cause you do it like you do
Hallelujah, all the people in the back
Hallelujah, it's tight like that
Hallelujah, all the people up front
Tight like that, rapture, rock
Don't try to sell me your New Age guru troubles
Cause I'm already reeling doing that good time gospel shuffle
And all your thumpings about some Armageddon
Ain't no big deal, cause I already hang with Him
Amen, do it all again
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Spit shine and a three piece suit
Good Lord I got to thank you cause you do it like you do
Hallelujah, all the people in the back
Hallelujah, it's tight like that
Hallelujah, all the people up front
Tight like that, rapture, rock
Oh yeah, tight like that
Honey it's tight like that
Honey it's tight like that
Honey it's tight like that
Can I get a witness for the rock of ages?
For the rock of ages?
Can I get a witness for the rock of ages?
For the rock of ages?1Embed
