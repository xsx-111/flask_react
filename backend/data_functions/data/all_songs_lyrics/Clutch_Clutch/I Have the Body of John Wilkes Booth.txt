I Have the Body of John Wilkes Booth LyricsLike Marlon Brando, but bigger
You'll find that creature at the bottom of the deep down Susquehanna River
This one I had stood right on up to me
Tore out his hook and declared himself a prodigy
This one I had it turned bright like the sun
Went around three times and departed with the dove
But oh no, fishing ain't what it used to be
I've seen some bad years, but this one is just killing me
One little nibble in thirteen years
I really pack 'em in
This one I had, I seen it in dreams
All shacked up with lightning and horizon beams
Well I bring 'em on up, and then I pack 'em on in
In all the places I've been
And I swear it's never been like this before
Least not since 19 and 44
But today, I made a sick discovery
Lead box in Sassafras Cove
Well I brought him on up and then I packed him on in, oh yes
Now I'm really cashing in
Wash of the Chesapeake and Appalachian Blue Range
I have discovered the body of John Wilkes Booth
Yes, it's true, I have Mr. Booth
Everybody got to make a living somehow
Do I hear a million?
Well I bring 'em on up and then I pack 'em on in1Embed
