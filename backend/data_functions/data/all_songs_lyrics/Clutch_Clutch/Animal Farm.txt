Animal Farm LyricsListen up you stinking maggots, it seems you just don't get it
Well, I've been appointed to inform you, your days are numbered
You would cry, you would scream
If you knew half the things I see
Please, please just do as I say
Repent and leave your evil ways
Meanwhile, planes drop from the sky
People disappear and bullets fly
Little grey men are coming our way
"Tastes just like chicken", they say
Actually they're all around
Secret bunkers underground
Round 'em up, skin 'em alive
Rolling, rolling, rolling, rawhide
Carter is a clone
Dozen brothers 'round the globe
MJ-12 damned us to hell
Scroll & Key, Skull & Bone
It's only just begun
The best is yet to come
Area 51
The spawn of Babylon
Couldn't give a damn about JFK
Everything's conspiracy
Wouldn't be surprised if they have their way
"Tastes just like chicken", they say
I know it's hard to swallow
It must sound too far fetched
But you can bet your bottom dollar
I ain't going with the rest1Embed
