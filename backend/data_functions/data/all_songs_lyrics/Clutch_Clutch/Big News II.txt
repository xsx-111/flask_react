Big News II LyricsCan't funk with the feel or with the other three
This mother lode coming at you all three D's
We got big news, the party boat is here
The band is kicking, and I see lots of beers
And I believe there is gambling
On the deck just below from here
We got Greedo, Solo to the rear
They know the deal, sacks packed and stacked with
Pieces of eight, a sailor's life for me
Live free or die
Never look a bounty hunter in the eye, damn!
Now, where were we?
I think aces high, sleeves are rolled
Tremendous diamonds and a mouth of gold
I've spent many years a rambling
I'll never change these foolish ways
Cause fortune tellers make a killing nowadays
Best keep living like a castaway
With my sack packed
Pieces of eight, a sailor's life for me
Live free or die
Never look a merman in the eye, damn!3Embed
