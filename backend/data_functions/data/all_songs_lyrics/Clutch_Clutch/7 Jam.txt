7 Jam LyricsEverything gonna be all-right
Everything gonna be all-right
Everything gonna be all-right
Everything gonna be all-right
I went deep down into that river now
I rose up
And I felt that sun beat down upon this sinner's face, yeah, yeah
And I went deep down in that water now
I rose up
I felt that sun beat down upon my face, yeah, yeah
Here we go!
So then I smash up the palace like the son of Samson
Hollering louder than all of Bedlam
Take me to higher ground
Then bury my body 6-feet down
And I walked 40-miles out into that desert now
Wailed and moaned
Till the Lion, He called my name, yeah!
And He said that Old Ship of Zion is taking way, way out
Out into outer space
Yeah! Yeah!
And He said
Everything gonna be all-right
Everything gonna be all-right
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Oh yeah!
I climbed the highest of the heights
Atop that mountain I watched the day turn into night
Oh I tell you I was a wretched sight
But I stood long and hard until the light
Rubbing needles in my eyes, eating dirt
I stood up
And everything was all-right
Here we go!
But then I smash on the palace like the son of Samson
Hollering louder than all of Bedlam
Take me to higher ground
Then bury my body 6-feet downEmbed
