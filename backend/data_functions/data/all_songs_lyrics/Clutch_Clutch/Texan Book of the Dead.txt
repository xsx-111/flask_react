Texan Book of the Dead LyricsSo, you say you want to go to heaven?
Well, I got the plans
Kinda walks like Sasquatch
But it breeds like Kublai Khan
In original dialect, it's really quite cryptical
There are many copies around
But this, my man, is the original, yeah
It's given me powers but kept me low
Many have scorned this
Modern day Pharisees
Fat with espressos
Be leary of Timothy, clear light and all that
If you want light, go steal the sun
Hell, that boy don't know crap
If you want to know paradise
Do you wanna know hell?
Want to drink that cool, clear liquor?
Better dig a little deeper in the well, my man
If you want to know paradise
Do you wanna know hell?
Want to drink that cool, clear liquor?
Better dig a little deeper in the well, my man
Do you want a mantra? Do you want to know?
Do you want that mantra? Well, here you go
One for the money, two for the show
And a knick knack, paddy whack
Give the lord a handclap
Ooh ee ooh ah ah
Twing twang walla walla bing bang
Oh ee ooh ah ah
Twing twang walla walla bing bang, oh yeah
Ooh eee ooh ah ah
B-I-N-G-O
Ooh eee ooh ah ah
E-I-E-I-O
Still want that mantra, still wanna know?
Still want that mantra, well here it go
It is written, I have spoken
So, put this in your pipe and smoke it
Ooh ee ooh ah ah
Twing twang walla walla bing bang
Oh ee ooh ah ah
Twing twang walla walla bing bang, oh yeah
Ooh eee ooh ah ah
B-I-N-G-O
Ooh eee ooh ah ah
