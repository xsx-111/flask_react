Escape from the Prison Planet LyricsThen against my better judgment I went walking out that door
I smiled at one person then I nodded to three more
One man asked me for a dollar, I asked him, "What's it for?"
He said, "I have seen them." I said, "O.K., it's yours."
And as featured on the M-T-V, the local high school lets out
And the town becomes anarchy
Parties are crashed, skid marks are measured
The story's in the paper, you may read it at your leisure
Get out
Eject
Escape From the Prison Planet
Get out
Eject
Escape From the Prison Planet
And to the tune of a billion dollars, I supplied to the D.O.E
Some tasty little nuggets of alien technology
And as one might expect, I've been harassed for years
The Men In Black have been bending my ear
As a matter of fact, they were just here today
But I escaped them through a secret passageway
Once I lived there for one thousand days
Get out
Eject
Escape From the Prison Planet
Get out
Eject
Escape From the Prison Planet
I have plans for the future, guess they're futuristic plans
Move out west and buy some desert lands
Maybe up North, just past Alaska
You know nothing of this if they ask you
Red Rover, Red Rover, Bob Lazar's coming over
So honey clear the airstrip and light up that stove
By Jove, I think it's started. Oh yeah
Escape From the Prison Planet
Billion people harvest on Mars
Rebuild the remnants of the obelisk
One mile from the pyramid
Escape From the Planet of the Apes
Go forth, ad infinitum
Return the relics to the Elephant
And Atlantis rises
Get out
Eject
Escape From the Prison Planet
Ejector seat ignite
Billion people harvest on Mars
Rebuild the remnants of the obelisk
One mile from the pyramid
Escape From the Planet of the Apes
Go forth, ad infinitum
Return the relics to the Elephant
And Atlantis rises2Embed
