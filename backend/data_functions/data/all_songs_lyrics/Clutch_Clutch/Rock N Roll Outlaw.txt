Rock N Roll Outlaw LyricsIn the north they call us Rebels
In the south they call us Yankees
Because every other sucker's born to do the hokey pokey
With the skillet licking time keepers,
The grinning reapers
Of a missionary rock star
You can rock it like Sir Sisyphus
But even in it's genesis
It's really quite ridiculous
'Lectric hobo, so now you know
Not to clock the Weeble Wobble hot rod gang
Revelator big bang
You can't hang with the heaviness's hung
Among the houses of the rising tongues
No fun to crack the axles
But it's got to be done
Because whenever you wobble the weebles
You know that they get ticked off
And in the season of boll-weevil speaking evil in your ear
And a pile of manure fertilizing all your fears
We yabba-dabba-doo all the way to Shangri-la
Here it is with the rock and roll outlaw
Where rock is criminal, criminals rock
Where rock is criminal, they rock like this
Where rock is criminal, criminals rock
Where rock is criminal, they rock like this
Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw
I'm a rock and roll outlaw
Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw
I'm a rock and roll outlaw
You can rock it like Sir Sisyphus
But even in it's genesis
It's really quite ridiculous
'Lectric hobo, so now you know
Not to clock the Weeble Wobble hot rod gang
Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw
I'm a rock and roll outlaw
Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-hawEmbed
