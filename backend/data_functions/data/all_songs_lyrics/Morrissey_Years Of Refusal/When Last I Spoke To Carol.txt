When Last I Spoke To Carol Lyrics
When last I spoke to Carol I said:
"I can't pretend it gets easier."
She said:
"I've hung on, I have edged around this narrow ledge since the day I was born in 1975."

When last I spoke to Carol I said:
"I can't pretend I feel love for you."
She said:
"I've hammered a smile across this pasty face of mine since the day I was born in 1975."

When I said goodbye to Carol
Black earth upon the casket fell
She had faded to
Something I always knew
To the rescue
Nobody ever comes1Embed
