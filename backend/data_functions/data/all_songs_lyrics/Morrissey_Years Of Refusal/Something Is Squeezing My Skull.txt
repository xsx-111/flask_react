Something Is Squeezing My Skull Lyrics
I'm doing very well
I can blackout the present and the past now
I know by now you think I should have straightened myself out
Thank you, drop dead

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can barely describe
There is no love in modern life

I'm doing very well
It's a miracle I even made it this far
The motion of taxis excites me
Will you peel it back and bite me?

Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I cannot describe
There is no hope in modern life
Oh, something is squeezing my skull
Something I can't fight
No true friends in modern life
Diazapam (that's valium), Tarmazpam
Lithium... HRT... ECT
How long must I stay on this stuff?

Don't gimmie anymore, don't gimmie anymore, don't
Gimmie anymore, don't gimmie anymore, please
Don't gimmie anymore
You swore you would not gimmie anymore, don't gimmie
Anymore...
Please don't gimmie anymore
Oh, you swore
You swore!
You swore!
You swore you would not gimmie anymore2Embed
