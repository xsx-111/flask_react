Goodmorning Sunshine Lyrics
Heh heh, Good morning sunshine
(Damn) Good morning sunshine
(Yo) Good morning sunshine-shine-shine
Good morning sunshine
Good morning sun-sunshine

I ain't the cat y'all saw yesterday
At least, I mean by tomorrow I won't be anyway
Whole new ballgame, (whole new day!)
Bug you, don't it?
You overgrown headlight
I asked you for the last time, why you so unkind?
How many years and time I ask you?
Just to make this blue
You don't look out for us more than you do
Curious huh, curious, yellow, ain't ya
(Naw, it ain't religion)
You know I don't go for that chosen few
Amen and (God just testing you)

Rain?
That sure is lame
You must think I stone lost my brain
Rain?
(Boy!) That sure is lame
(Good morning sunshine)
I ain't the cat y'all saw yesterday
At least, I mean by tomorrow I won't be anyway
Whole new ballgame, (whole new day!)
Curious, ain't ya?
Curious, yellow
(My Aunt Emma)
She drowned in that boat on (Labor day)
She had on a big wide yellow hat
It was all yellow and (Brand new)
The hat was green and she was too
(Everybody's dead)
When they found her
(Like some old Titanic shi-)
Because she didn't come up right away
Reverend Coleman said it was to punish her (For her fast ways)
But he always talked like that anyways
(I like how they're contradicting)
Trying to scare folks to grease his tray (Be praised)
That's what my Uncle Leroy used to say
And Emma was always the practical one
In the family anyway
Then she reached in the pocket and gave (The number that gonna hit today)

Good morning, sunshine
I ain't the cat you saw yesterday
At least, I mean by tomorrow I won't be, anyway
Whole new ballgame, whole new day
First thing I'm gonna do is send down a box load of roses
And have' em put on Aunt Emma's grave
Next I'm gonna buy myself some shades
So if I'm out in the day, I won't have to look at you
Last time you and that garment district Cadillac
Gonna trump on me3Embed
