The Unseen Lyrics
Quasimoto representing the unseen
Immortal stats, yo, we got invisible clean
Advanced rhyme scene out of lou beans
The unseen, we keep it clean like a diamond ring
Or dirty like a one night fling
But I bet you can't catch my swing
We roll numbers, stack styles every time we do our thing
Hitting like some line backers
Rude rhyme shacklers, you fuck with us, you end up on the black list
You rushed by tacklers, yeah, that's a fat kiss of death
Like we on the street scene
You and your whole crew intrigued, 'cause you ain't got no tricks up your sleeve
Only bust rhyme function to a point to where y'all can't even breathe
So, make way for the unseen

Yo, Madlib
Change the beat up, so I can turn these peoples

Quasimoto got so much soul, niggas be like, "Yo!"
Quasimoto got so much soul, niggas always be like, "Yo!"

I got soul like Fred Wesley
You know, it's Lord Quas up in the spot hitting freshly
Who blow ya head while I'm keeping my cool?
Madlib controlling tracks, taking y'all back to school
We got y'all up on the bubblegum
Smack you like I'm Troublesome
Turn your speakers up, take a puff and you'll see exactly what I mean
Loud and clear be the unseen
Quasimoto got so much soul, niggas always be like, "Yo!"
Quasimoto got so much soul, niggas always be like, "Yo!"

Soul
(Some of that soul)
Soul
(Go over there)
(Quasimoto)
