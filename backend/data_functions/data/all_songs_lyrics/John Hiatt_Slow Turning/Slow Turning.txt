Slow Turning LyricsWhen I was a boy
I thought it just came to ya'
But I never could tell what's mine
So it didn't matter anyway
My only pride and joy
Was this'a racket down here
Bangin' on an old guitar
And singin' what I had to say
I always thought our house was haunted
'Cause nobody said boo to me
I never did get what I wanted
Now I get what I need
It's been a slow turnin'
From the inside out
A slow turnin', baby
But you come about
A slow learnin'
But you learn to sway
A slow turnin', baby
Not fade away, not fade away, not fade away
Now I'm in my car
I got the radio down
An' I'm a'yellin' at the kids in the back
'Cause they're bangin' like'a Charlie Watts
You think you come so far
In this one horse town
Then she's laughin' that crazy laugh
'Cause you haven't left the parkin' lot
Time is short and here's the damn thing about it
You're gonna die, gonna die for sure
And you can learn to live with love or without it
But there ain't no cure
There's just a slow turnin'
From the inside out
A slow turnin'
But you come about
A slow turnin', baby
But you learn to sweat
A slow turnin'
Not fade away (x5)
A slow turnin' (x4)Embed
