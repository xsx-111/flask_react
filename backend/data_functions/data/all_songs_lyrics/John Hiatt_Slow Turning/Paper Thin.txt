Paper Thin LyricsI was gonna get up off'n that bar stool
Just as soon as I could figure it out
Why I was overlooked at the car pool
A'stood up at the dance with no twist and shout
You're burnin' with your last desire
And every memory haunts you
You write it down in alcohol fire
'Cause that's the only flame that wants you
When you're paper thin
G'on read all about it
When you were outta' luck, well, luck was doin' alright
When you're paper thin
Yeah, they can see right through ya'
You just cut you're little finger on the edge of the night
Now do I really have to be responsible
For what I did between those tavern walls?
I was just mixin' up some chemicals
You coulda' heard a pin drop, ya' coulda' heard time crawl
And every once in a while
You could hear your own heart pound
Maybe some paper doll with a pasted on smile
Would let you write her number down
(Chorus x2)
(You're paper thin)
(Paper thin) (x7)Embed
