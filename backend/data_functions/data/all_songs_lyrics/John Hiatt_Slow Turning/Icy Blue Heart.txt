Icy Blue Heart LyricsShe came onto him like a slow movin' cold front
An' his beer was warmer than the look in her eye
She sat on a stool, and he said, "What do you want?"
And she said, "Give me a love that don't freeze up inside"
He said, "I have melted some hearts in my time dear
But to sit next to you, well, I shiver and shake
And if I knew love, well, I don't think I'd be here
Askin' myself if I've got what it takes"
To melt your icy blue heart
Should I start?
To turn what's been frozen for years
Into a river of tears
These days we all play cool, calm and collected
Why, our lips could turn blue just shootin' the breeze
But under the frost, well, he thought he detected
A warm blush of red and a touch of her knee
He said, "Girl, you're a beauty like I've never witnessed
An' I've seen the Northern Lights dancin' on air
An' I felt the cold follow the first kiss
There's not enough heat in the fires burnin' there"
(Chorus)
