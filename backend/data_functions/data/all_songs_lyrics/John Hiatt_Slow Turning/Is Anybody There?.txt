Is Anybody There? LyricsWell I'm out here on my own
Followin' a star
And asking on my knees, for some direction, please
And, God, you know it's hard
'Cause I'm such a stubborn man
Lord, I'm stubborn as a mule
Even though I struggle some, I believe a change will come
And I hear you love a fool
An' I see a road and a flash of lightnin'
Let me tell you it's frightenin'
Is anybody there? (there)
Oh, I need somebody tonight
To care (care)
I'm feelin' alone and it just don't seem right
Is anybody there? (there)
Oh, I need somebody to be
To know that I'm good enough for love
To walk beside me
And as a woman in this world
Well you must have felt like this
That a man might come along
With another hard luck song
And betray you with a kiss
But would you reconsider me
Though I know I've caused you pain
I've taken vows with you
An' I believe them to be true
Now can we take a little rain?
We could hit that road in a flash of lightnin'
Maybe it won't be so frightenin'
(Chorus x2)
I'm gonna keep on walkin', baby
I'm gonna keep on walkin', walkin', walkin'
Keep
I wanna keep, I wanna keep, I wanna keep on walkin'
I wanna keep
I got to keep on walkin', walkin', walkin'
I wanna keep, I wanna keep, I wanna keep on walkin'
Please
Keep on walkin', babyEmbed
