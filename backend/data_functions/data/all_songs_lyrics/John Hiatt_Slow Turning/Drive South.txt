Drive South LyricsI didn't say we wouldn't hurt anymore
That's how you learn, you just get burned
But we don't have to feel like dirt anymore
Though love's not earned, baby it's our turn
We were always lookin' for true north
With our heads in the clouds, just a little off course
But I left that motor runnin', so if you're feelin' down and out
Come on baby drive south, with the one you love
Come on baby drive south, with the one you love
I'm not talkin' 'bout retreatin' little girl
Gonna take our stand, in this Chevy van
Windows open on the rest of the world
Holdin' hands, all the way to Dixieland
We've been tryin' to turn our lives around
Since we were little kids, it's been wearin' us down
Don't turn away now darlin' lets fire it up and wind it out
Oh
(Chorus)
An' I heard your mama callin', I think she was just stallin'
Don't know who she was talkin' to, baby me and you
We could go down with a smile on, don't bother to pack your nylons
Just keep them pretty legs showin', it gets hot down where we're goin'
Better believe it, baby
We were always lookin' for true north
With our heads in the clouds, just a little off course
But I left that motor runnin', so if you're feelin' down and out
Oh
(Chorus)Embed
