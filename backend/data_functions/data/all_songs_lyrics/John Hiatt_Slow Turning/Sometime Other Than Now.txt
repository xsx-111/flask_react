Sometime Other Than Now LyricsMaybe your mama didn't treat you right
Maybe her intentions weren't even very good
Maybe my daddy he laid awake at night
Imaginin' himself in some other neighborhood
Left to our own devices
Like maybe they were too
Out on the open road
And wonderin' what to do
You ask how we got here baby don't ask how
'Cause that was sometime other than now
Takes what it takes, that's what they told us girl
Done a lot of dumb things, probably do some more
On two different paths, runnin' 'round in different worlds
We finally found each other, who we were lookin' for
I see my own reflection
When I give my love to you
And it's shot back like an arrow
So straight and true
(Chorus)
An' I'm not leavin' babe
Whatever's comin' right here and now
Maybe tomorrow we can't take
I'm not grievin' babe anymore
The past is gone
An' we can't fake it, baby let's make it
With this love of ours somehow
A little bit of fear, you know it goes a long way
It's followed us around since we were little kids
With just a little faith, well maybe baby someday
We will have the strength, the strength to forgive
Don't come all of a sudden
But when it's here at last
You blink your eyes and miss it
It happen so fast
(Chorus)
Yeah, that was sometime other than nowEmbed
