Feels Like Rain LyricsDown here the river, meets the sea
And in the sticky heat I feel ya' open up to me
Love comes outta' nowhere baby, just like a hurricane
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Lyin' underneath the stars right next to you
And I'm wonderin' who you are and
How do you do?
How do you do, baby?
The clouds roll in across the moon
Wind howls out your name
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
(Baby can ya' feel it?)
We ain't never gonna' make that bridge tonight, baby
Across the Ponchartrain
And it feels like rain
And it feels like rain
So batten down the hatches, baby
And leave your heart out on your sleeve
It looks like we're in for stormy weather
That ain't no cause for us to leave
Just lie here, in my arms
And let it wash away the pain
It feels like rain
And it feels like rain
Baby can ya' feel it, feel it, feel it?
Feel it, feel it
(Baby can you feel it?)
(Can you feel it?)
I wanna let your love, wanna let your love, wanna let your love
Pass all over me (Feel it, feel it)
