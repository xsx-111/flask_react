Georgia Rae LyricsI know a girl, mess with your mind
She'll come to you in the summer sometime
She'll talk about things ya' don't understand
But you better stick to the matters at hand
Before the whole damn thing unwinds
She is beautiful, she is small
She don't wanna play basketball
But there's no tellin' what she might do
Before her doin' days are through
A'right now she can't even crawl
Georgia Rae, ok, Georgia Rae
Georgia Rae, baby what I say, Georgia Rae
C'mon, Georgia Rae
Your mother and I we did this act
In some hotel 'bout nine months back
Now, it is love that brings you here
A love that will not disappear
Georgia, honey, you can count on that
(Chorus)
We were tired, shoulda' been sleepin'
But, like a fire, somethin' went creepin', creepin', creepin'
Now your brother and sister don't understand
How your tiny feet and your tiny hands
Could carry the weight of a thousand earths
Into our little universe
But, Georgia, we all think it's grand
(Chorus x2)
Lucky for you child, ya' look like your mommaEmbed
