Go Through It Lyrics
She knew it about Route Three
Oh, she blew it, you know she could've told me
He can't say no, he can't ask why
Go through it, highway bride
He delivers, he's a roadsider
He gets no road from a back seat driver
Away we go, yes or no?
I love you honey, give me a beer

But just like Jerry Lee, she's tuning in on me
And I've got no defense, but it makes no difference
Because just like Jerry Lee, she's tuning in on me
She does it easy, like a CB

He's hard to hold on the rolling road
He knows his rig's hot, get through that roadblock
Ten miles to go, oh, radio
She knew it, now so does he
Ah, I love you honey, give me a beer
Ooh, go through it, come sit right hereEmbed
