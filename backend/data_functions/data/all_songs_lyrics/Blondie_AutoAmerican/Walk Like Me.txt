Walk Like Me Lyrics
We don't wear that uniform
Paper men from pages torn
Right off the press (it could be Tas)
Suits for the regime
The media's gone and had a baby
Seventh wave, another navy
I live in America
Gridlock on the street
Tell that girl you like her badge
Tell that man you're the Nazz
Tell me you're not the last walking in parade
Dressed to test you up the road
Tighter than the lightest clothes
Close the circle, walk in row
Walking in parade

Why don't you walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?

Carrying the standard stick
And marrying the politic
You won't know tomorrow
What went down today
Look at me; I'm in tune
References around my room
Just another secret school
Another cycle going by
You, you never looked like that
Don't look like me, don't take it back
You never had a name like that
Never had a color
Walking like a millionaire
Walking on imported air
Change the way you comb your hair
And watch what you walk under

Why don't you walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?
Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh
Heh, heh, heh

Heh, why don't you?
Why don't you walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?
Heh, hehEmbed
