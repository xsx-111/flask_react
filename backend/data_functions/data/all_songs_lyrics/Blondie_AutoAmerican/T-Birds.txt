T-Birds Lyrics
Circle high, circle low
Jammers fly, T-birds
You show, you show, whiplash go
You show, you show, T-birds
Mighty bird
T-bird, my mighty bird

On the dot in the slot, tie the knot
On the dot timed kisses
In the slot on the dot, tie the knot
In the slot, no misses

Mighty bird
T-bird, my mighty bird
T-bird, mighty bird
Black sun conqueror
Black sun worshipper

Coil it up, wind it out, strike it hot
Coil it up plumed serpent
Coil it up, wind it out, strike it hot
Coil it up, my T-bird
Serpent curl
T-bird, rule the world
T-bird, mighty bird
Black sun born again

Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
Oh I love my T-bird, T-bird
Oh I love my T-bird, T-birdEmbed
