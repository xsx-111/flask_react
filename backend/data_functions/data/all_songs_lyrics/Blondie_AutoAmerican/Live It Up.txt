Live It Up Lyrics
Your old lover's lying in the gutter
He used to be such an all night strutter
"Oh, my heart," I heard him mutter
"Oh, my dear, it seems to flutter"
Ah, ah

It's so hard to say "No"
When the deck is stacked to only go slow
It's easy sweet to live it up
An easy street when you've had enough
Ah, ah

Darkened night, splashing light
Soft and white and so polite
Let him in, beneath the rim
Beneath the skin, your next of kin
Cleansing fire, funeral pyre
Broken wire grown inside her
Secret hush, swollen rush
It's soft and plush, it's so plush

You know it's so pass√©
To sleep without you every day
So easy to do your stuff
So easy to live it up
Ah, ahEmbed
