Follow Me Lyrics
Far from day, far from night
Out of time, out of sight
In between earth and sea
We shall fly, follow me
Dry the rain, warm the snow
Where the winds never go
Follow me, follow me
Follow me

Follow me to a cave by a sapphire shore
Where we'll walk through an emerald door
And for thousands of breathless "evermore's" my life you will be

Only you, only I
World farewell, world goodbye
To our home beneath the sea
We shall fly, follow me

Only you, only I
World farewell, world goodbye
To our home beneath the sea
We shall fly, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow meEmbed
