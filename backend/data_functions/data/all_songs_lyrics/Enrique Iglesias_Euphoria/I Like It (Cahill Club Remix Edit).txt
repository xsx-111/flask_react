I Like It (Cahill Club Remix Edit) LyricsPitbull
One Love, one love
Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull
Y'all know what time it is
We gonna set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique! Holla at them like
Enrique Iglesias
Girl, please excuse me
If I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night
We can really let go
My girlfriend's out of town
And I'm all alone
Your boyfriend's on vacation
And he doesn't have to know
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do the things I'm gonna wanna do to you
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screamin' loud
Let me hear you go!
Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it
I, I, I like it
Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever
Girl, please excuse me
If I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying to keep my hands off
But you're begging me for more
Round round round
Baby, low low low
Let the time time pass
'Cause we're never getting old
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do it better turn around I'll give you more
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screamin' loud
Let me hear you go!
Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby I like it
I, I, I like it
Pitbull
Go DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami Boy, you know how we play
I ain't playin withya, but I wanna play withya
Get me, got me? Good
Now watch me
It's a different species, get me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James
Equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle and let 'em that it's on
Pa' fuera! Pa' la calle!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
Dale mamita tirame ese baile!
I see you watchin' me, you see me watchin' you
I love the way you move
I like them things you do like
Enrique Iglesias
Don't stop, baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop, baby
Until you get enough
Party, Karamu, Fiesta, Forever
Baby, I like it!
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it!
Come on and give me some more!
Oh yes, I like it!
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it, I, I, I like it!
Baby, I like it!
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it!
Come on and give me some more!
Oh yes, I like it!
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it! I, I, I like it!
Party, (Oh yes, I like it!) karamu, fiesta, forever!
Oh yes, I like it!
Party, karamu, (Oh yes, I like it!) fiesta, forever!Embed
