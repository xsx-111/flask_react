One Day at a Time Lyrics
Akon, Enrique
RedOne, Konvict, yeah
One day at a time
Yeah, it's one day at a time

Saw you in the club
You were dancing with somebody
So close, so tight
You were killing me so slowly
My friends were telling me what you're doing
Can drive a man so crazy
I try to live my life
It's been six months since you left me

So I, oh I, oh I
Still thinking about you, baby
I try, I try
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know
Yes, I know
I gotta take it one day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time
One day, one day, one day
One day at a time

I'm not the jealous type
But you stole my heart, baby
Dancing with that guy
Made it so hard for me to watch, baby
I just spinning around in them circles
I'm going through it in my mind, baby
Had to suck up the tears from my nostrils
To stop from crying out loud, baby

Oh I, oh I
Still thinking about you, baby
I try, I try
Can't stop thinking about you, baby
Why, oh why?
I keep thinkin' about you, baby
I try, I try

But I guess I gotta take it
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know
And I know
Gotta take it one day at a time
First thing I gotta do is try to face it (Try to face it)
But your voice keeps playing in my ear (Playing in my ear)
It just makes me crazy tryna fake it (Tryna fake it)
The true event's so bad, it's not what I wanna hear
But I guess I gotta take it

One day at a time
I gotta let you go
One day at a time
It seems so impossible
One day at a time
I gotta let you go
And I know
Yes, I know
I gotta take it one day at a time
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know (And I know)
Yes, I know (Yes, I know)
I gotta take it one day at a time
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
One day at a time
But it seems so impossible
One day at a time
Said I gotta let you go
And I know (And I know)
Yes, I know (Yes, I know)
I gotta take it one day at a timeEmbed
