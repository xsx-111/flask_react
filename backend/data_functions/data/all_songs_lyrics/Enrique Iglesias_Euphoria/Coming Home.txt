Coming Home Lyrics
Sometimes I feel I'm going nowhere
I'm moving but I just can't find the way
Surrounded by a million faces
They all say, they're my best friends
Take another drink to hide the sorrow
But come the morning, nothing's changed
The concrete skies are rushing by me
And this road is getting old

I don't wanna wait until it's over
I don't wanna wait until it's gone
I can't wait until tomorrow
'Cause I been waiting for so long
So baby I'm coming home, oh oh
Baby I'm coming home

I heard the radio play your favorite song
Made me think of everything we used to do
There's so much we used to talk about
And now I can't, even I say "I miss you", no

I don't wanna wait until it's over
I don't wanna wait until it's gone
I can't wait until tomorrow
'Cause I been waiting for so long
So baby I'm coming home, oh oh
Baby I'm coming home
So turn around, just turn around

I don't wanna wait until it's over
I don't wanna wait until it's gone
I can't wait until tomorrow
'Cause I been waiting for so long
So baby I'm coming home, oh oh
Baby I'm coming home

Baby, I'm coming home, oh oh
Baby, I'm coming homeEmbed
