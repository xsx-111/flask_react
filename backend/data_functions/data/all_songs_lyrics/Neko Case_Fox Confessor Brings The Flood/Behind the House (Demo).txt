Behind the House (Demo) LyricsOne night, I woke up crying in the lane behind the house
Clothes were wet and steaming by the time I figured it out
You didn't die in the fire
It was the flood that carried you from me
And the embers of your house still glowing
Make it hard to sleep, it's hard to breathe
There's not much room to go more crazy
A flaming sword above my head for all of you to see
Beware my girl, beware
Beware my girl, beware of these memories
And what is real, what is real
I walk this world forever in a dream
Or is this the land of the living?
Or is this your way to tell me that I couldn't save you?
I couldn't save youEmbed
