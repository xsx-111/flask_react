The Needle Has Landed LyricsHere I am, in traffic's slow flow
(Where the needle touched down)
Carbon planes draw a cage around the Air Force base
(Where the needle touched down)
My foot on the brake, it's okay to fly low
Over poor Spanaway
An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town from a sharp-toothed freighter
The needle's the same that recorded and played
When you left me at the Greyhound the year I moved away
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here... baby
My baby
So that's why I never come back here
That's why they spit out my name
Your exes have clawed up the Bible
Trying to keep me away
With the sledge of tectonic fever
The needle has landed again
Let it play
And the needle touched down
The needle has landed
An eagle swooped down from a semi-trailer
Took the name of your town from a sharp-toothed freighter
And if I knew then what's so obvious now
You'd still be here...Embed
