Maybe Sparrow LyricsMaybe sparrow, you should wait
The hawks alight till morning
You'll never pass beyond the gate
If you don't hear my warning
Notes are hung so effortless
With the rise and fall of a sparrow's breast
It's a drowning dive and back to the chorus
La de da de da de da
Oh, my sparrow, it's too late
Your body, limp, beneath my feet
Your dusty eyes cold as clay
You didn't hear my warning
Maybe sparrow, it's too late
The moonlight glanced off metal wings
In a thunderstorm above the clouds
The engine hums a sparrow's phrase
For those who cannot hear the words
For those who cannot hear the words
For those who will not hear the words
La de da de da de da
