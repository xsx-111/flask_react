John Saw That Number LyricsOld John the Baptist, Old John Divine
Leather harness round his line
His meat was locust and honey
Wild honey, Lord, wild honey
John saw that number way in the middle of the air
Cryin' holy, holy to the Lord
Old John the Baptist, Old John Divine
Frogs and snakes are gonna get John this time
God told the angel, "Go see about John"
So he flew from the pit with the moon round his waist
Gathered wind in his fists and the stars round his wrists
Cryin' holy, holy to the Lord
Read the revelations, you'll find him there
Third chapter, fourth verse, where he said unto me
"There's a beast that rose out of the sea"
Ten crowns, ten crowns
On his horns write, "Blasphemy"
John couldn't read it
Cannot repeat it
John couldn't read it
Holy, holy to the Lord
There was a man, a Pharisee
Who came by night to meet him
Said, "I know thy teacher came from God
'Cause no man can do such miracles
Without the Lord to entreat him"
God told the angel, "Go see about John"
So he flew from the pit with the moon round his waist
Gathered wind in his fists and the stars round his wrists
Cryin' holy, holy to the Lord1Embed
