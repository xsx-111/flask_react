At Last LyricsI can say that I've lived here in honor and danger
But I'm just an animal and cannot explain a life
Down this chain of days, I wished to stay among my people
Relation now means nothing, having chosen so defined
And if death should smell my breathing
As it pass beneath my window
Let it lead me trembling, trembling
I own every bell that tolls me1Embed
