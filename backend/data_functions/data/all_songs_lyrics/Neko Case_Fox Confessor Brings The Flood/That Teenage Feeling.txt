That Teenage Feeling LyricsNow that we've met
We can only laugh at these regrets
Common as a winter cold
They're telephone poles
They follow each other
One, after another, after another
But now my heart is green as weeds
Grown to outlive their season
And nothing comforts me the same
As my brave friend who says
"I don't care if forever never comes
Cause I'm holding out for that teenage feeling
I'm holding out for that teenage feeling"
All the loves we had, all we ever knew
Did they fill me with so many secrets that keep me from loving you?
Cause it's hard, hard, hardEmbed
