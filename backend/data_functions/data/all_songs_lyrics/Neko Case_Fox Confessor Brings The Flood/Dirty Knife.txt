Dirty Knife LyricsSo suddenly the madness came
With it's whiskered, wolven, ether pangs
He locked the door and he shut the blinds
He laid down on the floor and he slept like iron
While the dirty knife worked deep into his spine
The blood runs crazy
The blood runs crazy
Cascading letters pool on the stairs
The grass is high, the cats are wild
You can't even touch the tip of their tails
And the blood runs crazy with giant strides
He sang nursery rhymes to paralyze
The wolves that eddy out the corner of his eyes
But they squared him frozen where he stood
In the glow of the furniture piled high for firewood
And the blood runs crazy with giant strides
And the woodsman failed to breach those fangs in time
So they dragged him through the underbrush
Wearing three winter coats and a dirty knife
Krichit shaleno, strekoche zubami
La da da da (x2)Embed
