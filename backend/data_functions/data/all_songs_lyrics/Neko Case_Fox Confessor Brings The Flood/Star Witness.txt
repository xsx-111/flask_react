Star Witness Lyrics
My true love drowned in a dirty old pan of oil
That did run from the block
Of a Falcon sedan 1969
The paper said '75
There were no survivors
None found alive

Trees break the sidewalk
And the sidewalk skins my knees
There's glass in my thermos
And blood on my jeans
Nickels and dimes of the Fourth of July
Roll off in a crooked line
To the chain-link lots where the red tails dive
Oh, how I forgot what it's like

Hey when she sings, when she sings
When she sings like she runs
Moves like she runs
Hey when she moves, when she moves
When she moves like she runs
Moves like she runs
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight

"Hey pretty baby, get high with me
We can go to my sister's if we say we'll watch the baby"
The look on your face yanks my neck on the chain
And I would do anything (I would do anything)
To see you again
So I've fallen behind

Hey when she sings, when she sings
When she sings like she runs, moves like she runs
Hey when she moves, when she moves
When she moves like she runs, moves like she runs
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight
Hey there, there's such deadly wolves 'round town tonight
'Round the town tonight

Go on, go on and scream and cry
You're miles from where anyone will find you
This is nothing new, no television crew
They don't even put on the sirens
My nightgown sweeps the pavement, please
Don't let him die
Oh, how I forgot...2Embed
