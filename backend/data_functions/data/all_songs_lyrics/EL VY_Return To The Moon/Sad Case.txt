Sad Case LyricsI've been wondering what to do
I'd give anything to talk to you
I've been thinking some peaceful thoughts
Open windows and headphone knots
Michael, I've been a sad case
Michael, I've been a sad case
When St. Louis turns off its lights
I will talk to you through the night
We won't break anybody's backs
Let's just keep our eyes on the cracks
Michael, I've been a sad case
Michael, I've been a sad case
It takes a lot of time
And it takes a little bit of crying
To get your mind off
It takes a lot of time
And it takes a little bit of crying
To get your mind off
I've been walking past the place
On West Flourescent Avenue
None of them remember me
And none of them remember you
One thing at a time goes
Through my mind
One thing at a time goes
Alright
It takes a lot of time
And it takes a little bit of crying
To get your mind off
It takes a lot of time
And it takes a little bit of crying
To get your mind off
Michael, I've been a sad case
Michael, I've been a sad case2Embed
