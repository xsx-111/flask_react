Return to the Moon (Political Song for Didi Bloome to Sing, with Crescendo) Lyrics
Scratched a ticket with a leg of a cricket
And I got triple Jesus
Cashed it in for a Siamese twin
At the family firing range
Went to bed and woke up inside another man's head
Nobody noticed
I'm so excited the senator's a fighter
Don't tell me nothing's changed

Return to the moon, I'm dying
Return to the moon, please

Bought a saltwater fish from a colorblind witch
Cause she said she loved it
Couldn't tell her the part that would break her heart
But it loved me
She said, I think you're getting too far from your family's house
To find it
You should know if you're running away and I touch you
You freeze

Return to the moon, I'm dying
Return to the moon, please
Return to the moon, I'm dying
Return to the moon, please
Don't make me wait for you at the corner of Eden Park
Don't make me wait for you at the Serpentine Wall

Wish I could have been there when you were driving away
For California
If you've got to go somewhere
Then you better go somewhere far
Did you really think I could ever go on without you?
I'm not a genius
I imagine myself being cool
In the backseat of your car

Return to the moon, I'm dying
Return to the moon, please
Return to the moon, I'm dying
Return to the moon, please

Don't make me wait for you at the corner of Eden Park
Don't make me wait for you at the Serpentine Wall4Embed
