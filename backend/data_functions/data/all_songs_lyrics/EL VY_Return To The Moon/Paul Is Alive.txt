Paul Is Alive LyricsI had a sugar-coated childhood
The stars were in my soup
But given the opportunity
I’d start over and change it all
Beatlemania made my mother
Think the way she does
She always said
"Don’t waste your life wishing everything was how it was"
Paul is alive
I was in a moment for a moment
Then I wasn’t
I was sixteen years old in a dead guy’s boots
With my hair slicked to the side
Sitting outside the Jockey Club
Crying in my 7-up
I could hear Husker Du and The Smiths
The Sluggos, The Cramps go bup bup bup bup inside
Paul is alive
Nobody stays above
Out in the waves of love
Nobody stays above
Out in the waves of love
Inside the Jockey Club
I’m even
I’ve never been this far up the river
And I don’t want to go
Nobody makes you beg to be different
And there’s Foster's on the floor
If I go
Will I find
There’s a waiting line?
Maybe I should take my time
‘Cause I never heard of anybody coming back
Nobody stays above
Out in the waves of love
Nobody stays above
Out in the waves of love
Inside the Jockey Club
I’m even with heaven
I’ve never been this far up the river
And I don’t want to go
Nobody makes you beg to be different
And there’s Foster's on the floorEmbed
