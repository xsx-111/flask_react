Careless Lyrics
Didi, are you lost?
A Cadillac for your thoughts
Where do you go?
I don't wanna know

Don't be careless with me yet
Not yet
You're in a hurry
I'm stalling

Meet me tonight
You can drink, while I drive

Don't be careless with me yet
Not yet
I'm staying under spider web roads

Don't know what we're waiting for
People like us don't ever switch
Our videos from scene to scene
But I've been wanting you so long
I really don't know what to do
I don't know what you want from me
Didi, if you leave
I'll cling to your sleeve

Don't be careless with me yet
Not yet
I still love you
I'm still falling

I don't know what we're waiting for
People like us don't ever switch
Our videos from scene to scene
But I've been wanting you so long
I really don't know what to do
I don't know what you want from me

It's agony
It's agony
I don't know what we're waiting for
People like us don't ever switch
Our videos from scene to scene
It's agony
It's agony3Embed
