Happiness, Missouri Lyrics
While away while someone counts the minutes
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
By the way, I told you we were in this
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off it
While away while someone counts the minutes
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
By the way, I told you we were in this
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off it


People are nice
They go easy on ice, but
I'm on the Sun today
I'm out of reach
Try to pinch my cheeks
Cause you're making me wanna sob

While away while someone counts the minutes
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off
By the way, I told you we were in this
Happiness, Missouri, I got to get your mind off itEmbed
