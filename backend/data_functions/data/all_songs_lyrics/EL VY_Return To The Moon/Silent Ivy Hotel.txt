Silent Ivy Hotel LyricsSilent Ivy waste of love...

How long have we been here
Sitting on the floor
Pool-water martinis
And a towel under the door

I still don't really know you
Very well
How long have we been coming here
To the Silent Ivy Hotel

It'll only last
For a silent ivy minute
A silent ivy minute
A silent ivy minute

It'll only last
For a silent ivy minute
It'll only last a while
We could stay here for ever
And never get it together
Wouldn't matter whatsoever
We'll never get it together
I put your hair in an arrangement
With helium and tape
I decided I would love you
I decided not to wait

We have an arrangement
We give each other pain
A little mine for yours
It's all pretty much the same

It'll only last
For a silent ivy minute
A silent ivy minute
A silent ivy minute

It'll only last
For a silent ivy minute
It'll only last a while
We could stay here for ever
And never get it together
Wouldn't matter whatsoever
We'll never get it together
It's a waste of love
It's a waste of love, love
It's a waste of love, love, love
It's a waste of love
It's a waste of love, love
It's a waste of love, love, love

It'll only last
For a silent ivy minute
A silent ivy minute
A silent ivy minute

It'll only last
For a silent ivy minute
It'll only last a while
We could stay here for ever
And never get it together
Wouldn't matter whatsoever
We'll never get it together

It's a waste of love
It's a waste of love, love
It's a waste of love, love, love
It's a waste of love
It's a waste of love, love
It's a waste of love, love, loveEmbed
