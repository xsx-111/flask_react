Need a Friend LyricsMeet me somewhere near the back
Where the bouncers won't attack
I think the world's about to end
I don't need your love, I just need a friend
I just need a friend to guard the door
I just need a couple minutes on the floor
I just need to talk to you for a second
I just need a break from the sound, cause it's killing me
You were supposed to be here before the last song
You were supposed to bring me your brother's weed
You were supposed to walk me home from the river, man
This is heartbreaking, heartbreaking, heartbreaking
Why are they talking to my father?
He's way behind the candelabra
Everyone is now and then
I don't need your love, I just need a friend
I just need a friend to guard the door
I just need a couple minutes on the floor
I just need to talk to you for a second
I just need a break from the sound, cause it's killing me
You were supposed to be here before the last song
You were supposed to bring me your brother's weed
You were supposed to walk me home from the river, man
This is heartbreaking, heartbreaking, heartbreaking
You were supposed to be here before the last song
You were supposed to bring me your brother's weed
You were supposed to walk me home from the river, man
This is heartbreaking, heartbreaking, heartbreaking, heartbreaking
Man, this is
Heartbreaking
Heartbreaking
Heartbreaking
Heartbreaking
