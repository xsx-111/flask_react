No Time to Crank the Sun LyricsNo time
To crank the sun
And dry our hair
Before we go
No time
To lay around
We’ll come back someday
No time
To change our minds
The pricks are always
On our heels
No time
To fight about it
This time we can’t be late
I was driving
Taking chances
Walking way too far out on
Some broken branches
Sometimes where you’re going
Is hard to see
I always knew there was
Something missing
They said no one could ever get me
To sit and listen
I was always
Trying to leave
Babe it got away from me
It got away from me
No time
To plant our feet
These things they always
Come from nowhere
No time
To lay around
We’ll come back someday
Nothing will ever just
Come to you, it’s only
What you find around and
What you do
If you don’t hold it tight
It’ll leave
I kept seeing you
All around me
I couldn’t just stand here and wait
Until you found me
I had to take you to make you
Believe
Babe it got away from me
It got away from me
It got away from me
It got away from me
It got away from me
If I wasn’t so gone tonight
I’d try to explain (It got away from me)
Some people just know what they want
It doesn’t change
If I wasn’t so gone completely
This would feel like pain
Some people just know what they want2Embed
