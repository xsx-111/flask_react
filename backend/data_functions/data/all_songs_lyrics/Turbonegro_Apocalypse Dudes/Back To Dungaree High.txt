Back To Dungaree High LyricsI didn't mean to turn you on, no way
Just wanna dance and sing my song, well, okay
Clocking in, clocking out, no, I don't mind it at all
Me and the danger dudes were on the news, so just don't bother to call
Because, because
It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive
So it's back, back to Dungaree High
Just to get by, back to Dungaree High
Just a great big boy with a teeny-weeny alibi
Just a soul on ice
With a mirror and a blade and a pocket full of mice
Cheap thrills done and the dirt cheap ants
'Cause I got a headache in my pants
It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive
So it's back, back to Dungaree High
Just to get by, back to Dungaree High
Just a great big boy with a teeny-weeny alibi
Throb throb
It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive, boy
It's just a way to stay alive, boy
It's such a trip just to survive
Back to Dungaree
