Are You Ready (For Some Darkness) LyricsAre you ready for some darkness?
Are you ready for some fun?
Do you wanna touch the night tonight?
Or do you want to grab your hat and run?
Are you ready for some action?
Are you ready for the void?
Do you wanna lose your mind tonight?
Do you wanna be a denim boy?
Are you ready for the night time?
Are you ready for the booth?
Do you wanna suck the goat tonight
And taste some outer space truth?
Are you ready to be punished?
Are you ready for some good old pain?
Do you want to belt it out tonight?
And do you, do you want the night to stay?
Or is it way to much?
Too much for you to touch?
You want it, you got it
But do have the guts?
So come on, give me a kiss
But don't give no lip
You saw it, you bought it
But you never paid for this
Are you ready for some darkness?
Are you ready for the show?
Do you wanna feel the heat tonight?
Or do you, do you want to hit the road?
Do you really wanna get it?
Or do you, do you wanna shut the door?
Do you really wanna call it a day?
Or do you, do you want some more?
Or is it way too much?
Too much for you to touch?
You want it, you got it
But do you have the guts?
So come on, give me a kiss
But don't give me no lip
You saw it, you bought it
But you never paid for this
Are you ready for the panther?
Are you, are you ready for the light?
Do you wanna buzz the buzz again?
And are you, are you ready for the fight?
Are you ready? Are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready, yes, I'm ready
Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready
Are you ready for the light?Embed
