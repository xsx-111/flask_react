Rendezvous With Anus LyricsWalk the streets, what do I see
Shit on legs approaching me
Alright, I really want it
Oh, yeah, I gotta have it
Come on, baby, and dance again
Jerk that head and be my friend
Merging Zeus and Spartacus
In ren-ren-ren-ren-rendezvous with anus
With anus, yeah
B.O.S., buns of steel
Spandex ass to make me kneel, yeah
Gonna give you electric shock
Gonna give you electric rock
Come on, baby, and dance again
Jerk that head and be my friend
Merging Zeus and Spartacus
In ren-ren-ren-ren-rendezvous with anus
With anus, yeah
With anus, oh, yeah
With anus, oh, yeah
Come on now
Looking good and feeling clean
Classic buttocks on the scene
Cars go by, they're out of luck
Eyeball ass, eyeball stuck
Come on, baby, and dance again
Jerk that head and be my friend
Merging Zeus and Spartacus
In ren-ren-ren-ren-rendezvous with anus
With anus, yeah
With anus, oh, yeah
With anus, yeah, oh1Embed
