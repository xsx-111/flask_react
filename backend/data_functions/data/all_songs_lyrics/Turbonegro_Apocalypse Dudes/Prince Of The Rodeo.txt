Prince Of The Rodeo LyricsYeah
Hi-ridin' daddy-o
Prince of the rodeo
Spur-hump hey-ho let's go
Prince of the rodeo
Fornicator of the lasso
Prince of the rodeo
Sperminator of the asshole
Prince of the rodeo
Shoot the chute
Pull the flute
I'm back in the saddle
The world's most promising cowboy
Lo-ridin' daddy-o
Prince of the rodeo
Sexy denim romeo
Prince of the rodeo
Rhinestone homo rock-n-roll
Prince of the rodeo
Buns of steel Geronimo
Prince of the rodeo
Jerk that calf
Half-n-half
I'm back in the saddle
The world's most progressive cowboy
And don't forget the clown
I'm ridin' high
I'm ridin' low
Prince of the rodeo
I'm ridin' high
I'm ridin' low
Prince of the rodeo
I'm ridin' high
I'm ridin' low
Prince of the rodeo
I'm ridin' high
I'm ridin' low
Prince of the rodeo
I'm ridin' high, I'm ridin' low
I'm ridin' high, I'm ridin' low
Prince of the rodeo
I'm ridin' high, I'm ridin' low
I'm ridin' high, I'm ridin' low
Prince of the rodeoEmbed
