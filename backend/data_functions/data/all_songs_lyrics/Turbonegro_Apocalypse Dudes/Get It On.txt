Get It On LyricsGimme friction baby, and I like it
Gimme friction baby, and I like it, love it
Gimme deathpunk baby, and I like it
Gimme deathpunk baby, and I like it, love it, like it, love it
Get it on
Right on
Gimme shiny beast, and I like it
Gimme shiny beast, and I like it, love it
Gimme teen machine, and I like it, yes I do
So young, firm and clean, and I like it, love it, like it, love it
Get it on
Right on
What do you want?
What do you want?
I wanna get it on
Right onEmbed
