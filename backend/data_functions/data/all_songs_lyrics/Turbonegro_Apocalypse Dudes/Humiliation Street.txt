Humiliation Street LyricsHumiliation Street
Where all the danger kids meet
The dagger dudes and the dirt done cheap
That's what I say
Humiliation Row
Where all the hollow kids glow
Pusslead panthers in the dirty snow
That's what I say
Humiliation Street
Humiliation
Humiliation Hill
Cowboys in for the thrill
Dimebag daddys with a dynamite kill
That's what I sayEmbed
