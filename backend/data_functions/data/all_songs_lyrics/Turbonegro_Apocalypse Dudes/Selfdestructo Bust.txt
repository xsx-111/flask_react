Selfdestructo Bust LyricsI ain't no architect
Ain't got the intellect
I gotta get away
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bust
I ain't no fireman
I lost it in the can
I gotta get away
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bust
I got a steel machine
I got a mongo's dream, yeah, yeah
I gotta get away
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bust
I gotta get away
My time will fade away
I'm gonna spend it in the dust
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bust
Yes, it's true
Ain't gonna ride that yellow bus
Yes, it's true
I got a selfdestructo bustEmbed
