Rock Against Ass LyricsIt took a while but now it's back
Back from the lab, it's in my hat
So you better run home!
Get on the motherfucking phone
It's time to rock aganst ass, so
Pick up the motherfucking stone
Well, I'm not in a hurry, no, I ain't in a rush
That rock is such a gift so make it last
No, I'm not in a hurry
But that ride is such a blast
I said lord take me downtown
'Cause it's a rock against ass
So you better think fast
So you better get back
I had no choice, I cut the leash
You can't control that rocky beast
So you bether run home
Get on the motherfucking phone
It's time to rock against ass, so
Pick up the motherfucking phoneEmbed
