Zillion Dollar Sadist LyricsI used to be such a welfare stoner
I used to be such a twilight zoner
I used to be such a money-bumming boozer
I used to be such a masochistic schmoozer
But now I'm worldwide
You know that I made it
I'm above the law
I'm the zillion dollar sadist
Zillion dollar sadist
What do you want, what do you want for nothing, baby
What do you want, what do you want for free
I tell you what you need: it's some Hanky-action, baby
I wanna hear you scream in denim ecstasy, yes, indeed
'Cause now I'm worldwide
You know that I made it
I'm above the law
I'm the zillion dollar sadist
Zillion dollar sadist
Well c'mon
Yeah, now I'm worldwide
You know that I made it
I'm above the law
I'm the zillion dollar sadist
Take it to the bridge
I promise fun
To all and everyone
No questions asked
It's gonna be great
A new dimension of fun
Do anything you wanna do...Embed
