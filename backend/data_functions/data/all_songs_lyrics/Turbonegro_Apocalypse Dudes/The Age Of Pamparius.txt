The Age Of Pamparius LyricsFrom the ashes of this golden age of confusion
The denim recruits came to be
Known as the apocalypse dudes
So you think you had an Opera?
Well not like this!
So you think you had a Napoli?
Well not like this!
So you think you had a decent pizza?
Well not like this!
So you think you had a real good pizza?
Well not like this!
You got nothing to lose at Pamparius
Gonna wear them happy shoes tonight
You got nothing to lose at Pamparius
Gonna bake a motherfucking pizza tonight
Alright!
So you think you had a pepperoni?
Well not like this!
So you think you had a calzone?
Well not like this!
So you thought you could make your own?
Well not like this!
So you thought you could take it home?
Well not like this!
You got nothing to lose at Pamparius
Gonna wear them happy shoes tonight
You got nothing to lose at Pamparius
Gonna bake a motherfucking pizza tonight
Motherfucking pizza tonight!
Apocalypse dudes got nothing to lose
Gonna stomp some teenage ass tonight
Apocalypse dudes got nothing to lose
Gonna bake some motherfucking magic
Tonight...tonight...tonight..well alright!2Embed
