Good Head LyricsGood head
Sweeping floors at the mill all day
Dropped out of school just to get away
I'm just a kid, but I'll soon be dead
And all I want is some good, good, good, good head
Good head
Flipping pizzas on a Saturday night
Classy asses to the left and right
"Have you ever been laid?" she said
Fuck you, I'd rather have some good, good, good, good head
