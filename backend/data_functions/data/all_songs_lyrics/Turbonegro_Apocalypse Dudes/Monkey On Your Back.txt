Monkey On Your Back LyricsYou claim the monkey is obscene
You claim the monkey is unclean
I've seen the monkey and his deeds
I've met that mother in his dreams
You paint it white, I paint it black
I'll be the monkey on your back
On your back
On your back
On your
Monkey on your back
You claim the monkey made you fall
You claim the monkey shaved your balls
I seen the monkey and his deeds
I tell you, brother, set him free
You paint it white, I paint it black
I'll be the monkey on your back
On your back
On your back
On your
Monkey on your back
You paint it white, I paint it black
I'll be the monkey on your back
You paint it white, I paint it black
I'll be the monkey on your back
On your back
On your back
On your
Monkey on your backEmbed
