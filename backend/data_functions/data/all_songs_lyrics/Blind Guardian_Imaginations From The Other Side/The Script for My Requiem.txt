The Script for My Requiem LyricsHallowed be the fatherland
God he knows
How long I'd been away
From here I did start for a search so
Full of disease
I still hear my cry outs
From the old cellars inside
Born in the days of medieval
My inner voice
Is always asking why
I came from nowhere
Without a task, without a name
Don't fear my evil
Fate, so, God, please lead me through
Forgotten realms
Mysterious dreams
In sunless rooms I'd sworn
I'll finish what I started, once
I'll find my holy grail
In the holy land
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry
I went out of my mind
In desert lands
Insanity's pawn
Out of control
Much too long I've been isolated
From my thoughts
Enclosed by the leader's spell
Bewildered to march
As a glory knight
And I tried
Still I hear the scream of thousands:
Crucified, crucified
"Take it all
Our gold, our home, our life
But we didn't kill your Christ!!
Reach out for your holy grail
Enslave us and make us
Your god's sacrifice!!"
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cry
Yes, I cry
Still I'm confused
If I was dreaming
Too late I realized
I'd been another fool
I pay the price
I pay the price
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
The jester's tears
They are inside me
Agony's the script for my requiem
Returning of the miracles
It's my own requiem
Is the script already written
Jester's tears I cryEmbed
