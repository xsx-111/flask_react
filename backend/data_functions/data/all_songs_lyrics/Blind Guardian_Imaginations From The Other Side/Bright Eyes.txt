Bright Eyes LyricsFool, just another
Fool, just another
Fool, just another
Fool, just another
Fool, just another
Fool, just another
Fool, just another
Fool, just another
I've been
Waiting
For signs
Of god
Create, enslaved, behaved
Everything is out of control
Get lost in a cold world
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Leave me alone, isolation bears hope
There's something else waiting
A promised destiny
Freezing me, I feel restless and low
These days full of sadness had joyfully changed into fear
My freakshow will start tonight (Into fear)
Don't miss the right time
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side
Everything is out of control
Everything is out of control
In my future plans
Everything is out of control
No one's left to hurt
Everything is out of control
Sorrow's gone away
Broken memories
Walking upstairs
Step by step
I see the whole world burning
The poet dies in Neverland
How it burns
Hey mother stubborn, I really hate you
If you say yes
I will say no
Ashes to ashes, but dust won't be dust
If you go there
I will go back
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
Betrayed by sunrise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Watching you, watching you
Hey father stubborn, you're yin and I'm yang
I feel alone
Who really cares
Born into ashes, to lose all the games
With a smiling face
(With a smiling)
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
And dark dragons rise
Bright eyes
Blinded by fear of life
No Merlin is by my side
So I sit still in my room, today
Winter's here in summer's season
Shall I say I was wrong if I'm right
A farewell to my last hope1Embed
