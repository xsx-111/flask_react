And the Story Ends Lyrics(And the story ends
Insanity said coldly still, waiting for the chance)
So out of nowhere it will rise
(Oh, and another journey starts)
By the call of the moon
Was it really me I saw in the mirror screaming
I swallowed hate and lies through a thousand cries
Someone's sucking out my energy, power
What can I do on this road to nowhere
(Heart of dragon lies)
At the edge of time
And the story ends...
(Insanity said coldly still, waiting for the chance)
So out of nowhere it will rise
(Oh, and another journey starts)
Into insanity's claws
Come with me
And join me
A new life's waiting for you
Jump through the mirror
Leave fear behind
No matter where I tried, the candle light seemed lost forever
(Before my vision fades, cathedral, falling tears)
We're not alone, there's someone else, too from the mirror's other side
Reflecting the cruel part of your soul, it's time for your choice
What can I do on this road to nowhere
(Heart of dragon lies)
At the edge of time
And the story ends...
(Insanity said coldly still waiting for the chance)
So out of nowhere it will rise
(Oh, and another journey starts)
By the call of the moon
(Solo)
(Heart of dragon lies)
Heart of dragon lies
What can I do on this road to nowhere
(Heart of dragon lies)
At the edge of time
And the story ends...
(Insanity said coldly still, waiting for the chance)
So out of nowhere it will rise
(Oh, and another journey starts)
Into insanity's claws
I'm not a king, I'm just a bard
How can I trust, there's good and bad
The wounds of life will remain
At least I found a friend1Embed
