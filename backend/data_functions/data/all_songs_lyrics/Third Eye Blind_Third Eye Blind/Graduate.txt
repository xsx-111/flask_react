Graduate Lyrics
Knock it all down!
Will the song live on long after we do?
Will the song live on?
Can I graduate?

Can I look at faces that I meet
Can I get my punk ass off the street
I've been living on for so long
Can I graduate
To the bastard talking down to me
Your whipping boy calamity
Cross your fingers
I'm going to knock it all down

Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?

Echo fading we can't let go
She goes walking by in slow-mo
Sell your heart out for a buck
Go on fade out before I get stuck
Talking to somebody like you
Do you live the days you go through?
Will this song live on long after we do?
Can I graduate?
Can I look in faces that I meet?
Can I get my punk ass off the street?
Won't die on the vine
I want to knock it all down
Can I graduate?
Echo fading, candle blow
Did you flash out long ago
Cross my fingers, I don't know
Someone poked you down below

Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?

Can I get my punk ass off the street?
Can I look in faces that I meet?
I'm not waiting here for you to die
Will this song live on long after we do?
Long after we do1Embed
