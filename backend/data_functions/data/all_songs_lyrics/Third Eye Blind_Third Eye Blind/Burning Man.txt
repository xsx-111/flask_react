Burning Man Lyrics
The rise and fall of my sloppy love
The smatterings, and splatterings
They'll get you
I'm not the one you were thinking of
Maybe you thought I'd call
Instead of crashing down your hall

Hold me down, I wanna find out
You know you will never get what you need

Blue Diamonds, strike 'em anywhere
First we caffeinate then incinerate
We'll get you
And sparks will fly in the summer air
Did you pull out of your stall
Maybe I'll see you after all

Hold me down, I want to find out
We say no 'cause I live my life like a burning man
Like a burning man, a burning man
Like a burning man
And I won't get enough until my legs are broken
The lies they fall and shine in an void
Life is not to fear, life is to enjoy
He'll get you
Oh, Mr. Death catches all someday
Baby I thought you'd call
Or leave a light on in the hall

Hold me down but I'll find out
We say no, 'cause I live my life like a burning man
Like a burning man, a burning man
Like a burning man
Hold me down, I wanna find out
We say no 'cause I live my life like a burning man
Like a burning man, a burning man
Like a burning man
And I won't get enough, until my legs are brokenEmbed
