Good for You Lyrics
Hey, will you stay awhile
My smile will not mislead you
Cause I've been alone
My faith turned to stone
Still there's something in you that I believe in

Close to your pierce, I go wild and fierce
Still I let you be, I feel you next to me
Cause inside I feel a wind that starts to blow
I'm taken in your undertow
Everything is fine, I'm lonely all the time

Cause all I want to do is be there
For the things that you're going through
Well, is it good for you? Is it good for you?
Cause you haunt my nights when
I don't know where my life should go
Well, is it good for you?
Is it good for you?

Hey child, please stay awhile
My smile will not mislead you
Cause I've been without, I go wild with doubt
I grab at you, I can't stop grabbing at you
Cause I feel you cross my mind
In disarray, intoxicated ricochet
There's nothing wrong just don't take too long
Cause all I want to do is be there
For the things that you're going through
Well, is it good for you? Is it good for you?
Cause you haunt my nights when
I don't know where my life should go
Well, is it good for you?
Is it good for you?


Cause all I want to do is be there
For the things that you're going through
Well, is it good for you? Is it good for you?
Cause you haunt my nights when
I don't know where my life should go
Well, is it good for you?
Well, is it good for you?1Embed
