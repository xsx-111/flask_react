Losing a Whole Year Lyrics
(Losing a whole year)
(Losing a whole year)
I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamn day in bed
(Losing a whole year)
Hiding in your room we'd lay like dogs
And the phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid
(Losing a whole year)

Rich daddy left you with a parachute
Your voice sounds like money and your face is cute
But your daddy left you with no love
You touch everything with a velvet glove and
Now you wanna try your life with sin
You wanna be down with the down and in
Always copping my truths
I kinda get the feeling like I'm being used
And now I realize that you never heard
One goddamn word I ever said

(Losing a whole year)
(Losing a whole year)
I took your stuff and put it in the basement
When I found out what the smile on your face meant
I seen you pop that check
Craning your neck at the car wreck
And it always seems that the juice used to flow
In the car, in the kitchen you were good to go
Now we're stuck with the tube
A sink full of dishes and some aqua lube

And I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamn day in bed
Hey, bye

Hey, bye
(Losing a whole year)

If it's not the defense then you're on the attack
When you start talking I hear the Prozac
Convinced you found your place
With the pierced queer teens in cyberspace
When you were yourself there was tasting sweet
Sours into a routine deceit
Well this drama is a bore
And I don't wanna play no more
Whoa why
Whoa, why
(Losing a whole year)
I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamn day in bed

Hey, bye
Hey, bye11Embed
