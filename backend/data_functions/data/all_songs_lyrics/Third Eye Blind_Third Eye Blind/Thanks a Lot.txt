Thanks a Lot Lyrics
"It's all in your mind," she said
The darkness and the light
The clock, it bleeds for you
But you never got the timing right
I woke you up
And I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right

All hands on deck, boys
'Cause this ship was made to sink
Your swabber salutes you now
But I know what he's thinking
I woke you up
And I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right

Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
You don't even know
Thanks a lot
The clothes she wears mis-fit
And she's nervous when she speaks
Her zombie mom and dad
Live in a separate house of freaks
I woke you up
And I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right

Thanks a lot
You don't even know
Thanks a lot


I'm the one for you
Cause I know all the dirty things you like to do
I'm the fear in your eyes
I'm the fire in your flies
I'm the sound that's buzzing around your head

Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
You don't even know
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lotEmbed
