I Want You Lyrics
The suckers lose themselves
In the games they learn to play
Children love to sing but
Then their voices slowly fade away
People always take a step away
From what is true
That's why I like you around

I want you
Oh you do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You're making me want you

An open invitation to the dance
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in
No apology because my urge is genuine
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine
Here I am and I want to take a hit
Of your scent cause it bit so deep into my soul

I want you
Yeah, you do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You make me want you
Oh you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do
I want you
And I can't get enough (You, you, you, you)
Oh, I can’t get enough
And I can’t get enough (Oh, oh, I, I, I)

The village church yard is filled with
Bones weeping in the grave
The silver lining of clouds
Shines on people Jesus couldn't save
You want to know how deeply my soul goes?
Deeper than bones
Deeper than bones

And, I can't get enough (I, I, I, I, I)
Oh, I can't get enough
Oh, I can’t get enough (You, you, you, you, you)
Oh, I can’t get enough

After we did it by the windowsill
Smoke rings drifted through the midnight sky
Presently in the quilt that your mother made
A bare candle burns to fight off the gloom
You said to live this way is not for the meek
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep
I said there'll be no regrets when the worms come
And they shall surely come
Oh, you do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do, you do
Make me want you
(Send me all your vampires)
Yeah, I do, you do, you do, you do
You do, you do, you do
Make me want you
(Send me all your vampires)
I want you
(Send me all your vampires)
I want you
(Send me all your vampires)
...
(Send me all your vampires)
...
(Send me all your vampires)
(There will be no regrets when the worms come)Embed
