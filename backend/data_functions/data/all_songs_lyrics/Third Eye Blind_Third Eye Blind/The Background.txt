The Background Lyrics
Everything is quiet
Since you're not around
And I live in the numbness now
In the background
I do the things we did before
I walk Haight Street to the store
And they say, "Where's that crazy girl?"
You don't get drunk on red wine and fight no more
I don't see you anymore since the hospital

The plans I make still have you in them
'Cause you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words
Like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly
I only feel for you
I only know because I carry you around
In the background
I'm in the background

Words, they come and memories all repeat
I lift your head while they change the hospital sheets
And I would never lie to you no
I would never lie to you no
I felt you long after we were through, we were through
The plans I make still have you in them
'Cause you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words
Like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly
I only feel for you
I only know because I carry you around
In the background


'Cause I felt you long after we were through

Well, you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words
Like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly
I only feel to you
I only know because
I'm way, I'm way in the background
I'm in the background4Embed
