Hazey Jane II Lyrics
What will happen in the morning
When the world it gets so crowded
That you can't look out the window in the morning?

And what will happen in the evening
In the forest with the weasel
With the teeth that bite so sharp
When you're not looking in the evening?

And all the friends that you once knew are left behind
They kept you safe and so secure
Amongst the books and all the records of your lifetime

What will happen, in the morning
When the world it gets so crowded
That you can't look out the window in the morning?

Hey, take a little while to grow your brother's hair
Now, take a little while to make your sister fair
And now that the family
Is part of a chain
Take off your eyeshade
Start over again
Now, take a little while to find your way in here
Now, take a little while to make your story clear
Now that you're lifting your feet from the ground
Weigh up your anchor and never look 'round

Let's sing a song for Hazey Jane
She's back again, in my mind
If songs were lines in a conversation
The situation would be fine4Embed
