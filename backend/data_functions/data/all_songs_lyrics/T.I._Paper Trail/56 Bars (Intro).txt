56 Bars (Intro) Lyrics
Yeahhhhh (hey!)
Hahaha, hey, hey, ha (all right)
Aight Toomp, man
This what the folks been waiting on, I guess (that's right)
Let's give it to 'em, baby (hey!)
Grand Hustle, nigga
Aye, man
They been waitin on this shit since "What You Know," huh?
Yeahhhh, it's the King, bitch!
Aight, my nigga, the wait is over, nigga
Hey, hey!

One for the money, two for the show dawg
Three for the niggas hatin on the low, y'all
Know a picture's worth a million words I'mma show y'all
Death before dishonor, family befo' all
Without the braids I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Minus the testimony; say it ain't so homie
Hey! Shorty like that, don't he?
World hopped off my jock, I got 'em right back on it
Ohh! Step back, brush myself off
Picked bid'ness back up right where I left off
I could show my dough, that other guy just talk
Hey where I live just as big as yo' projects dawg
AY! Ha ha, better check my swagger
How I walk, how I talk, how I stack that cheddar
What I drive, how I dress, nigga let's just bet a
Hundred stacks on that, nigga I'm just, better
Hahahaha, somebody better tell 'em mayne
They swag owe my swag everythang
It's very plain to see you study me awful hard
To the point that my swag need a bodyguard
I think a Thank You card's in order, y'all oughta be
Havin y'all swag sendin mines an apology
A lot of little me's I see, got beef
But what's the possibilities? Stop seek, you not me
Hardly worth a hill of beans, step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated; don't see how half of you rappers made it
Say good-bye to the fame and fortune, c'est la vie
And what the game need with you nigga? They got me
I ride through the city, so clean, seat really low
Automo-bil-ey so, pretty but I'm illy though
No comparison, ain't a nigga mo', thorough than
This gangsta American flow, doper than heroin
King like Evelyn, Champagne mayne
So deranged and belligerent; right up there with Benjamin
Who? Andr√© 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK
Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and, Lupe
So fuck what you say, you welcome to ask who you may
Bet they say as of today I'm back on top like a toupee
Hey! All objections overruled, it's overdue
Both high, and sober too, I'm so high, up over you
Same guy you see in the streets is as fly as here in the booth
So don't be surprised when you meet me to see I'm really the truth
Ooh, so uncouth, nigga who want proof?
Must agree if shit I did can't no one undo
I stay on my, one-two, nigga who want to
Turn a brunch into a brawl, do what you gon' do
I'm why it's, hot as a bitch in here still, cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission dear
Think that was somethin, listen here2Embed
