Swing Ya Rag Lyrics
Woo! (Swizzy)
Need y'all to take y'all rags out, man (T.I.)
And let it swing, swing, swing, swing
Let it swing, swing, swing (ATL!)

Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (I don't dance), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (Don't dance), no way (No way)
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Hey, swang!

New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag (Gucci rag)
Tied to my belt loop and my Louis bag (Hey)
Full of stacks, rubber bands, round big cash (Yeah)
Got a sick swag 'til the haters get mad, come on
We in the club, homes (Hey), getting our thug on
Bottles of Patron, if you're grown, get your buzz on (Yeah)
We bought the bars out (Yeah) and brought the cars out (Yeah)
I'm like the moon howI shine and bring the stars out (Haha)
When it's dark out (Okay), get the squad out
We ball hard, sucka nigga, eat your heart out (Sucka nigga!)
I'm too advanced, super swag in my Louis pants (Yeah, yeah)
Balling on my Louis silk shirt, match my Louis rag (Yeah, yeah)
Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (Uh-uh), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (Uh-uh), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Hey, swang!

I say, "Whoa, kemosabe," big balling is my hobby (Hey)
I'm bopping while I'm walking, rag falling out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic, homie, I ain't even talking (Uh-uh)
Hated on by the workers, but I'm cool with all the bosses (Oh)
Catch me flossing at the mall (Mall), talking to a broad (Broad)
She follow me in Gucci, and I taught her how to ball (Ball)
Three pair of shoes, four shirts, six rags (Rags)
The chick said, "Dag, that's more than my bag" (Haha)
Shawty, I can show you how to spend this bread real fast (Fast)
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast (Fast)
Silk scarf hanging out of my jeans
No, homie, I ain't banging, I'm just doing my thing!

Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (Uh-uh), no way (Hey, hey)
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (Uh-uh), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Hey, swang!
I took some time off (Okay), and now I'm back y'all (That's right)
You in the line at the club, I'm in the back, dog (Haha)
And when this song's on, ballers peel stacks off
And make it rain on them broads, watch them stacks fall
Ayy, pull your rag out (That's right), and wave it left, right
Let it sag with your pants, get your swag just right (Ha)
Riding Bankhead, flag flying out the Benz
Once a fool with it, ooh, we gon' bring them out again

Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance, no way (Hey, hey)
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Alright (Alright), okay (Okay)
I don't dance (Uh-uh), no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it 'round in the air
Swang!3Embed
