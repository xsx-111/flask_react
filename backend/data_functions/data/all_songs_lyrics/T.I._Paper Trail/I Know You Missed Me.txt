I Know You Missed Me Lyrics
I know you miss me, I know you miss me..

They say the city ain't the same and the nightlife died
Since T.I.'s inside, like the streets been quiet
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know
The say the thugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know

Yeah, y'know I do it for the city and err'body that's in it
The generals and lieutenants salute how I represent it
Since I've been sittin' a minute, know err'body be missin me
Walkin off in the club, gettin err'body attention
When I'm out, record was spinnin, they start it from the beginning
Get bottles of Cris' n' Remy and pass it out to the women
Pull out a stack of twenty, throw it up to the ceilin
Watch it fall to the flo', start throwin some mo'
Ask anybody you know, wherever party you go
With me in the V.I.P., know that shit was outta control
If I pull up in a Mercedes, or hoppin out of the Rouge
Continue hatin but hey, I'm the flyest guy that you know
Ay East Coast, West Coast, Midwest, South
I keep a fire marshal at the do' stressed out
Line stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down
Been a minute in the city since it really went down, ain't it?

I'm gettin calls err'y evening, sayin the streets need me
I'm at it just as soon as I'm able pimpin believe me
Niggas talkin greasy but they don't wanna see me
They know where to find me, soon as they release me
Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat figures
Hey, one stack, two stacks, three stacks, fo'
Nigga, five stacks, gon' tell 'em bring ten mo'
And Lamborghinis' and Apollos', they see me they screamin holla
The robbers follow the ballers, so {?} in my products
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter
Long as I been sittin still, niggas still ain't caught up
Atlanta you know I run it, err'body astonished
'Ey gotta stay in their houses like err'ybody were punished
Tell 'em they can quit frontin and them suckas sit down
Let 'em know the king comin and he shut this shit down, homie


And err'y time I take the city back
And wear my crown, nigga give me dat - dat, dat
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know
I did my thang, stack my millis
Now it time for me to bring back my city, ay
Ay, I know you miss me, I know you miss me - I know, I know
