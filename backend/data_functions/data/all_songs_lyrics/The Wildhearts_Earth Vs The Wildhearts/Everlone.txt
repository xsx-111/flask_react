Everlone LyricsLife has teeth, and bites the feeding open hand
You wanna be in a band?
I got to feeling, I got too much, too soon, too fucked up I don't know
I got to get to the show
Well... what have I got to do?
What have I got to do to get through to you?
Well... what have I got to do?
What have I got to do to get next to you?
Like a telephone call would do, fuck it
CHORUS:
Everlone, everlone
A thousand fake heroes appear at the throne (of)
Everlone, into the great unknown
Leaving it all to fade for a while
'til the fire in my eyes passes by
When ideas run out, any fool can make a fist
I got the will to resist
I got the power of one, the fear of none, the arms to judge a man
I bet you don't understand
Well... what have I got to do?
What have I got to do to get through to you?
Wellâ€¦ what have I got to do?
What have I got to do to get next to you?
Like a telephone call would do, fuck it
CHORUS
Passes by - like a train, like the strangers all around
Passes by - like a pain, like the only friend I've found
But if you mix self-confidence with some common sense
Maybe then you'll realise you touch me never, never, ever...
(... ever (x7))
