My Baby Is A Headfuck Lyrics"Gee mister you got the best answering machine message I ever heard"
Drags me round all day just like a ball
On a chain or a tooth pain when I confess...
I'm just a mess
Do I have to take this shit from you every time I
Look your way or say "HEY! it's about time
You show me yours and I'll show you mine"
And I hope you can keep that turd eating grin of yours
Upon your face when you find that you're thrown to one side
'cos no-one likes a rotten roller coaster ride
CHORUS:
'cos she's the kind of girl who'll take your heart
And leave you feeling worse than you did at the start
'cos she's a headfuck, my baby is a headfuck
In a bygone age engaged in the passion trip
A final score was required just to make it worthwhile
All the patience and the wasted time
For it seems today the play (did mutate into) a movie scene
Where the aim is to get the best line
Crashing heads for the second time
CHORUS:
'cos she's the kind of girl who'll break your mind
And make an easy meal of the sensitive kind
'cos she's a headfuck, my baby is a headfuck
(oh no... day tripper, prick teaser yeah)
(doo... wop-wop a-oo...)
So a parting word to those young unfortunates who
Cannot get to sleep 'til one little snake uncurls
Raise a glass to the Underworld!
(doo... wop-wop a...)
You can try all week and still keep on waiting
It's a messed up, stressed out, loss situation where pearls
End up changing into headfuck girls
CHORUS:
'cos she's the kind of girl who'll steal your smile
And chuck it over there on the rest of the pile
'cos she's a headfuck, my baby is a headfuck (x3)
Headfuck me!
(head fuck (x10))
(...nice knowing...)Embed
