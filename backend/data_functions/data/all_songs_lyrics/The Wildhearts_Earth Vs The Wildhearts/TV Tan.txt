TV Tan LyricsI'm living on a land-mine
My body's ticking away, my cartoon eyelids
And my skin, a sickly grey
And if I waited by the 'phone line
I'd wait a couple of days so I'm here lying
On my bed, until I fade
I flick the channels one to one, I flick them through again
And all the time I'm dreaming better days
CHORUS:
And now I see no sun, I see no life behind my one-track mind
Here I need no fun, I need no time to find a new design
Move along I'm working on my 3-D TV tan
Softso KO - I need another show
Softso KO - it's just a part of the plan
Softso KO - there's only me and my TV Tan
Some day maybe I'll call you
I'll see whenever I'm free.. maybe Tuesday, when there's nothing on TV
20 Regal and a 4-pack
I guess I'm set for the night and anti-social, to keep in shape, thin and white
I light a smoke, and in'tween tokes, consult the TV guide
The bible for the pig who stays inside
CHORUS
Thinning, I'm thinning and insanely grinning
And fools peering
Out of my TV try hard to be funny
Unfortunate for me
They start to entertain ye
I'm living on a land-mine, the kind that never ignites
And I'm here waiting, here for nothing...
