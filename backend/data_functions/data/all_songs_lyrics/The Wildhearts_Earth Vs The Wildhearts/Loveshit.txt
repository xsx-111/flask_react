Loveshit LyricsWhen you're young and you say you believe it, man you're never gonna ch-ch-ch-change
You can read about it all in imaginary stories but you never get the glory 'cos in life it ain't the same
You give a bit, and you give a bit, and it's all you'll ever d-d-d-do
But you still keep believing in your loveshit
'cos you're hoping one day it'll happen to you, like
My baby with the sunset eyes, making moves that can burn my soul
Well it's the last song we'll ever hear before we go
CHORUS:
What can I do about this loveshit anyway?
There's nothing you can do to ease my mind
What can I do about this loveshit anyway?
D'you have to waste your life before you find
It's all loveshit
Sign your name on the dotted line, it's time for you to su-su-su-suffer
You're gonna wish you'd changed your mind in a-three weeks time
'cos then you('ll) find that one lover's like another
Say goodbye to it, maybe cry a bit, it's a waste of fucking t-t-t-tears
But you still keep believing in your loveshit
'cos if you ain't holding hands people say that you're queer
Teacher, teacher won't you open your eyes, teach me something that I need to know
'cos it's the last song we'll ever hear before we go
CHORUS
Oo oo oo-oo
It's a popular myth that we've grown up with since the age of man's desire
If it's true romance to be in your pants I don't buy, I don't buy, you know I don't buy
({lots of chatter including:}
Mmm...
... mentioned it, now what was your name?
â€¦ everybody does...
I bet the chorus comes now...
