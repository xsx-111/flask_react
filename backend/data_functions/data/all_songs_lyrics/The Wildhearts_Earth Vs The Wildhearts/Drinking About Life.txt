Drinking About Life LyricsI can be anything I want to be, anything you hate in me multiplied by twenty three
Sometimes in my head I think I'm someone else that makes me feel bad, badder than before
It's my life, my time, I can do what I wanna do
When did I give you an invite to come round here, make me feel bad, badder than before
It's my life, my time, I can do what I wanna do
It's my solo party, it's my body, and if I choose to abuse it with my lifestyle and my music
What the fuck! I can't lose! it's my life! why is it I can't keep you far enough away?Embed
