Came Back Haunted Lyrics
Ha-ha-haunted
The throat is deep and the mouth is wide
Saw some things on the other side
Made me promise to never tell
But you know me I can't help myself, no
Now I got something you have to see
They put something inside of me
Its smile is red and its eyes are black (black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)
I don't think I'll be coming back

I don't believe and I
I had to see
I came back haunted
I came back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted

Everywhere now reminding me
I am not who I used to be
I'm afraid this has just begun
Consequences for what I've done,  yeah
I don't believe and I
I had to see
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha


I don't believe and I
I had to see
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted
I said goodbye but I
I had to try and I
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted
You tried to tell me but I
(You tried to tell me but I)
I couldn't stop myself now
(I couldn't stop myself now)
I came back
I came back haunted
C-c-came back haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop
Came back ha-ha-haunted
Just can't stop9Embed
