Disappointed Lyrics
If I were you
I wouldn’t trust
A single word
I say
Think by now
You should know
Nothing’s going
To change

Can I ask you something?
What did you expect?
So disappointed
With what you get
Do you ever want to
Just get out of here?
So disappointed
You disappear

Look at you
Superman
With all the world
To save
You think by now
You’d figure out
That nothing’s going
To change
And I am part of the reason
Can I ask you something?
What did you expect?
So disappointed
With what you get
Do you ever want to
Just get out of here?
So disappointed
You disappear2Embed
