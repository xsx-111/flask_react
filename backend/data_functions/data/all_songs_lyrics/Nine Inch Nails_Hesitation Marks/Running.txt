Running Lyrics
I followed you again this morning
Just close enough to feel you near
Pretending everyone could see me
Just slip away and disappear

They're right behind
They're so inclined
They're all aligned
We're undermined
As good as blind
I'm out of time
So hard to find
So well-defined
They're all aligned
They're intertwined
We're undermined
They're so inclined
We're right behind
So hard to find
As good as blind
I'm out of time

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I had a friend, I think who knew me
I couldn't seem to make him stay
I know they're watching waiting for me
I know I'll never get away

I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this
I'm running out of places I can hide from this

I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'm running out, I'm running out, I'm running out
I'll never get away
I'll never get away
I'll never get away2Embed
