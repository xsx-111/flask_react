All Time Low Lyrics
Go
I've heard all I need to know
Your voice in fucking echo stereo
Well this particular scenario
Looks like another all time low
Why did you go and let them in
See this is where the fun begins
You barely even pierced the skin
Just wait 'til you see what is coming

Get down on the floor
Shut the goddamn door
Been down this road before
We’re coming back for more

So give me just a little, baby
Just something to get by
This is gonna last forever, baby
We’ll get the other side
And we will live forever, baby
And stretch across the sky
I'll follow right behind you, baby
We are never gonna die
Hey
Everything is not okay
We lost too much along the way
The passengers arrived today
It looks as though they're here to stay
This paranoia turns to fear
Just who was whispering in your ear?
Pretending, but I know you hear
Just how’d we fucking end up here?

So give me just a little, baby
(So give me just a little, baby)
Just something to get by
(Just something to get by)
This is gonna last forever, baby
(This is gonna last forever, baby)
We’ll get the other side
And we will live forever, baby
(And we will live forever, baby!)
And stretch across the sky
(And stretch across the sky)
I'll follow right behind you, baby
(I'll follow right behind you, baby!)
We are never gonna die
We're never gonna die
How did we get so high?

Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky
Stretch across the sky16Embed
