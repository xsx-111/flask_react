Satellite Lyrics
Data trails
Like fingernails
Scratch across
The sky
Hard to know
Figure out
Tell the truth
From lies
Everywhere
Listening
Every word
You say
Think I found
A way around
Yeah, I think I found
A way
Well, come on
Come on
Come on
Come on

Satellite
I'm watching you
I'm one step ahead
Satellite
I'm part of you
I'm inside your head
Yes we can
Yes we did
Eliminate
The spread
Better watch
What you think
What was that
You said?
Everywhere
And everything
And every word
You say
Think I found
A way around
Yeah I think I found
A way
Come on

Satellite
I'm watching you
I'm one step ahead
Satellite
I'm part of you
I'm inside your head
Satellite
I'm watching you
I'm one step ahead
Satellite
I'm part of you
I'm inside your head
Satellite
Satellite
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
(So very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
(So very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
(So very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
(So very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
(So very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
Satellite
(So very high)
I know you're up there somewhere
(So very high)
(So very high)Embed
