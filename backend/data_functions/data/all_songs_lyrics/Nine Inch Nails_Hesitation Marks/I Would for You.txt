I Would for You Lyrics
What a pathetic string of words
Just leave them lying on the floor
The warning posted on the door
Not over here, not anymore
There was a place that could have been
Step over all that used to be
Since you have let yourself come in
Some things I'd rather you not see

See, I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well, I think I would for you

Didn't it seem like something more?
So long, I can't remember when
All this has happened all before
And this will happen all again
And I only have myself to blame
And I only have myself to blame

See, I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well, I think I would for you
See, I keep lying to myself
Don't know what else there is to do
If I could be somebody else
Well, I think I would for you5Embed
