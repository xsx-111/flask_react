In Two Lyrics
Split
Split into
Something else
Shed
Your precious skin
Save yourself
Bleed
Have to purge
What you were
Yes
Yes, of course
This is gonna hurt

Nature is violent
The very nature of this is violence
No no no no no that was someone else
No no no no no no no that wasn't me

It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I don't believe you can even remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
Thrive
Just become
Your disease
Leave
Them behind
You are free
Take
What you want
What you deserve
Yes
Yes, of course
This is gonna hurt

It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart
I don't believe you can even remember which one you are
It's getting harder to tell the two of you apart

I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know anymore
I just don't know6Embed
