Various Methods of Escape Lyrics
Hallucinate in high fidelity
The pieces of a plan
Construction of the highest quality
The blood from my own hand
A line of lyric looping in my head
Nobody listening
I guess it really doesn't matter anymore
I guess it doesn't mean a thing

I've got to let go
I've got to get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard?
Let me get away

An effigy so wondrous to behold
A statement so profound
A place to bury everything I did
And burn it to the ground
The fire illuminates the final scene
The past repeats itself
I cannot tell the difference anymore
I cannot trust myself
I've got to let go
I've got to get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard?
Let me get away
I've got to let go
I've got to get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard?
Let me get away

I think I could lose myself in here
I think I could lose myself in here
I think I could lose myself in here
I think I could lose myself in here

I've got to let go
I've got to get straight
Why'd you have to make it so hard?
Let me get away
Got to let him go
Find another way
Why'd you have to make it so hard?
Let me get away2Embed
