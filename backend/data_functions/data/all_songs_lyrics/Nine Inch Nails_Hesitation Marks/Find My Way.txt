Find My Way LyricsLord my path has gone astray
I'm just trying to find my way
Wandered here from far away
I'm just trying to find my way
You were never meant to see
All those things inside of me
Now that you've gone away
I'm just trying to find my way
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh, ooo
Ohhh
I have made a great mistake
Pray the Lord my soul to take
The ghost of who I used to be
I can feel them come for me
It looks as though they're here to stay
I'm just trying to find my way
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh, ooo
OhhhOhhhPleaseOhhhI never meant toOhhhPleaseOhhhI never meant for thisI have been to every place
I have been to everywhere
I'm just trying to find my way
Oh, dear Lord, hear my prayer
I have been to every place
I have been to everywhere
I'm just trying to find my way
Oh, dear Lord, hear my prayer
I have been to every place
I have been to everywhere
I'm just trying to find my way
Oh, dear Lord, hear my prayer
I have been to every place
I have been to everywhere
I'm just trying to find my way
Oh, dear Lord, hear my prayer5Embed
