Sweet Rowena LyricsMayday, man over board
I?ve fallen in love with you
Baby, won't you save me?
'Cause without you I just won't pull through
Sweet Rowena, won't you call my number?
Sweet Rowena, won't you call my name?
Throw me a line, I'm going under
And my heart is going up in flames
SOS, I'm in distress
Drown in a pool of tears
Angel, tell me how you feel?
Spending your time up in here
Sweet Rowena, won't you dial my number?
Sweet Rowena, won't you call my name?
Throw me a line, I'm going under
And my heart is going up in flames
911 no need to come
Just cancel my emergency (oh my emergency baby)
The sweetest thing, Lord, I've ever seen
Is snuggled right here next to me
Sweet Rowena, she dialed my number
Sweet Rowena, she called my name
Pull back the covers, I'm going under (going under baby)
And my house is going up in flames (up in flames)
Sweet Rowena, she dialed my number (call my number baby)
Sweet Rowena, she called my name
Pull back the covers, I?m going under (going under now)
Lord the house is going up in flames (oh in flames yes)
Oh yes it is babyEmbed
