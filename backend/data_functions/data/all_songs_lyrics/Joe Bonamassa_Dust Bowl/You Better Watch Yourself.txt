You Better Watch Yourself LyricsYou better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you
Well you steal my heart, and you go away
Don't tell me you'll see me another day
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you
Well I give you all my love
All my things too
Fine Cadillac baby watcha gonna do?
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on you
Well people are talkin'
All over town
You say you're gonna love me but you put me down
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
You better watch yourself
I've got my eyes on youEmbed
