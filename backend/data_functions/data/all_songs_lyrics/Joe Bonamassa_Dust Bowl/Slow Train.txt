Slow Train LyricsThere's a slow train coming
It's movin' on down the line
Steel wheels on iron rails
Tonight I'm fixin' to die
Woo, I hope you don't mind pretty mama
Woo-hoo, hope you don't mind if I go
Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I ain't gonna see you anymore
There's a slow train coming
Coming right on time
Smokestacks and bottle lightning
This jumper on the line
Woo, I can't do without it anymore pretty mama
Yes, I can't do it without it anymore
Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I ain't gonna see you anymore
There's a slow train coming
To march us home from war
With my leather boots and my haversack
Sure can take it no more
Woo, I cried for her baby when I saw you there
Woo-hoo, I cried for her just the same
Cause when the steam from the slow train rises
I'm gonna cry for you just the same
Well there's a slow train coming
Carrying the mighty worker hordes
Eighteen days in the cotton field
Enough to put a man out of coup d'amour
Woo, It's time to move on pretty mama
Woo-hoo, Yes it's time to move on as I go
As the steam from my slow train rises
It's time for me to get on boardEmbed
