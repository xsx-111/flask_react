Heartbreaker LyricsWell my maker
Must've been a hard heartbreaker
And I'll tell you why
Said my maker
Must've been a hard heartbreaker (until you)
I'll tell you why
I'm breaking my own heart
Tryin' to love a faker
I tell your soul, hmm
Just like a blind, blind man
My little house is on fire
Hmm
Just like a blind man
My little house is on fire
I'm burning my own eyes out
Tryin' to reach the door
Well the sun is shining (well the sun it was shining)
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart (hmm my heart is cold, it is)
Well the sun is shining (well the sun is shining)
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart (reach my heart)
But I was cold
I'm wasting my whole life
Tryin' to make a new start
To make a new start
Hmm
Gonna make a new start
Gonna make a new start
Gonna make a new start
Make a new startEmbed
