Black Lung Heartache LyricsWell I'm a man of the mountain
I'm just made of dirt
Of this Earth I traveled
Like a shepherd and his herd
And I said hang on, hang on
Black lung heartache
I sleep in a modest house
These green hills I mind
And if I plow tend my children
Who will be by the side?
And I said hang on, hang on
Black Lung Heartache
I've shed many tears
Seems I can't shed no more
You can see them on the table
You can see 'em on the floor
Now I said hang on, hang on
Black lung heartache
I've seen many men
They become hard as nails
Carrying the hammers like keys to a jail
Now I said hang on, hang on
Black lung heartache
Now I said so long, so long
Black lung heartacheEmbed
