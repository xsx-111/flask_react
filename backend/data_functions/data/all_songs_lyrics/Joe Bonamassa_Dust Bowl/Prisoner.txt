Prisoner LyricsI've never been wrong
But you're the only one I trust to show me the way
I always hear your voice
And in my dreams I hear you calling
Out my name
What is it about you?
Some kind of light shines from your face
And I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
I've been taken
I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
Oh I've been taken
I've been hypnotized
Well eyes say everything
You want to keep me here forever, and I can't escape
One minute's so sincere
Then you completely turn against me
And I'm afraid
And you don't have to say you love me
'Cause if you want me now, I'll stay
And I can't turn away
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
I've been taken
Taken by surprise
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
Oh I've been taken
I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
I've been taken
I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
Oh I've been taken
I've been hypnotized
I'm like a prisoner
I'm like a prisoner
I'm like a prisoner
Captured in your eyes
Oh I've been taken
I've been hypnotized yesEmbed
