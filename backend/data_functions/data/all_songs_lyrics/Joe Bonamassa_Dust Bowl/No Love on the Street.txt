No Love on the Street LyricsBaby woke up nervous
She was sweating from the steam heat
She kicked off the covers
Fever burning bright, paranoia night
Five alarm alert repeats
This city never beats you
But it buries you so deep
'Cause there ain't no love
Ain't no love on the street
Baby's breathing deeply
She's listening to her heart beat
She walks into the kitchen
Dishes in the sink
Doesn't even matter
Maybe read a magazine
And the colored girls go
Whoop-de-doop-de-doop-de-doop-
Doop-de-doop-de-doop
'Cause there ain't no love
Ain't no love on the street
Baby needs a frame of reference
Some other place to go
An all night launderette
Light a cigarette
Jump an usherette
Babe's an all night diner
She's got a trucker's appetite
'Cause there ain?t ain't no love
Ain't no love on the streetEmbed
