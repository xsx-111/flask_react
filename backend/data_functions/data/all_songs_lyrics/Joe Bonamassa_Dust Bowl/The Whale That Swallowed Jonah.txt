The Whale That Swallowed Jonah LyricsWell, the sun is up and a-rising
The wagon's headed west
Now I can't shake that old suspicion
That I settled for second best
I've been frugal at my table
I've been conscious, I've been blind
Who ever said that 40 acres and a mule
Would ever keep me satisfied?
They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
Out in the deep blue
Sometimes I get that feeling
That same ol' whale swallowed me
They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
To put me through the test
Sometimes I get that feeling
That I'm different from the rest
Now the sons of tomorrow
Will come to me in time
Life is going by so fast now, baby
I haven't had a chance to change my mind
I feel it in my fingers
I can feel it in my bones
Maybe it's the whale's way of telling me
It's time to get yourself back home
They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
Out in the deep blue
Sometimes I get that feeling
That ol' whale swallowed me
They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
To put me through the test
Sometimes I get that feeling
That I'm different from the rest
They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
Now in the deep blue
Sometimes I get that feeling
That same ol' whale swallowed me
They say the whale that swallowed Jonah
To put me through the test
Sometimes I get that feeling
That I'm different from the rest1Embed
