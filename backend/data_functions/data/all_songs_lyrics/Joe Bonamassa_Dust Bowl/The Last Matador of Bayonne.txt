The Last Matador of Bayonne LyricsI hold out hope
But it stalls
Soon, the last curtain falls
A hundred years of past has spoken
All the great warriors
Are sown into history's flag
Like a book of the seven seals
Of the heroes (hero's?) past
Through fires, revolutions
Dust storms and conclusions
Will the show go on tonight'
For one more time
I fight on
Fight on
I'm the last matador of Bayonne
For tomorrow this place falls
Into silence
There's a path
Traveled by many
Say one more prayer for my family
Like a ship without a sail
Cast adrift
I fight on
Fight on
I'm the last matador of Bayonne
A hundred years of past
Now are goneEmbed
