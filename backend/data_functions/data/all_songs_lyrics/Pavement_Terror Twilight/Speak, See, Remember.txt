Speak, See, Remember Lyrics
Speak, see, remember
The crimes it took to get you through Deadbeat December
There's blood in the butter, the kitchens are closed for the holidays
You know that I've got to say
There's been a lot of talk since you're on to me
On, daddy, on

To find in the fishes, the creatures, the air
Been hangin' around
God loves ya, but what could he do?
Yeah, wha wha wha wha wha what could he do?

Passion and a lovin' suggestion gonna send ya
Into somebody's icy arms and now
Graphics will do the deal justice
It's a can't lose
Only two times or three or four or more

To find in the love in the creatures, the air
You're hangin' around
God loves ya, but what could he do?
Quit hangin' around
God loves ya, but what could he do?
What could he do?
Yeah, what could he do?
The terror twilight
It's hard to get down for it
The terror twilight
It's hard to get down for it
The terror twilight
It's hard to get down for it
The terror twilight
It's hard to get down for it

To love in the find in the creatures, the air
You're hangin' around
God loves ya, but what could he do?
My friend, you're hangin' around
God loves ya, but what could he do?
What could he do?
What could he do?

Buy now!
Develop the coast and raise the sight lines
The oceans are moving out and someday
Develop the coast and sell the air
You know if we could we'd sell the air
Stand back!
Expansion is what we do the best
I don't see the grass and the fields
I see an epicenter with agendas
And you are aware they must be next
I hope you're aware they must be next
Do it! Do it! Do it!1Embed
