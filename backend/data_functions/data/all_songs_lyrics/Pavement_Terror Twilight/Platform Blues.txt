Platform Blues Lyrics
(One, two, three, four.)
Cardiac kid
Kinda like it, kinda like it
Cardiac kid, don't go
Chronological on all your friends
First you'll cause accidents
Raise the roof, make us tense
Follow through to the ends
And we'll rip the heart out from the defense

The lion reaps his own reward
Serengeti nightmare for the echo tour
You're a nice guy and I hate you for that
Thanks to people like you I'm no longer that

Mandrake versus the snake
I got it on the camera for posterity
But my stolen wild orchids got cut
See those Sherpas chirpin' from the autobus
It's got the right to sit on that face
Well, it was put here for me because I am great
I've got the right to sit on that face
Everybody look at me and my wonderful place
Patty, Patty, Patty, you're so catty
And it's not fair because I like to doody-doddy-do
Catty, catty, catty, you're so Patty
And it's unfair because I like to doody-doddy-do with you
It's unfair 'cause I like to doody-doddy-doody-da with you
Di-da-di-doody-da with you1Embed
