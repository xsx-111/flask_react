Carrot Rope Lyrics
I want to say
It's my second hand wonder
A thing that recovers the doubt
Slim door
Like a rainstorm, you've got to do
What you want and say it
It's of my design assembled at the cut
Slim door
It's all right to shake, to fight, to feel
You go down, down, down, down
Slim door
It's all right to shake, to fight, to feel
You go down, down, down, down
Harness your hopes to the folks
With the liquor, with the ropes
Red, red ropes, periscopes
They've got everything you will ever need
Stored under the chair

Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Don't waste your precious breath explaining
That you are worthwhile
Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Simmer, simmer, simmer down
Be patient and I'll let you see my
Carrot rope, feed my thrill
I got beat by weather
Carrot rope, feed my thrill
I got beat by weather
Carrot rope, feed my thrill
It's time to get me off of the ground
The wicket keeper is down

Hey little boy, would you like to know
What's in my pocket or not?
It's no ploy, it's no gimmick
It's the chance of a lifetime to see
Something that's never seen by mere mortals
Except me
And myself
And sweet I, so what do you say?
Would you like to play 20 questions with me?

A little, little Christian lie
A little, little Christian lie
Debating if it's time
To drop the bomb on you, my dear
A little, little Christian lie
A little, little Christian lie
Let's get down to brass tacks and start it
A carrot rope, feed my thrill
I got beat by weather
A carrot rope, feed my thrill
I got beat by weather
Carrot rope, feed my thrill
It's time to get me off of the grounds
The wicket keeper is down
The wicket keeper is down
He gets me off of the grounds
