Cream of Gold Lyrics
So much for destiny
A pinprick on my knee
The frost you paint across our dead affair
I sensed the toxic aura from the second we touched
You were stitched up venom and I was the cursed from the Vedic

Time is a one-way track and I am not coming back
I dream in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?
Time tired you're tainted through
Wins, songs and substitutes
I dream in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?

The afterlife is steep
We wonder and retreat
And everyone is after us
Skirt the gone street hawkers with the black lemonade
Keep an arrow trained on their conflicted minds 'cause they stutter

Time is the one-way track and I am not coming back
I dream in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?
Time tired you're tainted through
Wins, songs and substitutes
I dream in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?
I bleed in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?
I bleed in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?
I bleed in beige, why'd you leave me so far now?
I bleed in beige, why'd you leave me so far now!?3Embed
