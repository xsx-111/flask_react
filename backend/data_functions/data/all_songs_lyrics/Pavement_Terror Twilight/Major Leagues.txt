Major Leagues Lyrics
Lip balm on watery clay
Relationships hey hey hey
You kiss like a rock but you know I need it anyway
Angle for the ringside seats
When they fall, don't blame me

Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues

How you gonna teach him to walk
When he can't even finish the
He can't even finish
The songs of the law
Are they civilized or Satanist?
Cater to my walls and see if they fall
Don't leave me

Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
They'll wear you down sometime
Kids like wine
Magic Christians chew the rind
'Cause bad girls are always bad girls
Let's let 'em in

Darling, we're up against it
And there is no time for tie-ins tie-ins tie-ins
Go!

Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues
Bring on the major leagues

They'll wear you down sometime
Kiss the wine
Magic Christians chew the rind
'Cause bad girls are always bad girls
Let 'em in2Embed
