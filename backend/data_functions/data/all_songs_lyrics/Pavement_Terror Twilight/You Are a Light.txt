You Are a Light Lyrics
Tangled in the midst of all the trust
The way you pissed inside
The brain file technology drives
Show me your dots now

Who was it that said the world was mania, divorces, and spare change?
Let's lethalize our slingshots and swallow propane

You are the light
The calm in the day
You are the light
The calm in the day

Senior year abroad
I ripped the pea out of the pod
In store for three months of exile in Spain
Where was the danger?

Watch out for the gypsy children in electric dresses, they're insane
I hear they live in crematoriums and smoke your remains
You are the light
The calm in the day
You are the light
The calm in the day
Yeah


I drive stick
Gotta love it, automatic
Oh, everybody's gotta ride in something
High life, live
Comatosed him, bring it on in
Oh, I hope it arrives by Monday
Dry ice, skid
Button the strippers and quarantine nippers and
Oh, I have to die on Sunday
Irate kid
Laundromat spinners and let's act like winners and
Oh, who rolls with the Isolator?
Gotta roll, 'cause I am the Isolator1Embed
