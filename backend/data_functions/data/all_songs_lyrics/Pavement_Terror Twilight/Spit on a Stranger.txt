Spit on a Stranger Lyrics
However you feel, whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits
Whatever you need, however so slight
Whenever it's real, whenever it's right

I've been thinking long and hard
About the things you said to me
Like a bitter stranger
And now I see the long and short
The middle and what's in between
Well, I could spit on a stranger (Pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (Pull me out)

Whatever you feel, whatever it takes
Whenever it's real, whatever awaits me
Whatever you need, however so slight
Wherever it leads, whenever it's right

Honey, I'm a prize and you're a catch
And we're a perfect match
Like two bitter strangers
And now I've seen the long and short of it
And I could make it last
Well, I could spit on a stranger (Pull me out)
You're a bitter stranger (Pull me out)
Well, I could spit on a stranger, pull me out
You're a bitter stranger (Pull me out)
I see the sunshine in your eyes
I'll try the things you'll never try
I'll be the one that leaves you high, high, high4Embed
