Hold Your Colour Lyrics
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall
Soaking through
Colours that hold us up against the wall

Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall
With me
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)

I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and
Hold your colours against the wall (Soaking through)
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall
With me (Soaking through)
(...and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)

I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and

Ahhh, she looked into your eyes and saw what laid beneath
Don't try to save yourself, the circle is complete
We're reaching out and to take you
Nothing else can touch me

(Soaking through)
Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall
With me (Soaking through)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and-)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
Ahhh, she looked into your eyes
And saw what laid beneath
Don't try to save yourself
The circle is complete

I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and opened your eyes
I twisted the knife and

Fading gently, soaking through
And starting not to show at all
We're reaching out and to take you
Nothing else can touch me

(Soaking through)
Hold your colours against the wall
When they take everything away
Hold your colours against the wall
(Soaking through)(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
Hold your colours against the wall (I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
When they take everything away (I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
Hold your colours against the wall (I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
With me (I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)
(I twisted the knife and opened your eyes)2Embed
