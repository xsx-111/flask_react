Sounds of Life Lyrics
It seems like you're waiting for nothing
Looks like time had diluted it all
Maybe everything that could have been was thrown away
So just take what is left, and somehow fill the space
When I can see through it all I'll feel safe again
I'll feel warmer

Sounds of life outside
We're doing time
Sounds of life outside
One by one (One by one)
Got nothing to hide
One by one

Couldn't have seen it come, from an inch away
But it's here, right on time
Wait for the flash of grey and we will feel the same
If we can just drift for a while
When I'm back on the ground I'll feel safe again
I'll feel warmer

Sounds of life outside
We're doing time
Sounds of life outside
One by one (One by one)
Got nothing to hide
Sounds of life outside
We're doing time
Sounds of life outside
One by one (One by one)
Got nothing to hide
One by one
Sounds of life outside
We're doing time
Sounds of life outside
One by one (One by one)
Got nothing to hide
One by oneEmbed
