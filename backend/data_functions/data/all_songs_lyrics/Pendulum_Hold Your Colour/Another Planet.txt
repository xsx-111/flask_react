Another Planet LyricsThere were hard times ahead for the people of planet Pendulum
Staring into the networks of space and time
Their eyes were open
But still, they were blind
And I wandered through the weird and lurid landscape of another planet
Suddenly there was a change
Their eyes were open
But still, they were blindEmbed
