Streamline Lyrics
State your original plan as well
Being replaced by anything
Century Houston for that
Was that, was that it?
Do not let anyone surround you soak through and through
What you were originally about in the first place

Inside, think about it was it you or not, come in here
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come and hide
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come in here
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come and hide

(Let it go) Let it go streamline
(Let it go) Let it come inside
(Let it go) Let it go streamline

Ready or not, ready or not, ready or not
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come in here
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come and hide
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come in here
Inside, think about it was it you or not, come and hide
(Let it go) Let it go streamline
(Let it go) Let it come inside
(Let it go) Let it go streamline

Let it come streamline
Let it come inside
Let it come streamline
Let it come inside

Let it come streamline
Let it come inside
Let it come streamline

(Let it go) Let it go streamline
(Let it go) Let it come inside
(Let it go) Let it go streamline
(Let it go, let it go streamline)
(Let it go, let it come inside)
(Let it go, let it go streamline)
(Let it go, let it go streamline)
(Let it go, let it come inside)
(Let it go, let it go streamline)1Embed
