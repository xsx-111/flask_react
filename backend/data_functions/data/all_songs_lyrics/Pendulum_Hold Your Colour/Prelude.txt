Prelude Lyrics
Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space... Somewhere far away in space and time... Staring upwards at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky... We're marooned on a small island In an endless sea. Confined to a tiny spit of sand. Unable to escape. But tonight... On this small planet... On Earth... We're going to rock civilization3Embed
