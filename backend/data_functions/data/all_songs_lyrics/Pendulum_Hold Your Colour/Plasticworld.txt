Plasticworld Lyrics
I can't get used to you
I can't get used to you
I'm gonna take you somewhere
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
Like the way you move
Like the way you groove
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah)

You better believe ya (oh yeah)
Who's comin at ya
The way you look when my music flowin'
(Yeah)
You got structure
You better believe ya (oh yeah)
Who's comin at ya
The way ya look when the music's rollin'
I can't get used to you
I can't get used to you
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)
(Ohh, yeah, come on, get it)

You better believe ya (oh yeah)
Who's comin at ya
The way you look when my music flowin'
(Yeah)
You got structure
You better believe ya (oh yeah)
Who's comin at ya
The way ya look when the music's rollin'

Oh, I can make ya feel so good
And yeah, turn your world upside down
Oh, I can look into your thoughts
And yeah, I can look forever if I so desire
I don't really wanna show you all that
If it's ok that we can call that
I don't really know where I stand now
I can do anything ya want but
I can't get used to you
I can't get used to you

(Oh yeah)
You got structure
You better believe ya (oh yeah)
Who's comin at ya
The way you look when my music flowin'
(Yeah)
You got structure
You better believe ya (oh yeah)
Who's comin at ya
The way ya look when the music's rollin'Embed
