Tarantula Lyrics
Black tarantula
Time fi di massive come sing ya
Black tarantula
Don't play with my style, I might sting ya
Black tarantula
You want me inject me bacteria
But if ya body goin' stiff and your spine goin' numb
Now come fi get some

Shotter, hitter, serial killer
Go your funeral and I'll drink all your liquor
When you are bury we a stand next to the vicar
Fling on some dirt and make you buried little quicker
Shouldn't test the youth dem in the Tommy Hilfiger
Hug up ya Mama, say sorry to ya Papa
I'll a get number from your little sister
It's true, we're cold like Alaska; freezer

Black tarantula
Time fi di massive come sing ya
Black tarantula
Don't play with my style, I might sting ya
Black tarantula
You want me inject me bacteria
But if ya body goin' stiff and your spine goin' numb
Now come fi get some
Shotter, hitter, serial killer
Go your funeral and I'll drink all your liquor
When you are bury we a stand next to the vicar
Fling on some dirt and make you buried little quicker
Shouldn't test the youth dem in the Tommy Hilfiger
Hug up ya Mama, say sorry to ya Papa
I'll a get number from your little sister
It's true, we're cold like Alaska; freezer

Tarantula
Time fi di massive come sing ya
Black tarantula
Don't play with my style, I might sting ya
Black tarantula
You want me inject me bacteria
But if ya body goin' stiff and your spine goin' numb
Now come fi get some1Embed
