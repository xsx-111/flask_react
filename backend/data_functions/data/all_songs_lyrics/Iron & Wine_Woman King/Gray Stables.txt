Gray Stables Lyrics
Brave lady, I could see you through the mosses
Laid, shameless in the sun
My lady with her porcelain and her weightless
Face, pleasing everyone

Gray stables and the horses of the righteous
Pray daily for the brave

Lady, you were gorgeous in your weakness
Wet flowers on the ground
My lady never told me of her sadness
Bones floating in the sound
Brave lady, could you see me in the darkness
Wait, nameless like a stone
My lady with her watches by the mattress
Bathes lately all alone

Gray stables and the horses of the righteous
Pray daily for the brave

Lady, would you love me if I left her
Laid, breathless in the sun
My lady, like a teacup on the counter
Frail, pleasing everyoneEmbed
