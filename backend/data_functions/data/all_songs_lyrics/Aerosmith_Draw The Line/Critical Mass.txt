Critical Mass Lyrics
Arriving in boats, black hooded coats
Tormentors climbed into my room
I crawled under my bed, covered my head
But they're flushing me out with a broom
The leader, she's small, pinned my ass to the wall
For my seeds or she'd be losing her past
Time after time, she'd be reading my mind
But she never got the feeling to last

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrite it
This is the critical mass

So far so good, I heard the other say
So good so far, they're taking' me away
I drink to you, your mind, her ass
We'll take a drink and break the glass

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrite it
This is the critical mass

Now the tallest of two, with a brush full of blue
Paints surrealist scenes on the wall
So I tell her for fun, that it's really well done
But she just isnâ€™t listening at all
She points to my heart, telling me if I'm smart
I'll practice and phase
Out and admit, when the shoe doesn't fit
And I went screaming out down the hall
Really need it
Really need your love
Really need your love
Need your love need your love love love love love love love love love love
Just then I heard a pounding on the door
We're all here, sang the voice of twenty more
I drink to you alas
We'll take a drink and break the glass

Celebrate, celebrate, celebrite it
This is the critical mass

Time in space, is taking me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day
Time in space, is taking me away
Time erase, don't know the time of day
Time in space, is taking me away
Time erase, don't know the time of dayEmbed
