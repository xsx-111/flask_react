The Hand That Feeds Lyrics
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Please, doctor, doctor, please
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Feel like a old disease

Doctor, doctor, doctor
Get your sweet ass off the floor
Doctor, doctor, doctor
I can't refuse any loose hearted lady anymore
I scream your name into the crowd
You feel the flame but you aren’t proud
Maybe your attitude ain’t right
So all that's left for me to do is bite the hand that feeds me (Feeds me)
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Doctor, doctor, please

All the things you put me through
What the hell you want me to
Do all the things that Uncle John needs
I ain't the dog that bites the hand that feeds me

In the middle of, with a spittle of
Et to the birds of a feather
When another day, love another way
Push, shove, make love, play
Never never, never ever
Never ever, never ever
Na na na na

Yeah, doctor, doctor, doctor
Please do what you can
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Would you please give me life a hand?

All the things you put me through
What the hell you want me to
Do all the things that Uncle John needs
I ain't the dog that bites the hand that feeds me
Yeah, yeah

Doctor, doctor, doctor
Please, doctor, doctor, please
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Doctor, doctor, doctor
Doctor, doctor, doctorEmbed
