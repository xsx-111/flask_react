Milk Cow Blues Lyrics
Well I tried everything
Just to get along with you
And I'm going to tell you just
What I'm going to do
Well I'm sick of all your crying
When you should be leaving me alone
If you don't believe me
You pack my bag, I'm gone

Won't you  please
A don't that sun look good going down
You almost lost your love girl
When your old man isn’t around

Won't you  please
Don't that sun look good going down
Won't you please
Don't that sun look good going down
Well you best believe that I love you baby
When your old  man isn’t around

Won't you you please
Don't that sun (sun) look (look) good (good) going down
Won't you please....woo
Don't that sun look good going down
Well you best believe that I love you baby
When your old man isn’t around
And around and around and
Around and around and
Around and round and
Round and round and
Round and round...yak yak yak yak yaEmbed
