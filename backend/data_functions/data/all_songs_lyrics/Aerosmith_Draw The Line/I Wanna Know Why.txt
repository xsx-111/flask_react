I Wanna Know Why Lyrics
Kicking down the road
Feeling mighty slowed
With the likes of you
Getting mighty spaced
Never had a taste
Of what you're going' through
I can't bitch
Went from rags to riches
Then to ragtime screaming the blues

I wanna know why
Everybody's good intentions
Try to make a fool out to of me
I wanna know why
Everybody's good intentions
Got to make a fool
Got to make a fool
Try to make a fool out to of me

Swing low
Sweet cherry o
When a strange love showed me the way
You see more
Can't keep a score
When the whore's coming on for the play
I wanna know why
Everybody's good intentions
Try to make a fool out to of me
I wanna know why
Everybody's good intentions
Got to make a fool
Got to make a fool
Try to make a fool out to of me


E. Poe
Eating crow
Wonder if he know that the raven was mad

I wanna know why
Everybody's good intentions
Try to make a fool out to of me
I wanna know why
Everybody's good intentions
Got to make a fool
Got to make a fool
Try to make a fool out to of me

Oh, they play rough and can't get lost
So they try to make a fool out of me, Lordy
Ain't fooling me
Ya ain't ghooling me
Ain't fooling me
Ya ain't ghooling meEmbed
