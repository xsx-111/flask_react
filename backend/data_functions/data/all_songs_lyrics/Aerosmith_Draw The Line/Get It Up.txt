Get It Up Lyrics
Take me on you rocking whores
Hit the lights and shut your doors
Grab your ankles everyone
Ainâ€™t my way of having fun

Can't give it up, got to get it up, give it up, come on Nancy
Can't get it up, get it up, for your fancy
Got to get it up, get it up, come on Nancy
Can't get it up, got to get it up, get it up

For your fantasies my ass don't speculate
I'm just your slave, your master's bait
And lots of luck into the night
Just waiting for the bright light fright

Can't give it up, got to give it up, get it up, come on Nancy
Can't get it up, get it up, for your fancy
Got to get it up, get it up, come on Nancy
Get it up, got to get it up, come on Nancy

Really have a good time
Really have a good time
Sucking up the moonshine
Up underneath her clothesline
Really have a good time
Love me 'til the sun
Can't give it up, got to give it up, get it up, come on Nancy
Can't get it up, get it up, for your fancy
Got to get it up, get it up, come on Nancy
Get it up, got to get it up, come on Nancy

Get it up and down and all around
Take the ride and paint the town
Slow me down and make it fast
Scream almost and make it last
You know you got to really have a good time
You know you're really going to, really have a good time
Sucking up on moonshine
Up underneath her clothesline
You know you're really going to
Really have a good time
You know you really want to
Love me until the sun

Can't get it up
Get it upEmbed
