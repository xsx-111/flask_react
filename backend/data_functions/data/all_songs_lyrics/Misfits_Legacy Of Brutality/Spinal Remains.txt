Spinal Remains Lyrics
This isn't really sex, this isn't really life
This isn't really anything I think I like
And I will not sit on broken glass
Not for you or anyone
I will not cut my ass

We have no reasons but we still have fun
Down on the floor, baby, whisper my name
Yeah, when you rip my back to shreds
I dig my boots into the soft remains of your spine

I want to savage your spinal remains
I want to savage, baby, your spinal remains
In chains

This isn't really sex, this isn't really life
This isn't really anything I think I like
And I will not sit on broken glass
Not for you or anyone
I will not cut my fucking ass

I want to savage, baby, your spinal remains
I want to savage, baby, your spinal remains
They're making you changeEmbed
