American Nightmare Lyrics
Hot Chevy on a friday night
And the sweat drips down my spine
I put an axe in my babyâ€™s head
I'm gonna end up doing time
She looked so good in red
American nightmare running scared

It shoulda been hard to die
It shoulda been hard to kill
It shoulda been hard, I said
I had to split your head
American nightmare running scared

I'm heading down the highway
Sign has three inverted nines
If the law don't get me the devil will
But not without a fight

This highway never end, I said
American nightmare running scared
American nightmare running scared
I'm heading down the highway
Past three inverted nines
If the law don't get me the devil will
But not without a fight

This highway never fucking ends
American nightmare running scared
American nightmare running scared1Embed
