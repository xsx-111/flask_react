Some Kinda Hate Lyrics
There's some kinda love and there's some kinda hate
The maggots in the iron lung won't copulate

And it's a whoa oh oh oh oh
And it's a whoa oh oh oh oh
And it's a whoa oh oh oh oh
I said whoah whaoh oh, oh oh oh

Hear the cats cry
Little tortured babies in pain
Cracked necks by settled limbs
They don't hesitate

And it's a whoa oh oh oh oh
Baby, whoa oh oh oh oh
And it's a whoa oh oh oh oh
I said whoah whaoh oh, oh oh oh

There's some kinda love
And there is some kinda hate
I'm gonna tell you all about it now
The maggots in the iron lung won't copulate
And it's a whoa oh oh oh oh
Baby, whoa oh oh oh oh
Baby, whoa oh oh oh oh
I said whoah whaoh oh, whaoh oh oh1Embed
