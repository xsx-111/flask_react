Where Eagles Dare Lyrics
We walk the streets at night, we go where eagles dare
They pick up every movement, they pick up every loser
With jaded eyes and features, you think they really care

I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, babe

The omelet of disease awaits your noontime meal
Her mouth of germicide, seducing all your glands

I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, babe

Let's test your threshold of pain, let's see how long you last
That hatpin in your retina unbosoms all your past
With jaded eyes and features, you think they really care
Let's go where eagles dare, we'll go where eagles dare
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby
I ain't no goddamn son of a bitch
You better think about it, baby, ba- ba- ba-3Embed
