Angelfuck Lyrics
Little angelfuck
It's a shame your luck isn't better, babe
Did you like the fun?
Did you like the times that I promised you?

Open wounds on your brow
Little angel in red
She isn't loving you anymore

Little angelfuck
I seen you going down on a fireplug
Oh, little angelfuck
Sighs for everyone

Let those bastards believe
Dry your eyes and we'll leave
She isn't loving you anymore

Little angelfuck
I seen you going down on a fireplug
Oh, little angelfuck
Sized for everyone
Let those bastards believe
Dry your eyes and we'll leave
She isn't loving you anymoreEmbed
