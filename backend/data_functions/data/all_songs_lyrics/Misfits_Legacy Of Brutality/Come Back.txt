Come Back Lyrics
Come back, little raven
And bite my face
I've been waiting, endless waiting
Come back and bite my face

Come back, little raven
Deep
Sink
Your  claws
This is not then
It is not now
Come back
Deep sink your claws

I think you realize what I've done
Well, on the corner, slash my heart for fun
I'm not alive for anyone
I think you realize what I've done

You gotta come back
You gotta come back
You gotta come back
You gotta come back
Come back, little raven
And bite my face
I've been waiting, endless waiting
Come back and bite my face

I think you realize what I've done
Well, on the corner, slash my heart for fun
I'm not alive for anyone
I think you realize what I've done

You gotta come back
You gotta come back
You gotta come back
You gotta come back

You gotta come back, come back
Come back, right back to me
You gotta come back, come back
Come on back, right back to me
You gotta come back, come back
Come on back, right back to me
You gotta come back, come back
Come on back, right back to me, yeahEmbed
