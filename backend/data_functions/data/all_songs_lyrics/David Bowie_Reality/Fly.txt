Fly Lyrics
The television's on and I'm walking through the yard
The house is fast asleep and I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend

The kids are alright but they don't smile much
They sit up in their garage with their decks and their stuff
Dying for the weekend

The boy's on a charge but his mother doesn't know
I never got around yet to telling her so
It would only make her crazy

And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly

The television's on and I'm walking through the yard
The house is fast asleep and I'm crying in my car
Dying for the weekend
The kids have got a gig in an all night rave
They're lookin' pretty tough but I still want to say
Do you really have to go?

Down in the back street a skinny kid cries
Bad drive Saturday another life flies
Dying for the weekend

And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly
And I can fly
And fall toward the end
And I can fly
And I'll be fine
I'm only sleeping in my head
And I can fly
I close my eyes and I can fly1Embed
