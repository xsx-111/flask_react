Pablo Picasso Lyrics
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails

Well some people try to pick up girls
They get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
The girls would turn the color of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
He could walk down your street
Girls could not resist his stare
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Not like you
Wow!

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Well the girls would turn the color of a juicy avocado
When he would drive down their street in his El Dorado
Well he was only 5'3"
But girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not in New York
Wow!

Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails
Swinging on the back porch
Jumping off a big log
Pablo's feeling better now
Hanging by his finger nails1Embed
