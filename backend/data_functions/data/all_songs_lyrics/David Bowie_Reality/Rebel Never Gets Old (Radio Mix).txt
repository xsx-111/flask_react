Rebel Never Gets Old (Radio Mix) Lyrics
3, 2, 1

Never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
Never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
And there's never gonna be enough money
There's never gonna be enough drugs
Never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
Never gonna be enough money
There's never gonna be enough drugs
Never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex

3, 2, 1
And I'm running down the street of life
And I'm never gonna let you die
And I'm never ever gonna get old
And I'm never ever gonna get
And I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
I'm never ever gonna get old
So I'm never ever gonna get high
Never gonna be enough money
There's never gonna be enough drugs
Never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
3, 2, 1
Got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
3, 2, 1
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's go out tonight

Never gonna be enough money
There's never gonna be enough drugs
Never gonna be enough bullets
There's never gonna be enough sex
I'm never ever gonna get oldEmbed
