Rebel Rebel (2003) Lyrics
You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey baby, your hair's alright
Hey babe, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
You love dancing and you look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast

They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey babe, your hair's alright
Hey baby, let's stay out tonight
You like me and I like it all
You love dancing and you look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
You want more and you want it fast
They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on
Yeah

Rebel rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so

You've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Hey baby, your hair's alright
Hey baby, let's stay out tonight
Stay out tonight
Stay out tonightEmbed
