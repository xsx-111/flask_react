New Killer Star Lyrics
See the great white scar
Over Battery Park
Then a flare glides over
But I won't look at that scar
Oh, my nuclear baby
(We'll discover a star)
Oh, my idiot trance
All my idiot questions
(Like the stars in your eyes)
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never say I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
See my life in a comic
Like the way they did the Bible
With the bubbles and action
The little details in color
First a horseback bomber
(We'll discover a star)
Just a small thin chance
Like seeing Jesus on Dateline
(Like the stars in your eyes)
Let's face the music and dance

Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better
Don't ever say I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready
I'll never said I'm better, I'm better, I'm better, I'm better than you

All the corners of the buildings
Who but we remember these?
The sidewalks and trees
I'm thinking now

I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
A new killer star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
The stars in your eyes
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I discovered a star
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
I got a better way
Ready, set, go
I got a better way
Oooh oo
I got a better way
Ready, set, go1Embed
