Mean Girls Lyrics
I sat with you and talked about
Things I couldn't live without
And you told me that I wasnâ€™t happy
Yet
You picked me up from off the ground
Ae ran around that awful town
I told you things I never told anyone

You said you were fine
But then you changed your mind
Don't know where you went
But I know
That you left

Ah aaaahhhhh ah ahhh ah ahhhh ahoh ahhohooooh

I know youre telling everyone
The things I said and that I'm dumb
But I know you
Like no one else does, remember?
And when I think about that day
I know that sky turned an awful gray
'Cause you were the storm on my parade always

You said you were fine
But then you changed your mind
Don't know where you went
But I know that you left

Ah aaaahhhhh ah ahhh ah ahhhh ahoh ahhohooooh

No im not perfect yet
But at least I don't pretend
To be the world's best friend
I know you won't admit it but I wish that you would quit it

Oh why - why do you hate me
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?
Why do you hate me?
Why?Embed
