Angsty Lyrics
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work
It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything
It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything but you

But you
Yeah, I love you, yes I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you

I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work
I wanna stay with you but I can't
Because I gotta go to work
It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything
It's overwhelming
How much I hate everything but you
But you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you
Yeah, I love you, yes, I love you

You, it's true
I love you, I do
Oooo, ooo, ooo
Oooo, ooo, oooEmbed
