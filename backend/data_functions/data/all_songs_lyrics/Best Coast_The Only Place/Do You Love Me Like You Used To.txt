Do You Love Me Like You Used To Lyrics
I wake up to the morning sun
When did my life stop being so fun
Wish I could care about someone, the way I used to
When will this be done
I'm always crying on the phone
Because I know that I'll end up alone
Lord please forgive me for my sins
I didn't mean it, I just want it to end

Do you love me like you used to
Do you, do you, do you

I have no reason to complain
My feelings change, they melt away in my brain
I keep myself awake at night
Sleep with the lights on, always ready to fight
I'm always crying on the phone
Because I know that I'll end up alone
Lord please forgive me for my sins
I didn't mean it, I just want it to end
I'm always running down the street
I don't remember what it means to be me
I left all of that shit behind
But still I seem to lose my mind
My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind1Embed
