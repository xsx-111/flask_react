How They Want Me To Be Lyrics
All of my friends stick up their noses
They ask me where my money is
And where does it go once I've spent it

But I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be

And even my own mother asks me a lot of questions
I tell her I don't wanna talk
But she doesn't stop, she's just wondering

But I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be
I want you, you, you, you
I want you, you, you, you
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Aah, aah, aah, aah
Cause when I wake up in the morning
Or the middle of the night
I wonder who's there, and what they've said
Yeah, when I wake up in the morning
Or the middle of the night
I wonder who's there, and what they've said
But when I wake up in the morning
Or the middle of the night
I look at you and I know it's alright
I wake up in the morning
Or the middle of the night
I look at you and I know it's alright

Cause you don't want me to be
How they want me to be
You don't want me to be
How they want me to be

And I don't want to be how they want me to be
I don't want to be how they want me to be
You don't want me to be
How they want me to be
I don't want me to be
How they want they want me to beEmbed
