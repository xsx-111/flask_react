Why I Cry Lyrics
Look to the future, nothing's there
Don't know why I even care
Walk around in a haze
Seems to be the way I spend my days
I'm stuck in the grey
Turn around and no one's there
Don't know why I even care
Moods, they swing, the seasons change
Is it you or am I to blame, I always complain

'Cause you seem to think you know everything
Yeah, you seem to think you know everything
But you don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry

Before I can stay inside, Oh, how fast the time goes by
Take a pill, spend the bills
Seems to be the way I get my thrill
A never-ending hill
'Cause you seem to think you know everything
Yeah, you seem to think you know everything
But you don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
You don't know why I cry
Why I cryEmbed
