Last Year Lyrics
I used to believe in diamonds and things
I used to believe in you and me
But now I believe in nothing
I used to wake up in the morning
And reach for that bottle or glass
But I don't do that anymore
Kicked my habits out the front door

And I'm always talking to somebody else
She doesn't even know my face
I don't know how I feel
I'm all over the place
And when I go out I don't feel anything
I just keep on spending my money
One day it will be gone
And then I'll have to write another song

What a year this day has been
What a day this year has been
Please don't get me wrong
I just don't know where time has gone
What a year this day has been
What a day this year has been
Please don't get me wrong
I just don't know where my mind has gone

La-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
Aaah-aah-aaah-aahh
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da-da
Aaah-aah-aaah-aahh-aaaahEmbed
