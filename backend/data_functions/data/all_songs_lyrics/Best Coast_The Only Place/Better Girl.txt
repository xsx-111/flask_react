Better Girl Lyrics
And it's no fun when I'm freaking out
And it's no fun when I'm always down
And it's no fun what I'm putting inside of me
It's making me crazier
And it's no fun when I'm always alone
And it's no fun when I'm always at home
And it's no fun when you're laughing at me
Always laughing at me

You gotta keep me away from what they say about me
You gotta keep me away from what they say about me
Say about me
Cause I want to be a better girl

And it's no fun when I'm staying up late
And it's no fun when you're breaking the date
And it's no fun what I'm putting inside of me
Is making me crazier
And it's no fun when I'm always alone
And it's no fun when I'm always at home
And it's no fun when you're sitting without me
Always sitting without me
You gotta keep me away from what they say about me
You gotta keep me away from what they say about me
Say about me
Cause I want to be a better girl

Yeah I want to be a better girl
A better girl
A better girl
A better girl
A better girl
A better girl
A better girl
A better girl1Embed
