My Life Lyrics
When I go on airplanes
I listen to your voice
And when I go to sleep at night
I'm wishing for a choice

To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
Feel right

And all the things I'm taking
Are making me insane
And when I go to sleep at night
I'm wishing for a change

To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
To go back in time
Makes what's wrong feel right
Feel right
My mom was right
I don't want to die
I want to live my life
My mom was right
I don't want to die
I want to live my life

My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my life
My life, my life, my lifeEmbed
