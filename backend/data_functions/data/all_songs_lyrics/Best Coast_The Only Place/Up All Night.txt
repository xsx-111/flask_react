Up All Night Lyrics
You and me
Too good to be
Too true to be
Too dumb to see
That where I live
And where you live
Are not the same
We're not to blame
Just too crazy
And far too bored
And way too lazy to make it work
So here I am
I'm still alone
I'm still awake
I'm still afraid

I don't know what day it is
'Cause I've been up all night
I don't know what week it is
'Cause I've been up all night
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to see you
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever
You and me
Too good to be
Too true to be
Too dumb to see
That where I live
And where you live
Are not the same
We're not to blame
And now you're off in another town
With another girl
Just sittin' around
But I'm still here
I'm still alone
I'm still awake
I'm still afraid

I don't know what day it is
'Cause I've been up all night
I don't know what week it is
'Cause I've been up all night
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to see you
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever
You left me here alone
You left me here in the cold
You left me here by the sea
Oh well now all I wish I could see is
You and me

I don't know what day it is
'Cause I've been up all night
I don't know what week it is
'Cause I've been up all night
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to see you
I want to see you
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever and ever
Forever
