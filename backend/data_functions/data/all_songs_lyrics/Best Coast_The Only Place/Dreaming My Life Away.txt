Dreaming My Life Away Lyrics
We fell asleep
I saw the trees in my dreams
I want to follow them
Down the road
But it looks dark
And I am grown

I tried to call you
But you were sleeping
And you were dreaming
That I was on a road
With my best friend
And we were talking
About our dreams

We fell asleep
We fell asleep
We fell asleep
We fell asleep
Oooo
Oooo-o
Oooo-o
Oooo-oo
Ohhh-aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah
AaaahEmbed
