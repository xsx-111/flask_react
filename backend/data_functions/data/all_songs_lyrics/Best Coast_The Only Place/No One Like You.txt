No One Like You Lyrics
If I sleep on the floor
Will it make you love me more
If I pack up my things and leave
Can I still be the queen to your king

No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no

Know that you don't mean to say things
That hurt me and drive me to my knees
Been around this crazy world
But I still want to be your girl

Cause there's no one like you
No one like you, no one like you
No one like you, no one like you

No, no, no. no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, noEmbed
