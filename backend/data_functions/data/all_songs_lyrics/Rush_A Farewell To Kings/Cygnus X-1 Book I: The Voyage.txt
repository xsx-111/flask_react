Cygnus X-1 Book I: The Voyage Lyrics
"In the constellation of Cygnus
There lurks a mysterious, invisible force
The black hole of Cygnus X-1
Six stars of the Northern Cross
In mourning for their sister's loss
In a final flash of glory
Nevermore to grace the night"
Invisible to telescopic eye
Infinity, the star that would not die
All who dare to cross her course
Are swallowed by a fearsome force
Through the void, to be destroyed
Or is there something more?
Atomized - at the core
Or through the astral door
To soar...

I set a course just east of Lyra
And northwest of Pegasus
Flew into the light of Deneb
Sailed across the Milky Way
On my ship, the 'Rocinante'
Wheeling through the galaxies
Headed for the heart of Cygnus
Headlong into mystery
The x-ray is her siren song
My ship cannot resist her long
Nearer to my deadly goal
Until the black hole
Gains control

Spinning, whirling
Still descending
Like a spiral sea, unending
Sound and fury drowns my heart
Every nerve is torn apart...
To be continued...18Embed
