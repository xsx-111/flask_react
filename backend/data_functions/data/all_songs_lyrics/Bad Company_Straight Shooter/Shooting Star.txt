Shooting Star Lyrics
Johnny was a schoolboy when he heard his first Beatles song
'Love Me Do,' I think it was, from there it didn't take him long
Got himself a guitar, used to play every night
Now he's in a rock 'n' roll outfit and everything's all right

Don't you know?

Johnny told his Mamma, "hey, Mamma, I'm goin' away
I'm gonna hit the big time, gonna be a big star someday", yeah
Mamma came to the door with a teardrop in her eye
Johnny said, "don't cry, Mamma," smiled and waved good-bye

Don't you know, yeah yeah

Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, don't you know
Don't you know that you are a shooting star

And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are
Johnny made a record, went straight up to number one
Suddenly everyone loved to hear him sing his song
Watching the world go by, surprising it goes so fast
Johnny looked around him and said 'well, I made the big time
At last'

Don't you know, don't you know

Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, oh, yeah
Don't you know that you are a shooting star, yeah

And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are, a shooting star


Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, ahh-ahh
Don't you know that you are a shooting star, now
And all the world will love you just as long
As long as you are

Johnny died one night, died in his bed
Bottle of whiskey, sleeping tablets by his head
Johnny's life passed him by like a warm summer day
If you listen to the wind, you can still hear him play

Oh-oh-oh

Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah, don't you know'
Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you know, yeah

Don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you
Don't you know
Don't you know-ow-ow that you are a shooting star, yeah

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, woo
Don't you, don't you know that you are a shooting star
Don't you, don't you know

Know, know, know, know, know

Know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know
Know, know, know, know
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, woo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, woo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, woo
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, woh, woh2Embed
