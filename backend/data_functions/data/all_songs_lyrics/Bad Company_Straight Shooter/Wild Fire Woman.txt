Wild Fire Woman LyricsI'm gonna drive my car, way across the border
'Cos she's the only one, she keeps my mind in order
I'm not a bad man, but I know where I stand:
If I have your love, gotta have your love in my hand
Yeah, come on boys...
It takes a good man, yeah, to know a good woman
I ain't so much a good man as one who needs loving
I'm a driving down the highway getting closer to your love
I'm going pretty fast now, but it ain't fast enough. Listen
Wild fire shooting through my veins
Burns a fever to my brain
Wild fire woman, something you got
I start to shiver when you do that, do that baby, now
It takes a good man, yeah, to know a good woman
I ain't so much a good man as one who needs loving
So I'm burning up the freeway, ain't nothing in sight
You know it takes a whole lotta loving, to keep me driving all night, hey
Wild fire shooting through my veins
Burns a fever to my brain
Wild fire woman, something you got
I start to shiver when you do that, do that baby
Wild fire shooting through my veins
Burns a fever to my brain, oh
Wild fire woman, something you got
I start to shiver when you do that
Wild fire shooting through my veins
Burns a fever to my brain
Wild fire woman, something you got
I start to shiver when you do that, do that baby
Do that, do that baby
I start to shiver and shake
I just can't wait
I start to shiver and shake
I just can't wait
I start to shiver and shake, ha, now baby
I just can't wait, driving down the highway, yeah, yeah, oh
I'm driving all night...Embed
