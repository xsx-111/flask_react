Deal with the Preacher LyricsI need love, the kind I've never known before
You need it too, the kind that makes you feel so good, baby
I want to give, give you all the love you need
Well, I'm a loner, and that's the way I want to be, yeah
Let me say as the sun climbs across the sky above
So your smile filled me with a stronger love
Just as you and I, watchin' the morning sky, oh yeah
Somehow I know it's time for me to say goodbye, yeah, yeah
Here's why : can't make a deal with the preacher, oh yeah, yeah
And I can't make a bargain in heaven, now
Angel, you came to my window
Angel, you came to my door
I was a fool and I let you in
I sure ain't no fool anymore!
Yeah, yeah, you better believe me right now baby
Oh, yeah
As the sun climbs across the sky above
So your smile filled me with a stronger love, mm
Just as you and I, watchin' the morning sky
And somehow I know it's time for me to say goodbye
I can't make a deal with the preacher, you know yeah
And I can't make a bargain in heaven, yeah, yeah
Heaven knows me by now
I can't make a deal, oh no, no, no, no
I love you baby, I love you baby
I can't make a deal, make a deal, make a deal
Make a deal, make a deal, yeah, yeah
You know and I can't make no bargain in heaven
Listen, I can't make a deal, make a deal, make a deal
Make a deal, make a deal, oh, oh
And I can't make no bargain in heaven, oh yeah
Make a deal...Embed
