So It Goes LyricsI’ve seen you on the side of the road
Lined your pockets with pills
But the powder bag, he can hold a grudge
With your head, heart, stomach and lungs
You had a dragon to chase
Spread out, blood on your face
And you’re oh so ungratefully dead
Your sister is crying, your mother looks cold
You can follow your father to bed
On and on, I’ve never been here before
Hail Jerry, full of grace
Please seat yourself, usher of the times
Won’t recognize you
Please seat yourself, usher of the times
Won’t recognize you
I’ve seen you on the side of the road
Lined your pockets with pills
But the powder bag, he can hold a grudge
With your head, heart, stomach and lungs
So it goes...
Please seat yourself, usher of the times
Won’t recognize you
Please seat yourself, usher of the times
Won’t recognize youEmbed
