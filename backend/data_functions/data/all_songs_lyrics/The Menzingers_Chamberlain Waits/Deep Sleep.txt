Deep Sleep LyricsTo deep sleep
Well, I know now everything ain't free
As I rummage through an old phone book, deciphering names
That were carved on the Paupack peaks
Remember me?
Remember May 2003?
We were hopeless
We were doomed by our pending defeats
You drank Jack and I'd drink anything that's free
Well, I wonder what your old man thinks of us now
Slowly setting suns
Well I don't wanna wait for
I don't wanna wait for
I don't wanna wait for
I don't wanna wait for
I don't wanna wait for
I don't wanna wait for
Things to get better (better)
Better (better)
Better
Better
Pull your car over
Break your friends, save yourself (Like you told me forever ago)
Oh break your friends, save yourself (Like you told me forever ago)
Break your friends, save yourself (Like you told me forever ago)Embed
