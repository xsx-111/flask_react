Home Outgrown LyricsCondescender, condescender
Chemical splendor, I surrender a promise to myself
I know a snake, I know a charm, I know a selfish little boy
But I wish that I knew my friend
A neighbor is a stranger and compassion is an option
When your frigid hearts settle in
Condescender, last forever, come call off your dogs
Chemical splendor, I surrender a promise to myself
The old enemy
I’m not going home
I’m not going home
Where is my home?
Where is my home?
I’m not going home
Condescender, last forever, come call off your dogs
Chemical splendor, I surrender a promise to myself
The old enemy
My heroes, I have forgotten them
My heroes, maybe they never were
My heroes, I have forgotten them
My heroes, maybe they never were
I’m not going homeEmbed
