Tasker-Morris Station LyricsI never loved you but I tried to
And you were so ambiguous
We blamed the faulty wires
When we found our blood was pumped from stone
My memory is fading faster
I never bought a warranty
When I called and said I was leaving
You were one step ahead of me
Cold blankets, cold shoulders
Missed calls and apologies
But I met the other you, I met the other you
Cold blankets, cold shoulders
They’ve been there since I met you
At Tasker-Morris Station
So come back down to the middle where I’ve been
Settling into, with or without you
Come back down to the middle where I’ve been
Settling into, with or without you
But what do I know
But what do I know
But what do I know
Except our blood is pumped from stoneEmbed
