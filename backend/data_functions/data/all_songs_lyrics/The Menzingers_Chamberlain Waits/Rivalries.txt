Rivalries LyricsI'm gonna walk to the edge of the world
I'm gonna collect everything left that's scattered
Maybe then, I can mend your wounds
Maybe then, I can mend mine too
'Cause I'm running out of excuses
'Cause I'm running out of time
So, I'll find my own way home
And stumble into another New Year
I'm gonna get in fighting fit
I'm gonna let my liver play offense
But when captains choose their teams
I'm always the last one on the sidelines
'Cause I'm running out of excuses
'Cause I'm running out of time
To go anywhere but backwards
'Cause I can't wait for or live forever
No I can't wait for or live forever
Either
So, I'll find my own way home
And stumble into another New Year
I'm gonna get back all that's lost
I'm gonna regain rightful intuition
You said, "Well, hey man, I'm on your side
But I'm always waiting on your side"
'Cause I'm running out of excuses
'Cause I'm running out of time
When life falls apart, I'll eat my words
With insignias to award our failed ventures
When life falls apart, I'll eat my words
With insignias to award our failed venturesEmbed
