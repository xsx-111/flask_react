Time Tables LyricsOnce she came like a vision in the night
I fell in love before the morning arrived
She wore a blue dress to combat the heat
Drank beer from a bottle and danced in the street
Then I heard her singing something fairly familiar
A tale of two lovers in the thick of the summer
There in the moment, we kissed in the hammock
We argued over which Bad Religion album was better
Well, I thought ‘No Control’ or ‘Suffer’
And then she became queen of the neighborhood parties
'Cause I was an unknown boy along for the ride
Kept the guitar right by my side
It was better than conversing with the kids I didn’t like
But on the fourth of July, when the fireworks rang out
She met a new boy who was more hip and less strung out
I drove home with fire in the sky
Fiddled with the dials and stumbled across something
That you were always humming
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I’ll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with your Coke
Well maybe if you want to wander around outside tonight
Meet me in Lake Ariel after midnight
Or really whenever, I only want to talk
I only want to relive what was lost
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I’ll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with...
As time tables suggest
We were only just friends
In constant motions, covering stilts
I’ll give you a dollar for another ride home
Or something to mix with your CokeEmbed
