Emptiness Pt. 2 LyricsThe feeling of being in the mountains is a dream of self-negation
To see the world without us, how it churns and blossoms without anyone looking on
It's why I've gone on and on, and why I've climbed up alone
But actual negation, when your person is gone
And the bedroom door yawns, there is nothing to learn
Her absence is a scream saying nothing
Conceptual emptiness was cool to talk about, back before I knew my way around these hospitals
I would like to forget and go back into imagining that snow shining permanently alone could say something to me true and comforting1Embed
