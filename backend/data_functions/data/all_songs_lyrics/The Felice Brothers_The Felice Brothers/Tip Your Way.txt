Tip Your Way Lyrics
Tip the maid a dollar and a half
Tip the waitress, feed her cocaine habit
Tip the man with the gun
Tip at least everyone
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the grocery girl if you want
Tip the religious man on the yacht
Tip the women who wait on the white magistrate
Tip your way into heaven's gate

Tip the butler, tip the boy at the bar
Tip the one in the feathers and tar
Tip the fool in the aisle, tip the most ugly child
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the corner bum everyday
Tip the New York whore in the sleigh
Tip the carousel girl, tip the monkey in curls
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the girls embroidered in red
Tip the cannons that blew off her head
Tip the firing ships and the banners they rip
Tip your way into heaven's gate

Tip the bride a knife in the back
Tip your Long Island lawyer in black
Tip the saint on the phone, he's a long way from home
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the cavalry officer's son
Tip the streetcar children that run
Tip the man with the sickle, tip him a nickel
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the drummer boy in the fog
Tip the children who pet the wolf dog
Tip me a ring if you like how I sing
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the judge, tip the innocent man
Tip the electric chair guard if you can
Tip the old prison priest, he ain't slept in weeks
Tip your way into heaven's gate
Tip the stadium crowd in the sun
Tip away your life with the gun
Tip father time for keeping you fine
Tip your way into heaven's gate

Tip all of the boy's in the band
Tip a piece of your life in their hands
If the barn starts to burn give your lover a turn
Dance your way into heaven's gate
Dance alone, dance a merry old jig
Dance a butterfly's death in the ring
Dance the cold night away to a Johnny Cash tape
Dance your way into heaven's gate
Tip your own true love in the rain
Leave her there where the saxophone's play
Boy you're young as can be, you got country to see
Your a long ways from heaven's gate1Embed
