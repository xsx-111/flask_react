Ruby Mae Lyrics
Her name was ruby mae
She danced the cabaret
Such a lovely girl was she
That Ruby Mae

In the open window breeze
She pulled her stockings
Above her knees
Such a lovely girl was she
That Ruby Mae

On a lonely winter night
I followed her under Christmas lights
So low down was i
To Ruby Mae

In the bitter morning air
I hid her body there
In the heart of old times square
So she'd not lose her way
[Chorus
Her name was Ruby Mae
She danced the cabaret
Such a lovely girl was she
That Ruby MaeEmbed
