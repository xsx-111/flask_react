Murder By Mistletoe Lyrics
I'll call my carrier pigeons home
From a window where I stand alone
I'll draw the blinds and fall asleep
In an attic full of make-believe
Where carolers sing below
With bells in the falling snow
Their shadows against the white
On streets of electric light
At the bar I'll watch the news awhile
Just to see the anchor woman smile
On a stage I'll sing an Elvis song
Just to hear the barmaids sing along
Mirrors and razor blades
Christmas eve parades
A murder by mistletoe
Drunks in the falling snow
She left him by the night arcade
And turned his heart into a spade
He turned that lovely blue eyed Jane
To a homicide on Campbell Lane
Hearing the sirens croon
In a familiar room
Laying with last year's love
High as the moon above2Embed
