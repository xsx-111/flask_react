Wonderful Life Lyrics
Every Sunday morning I wake up
I see you by your dresser doing your make-up
Fluttering a Chinese fan in a Knoxville fashion
All last night you tossed and turned
Your body was hotter than the night that Richmond burned
You say you had a bad nightmare about tractor trailers crashing

Throw your arms around me
Let's keep this quiet
Hear our hearts in the distance like cannon fire
See our breath in the window, in the turning light
Oh it's a wonderful Life

You say you were only seventeen
When you fell in love with that dirty Reverend Green
I remember you at the baptism as he held his daughter down
We could hear Thelma and Louise
Making love under the Poplar trees
We could hear some screaming, sounded like a slaughterhouse

Throw your arms around me
Let's keep this quiet
Hear our hearts in the distance like cannon fire
See our breath in the window, in the siren light
Oh It's a wonderful Life
Me and Joey started a fire in the road
Just to watch it glow
His father didn't like it though, he gave Joey a black eye
Me and you we did the same damn thing
We fell in love knowing the pain it would bring
Now all I do is sing sad songs with red eyes

Throw your arms around me
Let's keep this quiet
Hear our hearts in the distance like cannon fire
See our breath in the window, in the turning light
Oh it's a wonderful Life1Embed
