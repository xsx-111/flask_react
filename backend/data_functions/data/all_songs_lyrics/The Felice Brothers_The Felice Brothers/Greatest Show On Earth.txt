Greatest Show On Earth Lyrics
I'm in the lobby of the motel 8
Waiting on my lovely date
Her name is Doris Day
I'm in a suit of burgundy
There's a deer-head looking at me
It's blowing my mind away
Everyone knows she's the killing kind
She keeps a 38 Smith and Wesson at her side
I put a pistol in my pants
Cause were going out to dance
Where the water drinks like cherry wine

Tell me mama, so it seems
Your son's been a bad marine
They're shipping him home tonight
Tell me mama wheres your other son
In jail with the other one?
You must'nt of raised them right
I heard your low-life husband shout
It got me to wondering what the scene was all about
He said I'm breaking my parole
Going down to Jericho
Get me that money, or I'm gonna beat it out
OOOH happy days are here!
It's the perfect summer night
And the moonlight's shining clear
Put a pistol in your purse
Cause we're going to Gettysburg
To the stand of the Greatest Show on Earth!

Is that your daughter Mr. Kissinger?
Better keep an eye on her
She been looking me up and down
Is that your woman in the coat of fur?
Better keep an eye on her
This is a ravenous part of town
I know about you and the deputy
And how they found him shot dead in a Mercury
Some say you're paid to kill
Like that mean ol' Buffalo Bill
Watch it buddy! Don't draw no gun on me!

OOOH happy days are here!
It's the perfect summer night
And the moonlight's shining clear
Put a pistol in your purse
Cause we're going to Gettysburg
To the stand of the Greatest Show on Earth!1Embed
