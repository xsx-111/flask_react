Goddamn You Jim Lyrics
Winter passed without a glance
Took our only boy last
She cried and Gods arms were a blind and breathing ocean

Blooming spring brought all I need
Warmth and rain for me to seed
My earth, good earth for our boy to lie in

In the summer I work my land
She walks like she still held his hand
And I swear to god I caught her once or twice smiling

In the autumn, gold wheat swaying
I cut her down from where she was swinging
She said
'Goddamn you, Jim. Up there I could hear him laughing'2Embed
