Whiskey in My Whiskey Lyrics
I put some whiskey into my whiskey
I put some heartbreak into my heart
I put my boots on that ole dance floor
I put three rounds Lord, in my 44

I loved the girl, she was my sunshine
Her name was Eleanor Caroline
She got fast, with a friend of mine
At the dance hall Lord, on the county line

I put some whiskey into my whiskey
I put some heartbreak into my heart
I make my way across that ole dance floor
And put three rounds Lord, in my Eleanor

I filled my glass with Uncle Jack
I lay my skin, my Sunday black
I'll make my bed on them railroad tracks
I'll leave this world lord and I won't look back

And I put some whiskey into my whiskey
I put some heartbreak into my heart
I put my boots on that ole dance floor
I put three rounds Lord, in my Eleanor1Embed
