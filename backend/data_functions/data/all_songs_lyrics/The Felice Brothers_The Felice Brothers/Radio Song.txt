Radio Song Lyrics
Anna Bell, the dying leaves
Are dancing off of the trees
They got an easy way
Let's you and me
Go dancing, too
Wreck our dancing shoes
Hey, hey, hey

Please don't you ever die
You ever die
You ever die
You moved me all of my life
All of my life
All of my life
Hum our radio songs
Radio song
Radio song
After every radio's gone
Radio's gone
Radio's gone

Anna Bell, the dying stars
Are falling down on us
They got an easy way
Let's you and me
Go falling, too
Way out into the blue
Hey, hey, hey1Embed
