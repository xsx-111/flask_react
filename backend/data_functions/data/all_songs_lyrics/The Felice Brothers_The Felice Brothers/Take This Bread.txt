Take This Bread Lyrics
Vic said today you guys went to LA. I was just listening to the news man
And the whole fucking Californias on fire over there
The whole southern California, San Antonio's burning. Uh LA's all covered in smoke and everything
I don't know man i guess you're experiencing tonight. I was just wondering if you were aware of that fact
There's a serious, serious fire going on over there. Thousands of homes being burnt up
Fucking Nuts. Uh anyway I know you're busy uh, just call when you get the chance and how you're making out
Love you to hear from you bro, love you, bye

Take this bread, if you need a friend
Cause I'm alright if you're alright
I ain't got a lot, but all I got
You're welcome to it
Cause I'm alright if you're alright

My neighbor Odetta
Came over to see if I was feeling better
Every morning at 8 through the backyard gate
And of all the pretty things she would bring
There was nothing like that song she sang
That could ease my sorry state
She'd sing to me:
Take this bread, if you need a friend
Cause I'm alright, if you're alright
I ain't got a lot, but all I got
You're welcome to it
Cause I'm alright if you're alright
Sha na na na na na
Lalalalalala la
Whoa! Take this bread
Sure thing, If I got bread you got bread
And everybody in my company has got bread
You look a little hungry
I ain't even that hungry, that's how I look at it
Butter side up, butter side down
Doesn't matter to me
If you got a slice, that's nice

I went for a walk, headlights in the dark
The man was dying in a pick-up truck
He took her from the wall, my parking lot
And killed her by the river
But the cops caught him in the guns
And I said to him..
Take this bread, if you need a friend
Cause I'm alright, if you're alright
I ain't got a lot, but all I got
You're welcome to it
Cause I'm alright if you're alright
Take this bread, if you need a friend
Cause I'm alright if you're alright
I ain't got a lot, but all I got
You're welcome to it
Cause I'm alright if you're alright
I'm alright if you're alright1Embed
