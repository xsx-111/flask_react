I Wonder LyricsAm I long way from your heart
I wonder
Is this where love is, heartache starts
I wonder
I wonder if you ever think about me
And how good our old loving used to be
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
When you left with one last curious look
I wonder
I tried to call you
You changed the number on me
I really wonder
You tell me things to get me where you want me to be
How come I feel your getting the best of me
Sometimes
I wonder
I hear a car coming round the corner
I hear footsteps on my front porch
I see a shadow from the light above
I hear a voice
Oh it's not yours
Why does this happen
What's going on
I wonder
Could this be a dream
Or has Bob gone crazy
I wonder
How come I feel your taking advantage of me
Why can't I get you out of me
Sometimes
Sometimes I wonder
(guitar solo)
They say that time will heal my broken heart
I wonder
Could it be that I'm blind
All alone in the dark
I wonder
I can't help feeling this way
If I could leave, I'd surely leave today
Sometimes
I wonder
It seems to me you still wanna be around
But when I see you, all hell starts breaking down
Sometimes
I wonder
Mm hmm
I really wonderEmbed
