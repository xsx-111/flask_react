Still Around LyricsSomething happened this morning when I opened my eyes and looked around me
Something strange was in the air
But what it was I just could not pin it down
And then I heard the shower running and I knew what it was
You were still around
How many times must I tell ya'
I'm tired of you and everything you stand for
I thought we'd reached an agreement
I thought everything would be all right
Yeah
But when I woke up this morning
I knew everything was wrong
Everything was wrong
You were still around
Still around
Why can't you show some feeling?
Why can't you understand?
Messed up my whole life
Why wreck my day
Did my best to love you
Now do your best to leave
Can't you see that's what I want
I really need
Why can't you show some feeling?
Why can't you understand
Messed up my whole life
Why wreck my day
I did my best to love you
Now do your best to leave
Can't you see that's what I want
I really need
I really need
How many times must I tell ya'
I'm tired of you and everything you stand for
I thought we'd reached an agreement
I though everything would be all right
But when I woke up this morning
Everything was wrong
Everything was wrong
You were still aroundEmbed
