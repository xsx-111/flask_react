More Than I Can Stand LyricsHey baby, wait a minute
Don't start leaving tracks now
I know there's really nothing left in it, woman
And before you go, gimme my love back
Cause that's more than I can stand
Much more than I can stand
It's so plain, but hard to admit
That it's over
I want a lover, you're a teaser
You're so unpredictable baby, and
You turn cold whenever I squeeze ya'
Do I have to let you go, baby?
That's more than I can stand
Much more than I can stand
It's so plain, but hard to admit
That it's over
Ohhh, I lost one I thought was wonderful
But the strange thing about it:
Is I can't believe that this is happening to me
It don't make no sense to try to plead with ya'
I know what your answer's gonna be, babe
I just thought maybe you'd reconsider
Before you head on out that door, baby
That's more than I can stand
Much more than I can stand
So plain, but hard to admit
That it's over
Please baby, wait one minute
If you walk out, I'll know it's true
But it would only set my mind at ease
Cause I 'm doing time worrying about you
That's more than I can stand
Much more than I can stand
Please don't tell me that it's over
Please don't leave YOUNG BOB alone
I can't believe it's happening to me
I'm doing time worrying about you, baby
That's more than I can stand, yeah
That's more than I can stand, babyEmbed
