Right Next Door (Because Of Me) LyricsI can hear the couple fighting right next door
Their angry words sound clear through these thin walls
Around midnight, I heard him shout, "Unfaithful one"
And I knew right then the axe was gonna fall
It's because of me
It's because of me
I heard him shout, "Who is he?" she mumbled low
He said, "Baby, don't you lie to me no more"
And I'm listening through these thin walls in silent shame
As she called out my name, I was right next door
It's because of me
It's because of me
Because of me
It's because of me
Oh, she was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
She was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts
Oh, oh, whoa-oh
At daybreak I hear him pack, say goodbye
I can hear him slam the door and walk away
Right next door I hear that woman start to cry
I should go to her, but what would I say?
It's because of me
It's because of me
Because of me
Young buck!
Oh, she was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader
She was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts
Oh, she was right next door and I'm such a strong persuader, yeah
She was just another notch on my guitar
She's gonna lose the man, the man that really loves her
In the silence I can hear their breaking hearts2Embed
