So Fine Lyrics
Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh
Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh
Ooh la, ooh la la, ooh la, ooh la la, ooh

Two drifters on the morning sky
Two drifters sailing wide and high
When summer breezes blow across your mind
With you, I will walk the line

I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)

People walking hand in hand
Everybody's singing to the band
I want to be where the stars shine bright
And hear sweet music on a summer night

I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh
Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh
Ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh la la, ooh

Sun-downers, we'll go on and on
We'll find the land of the midnight sun
And when you look, you'll see for miles around
You'll see the world is in your hand

I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)

Oh, baby, yes, you know just what I want
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)
I want it so fine (Whoo, whoo)

Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh
Ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh la, ooh
Ooh la, ooh la la, ooh la, ooh la laEmbed
