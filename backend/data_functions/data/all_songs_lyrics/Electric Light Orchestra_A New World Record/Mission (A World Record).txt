Mission (A World Record) LyricsThis is Yerffej Ennyl calling you from planet Earth
For many days, we travelled from a distant place and time
To reach a place they call the planet Earth
There was to be a celebration
On the mission of the sacred heart
The planet Earth from way up there is beautiful and blue
And floating softly through a rainbow
But when you touch down, things look different here
At the mission of the sacred heart
Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?
How's life on Earth?
(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)
When all the stars above
Lay icy fingers down on me
(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)
On a dirty worn-out sidewalk, sits a mother with a baby;
In her vale of tears, she sees no rainbow
And someone's singing from a window
In the mission of the sacred heart
Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?
How's life on Earth?
(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)
And when the stars above
Lay icy fingers down on me
(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)
There's a building on a corner, in a city, in a land
On a place they call the planet Earth
My orders are to sit here and watch the world go by
From the mission of the sacred heart
Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?
Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?
How's life on Earth?
What is it worth?Embed
