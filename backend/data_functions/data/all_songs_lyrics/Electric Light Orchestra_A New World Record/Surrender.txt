Surrender LyricsBaby, can you hear me call?
Is it alright? Now your back's against the wall
And baby, is it still the same?
Do you wonder? Is it on and back again?
Surrender
Baby, surrender
Surrender
Baby, surrender
I know it, what we said that day
Are you under? Does it matter anyway?
You told me what you said is true
Does it all mean waitin' gone, alone, and blue?
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, can you hear me call?
Is it alright? Now your back's against the wall
And baby, is it still the same?
Do you wonder? Is it on and back again?
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Surrender (It's all you gotta do)
Baby, surrender (It's all you gotta do)
