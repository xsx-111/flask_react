Do Ya Lyrics
Well

In this life, I've seen everything I can see, woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you

Do ya, do ya want my love? (Woman)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (I'm sayin')
Do ya, do ya want my love?

Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang 'Auld Lang Syne' by the light of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you
{Bridge}
In the country where the sky touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest in the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look
Just to feel, to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn

But I never seen nothin' like you

Do ya, do ya want my love? (Woman)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (I'm sayin')
Do ya, do ya want my love?

Well, I think you know what I'm trying to say, woman
That is, I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

Do ya, do ya want my love? (Come on now)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (Alright now)
Do ya, do ya want my blood?

Oh, look out
Do ya, do ya want my love?
Do ya, do ya want my love?
