Shangri-La Lyrics
I'm getting out, I'm getting out

Sitting here, waiting for
Someone calling at my door
Too bad
I'm getting out of love

What's the use of changing things?
Wonder what tomorrow brings
Who knows?
I'm getting out of love

My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude"
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

Duh-dah-deh-de-doo-deh-doo
I'm getting out, I'm getting out

Clouds roll by and hide the sun
Raindrops falling on everyone
So sad
I'm getting out of love
Yeah-yeah-yeah

My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude"
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue (the blue, the blue)
Doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude" (Do me, baby!)
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

I'm getting out of love
Where is my Shangri-La?
Doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-dah-dey
Where is my Shangri-La?
I'm getting out of love

I will return
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-LaEmbed
