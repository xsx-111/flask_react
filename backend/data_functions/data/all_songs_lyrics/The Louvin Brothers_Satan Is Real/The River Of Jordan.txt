The River Of Jordan LyricsTo the River Of Jordan our Savior went one day
And we read that John The Baptist met Him there
And when John baptized Jesus in Jordan's rushing waters
The mighty power of God filled the air
I'm on my way to the River Of Jordan
Gonna wade right in to the rushing waters
I'm going down to the River Of Jordan
And let the cool waters cleanse my soul
King Naaman was stricken with dreaded leprosy
And he sent for the man of God to pray
But Elisha said to Naaman "go dip yourself in Jordan"
And let the cool waters wash your spots away
So he went right down to the River Of Jordan
He waded right in the rushing waters
He dipped himself in the River Of Jordan
And the cool waters made him whole
Oh the River Of Jordan is many miles away
And this mighty river I may never see
But I'll find myself an alter in an old fashioned church
And my River Of Jordan that will beEmbed
