Dying From Home, And Lost LyricsCompanion draw nigh, they say I must die
Early the summons has come from on high
The way is so dark and yet I must go
Oh that's such sorrow you never may know
Oh can you not bow and pray with me now
Sadly regret that we never learned how
To come before Him who only can save
Leading in triumph through death and the grave
Only a prayer, only a tear
Oh if sister and mother were here
Only a song would comfort and cheer
Only a word from that book so dear
And can you not sing a song of His love
How He came down from the mansions above
To bleed and to die on Calvary's tree
Bringing salvation to sinners like me
Alas it is so, but thus it must be
No word of comfort are promised for me
To die without God or hope in His Son
Covered in darkness, begrieved and undone
Oh people of God who have His blessed Word
Will you not heed the command of your Lord?
And publish to all of Adam's lost race
Pardon, forgiveness, salvation through Grace
Only a prayer, only a tear
Oh if sister and mother were here
Only a song could comfort and cheer
Only a word from that book so dearEmbed
