Are You Afraid to Die LyricsAre you a stranger to God?
Carried away with your pride
Tell me, sinner, did you ever step to think?
Are you afraid to die?
Are you afraid?
Are you unsaved?
Are you afraid to die?
Call on Him while He's near
Moments are swift passing by
Will you seek Him where He may be found?
Are you afraid to die?
Are you too wicked to cry?
Would you to God's bosom fly?
Soon He's coming, like a thief in the night
Are you afraid to die?Embed
