The Christian Life LyricsI like the Christian life
My buddies tell me that I should have waited
They say I'm missing a whole world of fun
But I am happy and I sing with pride
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian life
My buddies shun me since I turned to Jesus
But I still love them they burden my heart
I'll try to lead them to walk in the light
I like the Christian life
I won't lose a friend by heeding God's call
For what is a friend who'd want you to fall
Others find pleasures in things I despise
I like the Christian lifeEmbed
