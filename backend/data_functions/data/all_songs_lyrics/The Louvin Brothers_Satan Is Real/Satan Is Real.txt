Satan Is Real LyricsSatan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astray
I attended service at a little church
In the country not long ago
A prayer was led by an old country preacher
Who then raised his hands as everyone stood and sang
"My God is real"
A warm breeze through the open windows
Brought in the smell of new mown hay in a nearby field
And the singing of birds could be heard
In the moment of silence
As the preacher opened the bible to read
And then a little old man stood up, bent with age
His hair thin and white
And said, "Preacher, tell them that satan is real too"
You can hear him in songs that give praise to idols
And sinful things of this world
You can see him in the destruction of homes torn apart
I know that satan is real
For once I had a happy home
I was loved and respected by my family
I was looked upon as a leader in my community
And then Satan came into my life
I grew selfish and un-neighborly
My friends turned against me
And finally, my home was broken apart
My children took their paths into a world of sin
Yes preacher, it's sweet to know that God is real
And know that in Him all things are possible
And we know that Heaven is a real place
Where joy shall never end
But sinner friend, if you're here today
Satan is real too
And hell is a real place
A place of everlasting punishment
Satan is real, working in spirit
You can see him and hear him in this world every day
Satan is real, working with power
He can tempt you and lead you astrayEmbed
