The Angels Rejoiced Last Night LyricsA house not a home was the picture Satan painted
For sweet little sister and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was prayin'
His heart was so hardened that he would not believe
In anger he'd swear his voice low and loud
His Sundays were spent out with the gamblin' crowd
I've never seen my daddy inside the house of God
For Satan held his hand, down the path of sin he trod
Not long ago our circle was broken
When God called on Mother one night
In a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to raise her children right
The angels rejoiced in Heaven last night
I heard my daddy pray "Dear God, make it right"
He was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last night
While Mother with the angels rejoiced last nightEmbed
