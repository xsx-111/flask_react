He Can Be Found LyricsHe can be found in a mother's smile
He can be found in the eyes of a child
He can be found He is everywhere
When we kneel in prayer each plea He hears
He can be found in the air that we breath
He'll always hear a heart that grieves
He can be found on life's stormy seas
He can be found in you and me
He can be found in the hearts of great men
He will reach down for one who has sinned
The peasant's daughter or the rich man's son
All who believe and who will let Him comeEmbed
