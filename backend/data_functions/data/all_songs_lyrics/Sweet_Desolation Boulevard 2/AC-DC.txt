AC-DC LyricsShe got girls
Girls all over the world
She got men
Every now and then
But she can't make up her mind
On just how to fill her time
But the only way she can unwind
Chorus
A.C. D.C
She's got some other lover as well as me
A.C. D.C
She's got some other woman as well as me
She's got some other woman as well as me
She's got funk
But they call her a punk
She got zing
You ought to see her ding-a-ling
Well let's be in it together
'Cause she'll be in it forever
You've got to take it now or never
Chorus
A.C. D.C
She's got some other woman as well as me
A.C. D.C
Some other woman as well as me
A.C. D.C
Some other woman as well as me...1Embed
