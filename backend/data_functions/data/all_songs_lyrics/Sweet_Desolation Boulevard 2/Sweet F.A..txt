Sweet F.A. LyricsWell it's friday night and I need a fight
If she don't spread I'm gonna bust her head
The guy's gone mad 'cause his chicks been had
But what can we do when there's four of you?
Sweet F.A. - never gonna make it
Sweet F.A. - people think we fake it
Sweet F.A. - now we're gonna take it
Sweet - F.A
Try to pull me out like a roustabout
Gonna spend my bread then I'll kick your head
You're just my size but if you're so wise
See the chick in black maybe she'll come back
Sweet F.A. - never gonna make it
Sweet F.A. - people think we fake it
Sweet F.A. - now we're gonna take it
Sweet - F.A
Ah, ah, ah, F.A
Ah, ah, ah, F.A
Yeah, the hurstle's now really nice somehow
See the street car scene from the black limousine
Shout it out let it all hang out
But you won't get rough 'cause it's all a bluff
Sweet F.A. - never gonna make it
Sweet F.A. - people think we fake it
Sweet F.A. - now we're gonna take it
Sweet - F.A1Embed
