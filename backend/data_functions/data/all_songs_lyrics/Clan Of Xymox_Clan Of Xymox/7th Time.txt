7th Time Lyrics
This 7th time
Love sickness and disillusion
This head that won't listen to me - now
There's crumbs of a dark night
Burning in your mouth
'till I wake you

It's three steps too far
This slammed door
Your damned bed
This white head beside you
And there's blood on the stairs
So keep it nice
I'm broken

Between skin and sheets
Skin and sheets
I won't disturb you any more
Between two lights, I woke you up
This 7th time
I won't disturb you any more
I won't disturb you any more
The 7th time
Love sickness and disillusion
This head that won't listen to me now
There's crumbs of a hot night
Burning in your mouth
'till I wake you

Between skin and sheets
Skin and sheets
I won't disturb you any more
Between two lights, I woke you up
This 7th time
I won't disturb you any more
I won't disturb you any more

The 7th time
The 7th time
I won't disturb you any more
I won't disturb you any more
I won't disturb you any more
I won't disturb you any more
