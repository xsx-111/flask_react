Cry in the Wind LyricsAre these your words with laughter
Is this your voice begging to be spared
Oh, you seemed so unassailable, you seemed so far away hey hey
Is this a voice begging to be spared
Is this your voice ?
Please, don't speak to me for a while
Are these your words with laughter
Is this your voice begging to be spared
Oh, you seemed so unassailable, you seemed so far away hey hey
Are these your words with laughter
Is this your voice ?
Catch my thoughts on the run
You kissed my hand
Like a friend in the heat of a fight
While those enemies scream
In the heat of a fight
I walked into my dream
Oh fall
Oh fall into your call
I jump I jump I jump
Jump out of time
Out of the fight
Jump jump
Jump out of time
I cry in the wind
I cry in the wind . someone is telling me
A frenzied thing
I cry in the wind I cry
A whisper in my ear1Embed
