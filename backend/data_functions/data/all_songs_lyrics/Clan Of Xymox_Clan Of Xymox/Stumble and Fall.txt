Stumble and Fall LyricsI never saw you like this before
Those eyes so weary, but that smile so steady
O, I never heard you, like this before
The words so heavy
The sound so dreary
O, they sound so dreary, hey
I never saw you
I never saw you
I never saw you
Like this before
I stumble and fall
Over your gaze and your call
I stumble and fall
It's dreary echoing, sounds in the static hall
How can I continue with this icy cube
You are putting in my head
You are putting in my head
I never saw you like this before
Those eyes so weary, but the smile so steady
O, the smile so steady
I never saw you
I never saw you
I never saw you
Like this before
I stumble and fall
Over your gaze and your call
I stumble and fall
It's dreary echoing
As it sounds in the static hallEmbed
