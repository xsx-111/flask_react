No Human Can Drown LyricsLet me be me alone
Let me dream in silence and enjoy
In the dark, cold, wonderful night
Let me believe
Make me glad
Lets dance on the water
Lets dance on the water
Let me believe no human can drown
If he don't expect too much
If he don't expect too much
Let me take you for a walk
Let me sing, let me smile
Tell me no human can drown
If he don't expect too much
And let me take you for a walk
I don't expect too much
Just wanna hold you
Just wanna touch you
Just wanna hold you
Just wanna touch you and feel your flesh
Take me to your universe
Hold me
Hold me1Embed
