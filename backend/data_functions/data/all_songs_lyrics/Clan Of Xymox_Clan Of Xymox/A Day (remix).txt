A Day (remix) LyricsWhere are you
When I am needing you
So far away
So far away
I think you're the most important
To me, to me, to me, to me
My sunken footsteps put their selves on
Through this gallery of deceased
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays
Where are you?
So far away
It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Ha, ho
Where are you?
So far away
I think you're the most important
To me, to meEmbed
