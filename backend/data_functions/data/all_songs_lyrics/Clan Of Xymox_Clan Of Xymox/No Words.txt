No Words Lyrics
Out in the night
It could be fun
It could be fun
It could be fun
No words to explain
No words in my mouth
No words in my mind
But the gesture said it all
And the words refined it all

I saw how you looked at me
I saw how you danced with her
I saw how you looked at me
I saw how you danced with her
I saw it before
I saw it before
Right now, I guess you move

I saw it before
I saw it before that time
But the gesture said it all
And the words refined it all
I saw how you looked at me
I saw how you danced with her
I saw how you looked at me
I saw how you danced with her
I saw it before
I saw it before
Right now, I guess you move

I saw it beforeEmbed
