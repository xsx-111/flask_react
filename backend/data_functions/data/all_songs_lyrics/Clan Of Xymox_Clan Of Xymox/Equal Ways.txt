Equal Ways Lyrics
So the circle cannot fail
It turns in endless ways
It turns in endless days
So this window offers views
Of endless loves and fears
Of endless moves and stands
We turn in rest and dance
Scarlet hour rises and falls
I won't stop wondering
I won't ever stop wondering


They walk in flowers
They walk in shorts
They win the nothings
They win awards
It makes no sense to me
I walk the flowers
I win the nothings
So this circle cannot fail
It turns its endless ways
It turns in endless days
Scarlet hour rises and falls
I won't stop wondering
I won't ever stop wandering
Scarlet hour rises and falls
I won't stop wondering
I won't ever stop wandering

We turn in equal ways
So let's live in equal days
We turn in equal ways
So let's live in equal daysEmbed
