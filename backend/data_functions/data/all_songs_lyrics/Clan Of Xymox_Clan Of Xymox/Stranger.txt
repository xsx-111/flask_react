Stranger Lyrics

Now I am feeling me a stra-stra-stra-stranger
When I looked into your eyes
When I look into your eyes (stranger)
Just walk, don't talk
Just walk, don't talk
So lets just walk
From place to place
As long as we don't talk
Face to face

Stra-stra-stra-stranger
Stra-stra-stra-stranger
Stranger
