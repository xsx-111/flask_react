A Day Lyrics

Where are you
When I am needing you?
So far away
So far away
I think you are the most important
To me, to me
To me, to me
My sunken footsteps put theirselves on
Through this gallery of deceased
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays
Where are you?
So far away
It makes no sense
It makes no sense at all

Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

Where are you?
So far away
I think you are the most important
To me, to me
My sunken footsteps put theirselves on
Through this gallery of deceased
I think their lives must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays
Where are you?
So far away
I think their lives
Must be deceived
Like the sham nowadays
Nowadays
Nowadays
Nowadays
Nowadays
It make no sense at all
So far away
In just one day
In just one day
It makes no sense at all
It makes no sense at all
In just one day

In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just one day
In just
In just one
One day1Embed
