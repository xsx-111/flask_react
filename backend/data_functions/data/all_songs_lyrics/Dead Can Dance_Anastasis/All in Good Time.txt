All in Good Time LyricsAll your ships
Have left their moorings
Cast adrift
On the Sargasso Sea
Waiting for the wind
To set your sails free
When you reach
The end of your rainbow
Chasing shadows
And down on your luck
Look for the sign
Look for a sign
As you rise to the very top
Of your mountain
Just remember those
Poor lost souls
On their way down
You taught me patience
Was a virtue
I took my time
Let Nature take her cause
All was revealed
All in good time
Turn back your clocks
Open up your memories
Beneath the veil
Where time stands still
You showed me a sign
You showed me the sign1Embed
