Flight Attendant LyricsWhen I was
A little baby
A mamma's boy
No one could save me
From those kids at school
They would bully
They would tease
They would taunt me
Haunt me
"You're such a pretty boy"
"You're such a pretty boy"
"You're such a pretty boy"
"You're such a pretty boy"
Fear
I grew up so scared
The bible belt
Redneck lifestyle
One day I'll fly free
In the airplanes
"Where's my seat?
Where's my champagne?"
Champange
I'm such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy
Heaven knows the lengths I'd go to please them every day
They don't even notice when I'm down
Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
Such a pretty boy
I'm such a pretty boy
Hotels were closed
And the airport was clean
I was stranded alone
In my southwest dream
Hotels were closed
And the airport was clean
I was stranded alone
In my southwest dreamEmbed
