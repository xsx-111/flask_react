Under Your Charms LyricsOnly half of the time do you tell me just what you want
Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want
Can I get some contact?
Can I get some contact from you?
Can I get some contact with what is real?
It's the end of the night and i'm feelin' sexual
It's the end of the night and i'm feelin' sexual
Can I get some love back?
Can I get some love back from you?
Can I get some love back that you conceal?
And now I've fallen under your charm
And now I fall into your arms
It's where I feel alright
In the blink of an eye do we do what's natural
Maybe once or twice do we do what's natural
Is it just a love task?
Is it too much to ask from you?
Is it just a love task or do you feel?
And I've fallen under your charm
And now I fall into your arms
And now I've fallen under your charm
And now I fall into your arms
Where I feel alright
It's where I'll stay tonight
Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want
Only half of the time do you tell me just what you want
Can I get some contact?
Can I get some contact from you?
Can I get some contact with what is real?Embed
