Rise LyricsThink I'm gonna pass out
Think I'll just lay down right here
Someone turn the light out
I'll cover myself with a jacket
And I'll still
Catch the last ride on a Brooklyn train
Thirty years old and nothing's changed
Spent hours on the land line
Hoping you would find time
For me
Showed up at your door
It was a scene I was so sure
You would be free
I should've cought a ride on a Brooklyn train
Thirty years old and nothing's changin'
And I'll rise
To greet you
In the morning
Light
And I'll rise
To greet you
In the morning
Tried so hard to ignore
All the feelings I have for you
They won't leave
I'm so crazy
How I wish that you could come around
And we could meet
So catch the last ride on a Brooklyn train
Meet me on the corner and I'll entertain
And I'll rise
To greet you
In the morning
Time
And I'll rise
To greet you
In the morning
It's an honest thing
And honest things they last
Think they're gonna come and carry me away
Think they're gonna come and carry me away
Think they're gonna come and carry me away
From you
Think they're gonna come and carry me away
Think they're gonna come and carry me away
Think they're gonna come and carry me away
From you
From you
From youEmbed
