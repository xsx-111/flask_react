Slaveship LyricsA slaveship
Lost at sea
A slaveship
Lost at sea
And I'm drownin'
Your water's deep
I'm drownin'
Your water's deep
The spaceship
In the country
A spaceship
In the country
And we're flying
Into green
We're flying
Into green
I told you a thousand times
(I told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(I sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Will you marry me?
I love you
Will you marry me?
City
There's an empty street
The city
There's an empty street
And we're dancin'
To the lonely beat
We're dancin'
To the lonely beat
Your building
Is where we meet
Your building
Is where we meet
And I'm hungry
Let's get something to eat
I'm hungry
Let's get something to eat
I told you a thousand times
(I told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(I sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Would you marry me?
I love you
Would you marry me?
Your daddy
He ain't like me
Your daddy
He ain't like me
I'm striving
Someone to be
I'm striving
I got a degree
One day girl
You will be my queen
One day girl
I will be your king
And we'll reign in
Our castle supreme
We'll reign in
Our castle supreme
Cause I told you a thousand times
(told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Will you marry me?
I love you
Will you marry me?
I told you a thousand times
(I told you a thousand times)
I sold you a thousand lines
(I sold you a thousand lines)
I love you
Will you marry me?
I love you
Will you marry me?Embed
