Sunshine (Come On Lady) LyricsForget all your little problems
Forget the boy you left at the bar
I got a stash been savin' for months now
California's not very far
Come on lady
Take this bum and make him right
You're my steady
You're the one who makes me feel
Sunshine
One that makes me feel sunshine
I wanna be your baby daddy
I wanna be your self-employed
So pack up the van and we'll go driving
To the coastal state
Uh-huh
Come on lady
Take this bum and make him right
You're my steady
You're the one that makes me feel
So come on lady
Give this bum a sense of pride
You're my steady
You're the one that makes me feel
Feel
Sunshine
One that makes me feel sunshine
One that makes me feel sunshine
One that makes me feel sunshineEmbed
