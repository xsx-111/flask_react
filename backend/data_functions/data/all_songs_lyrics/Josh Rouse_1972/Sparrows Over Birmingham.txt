Sparrows Over Birmingham LyricsFell down on both knees
You were young
Bones still soft
Legs fell numb
Oh how those sparrows sang for you
So you grew up
An isolated pup
You had some books
You had some love
Oh God was watching over you
Oh how those sparrows sang for you
You witnessed a man
A holy man
Touched your head
With his gentle hands
Oh God was watching over you
Lived in a house
In Birmingham
A preacher's son
The Lord's plan
Oh God was watching over you
Oh how those sparrows sang for two
When you arrived
Carried you there
Hear the preacher's son
Your only love
Oh God was watching over you
Wedding bells rang
(Wedding bells ring)
Church choir sang
(Church choir sing)
A gospel song
(Whoa-oh oh whoa)
A beautiful one
(A beautiful one)
Oh such a melancholy tune
(It's a sad tune mmmm-mmm)
Oh how it reminds me of youEmbed
