James LyricsHe decided he'd be better off alone
So he left his wife and child and went solo
It is summertime, Atlanta's hot as hell
He thinks back to what he had, and where he's now
(Whoo) James can't stop hangin' out in the bars
He's on top, breakin' all the ladies' hearts
James ain't got a problem with alcohol
He can't stop hangin' out in the bars
Found a pay phone, and the courage, it did swell
What to say James never really knew that well
And his apology was more than they could stand
"I'm just a poor excuse for what some call a man"
James can't stop hangin' out in the bars
He's on top, breakin' all the ladies' hearts
James ain't got a problem with alcohol
He can't stop hangin' out in the bars
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, ooh
"So I want you to be spirited and brave
Find someone to love, but never take my place"
He hung the phone up and defeated his own life
Disappeared into the closest neon sign
(Whoo) James can't stop hangin' out in the bars
He's on top, breakin' all the ladies' hearts
James ain't got a problem with alcohol
He can't stop hangin' out in the bars (Whoo)
James can't stop
When I walk down this street, I base it on five things: what you say and what you do. You mind your words. Common sense tells me not to drink
