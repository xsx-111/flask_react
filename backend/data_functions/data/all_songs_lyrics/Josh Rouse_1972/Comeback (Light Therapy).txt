Comeback (Light Therapy) LyricsI've been waiting for the longest time
I want you to come back
Maybe if the sun would shine
It'd bring my happy back
In the dark
So tired of waking up and its dark
So tired of being stuck on my own here
Norway is cold dear
And here comes june
The sun is gonna shine in june
The doctor says I'll feel better soon
Fills my vitamin D pills
He hands me the big bill
Cause I've been waiting for the longest time
I want you to come back
Maybe if the sun would shine
You'd bring my happy back
I'm gonna stay on this mountain high
Til you come running back
Don't leave me hangin' out on that line
I want you to come back
I want you to come back
I miss my serotonin
And my days are goin nowhere fast
The language is so foreign
And I can never understand
Understand
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Yeah cause I've been waiting for the longest time
I want you to come back
Maybe if the sun would shine
You'd bring my happy back
I'm gonna stay on this mountain high
Til you come running back
Don't leave me hanging out on that line
I want you to come back
I want you to come back
I want you to come back
I want you to come back
Yeah
Waiting for the longest time
Waiting for the longest time
I want you to come backEmbed
