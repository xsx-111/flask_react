When the Water Falls Lyrics
She's a picture perfect child of innocence
Searching out in childlike ways for knowledge
Now she's questioning her mother
Yeah, she's questioning her father
Yeah, she's looking for the answers
To the problem that confronts her

Do you know where the sun goes
When the water falls?
Do you know where the rain goes
When the water falls?

Though I think her subjects could run far and wide
She has centered on the topic of the sky
Now she's questioning her mother
Yeah, she's questioning her father
Yeah, she's looking for the answers
To the problem that confronts her

Do you know where the sun goes
When the water falls?
Do you know where the rain goes
When the water falls?
Do you know where the sun goes
When the water falls?
Do you know where the rain goes
When the water falls?

Do you know where the sun goes
When the water falls?
Do you know where the rain goes
When the water falls?

When the water falls
When the water falls
When the water fallsEmbed
