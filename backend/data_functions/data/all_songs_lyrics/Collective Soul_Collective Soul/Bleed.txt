Bleed Lyrics
I think her gun's unloaded now
I guess tomorrow will be after all
Who made me judge and jury here?
It seems I'm bearing witness to her fall

I don't know why she cries to me
She keeps her pain as company
Because it's only time before we all must bleed

Mirrors of her memory reflect
Nothing with each word she says
Her views have got me spinning around
I think she's burning alters in my head
