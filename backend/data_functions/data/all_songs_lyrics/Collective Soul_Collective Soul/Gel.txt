Gel Lyrics

Color me any color
Speak to me in tongues and share
Tell me how you'd love to hate me
Tell me how you'd love to care

Well I just want
To shake us up
Well I just want
I just want to
To shake us up

Let's mingle (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
And make it well (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Come together now (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Yeah, let's gel

Clothe me in any fashion
Glitter to so mundane
Tell me how you'd love to change me
Tell me I can stay the same
Well I just want
To shake us up
Well I just want
I just want to
To shake us up

Let's mingle (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
And make it well (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Come together now (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Yeah, let's gel


Let's mingle (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
And make it well (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Come together now (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Yeah, let's gel

Well let's bungle (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
And live to tell (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
How we came together (uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Yeah, how we gelledEmbed
