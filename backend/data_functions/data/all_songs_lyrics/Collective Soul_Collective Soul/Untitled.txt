Untitled Lyrics
Who have I left to please?
Take what you've yet to seize
No more questioning
'Cause love is what love should be
Unveil to me all that you want me to do
But why should I stop bearing allegiance to you?

I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The sorcerers or the preachers (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)
I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The scholars or the wise men (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)

What have I left to prove?
I speak all the words you choose
Confine me in walls of truth
'Cause love does what love should do
No more sentence, all of my pain has been freed
Why should this end when your mercy's all I need?

I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The sorcerers or the preachers (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)
I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The scholars or the wise men (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)
I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The sorcerers or the preachers (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)
I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The scholars or the wise men (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)

I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The sorcerers or the preachers (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)
I just believe in you
I don't believe in (I don't believe)
The scholars or the wise men (I won't believe)
I just believe in you (I just believe)
I just believe in you
Yeah, you, you, youEmbed
