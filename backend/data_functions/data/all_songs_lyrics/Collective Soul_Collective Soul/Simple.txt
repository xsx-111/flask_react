Simple Lyrics

Tangle up your twisted tongue. It's simple
Mesmerize your everyday. It's simple
Hey hey can't you see?
Love is all that you should need
Can't you see?

Ease your troubled mind
Let love seek; let love find. It's simple
Ease your weary soul
Let love lead; let love flow. It's simple

Pry into combative times. It's simple
Forfeit all lush concerns. It's simple
Hey hey don't you care?
Love is all that you should share
Don't you care?

Cleansing out your tarnished heart
It's simple
Learning from each other can be simple
Hey hey don't we know?
Love is all that we should show
Don't we know?Embed
