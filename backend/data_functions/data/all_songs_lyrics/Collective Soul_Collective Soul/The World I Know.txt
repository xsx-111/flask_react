The World I Know Lyrics
Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on

I drink myself of new found pity
Sittin' alone in New York City
And I don't know why

Are we listening?
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering

All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one
Into one

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laughed at myself
While the tears rolled down
'Cause it's the world I know
Oh, it's the world I know

I drink myself of newfound pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why, don't know why

So I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laughed at myself
While the tears rolled down
'Cause it's the world I have known
Oh, it's the world I know
Yeah, I walk up on high
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laughed at myself
While the tears rolled down
'Cause it's the world I have known
Oh, it's the world I know4Embed
