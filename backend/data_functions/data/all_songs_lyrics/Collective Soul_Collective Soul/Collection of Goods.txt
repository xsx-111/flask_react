Collection of Goods LyricsResonate in tones of saving grace
Separate from the Gods of hate
Alleviate all our doubting ways
Congregate to more loving days
A collection of peace where we could live
A collection of hope for us to give
A collection of words that mean we care
A collection of love for us to share
Recognize all equality
Vocalize solidarity
Exercise your tranquility
Glamorize all of love's needs
A collection of peace where we could live
A collection of hope for us to give
A collection of words that mean we care
A collection of love for us to share
She wants more she says
He wants more he says
I, want want more I say
He could take some more
She wants more she says
He wants more he says
I, I want more I say
He could take some more
A collection of peace where we could live
A collection of hope for us to give
A collection of words that mean we care
A collection of love for us to share
A collection of peace where we could live
A collection of hope for us to give
A collection of words that mean we care
A collection of love for us to share
She wants more, she says
He wants more, he says
I, want want more, I say
He could take some moreEmbed
