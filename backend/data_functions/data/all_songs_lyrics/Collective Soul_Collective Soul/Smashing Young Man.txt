Smashing Young Man Lyrics
Beggar's description
Of what I've been missing
Exploit your position
Don't think I didn't listen
Hey I hope you're feeling
A little better now

Success is so tragic
Pain is your gadget
Your tongue's just lashing
Just bitching by habit
Hey I hope you're feeling
A little purer now
Hey I hope you're feeling
Securer now

Help me I plea
I don't understand
Your ways and means
You smashing young man
Help me to see
The good you have planned
You're wearing thin
You smashing young man
You preach synthetic-like
Peace is an oversight
It's nothing to ignite
Your self-lit spotlight
Hey I hope you're feeling
A little special now
Hey I want to tell you
I think you're special now


I don't recall asking for guidance
I don't recall wanting to
I don't recall bowing before you
But I'm so impressed
With the kindness in your attitude
