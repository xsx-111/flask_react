Where The River Flows Lyrics
Give me a moment
Got to get this weight up off my chest
Don't feed me sorrow
Pain is a poison I digest

Find yourself another soul to hold
(You think, you thought, I know)
Off upon my journey I must go
(To where the river flows, to where the river flows)

I'll give you answers
To the questions you have yet to ask
Silence is beauty
Words, they only complicate the task


Make no more wishes
All of my patience has been spent
Gods of the season
Lead me to my next incident

Find yourself another soul to hold
(You think, you thought, I know)
Off upon my journey I must go
(To where the river flows, to where the river flows, to where the river flows)1Embed
