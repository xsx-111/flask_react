Get It Get It LyricsMy heart it dances
Whenever I'm with you
Don't make advances
I'm scared of what you'll do
We go out
Have a laugh
Have a good time
You and I
We go on
Have a drink
Have a good time
You and I
And when the night is through
It feels so right to kiss your lips
Wish I could say to you
That I've got so much
Come and get it
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Hug and kiss it
Love it love it!
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
If you're with it
Come and get it
Come and get it
I'm waiting in my room
To pick you up at eight
There's so much we can do
I promise I won't be late!
We go out
Have a laugh
Have a good time
You and I
We go on
Have a drink
Have a good time
You and I
And when the fun ends
I look into your eyes and say
Oh what a lovely time
I think that this might be the day to
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Hug and kiss it
Love it love it!
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
If you're with it
Come and get it
And when the night is through
It feels so right to kiss your lips
Wish I could say to you
That I've got so much
Come and get it
And when the fun ends
I look into your eyes and say
Oh what a lovely time
I think that this might be the day to...
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
Hug and kiss it
Love it love it!
Get it, get it
Get it, get it
If you're with it
Come and get itEmbed
