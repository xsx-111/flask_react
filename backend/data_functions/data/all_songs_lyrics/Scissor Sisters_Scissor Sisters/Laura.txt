Laura Lyrics
Laura, can't you give me some time?
I got to give myself one more chance
To be the man that I know I am
To be the man that I know I am
Won't you just tell Cincinnati?
I'm gonna need your love
Don't you give me your love
Don't you give me your

Sh'mon
Sh'mon
Where is your love?
Don't you give me your love
Don't you give me your
Sh'mon
Sh'mon
Where is your love?
Don't you give me your love
Don't you give me your

Freida, can't you spare me a dime?
I got to give myself one more chance
To ring the band that I know I'm in
To ring the band that I know I'm in
Won't you just tell Babydaddy?
I'm gonna need his love
Why don't you give me he love?
Why don't you give me he
Sh'mon
Sh'mon
Where is your love
Don't you give me your love
Don't you give me your
Sh'mon
Sh'mon
Where is your love?
Don't you give me your love
Don't you give me your

This'll be the last time
I ever do your hair
(Tired of this shit, swear I'm gonna quit
Can't seem to make enough dough, but my cuttin's on a roll)
One face among the many
I never thought you cared
(Seen enough stuff, thought I got rough
Now I know it ain't so, I gotta live on my own)
This'll be the last time
I ever do your hair
(Tired of this shit, swear I'm gonna quit
Can't seem to make enough dough, but my cuttin's on a roll)
One face among the many
I never thought you cared
(Seen enough stuff, thought I got rough
Now I know it ain't so, I gotta live on my own)Embed
