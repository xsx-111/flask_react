Lovers in the Backseat LyricsShe's quiet when she's down
Strangers from other towns
Nowhere to be found
On this side of the scene
Would you like a cigarette
Or my hand upon your shoulder?
I think we might have met
Would you like me to come over?
There's lovers in the backseat
Jealous glances now I'm looking for another song
On the radio
I'll take you to a side street
In the shadows you can touch one another now
And I'll just watch the show
She's happy when she's proud
Attention well deserved
Exuberant and loud
A disguise can he know?
How much she needs him
There's static on the sidelines
Can you read my thoughts?
Maybe its the right time
There's lovers in the backseat
Jealous glances now I'm looking for another song
On the radio
I'll take you to a side street
In the shadows you can touch one another now
And I'll just watch the showEmbed
