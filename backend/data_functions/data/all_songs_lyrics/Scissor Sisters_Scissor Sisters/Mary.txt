Mary LyricsI love the tone that's in your laugh
Gasping for an extra breath
Waiting for the time to pass
I believe in days ahead
Don't spend another night alone
Cross and wishing you were dead
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Ooh...ohhh
I've had it easy now you see
When I'm down you're always there
Standing by to comfort me
Someday we'll go round the world
I'll make the journey so sublime
I know you're not a travelling girl
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Ohhhh ohhhh
'Cause I'd give everything I have
Forget all the things that bring me joy
If you could have one day of pure and simple happiness
Until that moment comes
I'll be here where I've always been
I'm gonna be your friend
Until the day I die
Mary, you shouldn't let it make you mad
You hold the best you can
And Mary, after all the pain is gone
I'm always gonna live to be your man
Oohh ooohh oohhhh1Embed
