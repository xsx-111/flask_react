Filthy/Gorgeous Lyrics
Oh you're so filthy
And I am gorgeous

When you're walkin' down the street
And a man tries to get your business
And the people that you meet
Want to open you up like Christmas
You gotta wrap your fuzzy with a big red bow
Ain't no sum bitch gonna treat me like a ho
I'm a classy honey kissy huggy lovey dovey ghetto princess

Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (gorgeous)
Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (gorgeous)
You're disgusting
Oooh, and you're nasty
And you can grab me
Oooh cuz you're nasty

When you're runnin' from a trick
And you trip on a hit of acid
You gotta work for the man
But your biggest moneymaker's flaccid
You gotta keep your shit together
With your feet on the ground
There ain't no one gonna listen
If you haven't made a sound
You're an acid junkie college flunky dirty puppy daddy bastard
Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (gorgeous)
Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (gorgeous)
You're disgusting
Oooh, and you're nasty
And you can grab me
Oooh cuz you're nasty

Cuz you're filthy (so filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (oooh gorgeous)
Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (oooh you're so gorgeous)
You're disgusting (oh yeah)
And you're nasty (you make me feel so nasty)
You can grab me (grab it)
Oooh cause you're nasty
Filthy
Gorgeous
Oh you're so gorgeous
Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (gorgeous)
Cuz you're filthy (filthy)
Oooh, and I'm gorgeous (gorgeous)
You're disgusting
Oooh, and you're nasty
And you can grab me
Oooh cuz you're nastyEmbed
