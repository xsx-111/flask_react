The Skins LyricsYou are subject to inspections
Those are not your lips
Have you been kissed by a computer?
Are you able to move your hips?
It's the skins can you see them
Holding us in?
The skins can you see them?
We cling to our skins
Is it true, are you changing?
If so I won't come in
Are you going to be so different?
There's a world without skin
It's the skins can you see them
Holding us in?
The skins can you see them?
We cling to our skins
Randy Perkins where are you now?
The age of innocence is dead
Legions of legends have shown us how
When you're ageing it's so hard to keep your head
When you're ageing it's so hard to keep your head
I'm not complaining it's so hard to keep my head
When you're ageing it's so hard to keep your head
It's the skins can you see them
Holding us in?
The skins can you see them?
We cling to our skinsEmbed
