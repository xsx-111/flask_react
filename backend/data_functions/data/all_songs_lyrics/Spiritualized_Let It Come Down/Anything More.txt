Anything More LyricsThough my body gets tired
My mind does it no favors at all
And there's so little time
To do something, something, anything more
And there's no use in crying
About the damage that you've done inside
There's so little time
To do something, something, anything more
And your eyes say it all
Just like the way they did before
There's so little time
So do something, something, anything more
Don't cry, baby, cry
As long as you and I
Do more than just survive
Don't cry, have a real good life
And you know the things we do
Mean more to me than you
But the rain just came right through
Don't cry, we'll have a real good life
Though my body gets old
My mind does it no favors at all
There's so little time
To do something, something, anything more
And there's no use in crying
About the damage that you've done inside
There's so little time
To do something, something, anything more
And your eyes say it all
Just like the way they did before
There's so little time
So do something, something, anything more
There's no use in crying
There's no use in crying
There's no use in crying
There's no use in crying
There's no use in crying
There's no use in cryingEmbed
