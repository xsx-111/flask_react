The Straight and the Narrow Lyrics
The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the Devil makes good use of these hands of mine

And if Jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the Devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years

You know that I got a little something I should say
I guess that I'm just so easily led astray
It's alright because I know my own way back home from here
And I don't fall off the wagon, you know
I take a dive and go as deep as I can go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time
And...

The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the Devil makes good use of these hands of mine

You know that I got a little problem or two
I guess that I keep on taking a few
I've been told it's not the best thing that I can do right now
And I don't go looking for my sins you know
They come out waiting and I just get on and go
Don't hold your breath because I'm coming up slow this time
And...
The trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the Devil makes good use of these hands of mine

And if Jesus is the straight path that saves
Then I'm condemned to live my whole life on the curb
On the crossroad to the Devil, I'll dwell and I'll count my years

And the trouble with the straight and the narrow
Is it's so thin, I keep sliding off to the side
And the Devil makes, the Devil makes
Good use of these hands of mineEmbed
