Out of Sight LyricsOut of sight is always out of mind
I think out of mind is out of sight
I was just looking for some peace of mind
I just couldn't find a piece of mine
They say that pride comes just before a fall
I have fallen and I wasn't sure
You know that I have fallen further before
I just cannot stand falling no more
If I am good, I could add years to my life
I would rather add some life to my years
Life is really what you make it they say
I can't even make my mind up today
The world keeps turning, it keeps me in my place
Where I stand is only three miles from space
Standing space is all the space I can stand
Gravity just keeps on keeping me down
Out of sight is always out of mind
I think out of mind is out of sight
I was just looking for some peace of mind
But I just couldn't find a piece of mine
They say that pride comes just before a fall
I have fallen and I wasn't proud
You know that I have fallen further before
I just cannot stand falling no more
If I am good, I could add years to my life
I would rather add some life to my years
And life is really what you make it they say
I can't even make my mind up today
The planet spins and it keeps me in my place
Where I stand is only three miles from space
Well getting closer now to being apart
I kinda knew that, people; right from the startEmbed
