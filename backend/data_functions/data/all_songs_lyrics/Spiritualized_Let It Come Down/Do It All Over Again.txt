Do It All Over Again Lyrics
You gotta hope for the best and the best looks good now baby
And I don't think a few words of sympathy are gonna make your world go 'round
I'm sitting here looking at the TV and burning holes in everything that I get

You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again

I love you like I love the sun in the morning
But I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make you change your mind
I'm gonna spend the day in bed and I'm planning on sleeping my life away

You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again

You've gotta hope for the best and the best looks great now baby
And I don't think a few words of mine are gonna make your world go 'round
I'm sitting here looking at the TV and burning holes in everything that I get

You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over again
You'd better come right down and do it all over againEmbed
