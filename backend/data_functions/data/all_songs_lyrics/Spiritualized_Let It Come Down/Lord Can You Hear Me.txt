Lord Can You Hear Me Lyrics
Lord, help me out
I'd take my life, but I'm in doubt
Just where my soul will lie:
Deep in the earth or way up in the sky?

Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?

All my lovers have left my side
Can't get enough of life
To keep me satisfied
I've lost about everything
Lord, look what state I'm in

Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, when I call?
Lord, can you hear me, hear me at all?Embed
