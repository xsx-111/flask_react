On Fire Lyrics
Let's see how high we can fly
Before the sun melts the wax in our wings
Let's see how fast we can go
Before our eyes can't follow the road

I'm on fire
There's no water for the flames
And I'm alive
With no one but myself to blame
And I'm proud
That I've never fallen down
And I have learned
All the truth is tragedy now

Let's see how fast we can live
Until our times start slowing us down
Just how much further we go
Before we get our place in the ground

I'm on fire
There's no water for the flames
And I'm alive
With no one but myself to blame
And I'm free
To do just what I want to do
And I burn
All that faith has had me deny
Come on my love
Come on my child
Let heaven flow
Into your soul
Let it come on down
Ease away pain
You won't feel
That way again
Come on my love
Come on my child
Let heaven flow
Into your soul
Let it come on down
Let it come on down
Let it come on down
Let it come on down
Into your soul x8
(Into your soul) x8
Into your soulEmbed
