Stop Your Crying Lyrics
Nothing hurts you like the pain of someone you love
There ain't nothing you can gain that prepares you enough

Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now
Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now

Nothing hurts you like the pain of someone you care about
If I could take it all myself, you know, I sure would
Without a doubt

Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now
Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now

Nothing hurts you like the pain of someone so close to you
I feel so broke inside, but I'll devote my life to lovin' you

Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now
Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now
Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now
Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying now

Come on baby, stop your crying
Come on baby, stop your crying nowEmbed
