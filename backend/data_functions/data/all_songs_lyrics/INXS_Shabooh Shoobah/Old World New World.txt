Old World New World LyricsNatives wearing turquoise and silver
Dirty dogs barking in the distance
Ooh, people of a thousand tongues
I'm learning the primitive rites
I'm doing as the Roman's do
Mt. Kalais to Mt. Everest
Then down to River Ganges
Ooh, to follow your mighty past
We're learning the primitive rites
We're doing as the Roman's do
Old World, New World
I know nothing
But I'll keep listening
Cities tumble into the ocean
Cities getting built in the sky
Ooh, now we're talking digital
We're learning the primitive rites
We're doing as the Roman's do
Millions playing at monopoly
Rolling the dice of their lives
Ooh, dancing and shaking hands
We're learning the primitive rites
We're doing as the Roman's do
Old World, New World
I know nothing
But I'll keep listening
I know nothing
Grow old look wise
Never knowing 'till I die
But I'll keep listening
I'll keep listening
Pan, Shambala, Judaism
Hindu, Christianity
Muslim, Buddhism
