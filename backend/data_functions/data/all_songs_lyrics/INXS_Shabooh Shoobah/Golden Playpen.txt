Golden Playpen LyricsI'm drunk can't see my glass
Not worried - chair dancing man
Tossed out of the golden playpen
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure
You see the street ahead
Just keep walking down it
Look straight ahead
Nite club ice cubes crackin'
The money's gone
Don't have a cent
Tossed out of the golden playpen
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure
Sex talks eats you alive
We go making friends
Till we're satisfied
I'm drunk can't see my glass
Not worried - chair dancing man
Tossed out of the golden playpen
Beating the drum of pain and pleasureEmbed
