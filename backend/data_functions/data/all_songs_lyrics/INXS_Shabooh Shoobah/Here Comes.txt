Here Comes LyricsHere comes the rationalization
Here comes the song I know
There's a change of weather coming
There's a change in me and you
I found some questions
To the answers
The dancing flames
Of romances
Freedom is intoxicating
It's a lizard in your hand
Don't you worry about the future
I need some in my plan
I found some questions
To the answers
'Bout the dancing flames
Of romance's
Here come my kamakazee
Here comes god's top ten
Nothing to be done to stop it
Nothing to get in it's way
I found some questions
Too the answers
The dancing flames
Of romance's
Flame of romance's
Found some questionsEmbed
