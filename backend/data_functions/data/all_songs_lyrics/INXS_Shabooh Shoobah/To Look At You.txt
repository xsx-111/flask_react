To Look At You LyricsWhat is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words
To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonite
Who do you ask when there's no one
Left to turn to
You ask me and I'll always try to hear
Past money and colours and make believe
Good cheap values for a thrifty clown
To Look at You
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonite
What do you fear in the simple
Still of a summer's nite
I understand I sympathize for a day dream
Fairytales and I love you
What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feeling's
But never the words
To this ... real life documentaryEmbed
