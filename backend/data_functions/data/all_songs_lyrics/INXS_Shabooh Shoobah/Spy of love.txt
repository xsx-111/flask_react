Spy of love LyricsHave you noticed to this day
How many times you've prayed and played
Lifting lovers up and down
It get's around in this old town
Sleight of hand and sleight of mouth
A dirty trick to catch me out
I don't mind but what I say
Use that magic for better days
Standing above this moment
Listening to all I say
The spy of love will track me
Will catch me
Through the window I see a face
That dirty face that speaks with sorrow
You listen to the walls for clues
And stand in shadows protecting you
Standing above this moment
Listening to all I say
The spy of love will track me
Will catch me
Have you noticed to this day
How many times you've prayed and played
Lifting lovers up and down
It get's around in this old town
Standing above the moment
Listening to all I say
The spy of love will track me
Will catch meEmbed
