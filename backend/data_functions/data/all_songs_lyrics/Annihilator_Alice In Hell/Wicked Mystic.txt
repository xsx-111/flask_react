Wicked Mystic LyricsAll throughout the centuries, existing year to year
Lives on the powerful entity to thrive on pain and fear
A derelict of heavenly Gods, a feeling from within
Weakened minds are perfect prey, corrosion will begin
Chorus:
Some won't fight, the battle is forsaken
Show no might, the dark side has awakened
Even in the holiest the curious can be found
Their wonderment is dangerous as virtue is but bound
Moral codes broken
What's the sin that lurks within, the burning emotion of hatred
Repeat Chorus
Wicked Mystic
Hatred lurks in all of us, no one is exempt
It's proof of evil in our souls, is this the tempter's intent
A derelict of heavenly Gods, a feeling from within
Weak minds are perfect prey for corrosion to begin
Repeat Chorus
Wicked Mystic
Wicked Mystic, Mystic
Burns Like A Buzzsaw Blade
Excess perversion, and we'll never let it end
You and I are making a private legend
We've got the hunger, got the thirst
You want it slow, our bodies glow, nails rake my back
Chorus:
Tongue licks sweet parade
Animal lust, and it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Drippin' wet, we laugh at this charade
Screams of love in the air tonight
And it burns like a buzzsaw blade
Gratification, do you want some more
On the bed, entangled on the floor
Feel my eyes burn, we writhe until the dawn
Tease and please, humility is gone
Repeat Chorus
Excess perversion, and we'll never let it end
You and I are making a private legend
Feel my eyes burn, feel everything
On my knees, but I reign as your king
Repeat ChorusEmbed
