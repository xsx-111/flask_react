Ligeia LyricsI do not remember, where we did meet
Lengthened years have built my mind, memories undeep
Yet with instability, one thing stands too clear
Lady perfection, mystery, of whom I shed a tear
Chorus:
Airwoven divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Repeat Chorus
Sickness fell upon Ligeia, all knew she would die
Midnight came to lay her rest, farewell
Opium dreams, grief-stricken years, I took another bride
Replacing that which I did have, Ligeia why
Repeat Chorus (x2)
Bridge:
Chronic disease, my luck cursed
My new wife has died
Coming from her bed of death, I thought I heard her cry
Could a corpse cold, stiff, sedate, sob in the bed it lie
Approaching her, I chilled to stone, for it did swiftly rise
I can never be mistaken, there were, they were, Ligeia's eyes
Chorus:
Airwoven, divinity, mind, soul in victory
Cured of her malady, could this be my lost;
Ligeia
Airwoven divinity, tears shed, vitality
Cured of her malady, yes this is my lost;Embed
