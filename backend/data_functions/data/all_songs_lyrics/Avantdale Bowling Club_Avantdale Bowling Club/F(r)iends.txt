F(r)iends Lyrics
Old boy sittin' in the dark with a lightbulb
And a lighter in his hand like a pyro
Just can't put the thing down like an iPhone
Got too high flipped out like a psycho
What's he gonna do? Where's he gonna go now
Last I heard he was living in a motel
Broke up with his old girl then he broke down
Took it out on a best bro they ain't bros now
What you really know about shit like that?
Thirty-one years old, addicted to crack since way back
How you gonna quit like that
Try kick that shit it'll kick right back
Moved back with the old girl got kicked out
Moved back with the old man got kicked out
Whole life been an addict can't quit now
He just gotta have it, can't sit down
I remember when he used ta'
Turn the whole fucking room up
Wasn't anybody cooler back then
I was just a fucking loser
But you knew me before I blew up
Before anybody gave two fuck
Showed love so I gotta show you love back
Real shit man this here for you bruv
This one here
This one right here
This one here for you
This one right here
This one here
This go out to you
This for my homie, my brother
Real shit it's all true
This for my bolzi
You know me
And how long I known you?
We ain't even gotta be on the stuff when i say this stuff bruv
I ain't shit without you
I ain't even gotta say no name when i say this you already know who its going out to
This one right here
This one right here
This one here for you
This one right here
This one here
This go out to you

Old boy lying in a hospital lonely
Doped out on the dope looking all dopey
Had a little too much fun then he OD'ed
Just tryna keep up with all the homies
What you gonna do? Where you gonna go out
When your home town looks something like a ghost town
And the bro roll round with a whole pound like
"Oh well might as well have another blow out"
How you gonna slow down just like that?
Five years in she just gapped like fuck that
I probably would have reacted the same way
I don't know nothing about that can't say nah
Too much for one human to think about
Chewed him up and then she just spit him out
'Til they figured out a better way to get it out
Pour me up another Hennessy and ginger ale
Cause I probably woulda done the same thing anyhow
If I had that shit to forget about
Gotta get it out gotta get around
Why settle down sit down bruv lemme get around
It's a beautiful night dont wanna spoil it
While we doing coke off the top of the toilet
Lets toast this bottle full of poison
To a life full of pain and disappointment
You remember when I used ta
Live off tinfoil and tuna
I gave a sip about my future back then
I was just a fucking user so look
I ain't tryna judge you bruv
You just keep on doing what you do bruv
But I gotta be straight to ya
Because I'm the one who introduced ya
So this here
This one here
This one right here
This one here for you
This one right here
This one here
This go out to you
This for my homie, my brother
Real shit it's all true
This for my bolzi
You know me
And how long I known you?
We ain't even gotta be on the stuff when I say this stuff bruv
I ain't shit without you
I ain't even gotta say no name when I say this you already know who its going out to
This one right here
This one right here
This one here for you
This one right here
This one here
This go out to you

Remember when we used to do drugs
Now it's kinda like they do us
Did it until we did too much
Everything after that  really ain't do much
Started out on them blue doves
Then moved up to that yellow school-bus
Now it's like I need two doz' just for a buzz
I need to get a new buzz its been too long
My girl's two months due
Guess it's time that I grew up
Time to retire I'm tying my boots up
All that youth that I had I used up
I'm too old for these new drugs
Too clued up to be queued up
For this club this scrub just spewed up
On my brand new blue Pumas
Somebody call me an Uber
Before I turn into Tua
Who got the ulas? Look
Ain't nothing wrong with no Luda
But i'd rather be at home banging that Luther
My brains already screwed up
From all the 'cid I chewed up
I'm bout to grow me a tumor
All my friends all stuck in the past
Still dancing to Future
I was conceived by two users
I was supposed to be a loser
I had to see my old man cooped up in a orange jumpsuit tryna shoot up
I seen the sky, I seen the sewer
I seen a sign I shoulda seen sooner
I seen my best friend pack that flute up
One year later he tied that noose up
This one here

Friends, all my so called friends
They don't hang around me, anymore
Friends, all my so called friends
They don't hang around me, anymore
Friends, all my so called friends
They don't hang around me, anymore
Friends, all my so called friends
They don't hang around me, anymore
Friends, all my so called friends
They don't hang around me, anymore2Embed
