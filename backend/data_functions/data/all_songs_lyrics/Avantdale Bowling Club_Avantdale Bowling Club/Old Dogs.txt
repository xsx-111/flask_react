Old Dogs Lyrics
And we were chilling at the park
Feeling like I'm Miller at the arc
Killing it like Starks at The Garden
Feeling myself, my self esteem can't be guarded
Been on my Carmen Sandiego, just got back from France
And I gotta little bit of that Parisian steez in me still
My knees are Grant Hill, but I still feel like Phil
I'm on that zen ting, feel like I just won my 10th ring
I'm on, I could shoot the sun into a wedding ring
From half court, it's pouring, shots falling like autumn
Trash talking like I'm Jordan, off the back board for boredom
Like it was H.O.R.S.E, I'm calling it before I even saw it
Feeling like I ain't even shoot it, I just thought it
Into existence, you know that feel? '04 Pistons
Free will got me like me like Wilt, '62 Sixers
Game point, it's our check, from long distance
I hit the swish, then I hit the spliff and kissed the misuss
And it was like that
And it was like that, sometimes it just go like that
Sometimes, sometimes, yeah it just kinda go like that

And we were just sitting round, sitting round at the park
Said we gonna burn the tree, and then we watch the fire start
We are, we are nothing but some old dogs
Running round in the grass
Said we gonna hit the tree, then hit the shot off the glass
We are, we are
We crack a beer, sit back and stare
I catch some air, I scratch my beard
Me and the homies and we're feeling like the poor man's Cavaliers
Could be anywhere in the world, but I'm happy here right now
A feeling that felt so right I had to write it down
Standing about 5'9" but I felt like Yao
Up in the post, chilling with those close enough to know my nose hairs
Cheers to all of the years that we spent in the middle of nowhere
Going some place with a numb face so Sunday's come down would feel this good
6 foot 10 high, living like drift wood
Thoughts flow like lawn bowls roll, more joints rolled
Then passed to the left like the wing of our bird flying in circles
We deal out ideals like cards
Share our feels like psalms, avant-garde point guards
We doing our best Descartes
We doing our half-arse Marx
We counting dying stars
We talk about death, then laugh
We know this shit ain't gonna last
Take two puffs and then we pass
There's one beer left, now we're sitting in the dark
Ain't no tree left to burn, there ain't no question left to ask
Just some old dogs, sitting watching time run past
In the park
And we were just sitting round, sitting round at the park
Said we gonna burn the tree, and then we watch the fire start
We are, we are nothing but some old dogs
Running round in the grass
Said we gonna hit the tree, then hit the shot off the glass
We are, we are

Well I'm livin',  free spirit, so let me roam
No limit, all's forgiven, let me feed my soul
Well I'm livin',  free spirit, so let me roam
No limit, all's forgiven, let me feed my soul

All of my responsibilities (out the window)
Kick the socks off and feel the breeze (you know I)
Sunny days got me real at ease
Only way I can feel the peace (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Cause all of my frets
All of my woes, all of my stress
Fall off my shoulders, I'm blessed
All of my close ones, come rest
Follow my glow
And we can link up when it's high tide
Jump off on the high side
King tuck when I climb
Cityscapes and skylines
So just disconnect your wifi
Open up you eyes like
You need those rays today
Old dogs keep aging believe
But cherish these memories
They indeed won't fade away
Last night I slept in the open
Down by the redwood tree
Last night I slept in the open
Just to let my soul be free
Last night I slept in the open
Down by the redwood tree1Embed
