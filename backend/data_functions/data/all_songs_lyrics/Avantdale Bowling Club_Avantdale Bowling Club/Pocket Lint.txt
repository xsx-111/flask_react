Pocket Lint Lyrics
My lady late like the rent, I'm skint
Every cent that I made I spent
Cut the cheque and I paid my pimp
Now all I got is this pocket lint
The bank that run the world ain't my friend
Man that own the land ain't my kin
Fingers crossed at the ATM

All i got is this pocket lint
Pocket lint
Pocket lint
All i got is this pocket lint
Pocket lint
Pocket lint
Pocket lint

Low down, broke, no cash
No hope, skint, nomad
No plan B, no stash
Only got the crumbs sitting in my moustache
Time to get away and get off my broke ass
Getting on a plane no plan to go back
Ain't no place like home, I know that
But there are a couple dudes I know that smoke crack
And they say that, 'hey it ain't so bad'
But they don't really know they got a rich old man
Talking about some land that I don't have talking about some
Avocado smash
Haves don't wanna know what i don't
Have
And the bank won't give me a loan
For Home Brand
Ugh. I'm just tryna support my own fam
But I can't even afford a home in my home land
'Cause all i got is some pocket lint
Yeah I said all i got is some pocket lint
Yeah all i got is just some pocket lint
Pocket lint
Pocket lint
Pocket lint

The milk, the bread, the bills, the bed
The fruit, the veg, the warrant and reg
The battery dead, an arm and a leg to get a carton of eggs
A bottle of white, a bottle of red, a bottle
Of meds
The money she lent, the money you spent
The money you're meant to pay rent, here's the repo men again
Unread envelope on the bench
One step from the edge, on the end
Of a 3 day bend at the ATM
On a Sunday 8 am, again
The price of the life, the price of death
The price of gas, the price of meth, the side effect of stress
Tryna stretch the cheque till next payday
Pray Baycorp forget to get back
Before the debt get up to the neck
Back against the wall, bout to loose your head
Power bill, water bill, cigarettes, internet
50 cent in the piggy bank for the
Picket fence
Dream that you'll never get, scheming the benefit
Never get the benefit of the doubt though, never left home
Nobody wins at WINZ, they’re all pimps
No sympathy, they think we're all chimps
Rich all think the poor are all crims
And the poor all think the rich are all shit
Everybody wanna take the piss and talk shit
None of them have had to clean the toilet
Hard when you're born in Auckland
Gotta pawn an organ to afford the fucking mortgage
It's tense living in tents
We've all been desensitised, they pretending like
It's all-good. It’s good to be them
Got a new PM with a cool boyfriend
But she never comes to my ends
The ends don't ever meet, the week don't ever end
I got to keep all the dirt under the bed
Just so I can keep a roof over the head
Fuck 15 bucks and seventy-five cents
Government wanna take twenty per cent
By the time you get paid all the money is spent
All I got left is some pocket lint
Pocket lint
Pocket lint

One day, you’ll get older
One day, you’ll get over
One day, you’ll get closer
One day, you’ll get closure
One day, you’ll get slower
One day, you’ll get sober
One day, you’ll get somewhere
One day, you’ll get nowhere
One day, you’ll get higher
One day, you’ll get lower
One day, you’ll take over
One day, you’ll get broker
One day at a time…
Just take it, one day at a time…1Embed
