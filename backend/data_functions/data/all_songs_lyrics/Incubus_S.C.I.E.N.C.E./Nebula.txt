Nebula Lyrics
Do you enjoy
Your sight inside?

Disconnect and let me drift
Until my upside down is right side in
Society must let the artist go
To wander off into the nebula

Wander off into your nebula
Your nectarine of multiplicity
Cums like orgasmatron
On overdrive
Wander off into your nebula
Your tangerine of electricity
Is ripe and on a vine
So pick your prize

So, in little black book
Do I confide?

Upon return, I conjure what was seen
I let it pulse and boil within my limbs
I lay my pencil to the porous page
And let my lunatic indulge itself
Wander off into your nebula
Your nectarine of multiplicity
Cums like orgasmatron
On overdrive
Wander off into your nebula
Your tangerine of electricity
Is ripe and on a vine
So pick your prize

Prize, prize, prize

Disconnect and let me drift
Until my upside down is right side in
Society must let the artist go
To wander off into the nebula

Wander off into your nebula
Your nectarine of multiplicity
Cums like orgasmatron
On overdrive
Wander off into your nebula
Your tangerine of electricity
Is ripe and on a vine
So pick your prizeEmbed
