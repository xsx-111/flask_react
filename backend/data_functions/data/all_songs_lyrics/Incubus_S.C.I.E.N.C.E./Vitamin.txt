Vitamin Lyrics
I'm born, I'm alive
I breathe, in a moment or two I realize
That the sphere upon which I reside is asleep on its feet
Should I go back to sleep?

I'm born, I'm alive
I breathe, in a moment or two I realize
That the sphere upon which I reside is asleep on its feet
Should I, should I, should I go back to sleep?

You stare at me like I'm a vitamin
On the surface you hate, but you know you need me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily

We orbit the sun, I grow up
My open eyes see a zombified, somnambulist society
Leaving us as vitamins for the hibernating human animal
Do you, do you, do you see what I mean?

You stare at me like I'm a vitamin
On the surface you hate, but you know you want me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily
And I wonder, will you digest me?

Into the sleep machine I won't plug in
In fact I'd rather die before I will comply
To you, my friend I write the reason I still live
Because in my mind it's set the vitamin is ripe to give
Coming closer to another two thousand years
You and I will pry the closed eye of the sleep machine

You stare at me like I'm a vitamin
On the surface you hate, but you know you want me
I come dressed as any pill you deem fit
Whatever helps you swallow truth all the more easily6Embed
