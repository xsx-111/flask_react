A Certain Shade Of Green Lyrics
What! What! What! What!
What! What! What! What!
What! What! What! What!

A certain shade of green
Tell me, is that what you need?
All signs around say move ahead
Could someone please explain to me your ever present lack of speed?
Are your muscles bound by ropes?
Or do crutches cloud your day?
My sources say the road is clear
And street signs point the way

Are you gonna stand around until 2012 A.D.?
What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate
What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?

Would a written invitation
Signed, choose now or lose it all
Sedate your hesitation
Or inflame and make you stall?
You've been raised in limitation
But that glove never fit quite right
The time has passed for hand-me-downs
Choose anew, please evolve, take flight
Are you gonna stand around until 2012 A.D.?
What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate

Green, what are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?
A written invitation?
A public declaration? Yeah
A private consolation? Oh
Remember, when you procrastinate, you choose last

I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate
Go, go, go, go

Are you going to stand around until 2012 A.D.?
What are you waiting for, a certain shade of green?
I'm gonna grow a gray watching you procrastinate

What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for
What are you waiting for8Embed
