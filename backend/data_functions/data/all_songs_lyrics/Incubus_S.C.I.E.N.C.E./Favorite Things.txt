Favorite Things Lyrics
I'm thinking of my soul's sovereignty
And I know everything you hate in me
Fill me up with over-pious badgerings
To throw them up, one of my favorite things

Too bad the things that make you mad are my favorite things
My favorite things

Remember all the lessons fed to me?
Me, the young sponge, so ready to agree
Years have gone, I recognize the walking dead
Now aware that I'm alive and way ahead

Too bad the things that make you mad are my favorite things
Yeah-yeah, oh yeah
And I'm so happy

I see you looking, I know that you're thinking
That I'll never go anywhere
The things that I've done and the things that I've seen
I don't really expect you to care, go!
Too bad the things that make you mad are my favorite things
Yeah-yeah, oh yeah
And I'm so happy

Too bad the things that make you mad are my favorite...
Too bad the things that make you mad are my favorite things1Embed
