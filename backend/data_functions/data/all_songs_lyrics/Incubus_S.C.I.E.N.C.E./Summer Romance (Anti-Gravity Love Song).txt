Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song) Lyrics
I'm home alone tonight
Full moon illuminates my room
And sends my mind aflight
I think I was dreaming of some thoughts
That were seemingly possible with you

So I call you on the tin can phone
We rendezvous a quarter-to
And make sure we're alone
I think I've found a way for you and I to finally fly free

When we get there
We're gonna fly so far away
Making sure to laugh
While we experience anti-gravity

Anti-gravity
Anti-gravity

For years, I kept it to myself
Now potentialities are bound
And living under my shelf
Simply choose your destination from the diamond canopy
And we'll be there
So I call you on the tin can phone
We rendezvous a quarter-two
And make sure we're alone
I think I've found a way for you and I to finally be free

When we get there
We're gonna fly so far away
Making sure to laugh
While we experience anti-gravity

Anti-gravity
Anti-gravity
Oh yeah

Anti-gravity
Anti-gravity
Oh yeah2Embed
