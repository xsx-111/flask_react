Glass Lyrics
I wonder why
Why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why

If I had a dime
For every time you walked away
I could afford to not give a shit
And buy a drink and drown the day
But your pockets, they are empty
Yeah, and mine are times two
So why not make an about-face
And accept the love I send to you?

You're never gonna be content if you won't try
Try to see outside your line
There you go, you did it again
You act as if there's blinders on your eyes

Should I apologize
If what I say burns your ears and stains your eyes?
Oh, did I crack your shell?
When it falls away, you'll see we exist as well
Like a bottle with the cork stuck
Your true ingredients trapped up inside
Through the cloudy glass we catch a glimpse of you
I guess the hard shell represents your pride
Oh, if only it could be different
We could uncover the you, you deny
Between two, a small discrepancy
One complicates and one simplifies

You're never gonna be content if you don't try
Try to see outside your line
There you go, you did it again
You act as if there's blinders on your eyes

Should I apologize
If what I say burns your ears and stains your eyes?
Oh, did I crack your shell?
When it falls away, you'll see we exist as well

(There you go, there you go, looks good)
Take those fucking blinders off your eyes
So if I had a dime
For every time you walked away
You can bet your bottom dollar that
I'd be filthy rich by noon today

Should I apologize
If what I say burns your ears and stains your eyes?
Oh, did I crack your shell?
When it falls away, you'll see we exist as well
Should I apologize
If what I say burns your ears and stains your eyes?
Oh, did I crack your shell?
When it falls away, you'll see we exist as well1Embed
