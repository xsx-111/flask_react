Deep Inside Lyrics
It's 3 o'clock and we ask ourselves
Where are we now?
It seems we've wondered out of bounds again

Over and over, we ask ourselves why we don't
Utilize things that are stored deep inside of our

Deep inside, I'm on my own
And I can't see straight
Deep inside, 'cause I'm so stoned
I can't see straight

Man, I've gotta find my way back home
But I'm too deep inside

It's 4 o'clock, and we ask ourselves
Where did we go wrong?
We passed my house at least an hour ago

Over and over, we ask ourselves why we don't
Utilize things that are stored deep inside of our
Deep inside, I'm on my own
And I can't see straight
Deep inside, 'cause I'm so stoned
I can't see straight

Straight, straight
Alright

It's 5 o'clock
And we tell ourselves (Tell ourselves)
"We need to get home"
The sun is creeping overhead again

Way too deep inside to get home
Way too deep inside to get home
Way too deep inside to get home
Way too deep inside to get home
Oh my god, I've got to get home
Oh my god, I've got to get home
Oh my god, I've got to get home
Way too deep inside to get home
Over and over, we ask ourselves why we don't
Utilize things that are stored deep inside of our...
I know exactly where we are
Where the fuck are we?1Embed
