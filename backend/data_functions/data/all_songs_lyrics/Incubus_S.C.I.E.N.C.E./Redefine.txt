Redefine Lyrics
Imagine your brain as a canister filled with ink
Yeah, now think of your body as the pen where the ink resides
Fuse the two, kapow! What are you now?
You're the human magic marker, won't you please surprise my eyes?
It's in your nature, you can paint whatever picture you like
No matter what Ted Koppel says on channel 4 tonight
So modify this third rock from the sun
By painting myriads of pictures with the colors of the one

I'm sick of painting in black and white
My pen is dry and I'm all uptight
So sick of limiting myself
To fit your definition
I'm sick of painting in black and white
My pen is dry and I'm all uptight
So sick of limiting myself
To fit your definition

Picture the scene, where whatever you thought
Would, in the blink of an eye, manifest and become illustrated
You'd be sure man that every line drawn
Reflected a life that you loved not an existence that you hated
So, must we demonstrate that we can't get it straight?
We've painted a picture now we're drowning in the paint
Let's figure out what the fuck it's about
Before the picture we painted chews us up and spits us out
I'm sick of painting in black and white
My pen is dry and I'm all uptight
So sick of limiting myself
To fit your definition
I'm sick of painting in black and white
My pen is dry and I'm all uptight
So sick of limiting myself
To fit your definition

I'm sick of painting in black and white
My pen is dry and I'm all uptight
So sick of limiting myself
To fit your definition

So, must we demonstrate that we can't get it straight?
We've painted a picture now we're drowning in the paint
Let's figure out what the fuck it's about
Before the picture we painted chews us up and spits us out3Embed
