Magic Medicine LyricsOn this page you see a little girl giggling at a hippopotamus
I wonder why?
Wonder why
On this page you see a little girl giggling at a hippopotamus
I wonder why?
Turn the page, thank you
On this page you see a little girl giggling at a hippopotamus
"Don't
Don't
Don't
Don't
Don't say things that hurt others," said pussycat
Pussycat
Pussycat
Pussycat
Like, "Isn't that hippo fat?"
Fat
Fat
Fat
Fat
Fat, fat
Fat, fat
Fat, fat
Or shout "Hyena, I hate you"
Hate you, hate you
Hate you, hate you
Hate
I found a sound in the house one day
If you know who lost it, I'll give it away
Away
Away
Away
This sound I found said, "This sound belongs to a hot ray"
Ray
Hot
Hot
Hot
The magic medicine workedEmbed
