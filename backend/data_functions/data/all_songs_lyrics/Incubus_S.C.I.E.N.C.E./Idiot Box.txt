Idiot Box Lyrics
In my head

You keep your riches and I'll sew my stitches
You can't make me think like you, mundane
I've got a message for all those who think that
They can etch his words inside my brain
Inside my brain

TV, what do I need? Tell me who to believe
What's the use of autonomy when a button does it all?
When a little button does it all, does it all?

So, listen up, listen up closely, all
Who've seen the fucking eye-ache too
It's time to step away from cable train
And when we finally see the subtle light
This quirk in evolution will begin
To let us live and recreate
Create again

TV, what do I need? Tell me who to believe
What's the use of autonomy when a button does it all?
TV, what did I see? Tell me who should I be
Let's do our Mom a favor and drop a new God off the wall
Let me see past the fatuous knocks
I've got to rid myself of this idiot box
Let you see past the feathers and flocks
And help me plant a bomb in this idiot box

From the depths of the sea, to the tops of the trees
To the seat of a La-Z-Boy staring at a silver screen

TV, what do I need? Tell me who to believe
What's the use of autonomy when a button does it all?
TV, what did I see? Tell me who should I be
Let's do our Mom a favor and drop a new God off the wall, wallEmbed
