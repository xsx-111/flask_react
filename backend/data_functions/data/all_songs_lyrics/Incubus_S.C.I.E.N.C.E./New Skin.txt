New Skin Lyrics
At first I see an open wound
Infected and disastrous
It breathes chaotic catastrophe
It cries to be renewed (Please renew me!)
Its tears are the color of anger
They dry to form a scab
To the touch, its stiff and resilient
Underneath, the new skin breathes, yeah


It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?

As outwardly cliche as it may seem
Yes, something under the surface says "c'est la vie"
There is a circle, it is a plan
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Look closely at the open wound
See past what covers the surface
Underneath chaotic catastrophe
Creation takes the stage, so
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again
Dead skin will atrophy itself to start again

It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?

Until the twentieth century, reality was everything humans could touch, smell, see, and hear. Since the initial publication of the chart of electromagnetic spectrum, humans have learned that what they can touch, smell, see, and hear is less than one millionth of reality.

Fallacious cognitions
Spewed from televisions
Do mold our decisions
So stop and take a look and you'll see what I see now
Now!

It's all been saved
With the exception for the right parts
But when will we be new skin?
It's all been seen
With the exception for what could be
But when will we be new skin?
