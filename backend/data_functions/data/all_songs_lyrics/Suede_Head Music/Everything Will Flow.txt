Everything Will Flow Lyrics
Watch the early morning sun
Drip like blood from the day
See the pretty people run
So many games to play
See the blue suburban dream
Under the jetplane sky
Sleep away and dream a dream
Life is just a lullaby-by

Oh, and everything will flow
Oh you know everything will flow
Oh

Watch the day begin again
Whispering into the night
See the pretty people play
Hurrying under the light
A million cars a million trains
Under the jetplane sky
Nothing lost and nothing gained
Life is just a lullaby-by

Oh and everything will flow
Oh I said everything will flow
Oh you know everything will flow
Oh
Oh and everything will flow
Oh you know everything will flow
The neon lights in the night tonight
Will say"everything will flow"
The stars that shine in the open sky
Know "everything will flow"
The lovers kissed with an openness
Will say "everything will flow"
The cars parked in the hyper market
Know "everything will flow"Embed
