Electricity Lyrics
We got a love that's cold as stone
We got a love from our violent homes
We got a love and it got no name
We kiss our love with lips like pain
We got a lotta electricity
We got a love like AC/DC
We got a love and it got no shame
We kiss our love with lips like pain
Kissing our love with lips like pain

Oh it's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than the two of us
Oh it's bigger than you and me
We got a love between us and it's like electricity

We got a love like a violent mind
We get our love from white white lines
We got a love and it got no name
We kiss our love with lips like pain
We got a love from nowhere towns
We got a love like electric sounds
We got a love and it got no shame
We kiss our love with lips like pain
Kissing our love with lips like pain
I said, oh it's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than the two of us
Oh it's bigger than you and me
We got a love between us and it's like electricity


Oh it's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than the two of us
Oh it's bigger than you and me
We got a love between us that's like electricityEmbed
