Indian Strings Lyrics
Open up my heart and see what's inside
Take a look inside me, inside my mind
And you'll see my heart is broken in two
Cos I've seen the real you

Images of violence fill up my mind
And you see the silence, feel it inside
And you'll see my heart is broken in two
Cos I've seen the real you

So sad we seem, so far we've been
She knows the scene
And I see your heart is broken too
Cos we've seen the real you
Seen the real youEmbed
