Down Lyrics
All the people in your life say you're down
And the strangers in the night say you're down
And the loonies on the right say you're down and you're down
And the ambulances sigh that you're down
And the traffic speeding by says you're down
And the people in your mind say you're down
And you're down

Hey you chase the day away
Hey you draw the blinds and blow your mind away
And there's a sadness in your style
And there's a blankness in your smile

And the people in the park say you're down
And the strangers in the dark say you're down
And the pissheads in the bars say you're down
And the audiences cry that you're down
And the ambulances sigh that you're down
And the boyfriends in your life say you're down
And you're down

Hey you chase the day away
Hey you draw the blinds and blow your mind away
And there's a sadness in your style
And there's a blankness in your smile
Hey you chase the day away
Hey you draw the blinds and blow your mind away
And there's a sadness in your style
And there's a madness in your smile

All the people in your life say you're downEmbed
