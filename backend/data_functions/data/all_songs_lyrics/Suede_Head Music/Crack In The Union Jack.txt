Draw the blinds and watch the show
Heard it on the radio
Saw it on the news today
Heard the lonely people say

There's a great big crack in the union jack
There's a great big crack in the union jack

Another day, another low
Another midday TV show
I saw it on the news today
I heard the lonely people say

There's a great big crack in the union jack
There's a great big crack in the union jack
In the union jackEmbed
