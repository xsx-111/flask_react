Asbestos Lyrics
Watching all the women shaking slimming
Walking down the road again
Looking at the lovers under covers
Come in and let's be friends

Watching all the schoolgirls shaking new girl
Coming on and having sex
Watching all the women shaking slimming
Come in and cash the cheques

The suburban girls
And they're making noise
And they're making eyes
At suburban boys

Watching all the lovers under cover
Watching all the roads that bend
Listening to lulu, amazula
Come in and let's pretend

Watching all the women shaking slimming
Walking down the road again
Scheming like a schoolboy watching you boy
Come in and let's pretend
The suburban girls
And they're making noise
And they're making eyes
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
The suburban girls
And they're making noise
And they're making eyes
At suburban boys
Suburban girls
And they're making noise
And they're making eyes
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boys
At suburban boysEmbed
