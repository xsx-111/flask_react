Head Music Lyrics
Lonely skies
Empty minds
We walk by to the rock and rhyme
I said, oh come on do it again

City signs
Business minds
We walk by with head hi-fi
You know oh I wanna do it again

And we lose it to the music
And we lose it to the beat
And get stupid, come on lose it
Cos it all means nothing to me

So give me head
Give me head
Give me head music instead
You know, oh, is it all in the mind?
Give me head
Give me head
Give me head music instead
You know, oh, yes it's all in the mind
Kids get high
Cities die
We just smile cos it's all inside
You know, oh yes it's all in the mind

So come on lose it to the music
And lose it to the beat
And get stupid, come on lose it
Cos this all means nothing to me

Come on come on and
Give me head
Give me head
Give me head music instead
You know, of cos it's all in the mind
Come on come on and
Give me head
Give me head
Give me head music instead
You know, of cos it's all in the mind
It's all in the mindEmbed
