Elephant Man Lyrics
I love that deafening, thundering sound
That sounds like buildings tumbling down
And people wish that they weren't around
When we all rock and roll into town

We hear those fearful, piercing screams
The kind you find on cinema screens
And if they're fit to burst at the seams
If they could say what all of this means

I am, I am the elephant man
It is incredible how I can
Look just like an elephant, man
Just like, just like my elephant fans

We love that satisfying, rattling crash
The sound of registers full of cash
We'll be all over your town like a rash
We'll steal your children and smoke all your hash

I am, I am the elephant man
It is incredible how I can
Look just like an elephant, man
Just like, just like my elephant fans
I love that deafening, thundering sound
The sounds like buildings tumbling down
And people wish that they weren't around
When we all rock and roll into town

I am, I am the elephant man
It is incredible how I can
Look just like an elephant, man
Just like, just like my elephant fans

We are, we are the elephant men
Take heed, we'll be stampeding again
Look out all of you fair-weather friends
Because elephants never forgetEmbed
