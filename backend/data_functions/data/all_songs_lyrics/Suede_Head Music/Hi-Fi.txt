Slipping through the city sliding train to train
Sulking on the subway music in our brain
She and me together in the city sounds
Me and Mona Lisa on the underground

Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeah
Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeah

Slipping through the city sliding brain to brain
Sulking on the subway listening to the train
She and me together speed through space and time
Graffiti in our eyes and music in our mind

Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeah
Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeah
Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeah
Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeah
Hi-fi
Hi-fi
Hi-fi
In the white city, yeah yeahEmbed
