The Naming of Things LyricsYou remind me of you
The way you shot right through and how
You broke my window glass
Fast, it happened so fast
I have to confess that I
That I was impressed, that I
That I was impressed, that I
Despite all the mess and the broken glass
I was impressed
Here's where I disappeared
Where I fell off the pier
And to, and to be rescued I did wait
I watched water bugs skate
As they draw figure eights, as they draw
From the bottom of the lake, as they draw
I watched water bugs skate, as they draw
From the bottom of the lake, I watched the water bugs skate
Memories like mohair sweaters
Stretched and pilled, faux-distressed letters
Moose's horns and figure eights
White plastic bags in search of mates
What suffocates the land
In memory of garbage can
In memory of garbage can
But you, you can't be found when the bell rings
You weren't there that day for the naming of things
The naming of things
The naming of things
When your homeroom bell rings
And then your homeroom bell
One two three four
Hey, just look at the mess you made today
You really didn't think it would get this bad
Hey, you feel like you're living in a Russian play
Where it seems like you've made everybody mad
'Cause you remind me of you
When you shot through
And broke my window glass
It happened so fast
I have to confess
I was impressed
Yeah, I was impressed
Despite all the mess and the broken glass
I was impressed
You, you can't be found when the bell rings
You weren't there that day for the naming of things
Naming of things
Naming of things
When your homeroom bell rings
And then your homeroom bell rings
It's the naming of things
The naming ofEmbed
