MX Missiles LyricsThose that will judge
Will say you're aloof
But you know the truth is a seed
You know what you need
Is a conflagration
Cause when I see your blood
And the bits of your broken tooth
It gives me the proof that I need
It's the proof that you bleed
And it's a revelation
Yeah, it's a revelation
It's a revelation
I thought you were a life-sized paper doll
Propped up in the hardware store
Propped up on the front lawn watching the parade
Of those legionnaires with 2x4s
As they're marching off to war
Yeah, they're marching off to war
I didn't know what you were made of
Color of your blood, what you're afraid of
Are you made of calcium or are you carbon based?
And if you're made of calcium, I'll have to take a taste
'Cause listen, calcium is deadly, but tender to the tooth
And it's one surefire way to know if you're MX missile-proof
Oh no, or if you're just aloof
You were in the ground in late November
When the leaves and earth were damp
Did you think they would remember
How you almost made state champ?
'Cause when you're running for the game against Alphonsus
And you fell upon the ground and chipped your tooth
Listen, that might really have surprised us
To learn that you weren't really MX missile-proof
Oh, I thought you were a life-sized paper doll
Propped up in the hardware store
You were propped up on the front lawn watching the parade
Of those legionnaires with 2x4s
As they're marching off to war
Yeah, they're marching off to war
Oh, they're marching...Embed
