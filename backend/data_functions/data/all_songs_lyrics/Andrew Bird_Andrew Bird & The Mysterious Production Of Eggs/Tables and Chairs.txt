Tables and Chairs LyricsIf we can call them friends then we can call them on their telephones
And they won't pretend that they're too busy or that they're not alone
And if we can call them friends then we can call
Holler at them down these hallowed halls
Just don't let the human factor fail to be a factor
At all
Don't, don't you worry, about the atmosphere
Or any sudden pressure change
Cause I know
That it's starting to get warm in here;
And things are starting to get strange
And did you, did you see how all of our friends were there
And they're drinking roses from the can?
And how, how I wish I, I had talked to them
And I wish they fit into the plan
And we were tired of being mild
We were so tired of being mild
And we were tired...
I know we're going to meet some day
In the crumbled financial institutions of this land
There will be tables and chairs
There'll be pony rides and dancing bears
There'll even be a band
Cause listen, after the fall there will be no more countries;
No currencies at all
We're gonna live on our wits
We're gonna throw away survival kits
Trade butterfly-knives for Adderall
And that's not all!
Ooh-ooh, there will be snacks there will
There will be snacks, there will be snacks
And we were tired of being mild
We were so tired of being mild
And we were (we were so) tired...
So don't you
Don't you worry
About the atmosphere1Embed
