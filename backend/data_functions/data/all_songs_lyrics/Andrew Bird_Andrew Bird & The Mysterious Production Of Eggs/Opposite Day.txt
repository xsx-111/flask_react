Opposite Day Lyrics
I got home this morning with the sun right in my eyes
And there was no warning as it took me by surprise as it
Hit me like an act of God, causing my alarm
That I had not become a cephalopod
I still had legs and arms
Yes I still had legs and arms

Today was supposed to be the day
Molecules decide to change their form
Laws of physics lose their sway
Youthful indiscretion now is suddenly the norm
With the good kids sprouting horns, yeah yeah

And today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Was supposed to be, today was supposed to be
Opposite day

Those that can't quite function in society at large
They're going to wake up on this morning and find that they're in charge
But those the world's set up for, who are really doing quite well
They're going to wake up in institutions
In prison or in hell
Prison or in hell
Today was supposed to be the day
Molecules decide to change their form
Laws of physics lose their sway
Youthful indiscretion now is suddenly the norm
With the good kids sprouting horns, yeah yeah

And today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
Today was supposed to be
Not just another day
It was supposed to be, today was supposed to be
Opposite day

But if you think there's something else
Well, you're right, there is
There's something else
But if you think I'm gonna tell you, think again
Why should I even think of telling you what there is?
Yeah, cause silence is knowledge
And knowledge is power
I'm under explicit orders to dare not speak its name
Listen up, I just work here
Oh, I dare not speak its name
I can't keep talking about it
Oh, I dare not speak its nameEmbed
