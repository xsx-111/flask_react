Banking on a Myth LyricsThere's one guy I'd like to thank
He signs the checks and leaves them blank, he's the one
He says you don't have to walk a plank
The game is rigged, go fig your slide show
Tanked and your flagship sank
So we're taking all our myths to the bank
So just don't, don't forget who to thank
Cause we're taking our, our myths to the
We're drinking a fifth to the
We're taking all our myths to the bank, oh no
If you could just do him this favor
Although it might involve child labor
Join his entourage, give him a foot massage
From Star Search to the Philharmonic
He'll get you there with Hooked on Phonics
He's the one to know, doesn't matter if you blow, no, no, no, no
In fact it's just the thing he thinks we're needing
It's a lukewarm liquid diet, they're force feeding
When the words we use have lost their bite
Now they hit you like an imaginary pillow fight
But it's all right, yeah, cause you're inside and you're in tight
Deals in commodities of the abstract sort
Buys them in bulk but then he sells it short
Talent, genius, love, even signs of affection
He floods the market, there's no price protection
And when his master plan is unfurled
There stands a handsome bid
On the weather systems of the worldEmbed
