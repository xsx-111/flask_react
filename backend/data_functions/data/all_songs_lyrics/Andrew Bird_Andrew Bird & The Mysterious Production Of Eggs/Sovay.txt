Sovay LyricsI was getting ready to be a threat
I was getting set for my accidental suicide
The kind where no one dies
No one looks too surprised
Then you realize riding on the para-success
Of a heavy-handed metaphor
And feeling like you've been here before
Because you've been here before
And you've been here before
Then a word washed ashore
A word washed ashore
Then a word washed ashore

Sovay, Sovay, Sovay
All along the day
I was getting ready to consider my next plan of attack
I think I'm gonna sack the whole board of trustees
All those Don Quixotes and their B-17s
And I swear this time
Yeah this time
They'll blow us back to the 70's
And this time
They're playing Ride of the Valkyries
With no semblance of grace or ease
And they're acting on vagaries
With their violent proclivities
And they're playing Ride of the Valkyries
Sovay, Sovay, Sovay
All along the day2Embed
