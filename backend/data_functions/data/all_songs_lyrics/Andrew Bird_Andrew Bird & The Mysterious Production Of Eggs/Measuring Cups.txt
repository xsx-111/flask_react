Measuring Cups LyricsGet out your measuring cups
And we'll play a new game
Come to the front of the class
And we'll measure your brain
We'll give you a complex
And we'll give it a name
Get out your measuring cups
And we'll play a new game
Can't have the cream when the crop
And the cream are the same
Liquid or gas
No more than the glass
Will contain
When you talk about the Hand of Glory
A tale that's rather grim and gory
Is it just another children's story
That's been de-clawed?
When the tales of brothers Grimm and Gorey
Have been outlawed
I think they're gonna make you start over
You don't want to start over
Put your backpack on your shoulder
Be the good little soldier
Take your places now
Cause we're all predisposed
Measuring cups, play a new game
Front of the class, measure your brain
Give you a complex and we'll give it a name, no no
When you talk about the Hand of Glory
A tale that's rather grim and gory
Is it just another children's story
That's been de-clawed?
When the tales of brothers Grimm and Gorey
Have been outlawed
Put your backpack on your shoulder
Be the good little soldier
It's no different when you're older
You're predisposed
That's all for questions
Now the case is closed1Embed
