Fake Palindromes Lyrics
My dewy-eyed, Disney bride what has tried
Swapping your blood with formaldehyde?
Monsters, whiskey-plied voices cried fratricide
Jesus, don't you know that you could have died?
You should have died with the monsters that talk
Monsters that walk the earth

And she's got red lipstick, and a bright pair of shoes
And she's got knee-high socks, what to cover a bruise
She's got an old death kit, she's been meaning to use
She's got blood in her eyes, in her eyes for you
She's got blood in her eyes for you

Certain fads, stripes and plaids, some singles ads
They run you hot and cold like a rheostat I mean a thermostat
So you bite on a towel, hope it won't hurt too bad
My dewy eyed, Disney bride what has tried
Swapping your blood with formaldehyde?
With the monsters what talk, monsters what walk the earth

She says, I like long walks and sci-fi movies
If you're six-foot tall and East coast bred
Some lonely night we can get together
And I'm gonna tie your wrists with leather
And drill a tiny hole into your head
And I'm gonna drill a tiny hole into your head4Embed
