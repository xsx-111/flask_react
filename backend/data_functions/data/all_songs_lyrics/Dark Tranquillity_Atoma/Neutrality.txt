Neutrality Lyrics
Much like the tension built between force and will
Stray voltage wanders from neutral to earth
Lest we forget to forgive the signals get crossed
These two grounded objects on the opposite side of
Right or wrong where empathy was once
Is not the end - this is the reasoning

I call you out so take it once and for all
The weight of the world on you
I call you out to claim neutrality

We failed our own reality on reality's terms
The less we know the more we forge
What suits our single-minded goals
It all comes down to this, a reverse polarity
In opposites we see what unity must be
Forever taking down the man-made walls of strife
Forever taking them down

I call you out so take it once and for all
The weight of the world on you
I call you out to be accountable today, tomorrow
I call you out
There's nothing like the friction sound
The slow burn of prolonged frustation
Wearing down the jagged edges to fit within the margins
The fires spread throughout the night
It must now go down to where it can begin
Inside and out I call you

I call you out so take it once and for all
The weight of the world on you
I call you out to claim neutrality
I call you out to be accountable today tomorrowEmbed
