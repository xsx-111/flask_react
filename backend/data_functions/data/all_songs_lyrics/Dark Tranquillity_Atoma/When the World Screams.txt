When the World Screams Lyrics
Let the weakness set in this world I know
Days cannot hold me, I blur in between
Never fully engaged, the mind races between words
As far as I can get, away from it all

When indecision ends can life begin again

I am silence when the world screams out
I am escape when you reach out to me
I am panic
I am fear behind these walls that protect me
I am failure and resistance
I am lost where I belong
I am silence when the world screams

My insecurity extends to others talking about themselves
Fed with this poison of self righteous false confidence
It's in their eyes, it's in our lives
Set to the tune of darkness, this is one to hold
I cannot stop insanity from chasing down my thoughts
Linger in the mind for what now seems indefinite time
My mind is holding me down
When indecision ends can life begin again

I am silence when the world screams out
I am escape when you reach out to me
I am panic
I am fear behind these walls that protect me
I am failure and resistance
I am lost where I belong
I am silence when the world screamsEmbed
