Faithless by Default Lyrics
To ends unknown by means unworthy
To answer wishes, long dead and gone
Old empty promises, a just reward for the blind
Belief makes work for idle minds, we lost our way
We lost our way

The only dream that matters
Is the one you wake up from

Go onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default

I call for a world where we are nothing more
Than the sum of what we know
Are we to be held hostage by our tolerance for the intolerant
Then we've lost our way
We've lost our way
To hope is to surrender
In this series of defeats

Go onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default

A pain far too familiar
Denounce your savage self

Go onward to the singularity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
Turn on this unentity
Whatever they say, whatever they do just go
We are faithless by default
We are faithless by default
Faithless by default1Embed
