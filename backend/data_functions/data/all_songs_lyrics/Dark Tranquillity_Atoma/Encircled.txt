Encircled Lyrics
I see myself in the bodies being carried out
I see myself in you when safety falls again
It broke something essential like nothing ever would
A promise to give, a promise to hold

This is not what I want you to hear right now
But our time is running out
So far removed from what you need to know
Words too hard to handle, our time is running out
We're by demons encircled

Eroding away at reason
The bile of insecurity
This fear devoid of nuance and fact resistant belief
I hold together what I can
I hold together what I know

This is not what I want you to hear right now
But our time is running out
So far removed from what you need to know
Words too hard to handle, our time is running out
We're by demons encircled
These are just symptoms of experience and life
I wish I could postpone

It eats at our logic like nothing ever should
It claws at our humanity so that nothing can remain
This is the currency of faith and we are coming up short
The reality of failure now upon us

This is not what I want you to hear right now
But our time is running out
So far removed from what you need to know
Words too hard to handle, our time is running out
We're by demons encircledEmbed
