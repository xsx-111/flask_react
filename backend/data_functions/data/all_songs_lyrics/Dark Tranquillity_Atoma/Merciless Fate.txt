Merciless Fate Lyrics
What if this image was taken
In an instant erased from the world
What if the truth is too far
And you reality can't cope with the distance
In the abstract a mind never challenged
Is the bearer of merciless fate

All you can feel is the loss of who you are
By force or by fire, by force or by flame
All you will know is the void of emptiness
By force or the flame 'til reason prevails

When the doubt starts to creep in your mind
And subverts the true cause of your ways
You must remain a witness of merciless fate

All you can feel is the loss of who you are
By force or by fire, by force or by flame
All you will know is the void of emptiness
By force or the flame

All that you see is a darkness
From the outside looking in(2x)
All you can sense is surface tension
From a distance grasping at straws (2x)
All you can feel is the loss of who you are
It's not about you, it's not about you
All you will know is the void of emptiness
By force of the flame, this merciless fateEmbed
