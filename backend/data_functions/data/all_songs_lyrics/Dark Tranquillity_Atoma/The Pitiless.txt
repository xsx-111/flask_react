The Pitiless Lyrics
Right now, right here we stand alone
Against pitiless indifference we stand alone

Forever confounded by the burning margins
To get without context when into denial
Give in to ignorance when the world responds in kind
Put an end to the search and nullify the sense of life

Alone in silence
I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference we stand alone

Against the ever coming night

So we step back to reveal a new perspective
When the allure of our gift is worn off
Not the least be curious when giants steps away
No going back, our time is running out

Alone in silence
I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference we stand alone
Must we resort to the end of our inquiry
For this to make sense, this to make sense?
Right here, right now we stand alone

Give up or recount them, the days of your life
The truth was of essence when time was alive
There is no incentive to give in to the absurd
Reality and comfort live forever to oppose
Forever opposed

Alone in silence
I am frightened and so are you
Against pitiless indifference we stand aloneEmbed
