Seperate Lives LyricsReleased as phil collins & marilyn martin single, 1985
You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room
Do i feel lonely too?
You have no right to ask me how i feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
We can't go on just holding on to time
Now that we're living separate lives
Well i held on to let you go
And if you lost your love for me, well you never let it show
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living (living)
Separate lives
Ooh, it's so typical, love leads to isolation
So you build that wall (build that wall)
Yes, you build that wall (build that wall)
And you make it stronger
Well you have no right to ask me how i feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Some day i might (i might) find myself looking in your eyes
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
Separate livesEmbed
