Two Worlds LyricsPut your faith in what you most believe in
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart, let fate decide
To guide these lives we see
A paradise untouched by man
Within this world blessed with love
A simple
Life, they live in peace
Softly tread the sand below your feet now
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart, let fate decide
To guide these
Lives we see
Beneath the shelter of the trees
Only love can enter here
A simple life, they live in peace
Raise your head up, lift high the load
Take strength from those that need you
Build high the walls, build strong the beams
A new life is waiting but danger's no stranger here
No words describe a mother's tears
No words can heal a broken heart
A dream is gone but where there's hope
Somewhere, something is calling for you
Two worlds, one family
Trust your heart, let fate decide
To guide these lives we see3Embed
