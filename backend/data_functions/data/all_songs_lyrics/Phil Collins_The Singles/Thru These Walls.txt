Thru These Walls Lyrics
I can hear thru' these walls
I can hear it when they're fooling around
I can hear thru' these walls
And I hear every sign, every sound
I can hear thru' these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down

Every word that they say
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way

My favorite moment
Putting the glass up next to the wall
Imagination
Tho' I see nothing, I hear it all
Putting my sign up
Do not disturb me, speak or shout, inside out
Oh mind my clothes, they're all laid out

I can see thru' my windows
I can see the girls and the boys
I can see thru' my windows
And I can imagine the noise
I can see thru' my windows
I can see them playing with toys
Oh I hope it won't end
If I promise not to touch, just be a friend

Life is so lonely
I don't get high off just being me
I like pretending
Wanting to touch them, wanting to see
It's only normal
Creeping behind you, now don't shout, Because it's alright
They keep the windows locked and the door shut tight
Oo I'm feeling like I'm locked in a cage
No way in, no way out, and it gets so lonely
Am I really asking a lot
Just to reach out and touch somebody
Because when I look thru' my windows or open my door
I can feel it all around me

I can hear thru' these walls
I can hear it when they're fooling around
I can hear thru' these walls
And I hear every sign, every sound
I can hear thru' these walls
In the dark with the shades pulled down
Every word that they say
Every noise they make feels it's coming my way
Ah yeah
Ah yeah
Ah yeah
Ah yeah2Embed
