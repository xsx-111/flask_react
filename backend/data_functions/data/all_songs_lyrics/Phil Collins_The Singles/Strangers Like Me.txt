Strangers Like Me Lyrics
Whatever you do, I'll do it too
Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me
I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
Oh, i just know there's something bigger out there

I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her
Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon
I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

I want to know, can you show me
I want to know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me
