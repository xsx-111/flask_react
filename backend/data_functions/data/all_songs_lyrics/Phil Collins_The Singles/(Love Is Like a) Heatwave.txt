(Love Is Like a) Heatwave Lyrics
Whenever I'm with her
Something inside
Starts to burning
And I'm filled with desire
Could it be the devil in me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

Just like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart

Whenever she calls my name
So slow, sweet and plain
I feel, I feel, feel that burning flame
Has my blood pressure got a hold on me
Or is this the way love's supposed to be

Just like a heatwave
Burning in my heart
Can't keep from crying
It's tearing me apart
(heatwave)
(heatwave)

Sometimes I stare in space
Tears all over my face
I can't explain it, don't understand it
I ain't never felt like this before
Well, that funny feeling has me amazed
I don't know what to do, my head's in a haze
Just like a heatwave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, he's in love girl (ooooh)
Yeah, he's in love girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Ooh, go ahead, girl
Ooh, you know he's in love, girl
Don't pass up this chance
It could be true romance

Heatwave
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(wahooo, wahooo)
Oooh, heatwave
Yeah, yeah
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo) Yeah, yeah
(Burnin' burnin' burnin') 
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo) Heatwave, yeah, heatwave
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo)
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')
Heatwave, yeah, heatwave
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo)
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')
(wahooo, wahooo, wahooo)
(Burnin' burnin' burnin')Embed
