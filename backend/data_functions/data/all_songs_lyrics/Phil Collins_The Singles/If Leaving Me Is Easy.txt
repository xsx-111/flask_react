If Leaving Me Is Easy Lyrics
I read all the letters
I read each word that you've sent to me
And though it's past now
And the words start to fade
All the memories I have still remain

I've kept all the pictures
But I hide my feelings so no-one knows
Oh sure my friends all come round
But I'm in a crowd on my own
It's 'cos you're gone now
But your heart
Heart still remains
And it'll be here if you come again

You see I'd heard the rumours
I knew before you let me know
But I didn't believe it, not you
No you would not let me go
Seems I was wrong, but I love
I love you the same
And that's the one thing that you can't take away
Just remember...
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder
If leaving me is easy
And you know coming back is harder1Embed
