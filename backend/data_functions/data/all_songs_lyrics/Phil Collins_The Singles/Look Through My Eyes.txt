Look Through My Eyes Lyrics
There are things in life you learn
And, oh, in time you'll see
It's out there somewhere
It's all waiting
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there
Watching over you

Just take a look through my eyes
There's a better place somewhere out there
Ooo, just take a look through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

There will be times on this journey
All you'll see is darkness
But out there somewhere
Daylight finds you
If you keep believing
So don't run
Don't hide
It will be alright
You'll see
Trust me
I'll be there
Watching over you
Just take a look through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
Theres better place somewhere out there
Ooo, just take a look through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(There's a better place)
If you look through my eyes

All the things that you can change
There's a meaning in everything
And you will find all you need
There's so much to understand

Take a look (take a look) through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look (take a look) through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(You'll be amazed if you just take a look)
Just take a look through my eyes
(Look through my eyes)
There's a better place somewhere out there
Just take a look (take a look) through my eyes
Everything changes
You'll be amazed what you'll find
(You'll find a better place)
If you look through my eyes
(You know there's a better place)
Just take a look through my eyes
(You know there's a better place)
If you look through my eyes
Take a look through my eyes3Embed
