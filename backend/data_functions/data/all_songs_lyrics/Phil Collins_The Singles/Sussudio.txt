Sussudio Lyrics
There's a girl that's been on my mind
All the time, Sus-Sussudio, oh, oh
Now, she don't even know my name
But I think she likes me just the same, Sus-Sussudio, oh, oh

Ah, if she called me I'd be there
I'd come running anywhere, she's all I need, all my life
I feel so good if I just say the word, Sus-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh, Sus-Sussudio

Now I know that I'm too young
My life has just begun, Sus-Sussudio, oh, oh
Ooh, give me a chance, give me a sign
I'll show her anytime, Sus-Sus-Sussudio, oh, oh

Ah, I've just got to have her, have her now
I've got to get closer but I don't know how
She makes me nervous and makes me scared
I feel so good if I just say the word, Sus-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh, S-Sus-Sussudio, oh

Ah, she's all I need, all of my life
I feel so good if I just say the word, Sus-Sussudio
I just say the word, oh, S-Sus-Sussudio
I just say the word, oh, Sus-Sussudio
I'll say the word, oh, S-Sus-Sussudio, oh, oh, oh

Just say the word
Ooh, just-just-just say the word, ooh
Just say the word
S-Sus-Sussudio, Sus-Sussudio
Sus-Sus-Sussudio, Sus-Sussudio
Sussudio, Sus-Sussudio
Just say the word, Sus-Sussudio
Just say the word, oh
Just say the word
Ooh, just-just-just say the word10Embed
