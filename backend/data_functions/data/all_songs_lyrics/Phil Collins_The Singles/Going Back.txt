Going Back Lyrics
I think I'm going back
To the thing I learned so well in my youth
I think I'm returning to
All those days when I was young enough to know the truth
Now there are no games to only pass the time
No more electric trains no more trees to climb
Thinking young and growing older is no sin
And I can play the game of life to win
I can recall the time when
I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend
And now I think I've got a lot more than
Just my toys to lend
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide
And everyday can be my magic paradise
I can play hide and seek with my fears
And live my days instead of counting my years
Let everyone debate the true reality
I'd rather see my world the way it used to be
A little bit of courage is all we lack
So catch me if you can cause I'm going back

I'm going back
Not just sitting, walking away
Yes, I'm going back
Going back to my youth
Come on, catch me because I'm going back
I'm going backEmbed
