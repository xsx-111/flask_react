Hands Off the Man (Flim Flam Man) LyricsHands off the man, the flim flam man
His mind is up his sleeve and his talk is make believe
Oh lord, the man's a fraud, he's flim flam man. He's so cagey, he's a flim flam man
Hands off the man, flim flam man
He's the one in the Trojan horse making out like he's Santa Claus
Oh lord, the man's a fraud, he's a flim flam man. He's a fox, he's a flim flam man
Everybody wants him, the people and the police and all the pretty ladies disarm
Oh yeah, the beautiful gent, you know he has hardly a cent
He pays his monthly rent with daily charm
Hands off the man, the flim flam man
His mind is up his sleeve and his talk is make believe
Oh lord, the man's a fraud, he's flim flam man. He's so cagey, he's an artist
He's a fox, he's a flim flam man
Don't believe him, he's a flim flam
Ole road runner, he's a flim flamEmbed
