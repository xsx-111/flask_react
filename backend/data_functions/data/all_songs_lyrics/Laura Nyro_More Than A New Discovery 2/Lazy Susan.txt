Lazy Susan LyricsLazy flower, my, you've grown so tall. I have lost and loved him, you have seen it all
Lazy Susan, lazy through, hasn't got a thing to do
Oh, but to sit there and light up the hillside, sun-fried, black-eyed Sue
Lazy Susan, lazy through, all the hills in love with you
Courted and cradled by Heaven and hillside, sun-fried
Black-eyed Sue, black-eyed Sue, black-eyed
Black-eyed Sue, how happy you must be. Once, I too had someone loving me
Johnny, Johnny, warm and true, that's how I remember you
This morning, just as I found you: up there on the hillside
With sun-fried, black-eyed lazy Susan, SusanEmbed
