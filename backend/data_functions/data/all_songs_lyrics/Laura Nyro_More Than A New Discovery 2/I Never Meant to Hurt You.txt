I Never Meant to Hurt You LyricsI never meant to hurt you, I'm not that way at all
Please believe the words of a heart, a heart that seems so small
And I never meant to hurt you, I guess I lost my place
Please believe the words of a heart, a heart that hides its face
Why do I do things I never mean to do?
Why did I speak so carelessly when all that I felt was love for you?
And I swear, I never meant to hurt you. I've got to make you know
Please believe the words of a heart, a heart that didn't show
I never meant to hurt you, I only meant to love you it's true
And when I saw you crying, I cried tooEmbed
