The Great Estates Lyrics
We beg rebirth to take us up
Parade our souls out by the back gate
Some claw the ground and some cut the air
And some warm the seas, but what will you be, and when?

And I swim through dirt to find you out
And a whale without his family history is
And I used to shout to find my way
Let the water guide my distant memory failed

Give into the reigns of a great estate
Better lights pull you out of the ground
Seep into the wood of the great estates
Animals your soul will guide

Give into the reigns of the great estates
Better lights pull you out of the ground
Seep into the wood of the great estates
Animals your soul will guide
Give into the reigns of the great estates
Better lights pull you out of the ground
Seep into the wood of the great estates
Animals your soul will guide
Give into the reigns of the great estates
Better lights pull you out of the ground
Seep into the wood of the great estates
Animals your soul will guide
Give into the reigns of the great estates
Better lights pull you out of the ground
Seep into the wood of the great estates
Animals your soul will guideEmbed
