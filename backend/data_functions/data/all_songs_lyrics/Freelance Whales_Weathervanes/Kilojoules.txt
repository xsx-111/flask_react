Kilojoules Lyrics
Well I've been making
Some cold calculations
Regarding our body heat
It's not easy
Believe me

You liken me to a vampire
My left hand was wearing
Fake plastic teeth all winter
And taking you for all you were worth

Well I'm afraid I'm not qualified to do
Any of these things for you
Well I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back
Any of those kilojoules
Late nights and weekends our hearts only walk
Slowly on the local track
So I've arranged for your phobias to be
Performed by a string quartet

Shoot me one of those
Glances I need to interpret
I've been feeling
Well-rested and healthy
Well I'm afraid I'm not qualified to do
Any of these things for you
And I'm afraid I'm not gonna give you back
Any of those kilojoules
Late nights and weekends our hearts only go
So slowly on the local track
So I've arranged for your phobias to be
Performed by a string quartetEmbed
