Hannah Lyrics
Do me this solid, if you would pretty lady, please
Grab your martini and meet me on the balcony
I've prepared a light show, you could fake a melody
We could argue over where and when the cymbal hits should be

Hannah takes the stairs and I usually take the elevator
Every now and then she offers me a lemon Now and Later
Please don't play the matchmaker, please don't be a player hater
If you dig her recent work then you should go congratulate her

And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops

Hannah takes the stairs cause she can tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up, or upside-down?

So Hannah let your roots grow, let your blue veins show
If I need to take a breath then you can take a trumpet solo
I'll work on the limbs if you work on the torso and
If it gets to be too much then you can lend a helping hand
And if you're partial to the night sky
If you're vaguely attracted to rooftops

Hannah takes the stairs cause she can tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she right side up, or upside-down?

Hannah takes the stairs cause she can tell
That it's a winding spiral case
Is she outside-in or inside out?2Embed
