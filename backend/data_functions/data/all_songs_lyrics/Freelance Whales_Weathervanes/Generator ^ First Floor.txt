Generator ^ First Floor Lyrics

We get up early just to start cranking the generator
Our limbs have been asleep, we need to get the blood back in 'em
We're finding every day, several ways that we can be friends

We keep on churning and the lights inside the house turn on
And in our native language we are chanting ancient songs
And when we quiet down, the house chants on without us
