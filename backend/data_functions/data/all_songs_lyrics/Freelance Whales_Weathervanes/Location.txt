Location Lyrics
I am starting to sense your location
You are somewhere in the attic
Looking something close to tragic
Knitting T-shirts into madras
I'm floating up the stairwell
With my toes grazing the cedar
Thinking softly what a tinder box we live in
And what a flammable heart I've been given

You could be in several different places
I am sensing your location

I am starting to sense your location
You are somewhere in the basement
Beating on a makeshift drum kit
Songs that I can hardly stomach
And I'm floating up the stairwell
With my fingers shaking frantic
Thinking softly what a concrete mess we live in
And what an icebox heart I've been given

You could be in several different places
I am sensing your location
You could be in several different
I am starting to sense your locale now


I am starting to sense your location
In an old abandoned mansion
In the country side of England
Spirits trapped inside the linens
And you're feeling quite at home there
Also feeling somewhat lonely
No one sees you in your pixelated fishnets
And your black and orange berets

You could be in several different places
I am sensing your location
You could be in several different
I am starting to sense your locale now

Oh, please believe the ghost in me
Is doing what I can to find you out1Embed
