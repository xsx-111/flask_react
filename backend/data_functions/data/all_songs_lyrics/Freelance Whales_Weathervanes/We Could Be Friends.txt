We Could Be Friends Lyrics
I am convinced that we could be friends
We have several interests in common
In common
And I am convinced that we have been friends
Were you a Tahitian grain of sand
In a past life?

Please don't put your face into your hands
We could be friends
Please don't put your face into your hands
We could be friends

I am convinced that we should be friends
We compare our hearts to things that fly
But cannot land

Please don't put your face into your hands
We could be friends
Please don't put your face into your hands
We could be friends

Please don't put your face into your hands
We could be friends
Please don't put your flesh into the ways
We could be friends
Please don't put your face into your hands
We could be friends
I can count the ways on my two hands
We could be friendsEmbed
