Starring Lyrics
Shut me up with your long tube socks
They don't scream, "Hey, let's just be friends"
Look at both my inkwells brimming
I was much less understanding then

How many stars you think you possess?
How many in your butterfly net?
They'll be etched onto your forehead
You were so misunderstood back then

But I think I get you now
I think I get you now

This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare


Don't let the bathwater get too high
You will be a flood of porcelain
Lions clawed on inside
It's digging hard into your tiles

And we're gonna flood this house
We're gonna flood this house

This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In the stranger's nightmare
This is me starring
In a stranger's nightmareEmbed
