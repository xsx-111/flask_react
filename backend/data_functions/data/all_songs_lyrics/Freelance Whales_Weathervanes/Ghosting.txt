Ghosting Lyrics
Do you ever play with kids in the basement
Soot upon your face so you were a hot mess
All your little molars cracked in the pressure
Come here little sister, let's get you to bed

But oh you caught me sleeping in the power sockets
You caught me mildew in the tiles of the bathroom
And oh you shot a glance like I was doing okay
Oh I am never on my way

Do you ever run with him in the morning
And think about jumping over the back fence
Seven different places need a bit of mending
All we use are eyes to fill in most the gaps

But oh you caught me sleeping in the power sockets
You caught me mildew in the tiles of the bathroom
And oh you shot a glance like I was doing okay
Oh I am never on my way

The reason my molars are so broken
Is I spend too much time ghosting
With the likes of you and yours
The reason my insides are so swollen
Is I spend too much time ghosting
With the likes of you and yours
The reason my molars are so broken
Is I spend too much time ghosting
(All we use are eyes to...)
With the likes of you and yours
(All we use are eyes to...)
The reason my insides are so swollen
Is I spend too much time ghosting
(All we use are eyes to...)
With the likes of you and yours
(All we use are eyes to...)1Embed
