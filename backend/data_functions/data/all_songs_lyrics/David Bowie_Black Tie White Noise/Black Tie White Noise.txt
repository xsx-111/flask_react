Black Tie White Noise Lyrics
(Yo yo yo yo yo)
(Yo yo yo yo yo)
(Yo yo yo yo yo)

Getting my facts from a Benetton ad
Looking through African eyes
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire (Black tie, white noise)
I've got a face, not just my race, bang bang
I've got you, babe

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Sun comes up and the man goes down
Woman comes again
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear (Black tie, white noise)
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisible now
Just disappear

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Then die in the flames singing "We Shall Overcome"
What's going on?
There'll be some blood, no doubt about it
But we'll come through, don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I look into your eyes and I wonder sometimes

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Oh Lord, just let him see me
Lord, Lordy, let him hear me
Let him call me brother
Let him put his arms around me
Let him put his hands together

Reach out over race and hold each other's hands
Walk through the night thinking "We Are the World"
What's going on?
There will be some blood, no doubt about it
We shall come through, don't doubt it
I look into your eyes and I know I won't kill you
And I turn my back for I know you won't kill me
You won't kill me
You won't kill me, no
But I wonder why
Yes, I wonder why sometimes
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

They'll show us how to break the rules
But never how to make the rules
Reduce us down to witless punks
(Black tie, white noise)
Fascist cries, both black and white
Who's got the blood? Who's got the gun?

Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noise

Cranking out
Cranking out
Cranking out white noise
Cranking out
Cranking out
Putting on the black tie
Cranking out the white noiseEmbed
