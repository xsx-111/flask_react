The Wedding Song Lyrics
These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Dreaming alone and I feel that someone
Listens to me
Angel for life

These are silver wings
These are golden eyes
These are floating clouds
Angel for life

Heaven is smiling down, heaven's girl in a wedding gown
I'm going to be so good, just like a good boy should
I'm going to change my ways
Angel for life
Of all the saints alive
Don't I feel like a saint alive
She's not mine for eternity
Though I'll never fly so high
I'm smiling
I believe in magic
Angel for life1Embed
