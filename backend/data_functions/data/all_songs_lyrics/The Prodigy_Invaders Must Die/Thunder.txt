Thunder LyricsI hear thunder but there's no rain
This kind of thunder breaks walls and window pane
I hear thunder but there's no rain
This kind of thunder, t-t-thunder

I hear thunder but there's no rain
This kind of thunder breaks walls and window pane
I hear thunder but there's no rain
This kind of thunder, t-t-thunder
I hear thunder
But there's no rain
This type of thunder
Breaks walls and window pane
I hear thunder
But there's no rain
This type of thunder
Breaks walls and window pane

This type of thunder
Breaks walls and window pane
I hear thunder
But there's no rain
This type of thunder
Breaks walls and window pane
I hear thunder but there's no rain
This kind of thunder breaks walls and window pane
I hear thunder but there's no rain
This kind of thunder, t-t-thunder

But there's no rain
This type of thunder
Breaks walls and window pane

But there's no rain
This type of thunder
Breaks walls and window pane
