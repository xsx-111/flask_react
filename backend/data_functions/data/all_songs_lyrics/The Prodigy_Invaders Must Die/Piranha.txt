Piranha Lyrics
Piranha, p-p-piranha
Piranha, p-p-piranha

Teeth grip, razor sharp
Vice-like power, tear you apart
Teeth grip, razor sharp
Vice-like power, tear you apart
(x2)


(x2)
You better not lose control
They pull you under, it will take a hold
You better not lose control
They pull you under, it will take a hold
