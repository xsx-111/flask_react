Take Me to the Hospital Lyrics
Take me to the...
Take me to the...
Take me to the hospital

Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive

Along came a spider
He was creepy like Dracula
He spoke like he was a friend
So I bit with adrenaline
Hold it!
Welcome to the scene of the crash
Welcome to the scene of the crash

Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
Push up your hand if you love the fashion
I wanna hear it for the London Massive

Crash
Crash
Hold it!

Welcome to the scene of the crash
Welcome to the scene of the crash
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the...1Embed
