Run with the Wolves LyricsWhat you gonna do when the hounds are calling?
What you gonna do when the hounds are calling?
(x2)
You're a mug
That's why I had to cut you down
You run with the wolves
While I hunt like a hound
You're a mug
That's why I had to cut you down
You run with the wolves
Shout it out loud
You run-
You run with the wolves
You run with the wolves
