Temptation Is A Gun LyricsBy Gregg Allman, Cain, Schon
Copyright 1994 Sony Music Entertainment, Inc
Like the hopeful dreams of many
He had everything and more
A lovely wife and children
All the things worth fighting for
He knows, there was still
Still, something missing in his life
Though he promised to be faithful
He was good at telling lies
He had an eye for young girls
He would steal some on the side
Oh no, he just could not be satisfied
It's a game of all or nothing
There is nowhere safe to run
Someone might just pull the trigger
Cause temptation is a gun
He met her at a night club
On the other side of town
Somehow he could not resist her
She's the best he'd ever found
She knows, she found her ticket to the other side
It's a game of all or nothing
There is nowhere safe to run
Someone might just pull the trigger
Cause temptation is a gun
His foolish ways seem harmless
But his world was so divine
Cause at home they know his secrets
They've heard all his alibis
As he tries to face his feelings
He can't justify his crimes
Now comes the final ending
Of the dreams he once held sacred deep inside
He can kiss it all good-bye
It's a game of all or nothing
There is nowhere safe to run
Someone might just pull the trigger
Cause temptation is a gun
Oh, ummmm, ya baby
Ahhhh temptation is a gun
Temptation is a gun
All or nothing, all or nothingEmbed
