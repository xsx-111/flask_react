Found You Lyrics
I've seen your face in better days
How times have changed
The seasons come and go
Even so, it's strange
You're looking just the same
You've come around again
To claim and call in what I owe you
Take what you want, take anything
I can't believe
You've finally returned
I was so naive
To sign along the line
But now I've changed my mind
I broke the deal that we agreed on
The hammer falls to rows of laughter
The jury calls, you have no answer
Take one final last look around you
You'll never know just how I found you

I've heard my name spoken in vain so many times
You called, well here I am, what is yours is mine
There's nothing you won't sell
But I don't want the wealth you made
That's not what I returned for
Who lit the charge, played all the parts
Surely we knew
That I just fanned the flames, time to see this through
Who opened up the door
And let me in before
Look up, there's everything to play for

 x2
I've seen your face in better days
How times have changed
The seasons come and go, even so, it's strange
You're looking just the same
You've come around again
To claim, and call in what I owe youEmbed
