Beginning To Fade LyricsMantras are falling through ceilings, good morning
Words that are snatched away, unheard, I'm yawning
Colours confusing, their multitudes blurring
A feeling that something's not right
You've gotta let out the things that you've found
You've gotta let out the melody that runs aground
The sound that falls away like a thought from yesterday's haze
Hey, hey
You've gotta let out the things that you've found
You've gotta let out the melody that runs aground
The sound that falls away like a thought from yesterday's haze
Hey, hey, hey
Seems that they'll meet us there, greet us where
Hundreds of stories were told before open doors, closing doors
Corners of pages, are folded down, left around
Beginning to fade out of sight
You've gotta let out the things that you've found
You've gotta let out the melody that runs aground
The sound that falls away like a thought from yesterday's haze
Hey, hey
You've gotta let out the things that you've found
You've gotta let out the melody that runs aground
The sound that falls away like a thought from yesterday's haze
Hey, hey
You've gotta let out the things that you've found
You've gotta let out the melody that runs aground
The sound that falls away like a thought from yesterday's haze
Hey, hey
You've gotta let out the things that you've found
You've gotta let out the melody that runs aground
The sound that falls away like a thought from yesterday's haze
Hey, hey, heyEmbed
