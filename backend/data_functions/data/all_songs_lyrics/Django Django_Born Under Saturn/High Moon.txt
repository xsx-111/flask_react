High Moon LyricsWalk through the night we knew so well
Over horizons in the dark
Blinded, I wonder if you're there
Under the cover of your faint silhouette
You were hidden in the broad daylight
Overlooking like a satellite
Overshadowed by the blaze of the sun
Wondering:
"Have you ever seen this side of me?
Will you ever keep me company?
Will you ever see the shadow that falls over me?"
Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skylight
In pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this
Call out your name, there's no reply
Will we be greeted by your smile?
Turn 'round and leave before the dawn
Under horizons in the sun, promising
You were hidden in the broad daylight
Overlooking like a satellite
Overshadowed by the blaze of the sun
Wondering:
"Have you ever seen this side of me?
Will you ever keep me company?
Will you ever see the shadow that falls over me?"
Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skylight
In pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this
Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skylight
In pale winter moonshine we'll drink to this
Night falling away
To pale morning twilight
Through veils out of eyesight we'll wait for this
Light drifting away
Through cracks in the skylight
In pale winter moonshine we'll drink to thisEmbed
