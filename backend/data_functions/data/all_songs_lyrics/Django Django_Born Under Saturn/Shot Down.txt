Shot Down LyricsWalk out and don't look back
There's no love lost
Don't take me for a fool or
I'll keep the prize that we had split
The day I quit weighs on my mind heavily
Deceived, run short of luck, double crossed
Shot down, follow behind 'til I find you
Running ahead of me, let down
Tables have turned, and I see you
Staring right back at me
Walk, in silence you were gone
Now all is lost, you always said that I'd be the one
To cut you from the pack, I should have known
Seeing that dust where you've flown
My love has gone, it's way too late
You sleight of hand deceived me and sealed our fate
You've taken back the cards, lost one by one
And in the game we've begun, undone
Run short of luck, double crossed
Shot down, left on the ground but I see you
Staring right back at me, let down
Tables have turned, and I hear you
Walking away from me
Shot down, follow behind 'til I find you
Running ahead of me, let down
Tables have turned, and I see you
Staring right back at me
I follow behind you
You thought that you'd lost me
I'll never forget it
You'll always remind me
You left it, you bind it
You took it, I'll find it
Don't ever forget it
I'll always remember
I follow behind you
You thought that you'd lost me
I'll never forget it
You'll always remind me
You left it, you bind it
You took it, I'll find it
Don't ever forget it
I'll always rememberEmbed
