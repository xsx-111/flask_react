4000 Years Lyrics
Stealin' fortunes
While the lights up above
Are bitching at the night time
Fleetin' memories
That you met in the day
And left by the roadside

Two boards revolving
Look down to where you're stranded
Sit there laughing
You're caught up in the traffic
Tripping up over
The spell that you're under

Don't think
Don't think
Don't think that you know me
I'll always be a stranger
Don't think
Don't think
Don't think that you know me
You'll never know the answer
Fall apart
And soon to be forgotten
Fall apart
4000 years and counting
Cover me over
And bury me under the sand

Leave me
Hanging
Broken down and blinded
You left me empty handed
Take me
With you
Fix her with your mirror
I'm growing ever distant

Fortunes are folded
And burning in your pocket
Faces forgotten
I'm looking back in wonder
Looking on over
The night growing colder
