Giant Lyrics
Skies hang heavy and they gather in your field of view
Lift them higher so they're never hanging over you
Carry the load with all your might
It's sinking low, you'll be alright, coming down
Reach a plateau, but you're feeling like you just begun
In the shadow of the heaven that you're holding on
Never saw something burn so bright
Caught all our minds, lit up the night - What a sight
Looking over on the city that you once belonged
Shrug your shoulders at the people who've done you wrong
Walking above a crowded street
The ones you love, a thousand feet below
Take the throne now are, we singing out the same old song?
Overgrown now, cause you never learned to move along
Never give up all through the years
It's plain to see, straight through the tears, and I'll stay

Holding the sky up above
Looking down to the ones way below
Standing tall, Giant

We'll be closer when you turn the world upon its head
Hand it over and I'll carry it along instead
Show me your hand so I can see, I'll understand more easily, over time
Break the silence, if you're thinking turn it to sound
Close the circle, when you finish tell me what you've found
Carry the load with all your might, it's sinking low, you'll be alright, coming down

Hand me the weight from above
Feel it falling away
Letting go of it all, Giant

Take it back now, do you really wanna take it to the start?
Looking back now, did you ever really wanna play a part?Embed
