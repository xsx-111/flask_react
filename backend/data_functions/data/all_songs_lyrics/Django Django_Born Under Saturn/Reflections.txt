Reflections Lyrics
Stare into a gleaming stone
Trying to seek new light
It glistened once, now its unrefined and cold
Try to live a perfect life
Paint our world in gold
Before we realized we were owned and sold

Reflections hurt my eyes
Rays cut me to size
Glimmer in the sun
The brilliance comes undone

We worked these mines for far too long
Set our lives in stone
The tracks that lead us down are overgrown
Climb out to a past we'd lost
Now the future's old
The embers burned too bright for us to hold

Reflections hurt my eyes
Rays cut me to size
Glimmer in the sun
The brilliance comes undone
Reflections hurt my eyes
Rays cut me to size
Glimmer in the sun
The brilliance comes undoneEmbed
