Life We Know LyricsCatch a glimpse of your face in the mirror
Don't recognize, but I know we were closer than
The life we know
The life we know
Take the views from a place unfamiliar
And visualize everything even better than
The life we know
The life we know

Lift into mind
Stuck in rewind
Draw the outline of your past life
Sketching visions with your dark eyes
All decisions that we’re taking
Have consequences still replaying
Premonitions of the next life
If you don’t like it we can rewind
There’s a rip in time, continue going through it
And leads us all into oblivion
Ooh
Ooh
Struck a chord and we tried to remember
When we were far overseas finding shelter from
The life we know
And the views that we found last forever
Just like the memories that brought us together in
The life we know
The life we know

Lift into mind
Stuck in rewind
Draw the outline of your past life
Sketching visions with your dark eyes
All decisions that we’re taking
Have consequences still replaying
Premonitions of the next life
If you don’t like it we can rewind
There’s a rip in time, continue going through it
And leads us all into oblivion1Embed
