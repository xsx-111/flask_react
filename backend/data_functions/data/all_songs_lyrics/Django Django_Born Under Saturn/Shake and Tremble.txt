Shake and Tremble Lyrics
Warning signs foretold, ignore or believe them
Winds begin to blow, changing direction
Watching time unfolding, melting and eroding
Burning through our fortunes, taking all that we know

Witness omens rising
As the skies begin to glow
Trace the fault lines forming
Watching gaps begin to grow
Walking back the ocean
Just enough to say a word
Feel a wave in motion
Shake and tremble

Smoldering eyes at night
Floating in darkness
Offer sacrifice
In adoration
Beating drums and laughter
Growing ever faster
Dancing over embers falling into the fire

Witness omens rising
As the skies begin to glow
Trace the fault lines forming
Watching gaps begin to grow
Walking back the ocean
Just enough to say a word
Feel a wave in motion
Shake and tremble
Smoke drifts far away
Taking all our thoughts
Words that once held weight
Lie in molten state
Turn our feet around
And fall without a sound
Engulfing all we know

Witness omens rising
As the skies begin to glow
Trace the fault lines forming
Watching gaps begin to grow
Walking back the ocean
Just enough to say a word
Feel a wave in motion
Shake and tremble2Embed
