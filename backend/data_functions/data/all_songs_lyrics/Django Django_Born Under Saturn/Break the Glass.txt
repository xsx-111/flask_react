Break the Glass LyricsWaking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Doesn't it seem like we've been here before?
Over an ocean the heavens will open
Nothing lives up to the visions we see
Everything's clear when you step through the mirror
Carried away to the fog in the distance
Breaking through the Glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share:
Hot balloons of open air
Step out of rhythm and fall into place
Try not to think of the hours I wasted
Open the shutters, now how can it be?
When did this picture become so unreal?
Moving along on an endless supply
Somehow I feel like the only survivor
Try to remember the moment we spent lost in the rain as we floated together
Carried away by the dream that we're sharing
Breaking through the Glass
Waking up at last
Are you still there?
Face up to the facts
The gasses that we share:
Hot balloons of open air
What does it matter, the world will still spin
Another day ends, and the end will begin again
Dancing in circles, and clapping out time
Telling the truth and forgetting the lies
Waking together, you lifted your head
How would it feel if we laid back forever?
Travel the world from the bed where we lie
Floating above like the ash from a fire
Pyre, pyre, pyreEmbed
