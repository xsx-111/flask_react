Vibrations LyricsI beat a path through the jewel of the earth
Behind the trail of a song that is cursed
The sounds above me so fleeting, but clear
Yet there’s no sign of no love that I hear
They climate chokes as I climb even higher
A golden phoenix that dances like fire
Chasing a treasure elusive and few
Just catching flashes of emerald and blue
Follow him blindly he’ll lead me right into the sun
Suddenly melodies fall from the skies
Crimson and golden vibrations of paradise
Colors dividing like brushstrokes in flight
What would I do if this love ever fell in to sight?
The thunder claps as I’m struck by my idol
I’m falling backwards and need your revival
So many patterns and shapes that confound me
I’m overcome by the love that surrounds me
We’re carried high and can see all around us
It wasn’t darkness, but daylight that found us
Across this landscape to cities of people
I never found that this love could be equal
Follow behind me I’ll lead you right into the sun
Suddenly melodies fall from the skies
Crimson and golden vibrations of paradise
Capture it quick, in and outs, a new beat
Choruses echo and call to me endlessly
Suddenly melodies fall from the skies
Crimson and golden vibrations of paradise
Colors dividing like brushstrokes in flight
What would I do if this love ever fell into sight?Embed
