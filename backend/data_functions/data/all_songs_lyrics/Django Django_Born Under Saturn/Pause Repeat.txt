Pause Repeat Lyrics
Cut out the page with the ending
Always wanna go on, there's nothing beyond
The ends of the earth that surround us
Drifting closer
Your lips read the word you've been saying for years
And play out the day like a hundred before
Constant reminder, heaven's sold out
Now it won't take anymore

Pause repeat every day every scene
It's a long time since we first began
The start of the part that we both agreed on is beginning
Pause repeat every line in-between
It's a long time since we first began
The start of the end is upon us
And now it's beginning again

Climb over walls that surround us
Never knew what we'd find hidden behind
Valleys and dunes of a landscape
Painted ruins
Step off the page, walk away when you're done
The spotlight fading on the life we've begun
Constant reminder, heaven's sold out
Now it won't take anymore
Pause repeat every day every scene
It's a long time since we first began
The start of the part that we both agreed on is beginning
Pause repeat every line in-between
It's a long time since we first began
The start of the end is upon us
And now it's beginning again
Pause repeat every day every scene
It's a long time since we first began
The start of the part that we both agreed on is beginning
Pause repeat every line in-between
It's a long time since we first began
The start of the end is upon us
And now it's beginning again1Embed
