Fill My Little Fanfare Lyrics
Hey show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world
Right up, right up
Some day you're going to realise
I want you to fill my little world
Right up, right up
Hey show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world
Right up, right up
Some day you're going to realise
That I'm going to fill your little world
Right up, right up
Up, up, up
Up, up, up
Up, up, upEmbed
