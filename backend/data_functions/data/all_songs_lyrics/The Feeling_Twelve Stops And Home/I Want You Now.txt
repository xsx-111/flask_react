I Want You Now Lyrics
It's never gonna work
I don't know what I'm doing in here
My evenings go beserk
Every time your voice gets near
But when I get under control
I see you ache for it and all
I've got some sugar for your bowl
I've got some loving for your soul

Some twinkle for your eyes, I
Getting sick of being just alone
They think it's not right, fine
Each to their very little own

I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And that's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how, I want you now

So Timmy goes to school
And Timmy goes to work all day
But we just hang around
And think of clever things to say
You deserve to get your wish
But you don't know what it is
First it was that and now it's this
But there's one thing that you missed
Together we'd be fine, fine
At least we can say we won't be lonely
Fine, fine, I never want to be alone

I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And that's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how, I want you now

I want you now
I don't care how
We're both to young to sit around
I want you now
Yea Yeaaa, Yea Yea Yea Yea

I want you now, I don't care how
We're both too young to be sitting around
I want you now, I want you now
You make me sure, you make me live
And that's worth more than I ever could give
I don't know how but I want you now
Yea Yea Yea YeaaaaaaaaEmbed
