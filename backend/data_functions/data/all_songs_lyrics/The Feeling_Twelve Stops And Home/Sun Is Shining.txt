Sun Is Shining Lyrics
(Alright)

Those were the days, your mother would say
You can come out to play
We'd kick things around, climb up a tree or jump across the canal
But every summer was a year in my head
And when it ended yeah we'd wish we were dead
But nowadays it comes and goes before you know it

The sun is shining
We've nothing left to lose
The sun is shining
Put on your favourite shoes
I'm getting tired and I'm sick of waiting for you
Waiting for you-ooo-ooo

I've got to move on
But my heart belongs in a world that is gone
I went to your house
Your mother' still there, but she said you've moved out
She says you left eleven years ago
She says she's told me this before but I don't know
She won't understand if I said how I love you
The sun is shining
We've nothing left to lose
The sun is shining
Put on your favourite shoes
I'm getting tired and I'm sick of waiting for you
Waiting for you-ooo-ooo
The Sun is shining
It's going to be alright
The sun is shining
Stop putting up a fight
We're getting high so I, we've got nothing to lose
Nothing to loo-oo-oose


The sun is shining
We've got nothing to lose
The sun is shining
Put on your favourite shoes
I'm getting tired and I'm sick of waiting for you
Waiting for you-ooo-ooo
The Sun is shining
Stop putting up a fight
The sun is shining
It's going to be alright
We're getting high so I, we've got nothing to lose
Nothing to loo-oo-ooseEmbed
