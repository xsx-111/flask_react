Sewn Lyrics
Give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
Give me the words and I'll say them like i mean it
Cause you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And God knows
You got me sewn

(Nah nah nah nah)

Danny boy, don't be afraid, to shake that ass, and misbehave
Danny boy, I know you got time, but what are you waiting for
Anyway the dust may just blow away, if you wait for a windy day
But you may find the chance has passed you by

I can't do the walk
I can't do the talk
I can't be your friend
Unless I pretend

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
So give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it
Cause you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And God knows
You got me sewn
(Nah nah nah nah)

Danny boy, don't be a fool
Take upon to break a rule
Danny boy your looking so low
You looking like the dead grown old
Anyway the blues may just wash away, if you wait for a rainy day
But you may find, the chance has passed you by

I can't do the walk
I can't do the talk
I can't be your friend
Unless I pretend

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
Give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it, yea
Cause you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
Cause you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
And God knows you've got me sewn
(Nah nah nah nah)
You've got me sewn
(Nah nah nah nah)

Oh-oooo, oh-oooo
Yeah-ee, yeah-e, yeah-e, yeah

So give me the song and I'll sing it like I mean it
So give me the words and I'll say them like I mean it, yea
Cause you got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
You got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
You got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft
You got my heart in a headlock
You stopped the blood and made my head soft

You made my head soft
You made my head soft
You made my head soft
You made my head soft
You made my head soft
You made my head soft
You made my head soft
You made my head soft
Yeah
(Yeah, yeah,yeah)
