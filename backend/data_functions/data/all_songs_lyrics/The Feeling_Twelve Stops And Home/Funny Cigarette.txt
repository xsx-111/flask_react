Funny Cigarette Lyrics
I like your funny cigarette

I like the pattern on your jumper
I like the way you comb your hair
I am the one you're gonna get to
And I like your funny cigarette

Your funny cigarette
Whoo-ooh whoo-ooh-oh
Your funny cigarette
Whoo-ooh whoo-ooh-oh
Your funny cigarette
Whoo-ooh whoo-ooh-oh
I like it
Your funny cigarette

If you want it (oh yeah)
You're gonna get it (all right)
Just be sure it's what you want
You might regret it (all right)
But if you want to get three
Well, that's okay with me
Make it tight, sister Jane
You won't forget it
You won't forget it
I saw the itsy-bitsy spiders
I saw the monkeys in the zoo
I saw the elephants and lions
I looked at them and thought of you
And your funny cigarette

Whoo-ooh whoo-ooh-oh
Your funny cigarette
Whoo-ooh whoo-ooh-oh
Your funny cigarette
Whoo-ooh whoo-ooh-oh
I like it
I like your funny cigarette

If you want it (oh yeah)
You're gonna get it (all right)
Just be sure it's what you want
You might regret it (all right)
But if you want to get three
Well, that's okay with me
Make it tight, sister Jane
You won't forget it
You won't forget it
Stop yearning, you're burning
I'm learning, heads turning
You're smoking, I'm choking
Keep talking, love is something beautiful
I like your funny cigaretteEmbed
