Blue Piccadilly Lyrics
She gave her heart for a wealthy man
A healthy child and a healthy tan
He gave it all for a pretty face
A sweet smile but a bitter taste
They gave it all
Yes they gave it all
Her thoughts were big but their feelings small

I put the dog out for you
Travelled beneathwards for you
Down where it's rumbling
Suburbs left crumbling
Here's where the fun begins, it's true
But I never knew anyone make me run but you do

And that's when the blue Piccadilly
Takes me away from the city
Maybe someday you'll forgive me
Twelve stops and home

You journeyed downwards for me
There ain't much left down here to see
You're just too cool for me
You made quite a fool of me
You brought out the school in me, in me
But I never knew anyone tougher than you
And that's when the blue Piccadilly
Takes me away from the city
Maybe someday you'll forgive me
Twelve stops and home
And baby I think that I love ya
And there's a short sign above ya
Cause it ain't it a shame
There's another
I think I'll go home

(Why are you here again)
Twelve stops and home
(There is no better friend)
Twelve stops and home
(Look at the time we spent)
Twelve stops and home
(When will it ever end)
Twelve stops and home

You take me down, down, down
You take me down


Everyone knows it
Can you deny it?
I was the only one for you
Everyone knows it
'cause we couldn't hide it
Nobody else got close, it's true
But my love was stronger than you think, yeah
It's much stronger now I've had a drink, well

I hope you know that I miss you
And I wonder where you've been
And I wonder who you've seen
And I hope that he's a friend
Do I miss you? (Yeah)
Do I miss you? (Yeah)
Well I wonder where you've been
And I hope you're with a friend

Everyone knows it
So don't you deny it
We had it all laid out for two
Everyone knows it
'cause we couldn't hide it
I was the sea and the sky was you
All of a sudden the wind just change direction
And that big black cloud came rolling in, yeah
I hope you know that I miss you
And I wonder where you've been
And I wonder who you've seen
And I hope that he's a friend
Do I miss you? (Yeah)
Do I miss you? (Yeah, yes I do)
I wonder who you've seen
And I hope that he's a friend

Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah
