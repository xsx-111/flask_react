Same Old Stuff Lyrics
My love, look me in the eye, don't lie
What's eating you inside
I know someone said I ain't your kind
Who knows that maybe they're right

Do you feel it in your bones
And bones beneath your skin
And the blood that flows within
I thought it was obvious

My love
We're made of the same old stuff
Same old stuff
It's not hard
Just look at how close we are
Instead of how far
My love
We're made of the same old stuff
Same old stuff
It's not hard
Just look at how close we are
Instead of how far
So what tell me what you got to hide
Do we all get pulled back sometimes
You feel cold
You feel so low
Just the same as I

I feel it in my bones
And I feel it in my skin
And the blood that flows within
I thought it was obvious

My love
We're made of the same old stuff
Same old stuff
It's not hard
Just look at how close we are
Instead of how far

I did it your way
Don't push it baby
Theres nothing more than bones and impressions now
Same old, same old, same old
There's nothing more
Same old, same old, same old
There's nothing more
My love it's time
My love
Same old, same old
Same, same old

My love
We're made of the same old stuff
Same old stuff
It's not hard
Just look at how close we are
Instead of how farEmbed
