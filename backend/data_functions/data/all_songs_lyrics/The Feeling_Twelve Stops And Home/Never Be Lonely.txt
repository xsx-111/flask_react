Never Be Lonely Lyrics
People in love get fast and foolish
People in love get everything wrong
People in love get scared and stupid
People in love get everything wrong

At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
They'll never be lonely

B-b-b-baby, I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
And why should I be sane without you
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you

People in love get special treatment
People in love get everything wrong
People in love, their hearts get eaten
People in love get everything wrong

At least they're not lonely
At least they're not lonely
They'll never be lonely
B-b-b-baby, I think I'm going c-c-c-crazy
And why should I be sane without you
They tell me to fight it
But they can bloody well just try it
I'll never be the same without you

Never be lonely, never be lonely
Never be lonely, never be lonely
Never be lonely, never be lonely
Never be lonely, never be lonelyEmbed
