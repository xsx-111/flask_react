Fill My Little World Lyrics
I had a dream we went away
Left this city for a day
You took me southwards on a plane
And showed me Spain or somewhere
But in reality you're
Not so keen to show me anything
And I thought you liked me

Hey, show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world
Right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
(I want you to) To fill my little world
Right up, right up, right up

So what you gonna to do with all this stuff
Pilling up, filling up, taking up (my little ....)
You misunderstand me
All I wanted was some evidence
That you really like me (you really liked me)

Hey, show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world
Right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
(I want you) To fill my little world
Right up, right up, right up
Maybe it's all too much
How come we're so messed up
Maybe I'm not enough
Maybe I'm just too much
Hey show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world...
Right up
Oooh ooo

Hey, show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world
Right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
(I want you) To fill my little world
Right up, right up
Hey, show some love
You ain't so tough
Come fill my little world
Right up, right up
Someday you're going to realise
That I'm passing you by, so fill your little world
Right up, right up, right up
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and show
Come on and showEmbed
