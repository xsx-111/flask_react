Helicopter Lyrics
My piano's out of tune
I wish it wasn't
I wish that you were mine
I wish that my heart was stronger
My piano's out of tune
I wish it wasn't
I wish we had more time
I wish that my world was softer
And I want a helicopter

I've had this feeling before
My heart is crawling in the mud, mud, mud
I'd feel much better I'm sure if I had a helicopter

This telephone's out of use
I wish it wasn't
I wish you loved me more
I wish that your world was closer
This telephone's out of use
I wish somebody would take me to your door
I wish that this world was finer
And I want an ocean liner
I've had this feeling before
My heart is crawling in the mud, mud, mud
I'd feel much better I'm sure if I had an ocean liner

My piano's out of tune
I wish it wasn't
I wish we had more time
I wish that my world was softer
And I want a helicopter
I want a helicopter

I've had this feeling before
My heart is crawling in the mud, mud, mud
I'd feel much better I'm sure if I had a helicopter
If I had a helicopter

I've had this (crawling in the mud, mud, mud)
My heart is (crawling in the mud, mud, mud)
I'd feel much (crawling in the mud, mud, mud, mud, mud)Embed
