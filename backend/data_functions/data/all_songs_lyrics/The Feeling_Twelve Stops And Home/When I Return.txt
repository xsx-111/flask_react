When I Return Lyrics
I've travelled far just to look at the stars from a new place
They look just the same from the hills and the plains, yes it's true
You gave it all to a fool
How could I know how I'd fare without you
'Til I was gone, gone, gone?

When I return I will be better than, better than before
For I will have learned what your medicine is for
When I return
When I return

You and your face and your hair and your taste made me leave you
You and your all-giving smile all the while made me go
So I lived in the east, I lived in the west, I did it all without a penny
I lived twenty days in a hornet's nest and didn't get stung hardly any
But I still miss you

When I return I will be better than, better than before
For I may have learned what your medicine is for, oh
When I return
When I return
When I return I'll love you better than, better than before, oh
For now I have learned what your medicine is for
When I return
When I returnEmbed
