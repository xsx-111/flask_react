Anyone Lyrics
Where the hell did you get that smile
I haven't seen one of them in a while
Cause these days I'm such a bore
I mope around, like I seen it all before
But something has changed
I used to be an open heart
What have you done to me

It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him
It was me who felt like a fool right then
And I won't be the only one
It could have been anyone
Yes it could
Yeah, Yeah

When the hell did you get so wise
Foiled again by attempts to disguise
Do you recall the day we kissed
Upon the coast, surrounded by the mist
I gave you my world to tear apart
Another fool, another broken heart
It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him
It was me who felt like a fool right then
And I won't be the only one
It could have been anyone

I know doing it again, it's out of line
(Trying to catch a fish down the line)
And I know doing it again, I must be blind
I'm doing it again
I'm doing it again

It could have been anyone, it could have been anyone
It could have been anyone, It could have been anyone
But it wasn't you and it wasn't him
It was me who felt like a fool right then
And I can't be the only one
It could have been anyoneEmbed
