Video Killed The Radio Star (Live From The Hospital) LyricsI heard you on the wireless back in '52
I'd lie awake intent in tuning in on you
If I was young it didn't stop you coming through
Oh, oh
They took the credit for your second symphony
Rewritten by machine, a new technology
And now I understand the problems you can see
Oh, oh
I saw your children
Oh, oh
What did you tell them?
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
Oh, uh-oh, oh, oh
So now we sit in an abandoned studio
I hear the playback and it seems so long ago
Do you remember the jingles used to go
Oh, oh
You were the first one
Oh, oh
You'll be the last one
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind we've gone to far
Oh, uh-uh, oh, oh
Oh, uh-uh, oh, oh
Video killed the radio star
Video killed the radio star
In my mind and in my car
We can't rewind we've gone to far
Pictures came and broke your heart
We put the blame on VCR
Oh, ahhh radio star
Oh, ahhh radio star
Video killed the radio star
