All You Need to Do LyricsYou say you don't know what you want to be
You can't afford a third degree
And now you're nearly twenty three and your daddy wants to know
What you're doing with your life
Well tell him it'll always be worth while
For when I feel wrong you make me strong
All you need to do is say I love you anyway
A few little words and I am good for another day
And then I'll tell myself maybe next time I'll make a change
All you need to do is say I love you anyway
And I'm back again
(Open up your heart, sing)
I love you
(It's a cure for everything)
I love you
I'm back again
(Doesn't matter where you've been)
I love you
All you need to do is say I love you anyway
Crazy morning
Freak out, warning
Boozy winters
Firewood, splinters
Morning after
Another disaster
I'm looking at the mess and baby I feel so ashamed
All you need to do is say I love you anyway
Oh. all you need to do is say I love you anyway
And I'm back again
(Open up your heart, sing)
I love you
(It's a cure for everything)
I love you
I'm back again
(Doesn't matter where you've been)
I love you
(Baby you can only win)
I love you
(Open up your heart, sing)
I love you
All you need to do is say I love you anyway
Greedy sometimes
Pushy and unkind
But when I do wrong
You smile, it's gone
Da-da-da-dum-da-da
Da-da-da-dum-da-da
All you need to do is say I love you anyway, yeah
OooohEmbed
