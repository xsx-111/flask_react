Strange Lyrics
Don't you dig this life
They call the meek
You whose feet are on the ground
And if you get too high
What goes around comes around
And brings you down

Cause people gonna see you
How they wanna see you
People gonna rate you
People gonna hate you
People gonna shove you
People gonna love you
People gonna do whatever
Makes them feel they own you better

Cause everyone knows we're strange
So why do you feel ashamed, baby
Everyone knows we're different
So why do you feel ashamed
We love you all the same

That's why
Cause if you feel it
And if you mean it
Don't apologize
And you'll be just fine
Cause all they ever need is what you'll give them
They only put you down if you give them permission
People gonna see you
How they wanna see you
People gonna rate you
People gonna hate you
People gonna shove you
People gonna love you
People gonna do whatever
Makes them feel they own you better

Cause everyone knows we're strange
So why do you feel ashamed, baby
Everyone knows we're different
So why do you feel ashamed
We love you all the same, yeah
We love you all the same, yeah
We love you all the same
So don't you ever change

You're undernourished
And unencouraged
And underrated
And unappreciated
The world is turning in a different direction to us
But just look how far you've come
Considering all of the pushing and spitting and stuff
Yeah everyone knows we're strange
So why do you feel ashamed, baby
Everyone knows we're different
So why do you feel ashamed
We love you all the same

Yes, we love you
Yes, we love you
All the same
All the same
Yes, we love you
Yes, we love you
All the same
Don't ever changeEmbed
