What Have You Done Lyrics
Would you mind if I hurt you?
Understand that I need to
Wish that I had other choices
Than to harm the one I love
What have you done now?

I know I'd better stop tryin'
You know that there's no denyin'
I won't show mercy on you now
I know I should stop believing
I know there's no retrieving
It's over now, what have you done?
What have you done now?

I have been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you

What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?
Would you mind if I killed you?
Would you mind if I tried to?
'Cause you have turned into my worst enemy
You carry hate that I don't feel
It's over now, what have you done?
What have you done now?

I have been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away, oh (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you...

What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done, what have you done?
What have you done now?

What have you done?
(What have you done, what have you done?)
(What have you done, what have you done?)
I will not fall, won't let it go
We will be free when it ends...
I have been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you
I've been waitin' for someone like you
But now you are slippin' away (What have you done now?)
Why, why does fate make us suffer?
There's a curse between us, between me and you1Embed
