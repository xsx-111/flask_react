The Cross Lyrics
Nothing's ever changed
You still turn away
You've washed your hands
You've made that all too clear
You just keep on living this lie
You refuse to see
You're denying me
The cross I bear
But you don't seem to care
Even Judas knew he had lied

I keep wondering why
I'm still calling your name
Through my tears

Why have you waited to embrace me, my dear?
Cold is your silence, denying what is real
I'm still wondering why
I'm still calling your name, my dear

I'm sorry if you can't
Stand the naked truth
All you see
Is how you want it to be
So you keep on living your life
Release me from this cross
After all these years
Oh, call my name
And help me with this weight
Even though it comes far too late

I keep wondering why
I'm still calling your name
Through my tears

Why have you waited to embrace me, my dear?
Cold is your silence, denying what is real
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name
And I wonder, oh, I wonder
In my heart I still hope
You will open the door
You can purify it all
Answer my call
Why? Why?

Why have you waited to embrace me, my dear?
Cold is your silence, denying what is real
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name
And I wonder, oh, I wonder
In my heart I still hope
You will open the door
You can purify it all
