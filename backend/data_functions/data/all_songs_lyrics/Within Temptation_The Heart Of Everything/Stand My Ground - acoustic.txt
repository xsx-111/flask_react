Stand My Ground - acoustic LyricsWITHIN TEMPTATION
I can see
When you stay low, nothing happens
Does it feel right?
Late at night
Things I thought, I put behind me
Haunt my mind
I just know there's no escape now
Once it sets its eyes on you
But I won't run, have to stare it in the eye
Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I got to face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will stand my ground
It's all around
Getting stronger, coming closer
Into my world
(My world)
I can feel
That it's time for me to face it
Can I take it?
Though this might just be the ending
Of the life I held so dear
But I won't run, there's no turning back from here
Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I got to face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will stand my ground
All I know for sure is I'm trying
I will always stand my ground
Stand my ground, I won't give in
(I won't give in)
I won't give up
(I won't give up)
No more denying, I got to face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will
Stand my ground, I won't give in
No more denying, I got to face it
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside
If I don't make it, someone else will stand my groundEmbed
