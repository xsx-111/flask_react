Blue Eyes LyricsBlue Eyes
Blue eyes just smile to the world
Full of dreams and with fascination
Too soon she saw that her hands were chained and pulled without any freedom
It's always the same, they fear no way out
I cannot break it
I can take it no more
It's burning me up inside
Lost all my tears, can't cry
No reason, no meaning
Just hatred
No matter how hard I try
You fear the beast inside
It's growing, it's waiting
Just to hurt you
This heart was hurt by the light and
I see your world that tries to deny
Now everything that I love has died or has been shattered to pieces
It's always the same, they fear no way out
I cannot break it
I can take it no more
Just to hurt you
Just to hurt you
Can't you see their eyes, what lies inside
They've given up, they no longer shine
Too soon they close with one last cry
Before they turn to light
Just to hurt youEmbed
