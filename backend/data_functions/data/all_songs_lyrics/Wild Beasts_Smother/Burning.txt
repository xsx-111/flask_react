Burning LyricsI'm saved
You pull my fingers out the dirt
You pluck me wriggling from the world
I'm saved
You cast me up into the wind
You shuck my body from its skin
I'm saved
Fire licking at the walls
You drag me burning across the coals
I'm ashamed
Lying fallen on some stair
Clutching at the empty air
I'm awake
I see you walk into the room
Do the thing I couldn't do
I'm afraid
My burning footprints on the floor
Things I don't need anymore
I'll wait
I'll wait
I'll wait1Embed
