Albatross LyricsAlbatross, albatross
How callous the ocean you cross
I, I blame you, I blame you
For all of those things I've been through
Don't feel bad, not a pang
It's my neck around which you hang
Like a chain or a tag
I flinch and you fall through the cracks
To the sea and all it bears
The secrets that I should'a shared
Drowned then and there
Yeah, they drowned then and there
Yeah, they drowned then and there
I, I blame you, I blame you
For all of those things I've been through
Don't feel bad, not a pang
It's my neck around which you hang
Like a chain or a tag
I flinch and you fall through the cracks
To the sea and all it bears
The secrets that I should'a shared
Drowned then and there
Yeah, they drowned then and there
Yeah, they drowned then and there
Albatross, albatross
Which way to turn when we're lost?1Embed
