Deeper Lyrics
The breakfast is all laid out
Waiting for you to arrive
The sun just rising
And going down again

Deeper, deeper
Oh piece me together again
Deeper, deeper
You burn a hole in the world

I have to know how it feels
And I am not afraid
This is the house we built
All else falls away

Deeper, deeper
Oh dare we put our tongues to the flames?
Deeper, deeper
Oh send the others away

You plug the yawning void
And the world parts for you
The sucking sun, in his sucking sky
You lift him into the room
Deeper, deeper
The smile across my face
Deeper, deeper
The fires inside you raceEmbed
