End Come Too Soon LyricsBreak some bread
The night's been blessed with a neverending-ness
But nonetheless
End come to soon
Sweet concubine
The night's divine in a never ending line
Of lovers
End come to soon
On the cusp
The both of us without any maybes but musts
That carry us
To the end too soon
Ink begins to blot
My eyes are blood shot, they've seen things they wish they have not
But it won't stop
The end coming too soon
Whose butter fingers read me like braille?
Whose dirty mouth would have made Mary hail?
Whose wholesome heart had bore down on me?
Who ushers dreamers into such harems?
Whose skin looked waxen in the failing light?
Who down right danced me like a sailing kite?
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh
End come too soon
End come, too soon
End come too soon
End come, too soon
End come, too soon
It comes too soon
It comes too soon
Too soon, too soon
Too soon, too soon
It's too soon, it's too soon
It's too soon, it's too soon
It's too soon, it's too soon
It's too soon, it's too soon
It's too soon, it's too soon
It's too soon
The end, it comes too soon
Too soon, too soon, too soon
The end it came and went too soonEmbed
