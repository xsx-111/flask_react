Reach a Bit Further Lyrics
I was angry and brash as a bull
You were devastatingly beautiful
I was crude, I was lewd, I was rude, I was not in the mood
It's a peculiar stance, It's me reachin' for the olive branch
Yes, I will do all the things that you ask of me
I said yes, I will, come on, darling, have no fear
And though the way is dark and hands will grab at us
I'll remember this and only this
Yes, I will

Tearjerker, shadow lurker
Wonder worker, reach a bit further
Tearjerker, shadow lurker
Wonder worker, reach a bit further
Will you by any chance
Remember the olive branch?

Said yes, I will do all the things that you ask of me
Oh yes, I will, come on, darling, have no fear
And though the way is dark and hands will grab at us
I'll remember this and only this
Yes, yes, I will
Tearjerker, shadow lurker
Wonder worker, reach a bit further
Tearjerker, shadow lurker
Wonder worker, reach a bit further
Will you by any chance?

Yes, I will1Embed
