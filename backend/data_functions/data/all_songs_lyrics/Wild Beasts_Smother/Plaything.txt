Plaything LyricsNew squeeze, take off your chemise
And I'll do as I please
I know I'm not any kinda heartthrob
But at the same time, I'm not any sorta slob
You're my plaything, you're my plaything
You're my plaything
Yeah, I'm wonderin', yeah, I'm wonderin'
What you're thinking
You're my plaything, you're my plaything
You're my plaything
Yeah, I'm wonderin', yeah, I'm wonderin'
How cruel I've been
New squeeze, unfold my body
I've ransacked myself
I've flat-packed myself for your ease
Y'know that the second I saw you
I was rendered the very voyeur
You're my plaything, you're my plaything
You're my plaything
Yeah, I'm wonderin', yeah, I'm wonderin'
What yer thinking
You're my plaything, you're my plaything
You're my plaything
Yeah, I'm wonderin', yeah, I'm wonderin'
How cruel I've been
I concur, I conquer
I concur, I conquer
I concur, I conquer
I concur, I conquer
I concur, I conquerEmbed
