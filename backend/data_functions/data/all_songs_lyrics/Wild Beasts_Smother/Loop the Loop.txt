Loop the Loop LyricsOh, don't you think
That people are the strangest things?
Design of desire
Means all that the heart requires
Is what it can't recognise, oh no, mmm
Oh, don't you think
That people are the hardest things?
Design of desire
Means all that the heart requires
Is what it can't compromise, oh no, ooh
I've made enough enemies
No, I've made enough enemies!
Forget now
How many must I forget now?
How many must I forget now?
How many must I forget?
Remember
As many as I remember
As many as I remember
I must forget
Regret now
How many do I regret now?
How many do I regret now?
How many do I regret?
Slender
Oh, there are some but they're slender
Oh, there are some but they're slender
Sums I regret
Oh, don't you think
That people are the strangest things?
Design of desire
Means all that the heart requires
Is what it can't sympathise, oh noEmbed
