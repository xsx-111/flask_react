Invisible LyricsI see our enemies, I see them on their knees
Crawling across the floor, you kill them all
Outside our door, the gaping hole
Into which all will fall
You have walked through my dreams
And I want you to see this
Open the door, open the door
Standing at the maw
Things vanish one by one
Invisible, invisible, invisible
Watch them go, all's going to fall
I say my goodbyes
To everyone I know
Goodbye, goodbye
I burn up my lists
We cease to exist
Leave nothing behind
The things I thought I'd want
They vanish one by one
Invisible, invisible, invisible
You have walked through my dreams
And I want you to see this
Invisible, invisible, invisible
Your lips to my lips
We cease to existEmbed
