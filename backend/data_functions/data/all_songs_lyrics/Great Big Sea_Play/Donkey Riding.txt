Donkey Riding LyricsWay hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Was you ever in Quebec launching timber on the deck ,where ya
Break yer bleeding neck riding on a donkey
Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Was you ever round Cape Horn where the weathers never warm
Wish to god you'd never been born riding on a donkey
Way hey and away we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Was you ever in Miramichi where they you tie up to a tree, and the girl sit on
Your knee riding on a donkey
Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Was you ever in Fortune Bay see the girls all shout hurray,here
Comes Dad with ten weeks pay riding on a donkey
Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Was you ever in London town see the king he does come down
SEE THE KING IN HIS GOLDEN CROWN riding on a donkey
Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkey
Way hey and a way we go donkey riding donkey riding
Way hey and away we go riding on a donkeyEmbed
