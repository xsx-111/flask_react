Ordinary Day LyricsI've got a smile on my face, I've got four walls around me
The sun in the sky, the water surrounds me
I'll win now but sometimes I'll lose
I've been battered, but I'll never bruise
It's not so bad

And I say way-hey-hey, it's just an ordinary day
And it's all your state of mind
At the end of the day, you've just got to say
It's all right
Janie sings on the corner, what keeps her from dying?
Let them say what they want, she won't stop trying
She might stumble, if they push her 'round
She might fall, but she'll never lie down
It's not so bad

In this beautiful life, there's always some sorrow
It's a double-edged knife, but there's always tomorrow
It's up to you now if you sink or swim
Just keep the faith and your ship will come in
It's not so bad
And I say way-hey-hey, it's just an ordinary day
And it's all your state of mind
At the end of the day, you've just got to say
I say way-hey-hey, it's just an ordinary day
And it's all your state of mind
At the end of the day, you've just got to say
It's alright
'Cause it's alright, it's alright
'Cause I've got a smile on my face and I've got four walls around meEmbed
