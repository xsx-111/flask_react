Jolly Roving Tar LyricsShips may come and ships may go
As long as the sea does roll
Each sailor lad just like his dad
He loves the flowing bowl
A trip on shore he does adore
With a girl who's nice and round
When the money's gone
It's the same old song
"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"
CHORUS:
Come along, come along, You jolly brave boys
There's lots of grog in the jar
We'll plough the briny ocean
With the jolly roving tar
When Jack comes in, it's then he'll steer
To some old boarding house
They'll welcome him with rum and gin
And feed him on pork scouse
He'll lend, spend and he'll not offend
Till he's lyin' drunk on the ground
When the money's gone
It's the same old song
"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"
CHORUS
Jack, he then, oh then he'll sail
Bound down for Newfoundland
All the ladies fair in Placentia there
They love that sailor man
He'll go to shore out on a tear
And he'll buy some girl a gown
When the money's gone
It's the same old song
"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"
CHORUS
When Jack gets old and weatherbeat
Too old to roam about
They'll let him stop in some rum shop
Till eight bells calls him out
Then he'll raise his eyes up to the skies
Sayin' "Boys, we're homeward bound."
When the money's gone
It's the same old song
"Get up Jack! John, sit down!"
