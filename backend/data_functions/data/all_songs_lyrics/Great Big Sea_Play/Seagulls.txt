Seagulls LyricsShe left St.Johns one day in May
Dressed in her sunday best
A kind man sat beside her
And she cried her way out west
She moved in with her cousin
And found a job down in the mall
Her friends at home were jealous
And said "We'll see you in the fall."
You know that she wants to try
Never you let you see her cry
You know that she wants to try
She's got seagulls in her eyes
The people here seem really nice
But the winter's way too long
Her new friends don't understand
They just tell her to be strong
She made some decent money
Yeah, but nothing comes for free
The busy streets just don't compete
With the sky, the rocks, the sea
You know that she wants to try
Never let you see her cry
You know that she wants to try
She's got seagulls in her eyes
(She's got seagulls in her eyes)
Her parents came at Easter time
Wanted her to stay
But she went and got a panel-bed
And moved home on her birthday
The girls in town all said
She couldn't make it on her own
Now the skies a little smaller
And it doesn't seem like home
You know that she wants to try
Never let you see her cry
You know that she wants to try
She's got seagulls in her eyes (X2)
(She's got seagulls in her eyes)Embed
