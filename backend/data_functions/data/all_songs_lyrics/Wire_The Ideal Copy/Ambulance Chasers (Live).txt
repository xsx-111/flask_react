Ambulance Chasers (Live) Lyrics
"Ambulance Chasers."

Ever creeping and climbing
The dogs keep griming
Fucking and sliming
No sense of timing
Anytime's alright
For what they've got in mind

Watch the front
Watch your behind
When they come

Arse sniffing
Wanting to kiss and make up
So terribly cut up
Oh, so terribly cut up
Oh, so terribly cut up
