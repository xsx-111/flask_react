A Serious of Snakes LyricsIt looks serious
Is that a paper
I see in your hand?
Then a pause for a German phrase
"Nie wieder nie wieder, nie wieder nie wieder"
Never again, none of your lip, y' tulip
Y' tulip, y' pea-brained earwig
Y' punk, y' silver-tongued shnake
I'd rather make furniture than go to midnight mass
Y'tulip, y'pea-brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver-tongued shnake
He's a genius in research, I simply fell in love, I've got your zip-code
Over there USA
Green turbaned angels
Annexe the right bank
Baby in a shambolic sideshow
They abandoned the baby
The baby trained, baby returns
Baby kills Mary and Joseph
Y'tulip, y'pea-brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver-tongued shnake
Talk about laughing
I might have defeated cancer
Or so they say
Electrocuted, I was transformed into a foot soldier of
The good general
Passionate for knights
In the heart of ancient Persia
Fearless to go forth
Fearless to adapt
Then blow to pieces
Y'tulip, y'pea-brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver-tongued shnake
Please send your god
My very best wishes
Does he still sing?
Does he still fish?
Does he still help you
On your days off?
Don't stop that dripping
I prefer the old tortures
It's only when you stop
That I feel it
Y'tulip, y'pea-brained earwig
Y'punk, y'silver-tongued shnake
When you lose the ship
It's like losing a part of you
I have a sense of my exposure
It's all on the neg
I try to use 2 instead of 3
Ah, but I have secrets
And there's a story in me
It starts ................
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dotEmbed
