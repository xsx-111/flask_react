Ahead Lyrics
Lips growing for service
Eyes steady for peeling
Bring on the special guest
A monkey caught stealing
Standard rewards in corners
Is full-board in new quarters
Kneeling for pleasure
Ensures a good time

I remember, I remember
Making the body search
I remember, I remember
Making the body search

Someone is taking you
Someone has taken me
TV doesn't understand
A word that matters
Scattering desires to
Smoldering fires
Someone has taken you
Someone is taking me
I remember, I remember
Making the body search
I remember, I remember
Making the body search

I remember
Making the body search
That is was nothing
But enough for ahead

I remember, I remember, I remember
Making the body search
I remember, I remember, I remember, I remember
Making the body search

I remember, I remember
Making the body search
I remember, I remember
Making the body search
