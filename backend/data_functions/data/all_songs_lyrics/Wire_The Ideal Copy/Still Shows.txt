Still Shows Lyrics
Steel testing on
Long good mornings
We make our days
As our days make us

Cutting the rabbit
Pressing skin
Selecting gear
Tearing about
Tearing about

In extravagant promises
Mysterious terrors thrive
Judgement dies
Into scenic affects
Yellow, it still shows
It still shows through

Skinning the rabbit
Dressing the skin
Selecting an ear
Tearing about
Tearing about
Cutting the rabbit
Pressing skin
Selecting gear
Tearing about
Tearing about
