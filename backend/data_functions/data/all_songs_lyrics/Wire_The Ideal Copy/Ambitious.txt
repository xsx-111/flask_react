Ambitious LyricsChain link route ways
Digital time base
New hours for these days
New files engaged
Strangeness detectors
Collage charmers
Magnetic behavior
Quarks and order
When it's cold I feel cold
When it's hot I feel ambitious
Fit for a princess
Hot on the heels of an angel
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
Are you hot? Are you hot?
I feel ambitious
The ideal copy is the same
The ideal copy has your name
When you can't, it makes you can
When you aren't, it makes you am
The ideal copy is what you want
When you won't, it makes you will
The ideal copy makes you happy
The ideal copy
