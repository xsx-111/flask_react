Cheeking Tongues Lyrics
Oh I what gets revealed
In the inland sea
Eels in lungs
A mystery
Begin to pull in and out
Then stomachs wail
For what went astray
For what went astray

Oh that cheeking tongue
Oh that cheating lunge
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you there? Were you there?
It's all history

Delirious vandals struggle with meters
A cheek tango with liters
Which fits and almost sick
Half track associations
Appear on parade
Appear on parade

Oh that cheeking tongue
Oh that cheating lunge
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you there? Were you there?
It's all history
Unrefined, the final scam
It doesn't rhyme, it didn't matter
A soundtrack for your silence
Insincere

Oh that cheeking tongue
Oh that cheating lunge
Were you there? Were you there?
Were you there? Were you there?
It's all historyEmbed
