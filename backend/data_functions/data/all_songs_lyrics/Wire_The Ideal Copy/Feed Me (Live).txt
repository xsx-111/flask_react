Feed Me (Live) Lyrics
What's the point
It's your table
I alter my altar
For every mouthful
You're unable
For every mouthful
I hunger

Feed me
Ooo, feed me

Don't give me that
It's your table
I grow by
Grow by inches
For every mouthful
You're living
For every mouthful
I'm running

Feed me
Ohh, feed me
Ohh, feed me
Don't give me that
It's your table
I grow by
Grow by in inches
For every mouthful
You're living
For every mouthful
I'm running

Feed me
Ohh, feed me
Feed me
Ohh, feed me

How fast do you run?
How fast can you run?Embed
