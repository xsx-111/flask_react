Scott Pilgrim Lyrics
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years

I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)

You can't stand to see me that way
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
You can't stand to see me that way, yeah
Yeah! Yeah!

I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
I've liked you for a thousand years, a thousand years
(I can't wait 'til I see you, I can't wait until I see you)
You can't stand to see me that way
No matter what I do, no matter what I say
You can't stand to see me that way
Yeah! Yeah!3Embed
