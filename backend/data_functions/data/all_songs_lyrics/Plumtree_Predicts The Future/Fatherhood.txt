Fatherhood LyricsKnee slapper
You are the funniest person I know
Backstabber
The matter
You're not so
Honest I hope you know
Honest I hope you know
(1, 2, 3, 4)
Toe tapper
Knee slapper
You are the funniest person I know
Backstabber
The matter
You're not so
Honest I hope you know
Honest I hope you know
My baby she don't know
My baby she don't know
But she don't know
And she don't care about that
Toe tapper
Knee slapper
You are the funniest person I know
Backstabber
The matter
You're not so
Honest I hope you know
Honest I hope you know
My baby (my baby) she don't know
My baby she don't know
But she don't know
And she don't care about that...
That...
That...Embed
