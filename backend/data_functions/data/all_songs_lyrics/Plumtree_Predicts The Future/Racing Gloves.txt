Racing Gloves LyricsI should think before I speak
I could learn to keep my mouth closed
I'm so contradictory
That by now you oughta' know
Eighteen years and a comfortable haircut
Really don't mean very much
And they say
Can't believe that
You would leave it
Behind
You know that
I don't see it
When it's mine
Can't believe that
You would leave it
Behind
You know that
I don't see it
When it's mine
I don't want you
To see me try
Never to see me try
Try, try, try
You make me feel obscene
Acting so divine
But it isn't how it seems
Do you really find
Do you really think you're smarter than me
Do you say it deliberately
Do you really think you're smarter than me
Do you say it deliberately

Eighteen years and a comfortable haircut
Really don't mean very much
Eighteen years and a comfortable haircut
Really don't mean very much
