Going So Low LyricsSo there I was walking into the big store
With my hand in my pocket
I didn't look back
I didn't look back
'Cause sometimes
You just gotta go on your own
Yeah sometimes
You just gotta go
Well the day that I leave's gonna hurt bad
But there's no other way
There's no other option
And I don't know whether it'll be worse
For me or for themEmbed
