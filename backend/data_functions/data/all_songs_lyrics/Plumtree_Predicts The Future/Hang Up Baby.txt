Hang Up Baby LyricsYou keep me
You keep me hanging on
You keep me
You keep me hanging on
For so long
You keep me
You keep me hanging on
No matter what I say or do
I just can't get enough of you
Your cell phone is
Ringing all day long
You know that it's
Me and not your mom
It wouldn't take
Much to turn it on
But you'd rather just
Keep me hanging onEmbed
