Your Mouth Shoots Off LyricsIf you wanted me to speak my mind
I'd speak my mind to you
And I'd try to see it through
You've felt that fear
For the thousandth time and you're
Willing to shrug it off
Either way you're much too soft
And I've been scared for a long time too
But I'm willing to fight with you
And it would be a bit to do
If you wanted me to speak my mind
I'd speak my mind for you
And I'd try to see it through
If you wanted me to speak my mind
I'd speak my mind to you
And I'd try to see it through
I felt my hands
Tie them into this
And then look me straight in the eyes
And then still took me by surprise
I tried to be
Complimentary but right now
I'm just appalled
But it can't hurt me most of all
Can't hurt me most of all
And it's all my fault
Telling myself that
Somebody's
Waiting for me
I know
I know
Somebody
If you ever decide to leave
If you wanted me to speak my mind
I'd speak my mind for you
And I'd try to see it through
I would
Speak my mind to you
And I'd try to see it throughEmbed
