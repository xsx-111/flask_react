Groovallegiance Lyrics
'Bout that time
They asked me where was I going you know
I, said, well
You have to be reasonable
So you know
I've never been away from home before
And, uh, besides they gave me a good deal
And I think that, uh
Funkadelica is
You know, the nation
That, you know, I would like to, live under
(What in the world is this boy talking about?)

Pledge a groovallegiance to the funk
The United Funk of Funkadelica
Uh, dey funk, well dey funk, today funk
Of da United Funk of Funkadelica
Pledge a groovallegiance to the funk
I pledge groovallegiance to the flag
Of funky, funky, Funkadelica, yeah
The United Funk of Funkadelica
Uh, dey funk, well dey funk, today funk
With the united funk we can fly!
For if our cause was unjust
We couldn't bring this funk to you
So we feel that it's a must
It is something we should do
You know
Let me take you by the hand
And spread the funk across the land
It's not hard to understand
Headin' for the master plan

Pledge a groovallegiance to the funk
(Oh yeah)
The United Funk of Funkadelica
Oh Yea-Hoo

Pardon me, but I can tell
We know each other very well
Take my funk and let it grow
And then we'll funk some more
Please come on, come all to the funk
Let your feelings grow as one
Join this nation, you will see
That we can make you free
Dip-Dip de-diddy-de-dep-dee

Pledge a groovallegiance to the funk
