Cholly (Funk Getting Ready to Roll!) Lyrics
I was strung out on Bach, and Beethoven was my thing
I dug jazz, I dug rock, anything with a swing
But I ran into a friend who told me there was so much more
Find the void that you missed there is plenty to explore

We want to take you, Cholly, when we go
(You wanna take me?)
We'd like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(Well, if you'd play me just a little bit more)
But if we play you just a little more
(Maybe I will)
We'd love to take you, Cholly, when we go

You know right about that time
I started to analyze what they were trying to tell me
They said, "Come on, Cholly, we want to take you somewhere"
I didn't know where they was trying to take me
Next thing I know they were saying something like this

Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll
Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll
Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll
Funk gettin' ready to go
Funk gettin' ready to roll
I would dance, I would sing, I would get lost in my dreams
I would fly, but never too high, cause my funk deserted me
Now that the door is open wide, and all my funk just can't hide
With the syndrome left behind, no, my funk just can't hide

We like to take you, Cholly, when we go
We like to take you, Cholly, when we roll
(They promise they would play it one more time)
We'd like to take you, Cholly, when we go
(You know it was in my head, it was in my feet)
