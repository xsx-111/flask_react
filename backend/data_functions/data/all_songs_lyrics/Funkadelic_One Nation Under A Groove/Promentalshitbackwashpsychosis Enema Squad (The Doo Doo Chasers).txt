Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad (The Doo Doo Chasers) LyricsThe world is a toll-free toilet
Our mouths neurological assholes
And psychologically speaking
We're in a state of mental diarrhea
Talking shit a mile a minute
Or in a state of constipated notions
Can't think of nothin' but shit
And in this world of
Stinky futures, shitty memories and
Constipated 19 now-nows
Emerges from the hiney of your head
The doo doo chasers
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad
The prune juice of the mind
The doo doo chasers
Friends of roto-rooter
Bringing you music to get your shit together by
The man in the tidy bowl of your brain
(What was that long word again-Promental?)
Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad
A musical bowel movement
Designed to rid you of moral diarrhea
Social bullshit
Crazy doo doo
Mental poots
(What was that again?)
They call us the unflushables
One swipe a clean wipe
(Go flush it, fellas)
And what causes all of this shit?
What is the source of food for thought?
Ego-munchin'
Religious doggie bags
A My burger with I sauce on it
A Me burger with I sauce on it
A myself sandwich
A personal burger
A me Hamburger
And a glass of constricted cola
Out to lunch with lunch meat
The fear of being eaten by the sandwich
The Promentalshitbackwashpsychosis Enema Squad
The doo doo chasers
Friends of roto-rooter
Music to clean your shit by
Low calorie logic
Muscle brains
Skinny brains
Count the calories of your thoughts
Funk, Confucius say
Like Chinese laxatives
Sweet and sour bowel movements
And in this world of stinking memories
Stankin memories
Shitty futures
19 now nows-constipated-like
Emerges the Doo Doo Chasers
The prune juice of the mind
The man in the tidy bowl of your brain
Bringing you music to get your shit together by
Funk, the P-Preparation
The prune juice of the mind
A mental, musical bowel movement
Groove-lax
One swipe, clean wipe
And with no extra charge
A psychological turd remover
A neurological enema
Holy Shit
(let me try one-crap)
Coprolites
Prehistoric doo doo
Helping you get your shit together
Backstage at a Funkadelic rehearsal
We bring you the Doo Doo Chasers
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Out to lunch with lunch meat, once again
The fear of being eaten by a sandwich
Lunchville
Where lunch is a nice time of day
At least twice a week
And fried Ice Cream is a reality
(Which one is George Clinton?)
Fried Ice Cream is a reality
Guess who's coming to lunch
I'm not gonna pay for this lunch, man!
Fried Ice Cream is a reality!
Fried Ice Cream is a reality!
Fried Ice Cream is a reality!1Embed
