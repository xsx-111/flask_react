Into You Lyrics
Into you now
Into you now
Into you now
Into you, my people

I can't get into the neutron bomb
I can't get into something that will do me some harm
I can't get into a drug addict principle
I can't get into something that would close the door
If it's right, it's all right for you now
And if it's right, it's all right for me now
Any night you'll be uptight until you find
That the wrong and the right are within your mind
×2

I can't get into the poisoned land
I can't get into something I don't understand
I can't into a bad romance
I can't get into a love that ends in a chance
×2
