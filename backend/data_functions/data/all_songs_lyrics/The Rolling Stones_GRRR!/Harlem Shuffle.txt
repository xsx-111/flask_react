Harlem Shuffle Lyrics
You move it to the left
Yeah, and you go for yourself
You move it to the right
Yeah, if it takes all night
Now take it kinda slow
With a whole lot of soul
Don't move it too fast
Just make it last
You scratch just like a monkey
Yeah, you do real cool
You slide it to the limbo
Yeah, how low can you go?
Now come on, baby (Oh, come over here)
Don't fall down on me now
Just move it right here, do the Harlem shuffle

Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle

Oh, oh-oh

Hitch, hitchhike, baby across the floor
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I can't stand it no more
Now come on, baby (Come on, baby)
Now get into your slide
Oh, just ride, ride, ride, little pony, ride

Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Do the monkey shine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shake ya tail feather, baby
(Shake shake, shake shake)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, shake ya tail feather, baby (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Yeah, like your mother told you how
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do the Harlem shuffleEmbed
