One More Shot Lyrics
Ooh, baby, I got a message for you
You got me doing something
I thought I never will do

Give me one more, one more shot
And it's all I got
Give you one more shot
And take me back
I'm all yours, Jack

Yeah, you got me freaking
Yeah, I'm over heating
Just when things are sweet
You kick me on the street

Give me one more, one more shot
Yeah, and it's all I got
And doing up on me (One more shot)

I'll make your play
Yeah, make my day
Put me in correction for my own protection
In your jurisdiction, spare the crucifixion
Give me one more shot
Babe, it's all I got
Baby, don't freeze up on me, uh (One more shot)

I love, I love, I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love
I love, I love, I love, I love
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na

(One more shot)
Give me one, give me one more shot
Yeah, and it's all I got
Just one more
(One more shot)
Give me one, give me one more, one
Give me one more shot
Yeah, babe
Give me one more shot
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Give me one more shotEmbed
