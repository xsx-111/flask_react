Streets of Love Lyrics
You're awful bright, you're awful smart
I must admit you broke my heart
The awful truth is really sad
I must admit, I was awful bad
While lovers laugh and music plays
I stumble by and I hide my pain
Mmm, the lamps are lit, the moon is gone
I think I've crossed the Rubicon

And I, I
Walk the streets of love
And they're full of tears
And I, I
Walk the streets of love
And they're full of fears

While music pumps from passing cars
A couple watch me from a bar
A band just played the wedding march
And the corner store mends broken hearts
And a woman asks me for a dance
Oh, it's free of charge, just one more chance
Oh, but I, I
Walk the streets of love
And they're full of tears
And I, I
Walk the streets of love
For a thousand years

Oh, tell me now
Well, I, ayy
I walk the streets of love
Yeah, and they're drenched with tears, oh

You had the moves, you had the cards
I must admit you were awful smart
The awful truth is awful sad
I must admit I was awful bad

And I, I walk the streets of love
And they're drenched with tears
And I, I walk the streets of love
For a thousand years, oh
I, I walk the streets of love
And they're drenched with tears, oh
I, I
Oh, there's only one that love could hear my, oh
I, I
Yeah, and they're full of tears
Oh, everybody be talking 'bout it (I, I)
Oh, everybody be walking by
And I, yeah, but I felt that, I, oh, yes, that I
Oh, yes, I could (I, I)
Oh, that's deep, deep love
Yeah, they're drenched, they're drenched in tears
And I (I, I)
Oh, yeah, come on, give it to me now3Embed
