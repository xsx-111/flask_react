Mixed Emotions Lyrics
Button your lip, baby, button your coat
Let's go out dancing, go for the throat
Let's bury the hatchet, wipe out the past
Make love together, stay on the path

You're not the only one with mixed emotions
You're not the only ship adrift on this ocean

This coming and going is driving me nuts
This to-ing and fro-ing is hurting my guts
So get off the fence now, you're creasing your butt
Life is a party, let's get out and strut, yeah

You're not the only one with mixed emotions
You're not the only ship adrift on this ocean
You're not the only one that's feeling lonesome
You're not the only one with mixed emotions

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
Let's grab the world by the scruff of the neck
And drink it down deeply and love it to death
So button your lip, baby, button your coat
Let's go out dancing, let's rock and roll

You're not the only one with mixed emotions
You're not the only ship adrift on this ocean
You're not the only one that's feeling lonesome
You're not the only one with mixed emotions
Mixed emotions

You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only one
You're not the only oneEmbed
