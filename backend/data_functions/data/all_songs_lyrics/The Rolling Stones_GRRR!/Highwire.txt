Highwire Lyrics
We sell them missiles, we sell them tanks
We give them credit, you can call up the bank
It's just a business, you can pay us in crude
You'll love these toys, just go play out your feuds
We got no pride, don't know whose boots to lick
We act so greedy, make me sick sick sick

So get up, stand up, out of my way
I want to talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay?
I want to talk to the man right away

We walk the highwire
Sending the men to the front-line
And hoping they don't catch the hell-fire
Of hot guns and cold, cold knives
We walk the highwire
Sending the men to the front lines
And tell them to hotbed the sunshine
With hot guns and cold, cold knives

Our lives are threatened, our jobs at risk
Sometimes dictators need a slap on the wrist
Another Munich we just can't afford
We're going to send in the 82nd Airborne
Get up, stand up, who's gonna pay?
I want to talk to the boss right away
Get up, stand up, out of my way
I want to talk to the man right away

We walk the highwire
Putting the world out on a deadline
We're hoping we don't taste the shell-fire
Of hot guns and cold, cold knives
We walk the highwire
Putting the world out on a deadline
Catching the fight on primetime
With hot guns and cold, cold knives


Get up! Stand up!
Get up! Stand up!
Hey!

We walk the highwire
Sending the men to the front line
And hoping that we backed the right side
With hot guns and cold, cold knives
We walk the highwire
Sending men to the front line
And hoping they don't catch the hell-fire
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold, cold, cold knives

Oh yeah
We walk the highwire
We walk the highwire
Oh yeah
With hot guns and cold, cold, cold knives
Oh yeah1Embed
