Somewhere Lyrics
I wish to wish, I dream to dream
I try to try and I live to live
And I die to die and I cry to cry
But I know why

I wish to wish
And I dream to dream
I try to try
And I live to live
But I die to die
And I cry to cry

Somewhere in my dreams
Of those who should
Still, the willow weeps
On roses for the dead
In laughs of love

From the likes of her
To the time of me
Like the moon to earth
And the sky to sea
Only we're no longer
Allowed to be, to be
Somewhere in my dreams
Things that should
Live in all the keeps
Echo all the worlds
In laughs of love

For times that pass my life
I'll search for the sky
That she wanders by

Somewhere in the dreams
That the skies hold
Still, the willow weeps
On roses for her bed
In laughs of love
Somewhere in the dreams
That the skies hold
Still, the willow weeps
On roses for her bed
In laughs of love
