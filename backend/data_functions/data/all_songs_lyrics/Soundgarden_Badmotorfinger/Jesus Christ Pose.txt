Jesus Christ Pose Lyrics
And you stare at me
In your Jesus Christ pose
Arms held out
Like you've been carrying a load
And you swear to me
You don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me

Like I, like I need to be saved, saved
Like I need to be saved, saved

In your Jesus Christ pose
In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the lord
And I swear to you
That I'd never feed you pain
But you're staring at me
Like I'm, like I'm driving the nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails, nails
Like I'm driving the nails (Nails)
Nails (Nails), nails (Nails)
Like I'm driving the nails (nails), nails

In your Jesus Christ pose
In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
It's the coming of the lord
Would it pain you more to walk on water
Than to wear a crown of thorns
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Than to bury you poor
Poor (in your Jesus Christ pose)
Poor (in your Jesus Christ pose)4Embed
