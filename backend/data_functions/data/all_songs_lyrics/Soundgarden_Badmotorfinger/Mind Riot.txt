Mind Riot Lyrics
I was slipping through the cracks of stolen jewel
I was tightrope walking in two-ton shoes
Now somebody's talking of third world war
(I've been caught in a mind riot)
And the police said, "This is normal control"
(I've been caught in a mind riot)

The candle was burning yesterday
Somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot
(Mind riot)

I was crying from my eye teeth and bleeding from my soul
And I sharpened my wits on a dead man's skull
I built an elevator from his bones
(I've been caught in a mind riot)
Had to climb to the top floor to stamp out the coals
(I've been caught in a mind riot)

The candle was burning yesterday
Somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot
I'm tied within
The candle was burning yesterday
Somebody's best friend died
I've been caught in a mind riot

I'm tied within
I'm luck's last match struck
In the pouring down wind
Pouring down wind
Mind riot
Mind riot
Mind riot
