Face Pollution Lyrics
Woooh!

And I can count it on my fingers
I have all my reasons not to feel
I'm numb as rigor mortis
Scared by monkey faces
Drowned in shark fins

But I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you

Now I'm in the mirror
Now it's getting clear
I fear that I'm in you
Now I'm into plastics
Now I've made a mask
It looks like fish heads

But I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you
I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling
I don't feel like feeling
Feeling like you
Wooh!

Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution
Face pollution, yeah!

Feel, feel
Feel, feel
Feel, feel
Feel, feel
