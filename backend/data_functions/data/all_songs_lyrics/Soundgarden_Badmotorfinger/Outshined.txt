Outshined Lyrics
I got up feeling so down
I got off being sold out
I've kept the movie rolling
But the story's getting old now
Oh yeah
Well, I just looked in the mirror
And things aren't looking so good
I'm looking California
And feeling Minnesota
Oh yeah

(So now you know) Who gets mystified
(So now you know) Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'Till I'm up on my feet again
Hey, I'm feeling, I'm feeling outshined
Outshined, outshined, outshined

Oh, yeah
Mmmhh, eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Someone let the dogs out
They'll show you where the truth is
The grass is always greener
Where the dogs are shitting
Oh yeah
Well, I'm feeling that I'm sober
Even though I'm drinking
But I can't get any lower
Still I feel I'm sinking

(So now you know) Who gets mystified
(So now you know) Who gets mystified

Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
'Till I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling, I'm feeling outshined
Outshined, outshined, outshined

Mmm
Oh yeah
Mmm
Outshined
Oh, oh, oh
(So now you know) Who gets mystified
Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
Yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
Show me the power child, I'd like to say
That I'm down on my knees today
And yeah, it gives me the butterflies, gives me away
Till I'm up on my feet again
I'm feeling, I'm feeling outshined
Outshined, outshined, outshined4Embed
