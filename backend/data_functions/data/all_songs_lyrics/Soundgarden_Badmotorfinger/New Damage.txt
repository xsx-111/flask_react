New Damage Lyrics
When new damage comes
It's a faceless poison
A new world order
It's new damage done

The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
Get out

When new damage comes
It's a new word for plague
A new world order
A new word for hate

The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
Get out, yeah
Before you drown
Get out
Get out
Oh yeah


When new damage comes
It's a new word for plague, yeah
A new world order
A new word for hate

The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown
The wreck is going down
Get out before you drown

Get out, get out
Get out, before you
Drown
Before you drown
Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out, get out
Get out, oh yeah
Get out before you drown
Get out
Get out
Before you drown, before you drown
Before, before you drown2Embed
