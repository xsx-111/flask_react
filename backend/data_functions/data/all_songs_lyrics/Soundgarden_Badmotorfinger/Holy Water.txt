Holy Water Lyrics
Holy water on the brain and I'm losing sleep
Holy Bible on the nightstand next to me
As I'm raped by another monkey circus freak
Trying to take my indignance away from me

Yeah, holy water's rusting me
Yeah, holy water's rusting me
It's rusting me
Rusting me

Bloody murder is the best I've heard her scream
Holy devil in the flesh some might believe
And they take thine majesty so seriously
'Cause it's the big lies more likely to be believed
Believed

Yeah, holy water's rusting me
Yeah, holy water's rusting me
It's rusting me
Rusting me

Damn the water, if it's life you want to drink
Mind your mother, if it makes you feel at ease
As you're raped by another monkey circus freak
'Cause it's the big lies more likely to be believed
Believed
Yeah, holy water's rusting me
Yeah, holy water's rusting me
Yeah, holy water's rusting me
It's rusting me
Rusting me

Rusting me
Rusting me, yeah
