Slaves & Bulldozers Lyrics
Every word I said is what I mean
Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need

Virgin eyes and dirty looks on
What I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking
Now I know why you've been shaking

So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said, “What's in it for me?
What's in it for me?”

Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel
Buying lies and stealing jokes and
Laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken

So bleed your heart out
There's no more rides for free
Bleed your heart out
I said, “What's in it for me?
What’s in it for me?
What’s in it for...
What’s in it for...

Every word I said is what I mean
Everything I gave is what I need
Everything I've held is what I've freed
Everything I've shown is what I feel

Virgin eyes and dirty looks on
What I have and why I took
Counting all the hands I shook
Now I know why you've been shaking
Buying lies and stealing jokes and
Laughing every time I choke
Biding all the time you took
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken
Now I know why you've been taken3Embed
