Down in a Hole Lyrics
Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom

Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart, I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now, a man who won't let himself be

Down in a hole, feelin' so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied
Bury me softly in this womb
Oh, I wanna be inside of you
I give this part of me for you
Oh, I wanna be inside of you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Oh, I wanna be inside of you
Holding rare flowers in a tomb, in bloom
Oh, I wanna be inside

Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
Down in a hole, feeling so small
Down in a hole, out of control
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied34Embed
