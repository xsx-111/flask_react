Sickman Lyrics
What the hell am I, thousand eyes, a fly?
Lucky then I'd be in one day deceased
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear

What's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine

What the hell am I, leper from inside?
Inside wall of peace, dirty and diseased
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear

What's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine
Can you see the end?
Choke on me, my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

"Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert
I tread on a plane of many
We who are of good nature and intention
But cannot touch on the dark
Recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk
With me, feel the pain
And release it"


What the hell am I, worn eroded pride?
Saddened 10 miles wide, I'm gon' let it slide
Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear
What's the difference, I'll die
In this sick world of mine7Embed
