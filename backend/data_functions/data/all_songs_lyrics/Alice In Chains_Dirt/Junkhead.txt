Junkhead Lyrics
"Junk, fuck"
Yeah, yeah

A good night, the best in a long time
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite
Nothing better than a dealer who's high
Be high, convince them to buy, yeah

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot

Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm
Running their boring drills
But we are an elite race of our own
The stoners, junkies, and freaks
Are you happy? I am, man
Content and fully aware, yeah
Money, status, nothing to me
'Cause your life's empty and bare, yeah
What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
I don't go broke
And I do it a lot
I do it a lot, yeah


Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

You can't understand a user's mind
But try, with your books and degrees
If you let yourself go and open your mind
I'll bet you'd be doing like me
And it ain't so bad

What's my drug of choice?
Well, what have you got?
See, I don't go broke
(And I do it a lot) Say I do it a lot
I do it a lot
I do it a lot
Said I do it a lot12Embed
