Them Bones Lyrics
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

I believe them bones are me
Some say we're born into the grave

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones

Ah! Ah! Ah!

Dust rise right on over my time
Empty fossil of the new scene

I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones


Toll due, bad dream come true
I lie dead gone under red sky
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them
I feel so alone
Gonna end up a big ol' pile of them bones27Embed
