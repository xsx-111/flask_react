Predormitum (Prologue) Lyrics
I had a funny dream the other night
I was floating in a cloud

I am floating happy not knowing nautical course
Tie a wristwatch in slipknots and dock at my porch
Time is of no essence, the presence becomes presents
Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance
Current currencies worthless, fodder for feeding purses
With iron clad words I solder together verses
I’m trippin like I’m eatin’ the fungi
Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye

Listen
There's no light, just never ending night
And the weather's like a hurricane when land is in its sight
The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
And I'm trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
From the motions of the sea, to the color of the dark
This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
I wonder as I wander through my heart

Cus it starts a dream defferred
A clipped wing on a white dove
Seems absurd, a smudge on a white glove
Not seen nor heard like screams from the night's lungs
Cling to words so much that you won't budge
Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
Thats what the night does
It hits your mind with the right stuff
To keep you blind with a slight buzz
The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
We scuffle through it's pieces, strugglin for peace it's
Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
The image in my mirror’s gettin harder to relate
I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
But I couldn't be farther from my faith, or my face
Through this waste of my mind, may I find direction
I'm a waste of my time if I don't find it's lessons

So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
As the world twirls on the tip of our index
Staring into space one’s vision is endless

But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is

So just close pupils and be pupils and listen

The headset’s your desk the test is what’s missin

Disect these notes of quotes of keys writtenEmbed
