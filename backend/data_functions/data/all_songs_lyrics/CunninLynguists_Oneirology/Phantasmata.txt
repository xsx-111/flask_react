Phantasmata Lyrics
Into the nightmare
Surrounded with evil
I take flight
Devils they take me
Into it for days away

I see visions of creatures
Crawl through the lonesome
So I might fall
I tried to turn anyway
And gaze at the beauty
I had known
The sun went down
He's lost the crown


"...and since much of our basic desires
Involve those things which are taboo
Or modified by moral precepts
Especially sexual desires and desires
To commit hostile and violent acts
We find that these things are not
Allowed to appear directly in our dreams
Instead they are modified by regrouping
Substitution, displacement, and other
Devices that disguise them..."1Embed
