Embers Lyrics
Imagine the burning embers
They glow below and above
Your sins you won’t remember
And all you’ll find there is love

I’m cloaked in smoke but feel no flames
Folks float around me but I see no wings
No halos or hounds, pitchforks or gates
Or omnipotent voice that picks course or fate
To the life of indecision build a dreamscape prison
Where light isn’t manufactured but captured inside a prism
In a state between asleep and awake
Feels closest to hypnosis where the infinite wait
Then the fog dissipates revealing crimson fields
Crept on by a fawn with flaming heels
Eyes red as stop signs and a mane of quills
As it gaze past hills of diamond trees
I see a silhouette rest upon golden knees
For the body of a goddess and a face of dreams
A half-naked Meagan Good in a pagan hood
Kiss me on the cheek, we didn’t speak but I understood
It wasn’t Heaven that I was seeking but a haven I sought
A canvas of the mind painted with my thoughts

Everything ain’t what it seems
I wake up to find I’m inside of a dream inside of a dream
See buried deep beside the seams of my screams
Of beings and otherworldly things rarely seen
Might be psychosis or maybe I chose this
The night approaches every time the eye closes
I see a burning bush, feel like I’m Moses
Burn so much kush I feel like amosis
All my images are morgues and wounds
And every fork in the road moves through Freud and Jung
In the darkness no orchard blooms
A state so dark, sparks from the torch is consumed
It’s like I live in a fortress of doom
In the forest where the blood pores were forced from my wounds
My body aches from this lobotomy, a part of me shakes
Open my eyes, I’m awake, awake

Ashes are burning brightly
The smoke can be seen from afar
So now you’re seeing how far
Ashes are burning the wayEmbed
