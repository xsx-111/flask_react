Looking Back Lyrics
You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
Part of my shine comes from the distance
You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
Is this business emotionally invested?
Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
Love is war, sex is a weapon
The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'
Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene
To make x-rated into nc-17
Then see everything she got she not shy
Our love below so dro we most high
Then wears off when what we wear's on
Again I turn away when what we share's gone
So...

If this is not the hardest part
I wanna part
Before it gets too deep
If passion dies within routine
I'll come clean
Leave me be, baby
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Looking back

Under the twilight, and we living the Miller Highlife
La Petite Mort, my lady we bout to die twice
I won't' surrender and you won't surrender yurn
Whatever happens after this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
We wired for desire, dangers to ourselves
Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
My muse, sleeps deep within time
I go to her for credit though I need to decline
It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
I'm sorry it's just the way we designed
My dear we should leave here, I'm talking bout one at a time though
Cause you got me changin' my mind slow
Leave here, says that voice in the back of my spine
As I awake and the moment rewinds

Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared
