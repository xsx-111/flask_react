Stars Shine Brightest (In The Darkest Of Night) Lyrics
You can only see the stars when it’s Don Cheadle black
When the chips are down who dips and who reacts?
Folding under pressure ain’t get us to where we at
When all hope’s lost you battle to get it back
In fact, dark times are when heroes shine
Without them sour grapes there would be no wine
Let your ego dine, adversity for breakfast
Zero pride, in settling for less then
Fighting tooth and nail, no matter who prevails
Instead of wishing on a star grab a comet by the tail
Your ship ain’t coming in, then you got to make a sail
Catch the wind and make it sail and hit the ground runnin’
Til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin’
Those talking ‘bout failure ain’t talkin’ ‘bout nothin’
You may weather the storm if you don’t stop punchin’
Reach for the stars and you might just touch ‘em

Stars shine, stars shine
When you think you’ve lost your way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day
Stars shine, stars shine
Coming out to light the way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day
Our money’s funny, our change is strange
These days ain’t sunny and the sea ain’t tame
We playing games where the rules ain’t clearly defined
In this coffee black world, knee deep in the grind
Be a vine in the shade, a salmon in a stream
Try lookin’ for the stars when examining your dreams
Could go from street singers to pop figures
From block niggas to a brotha that is followin’ stock tickers
To grow in the night you gotta create light
Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight
No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam
And you don’t need a telescope to detect dream
You blessed with a mind that can see through space
On dark nights, in the stars you can find your face
Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the
Stars shine until you’re back into the, back into the light, light, light
Against all odds and against the grain
Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain
In monsoon proportions them moments of importance
When victory’s in vain it’s the same the blood coursing
Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment
Poised when them black clouds come ‘round don’t back down
Let haters be theme music playin’ in the background1Embed
