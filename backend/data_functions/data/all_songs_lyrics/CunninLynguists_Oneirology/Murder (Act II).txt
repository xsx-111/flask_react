Murder (Act II) Lyrics
What if I told you that the battle was on?
Would that rattle ya bones? or would you be down to kill in the name of the throne
Drop bombs on innocent people or innocent homes
With automatic weapons or military drones
While me and my friends play croquet
And make bets on which country liable to fold next
Under the pressure of my fingertips
Any day or any time
They just cattle
We don’t need they kind any how
Talking population control
Gotta make room for the young, so it’s out with the old
I got tanks that need usin’, I’m lettin’ em go
For the low and some c-4 charges that’s ready to blow
I got the ticket on sativa ‘cause my patnah the supplier
And all my homeys down to invest in my empire
Sink the economy with no natural evidence
They complain, but that’s a part of being president
If I could get away with murder
I’d take my gun and I’d commit it X 2

I could use worship as a warship, bible and sword
Turn men and women to minions over Heaven’s rewards
Promise Islamic bombers Heavens harem of whores
For taking out a couple of floors
The holiest wars bring profits/prophets and I don’t mean Moses
Unless he’s on the screen when the NASDAQ opens
Horatio Caine won’t be able to blame me
For the third party bodies that his followers slain
Ashes and burnt remains all left in the name
Of
Whoever you praise, I just made it a game
Called winners and sinners, but they one and the same
You can play along with us at home
We livin’ in Rome, destined to fall
Didn’t you hear? I ain’t worried about the views of the public and peers
Shit, Hitler was once Time mags' Man of the Year
I’ma get it with hope while I’m peddlin’ fear
I’m a wolf in a wool cap with robes to match
Leadin’ the flock right down the hatch
I’m the fox in the hen house, the Devil You Know
In a black Cadillac, wrist glistenin gold
On my way to eat steaks with TD Jakes
So if you wanna dine with Christ you gon’ need these tapes
And if you still don’t know how cold I am
Please turn to page three in ya church program4Embed
