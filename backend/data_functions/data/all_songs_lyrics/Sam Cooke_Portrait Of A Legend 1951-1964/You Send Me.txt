You Send Me Lyrics
Darling, you send me
I know you send me
Darling, you send me
Honest you do, honest you do
Honest you do, whoa-oh

You thrill me
I know you, you, you thrill me
Darling you, you, you, you thrill me
Honest you do

At first I thought it was infatuation
But woo, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home, whoa-oh

You, you, you, you send me
I know you send me
I know you send me
Honest you do

(You send me)
Whoa, whenever I'm with you
(You send me)
I know, I know, I know when I'm near you
(You send me)
Mhm, mhm, honest you do, honest you do
Whoa, I know
(You send me)
I know, I know, I know, when you hold me
(You send me)
Whoa-oh, whenever you kiss me
(You send me)
Mhm, mhm, honest you do
At first I thought it was infatuation
But woo, it's lasted so long
Now I find myself wanting
To marry you and take you home

I know, I know, I know, you send me
I know you send me
Whoa-oh, you, you, you, you send me
Honest you do (Do, do, do, do)Embed
