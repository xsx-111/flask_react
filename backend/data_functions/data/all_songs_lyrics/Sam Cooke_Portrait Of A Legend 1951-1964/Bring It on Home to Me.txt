Bring It on Home to Me Lyrics
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind

Baby (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself

Baby (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

I'll give you jewelry and money, too
That ain't all, that ain't all I'll do for you

Baby if you (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
You know I'll always be your slave
'Till I'm buried, buried in my grave

Oh honey (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)

One more thing, I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out, stayed out day and night

But I forgive you (Oh), bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)5Embed
