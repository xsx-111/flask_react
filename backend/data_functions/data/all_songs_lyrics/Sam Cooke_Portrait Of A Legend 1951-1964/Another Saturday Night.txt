Another Saturday Night Lyrics
Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

I got in town a month ago, I seen a lotta girls since then
If I could meet 'em I could get 'em but as yet I haven't met 'em
That's why I'm in the shape I'm in

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way

Another fella told me he had a sister who looked just fine
Instead of being my deliverance, she had a strange resemblance
To a cat named Frankenstein

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way
(Here it is another weekend and I ain't got nobody
Man if I was back home I'd be swinging
Two chicks on my arm
Aww yeah
Listen to me huh)

It's hard on a fella, when he don't know his way around
If I don't find me a honey to help me spend my money
I'm gonna have to blow this town

Another Saturday night and I ain't got nobody
I got some money cause I just got paid
How I wish I had someone to talk to
I'm in an awful way1Embed
