Having a Party Lyrics
We're having a party
Dancing to the music
Played by the DJ
On the radio
The Cokes are in the icebox
The popcorn's on the table
Me and my baby, we're out here on the floor

So mister, Mister DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby

Everybody's swinging
Sally's doing that twist now
If you take requests, I've
Got a few for you
Play that song called "Soul Twist"
Play that one called "I Know"
Don't forget the "Mashed Potatoes"
No other songs will do

Let me tell you, mister, Mister DJ
Keep those records playing
'Cause I'm having such a good time
Dancing with my baby
Having a party (Yeah)
Everybody's swinging (Oh, we're)
Dancing to the music (Yeah)
On the radio (Oh, we're)
Having a party (Man)
Everybody's swinging (Yeah)
We're dancing to the music (Yeah)
On the radio (Tell 'em one more time)
We're having a party (Yeah)
And everybody's swinging (Oh, we're)
Dancing to the music (Yeah)
On the radio (Tell you we're)
Having a party (Yeah)
Everybody's swingingEmbed
