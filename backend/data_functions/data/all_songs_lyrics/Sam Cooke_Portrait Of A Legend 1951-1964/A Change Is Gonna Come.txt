A Change Is Gonna Come Lyrics
I was born by the river
In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been runnin'
Ever since

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

It's been too hard livin'
But I'm afraid to die
'Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep tellin' me "don't hang around"
It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will

Then I go to my brother
And I say, "Brother, help me please"
But he winds up
Knockin' me
Back down on my knees
Lor', there been times that I thought
I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to
Carry on

It's been a long
A long time comin', but I know
A change gon' come
Oh, yes it will51Embed
