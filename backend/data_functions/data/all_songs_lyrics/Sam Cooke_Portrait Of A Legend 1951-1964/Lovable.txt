Lovable Lyrics
Lovable
My girl
She's lovable
She's lovable
My, my girl
She's so lovable, mmm, mmm

Candy's sweet
And honey too
There's not another quite, quite as sweet as you
I know, I know, I know, I know I've always loved you
You're so lovable (She's so lovable)

Whoa-oh, and oh, I know, she's so (Lovable)
Yes she is, I know
I know, I know, I know she's lovable (Lovable)
Oh yes she is (Lovable, lovable)
I know she's lovable, my, my, my, my girl is lovable (Lovable, lovable)
Yes she is (Lovable, lovable)

Whoa, love and fascination
Is her middle name
To my heart a sensational feel she reigns
Whoa, whoa
I know, I know she's lovable (She's so lovable)
Whoa-oh, and oh, I know, she's so (Lovable)
Yes, she is, I know (Lovable)
I know, I know, I know she's lovable (Lovable)
Oh yes, she is (Lovable, lovable)
I know she's lovable, lovable, lovable, lovable (Lovable)
And I know she's lovable (Lovable)
Oh yes she is (Lovable, lovable)

Whoa, she's just an angel
A sweet little angel to me
When I'm without her I know, I know, I know I'm in misery
Whoa-oh, I love my girl
She's so (She's so lovable) lovable, whoa-ohEmbed
