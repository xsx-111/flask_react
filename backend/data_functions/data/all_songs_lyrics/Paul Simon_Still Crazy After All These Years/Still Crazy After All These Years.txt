Still Crazy After All These Years Lyrics
I met my old lover on the street last night
She seemed so glad to see me, I just smiled
And we talked about some old times
And we drank ourselves some beers

Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy after all these years

I’m not the kind of man who tends to socialize
I seem to lean on old familiar ways
And I ain’t no fool for love songs
That whisper in my ears

Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy after all these years

Four in the morning
Crapped out, yawning
Longing my life away
I’ll never worry
Why should I?
It’s all gonna fade
Now I sit by my window, and I watch the cars
I fear I’ll do some damage one fine day
But I would not be convicted
By a jury of my peers

Still crazy after all these years
Oh, still crazy
Still crazy
Still crazy after all these years4Embed
