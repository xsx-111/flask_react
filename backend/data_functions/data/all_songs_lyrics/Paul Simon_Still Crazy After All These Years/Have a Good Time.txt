Have a Good Time LyricsYesterday it was my birthday
I hung one more year on the line
I should be depressed, my life's a mess
But I'm having a good time
I've been loving and loving and loving
I'm exhausted from loving so well
I should go to bed but a voice in my head
Says "Ah, what the hell"

Have a good time (Good time, baby)
Have a good time (Good time, child)
Have a good time (Have a good time, baby)
Have a good time (Have a good time)
Paranoia strikes deep in the heartland
But I think it's all overdone
Exaggerating this, exaggerating that
They don't have no fun
I don't believe what I read in the papers
They're just out to capture my dime
I ain't worrying and I ain't scurrying
I'm having a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Have a good time
Maybe I'm laughing my way to disaster
Maybe my race has been run
Maybe I'm blind to the fate of mankind
But what can be done?
So God bless the goods we was given
And God bless the U.S. of A
And God bless our standard of living
Let's keep it that way

Have a good time (Good time, baby)
Have a good time (Good time, child)
Have a good time (Have a good time, baby)
Have a good time (Have a good time)Embed
