I Do It for Your Love Lyrics
We were married on a rainy day
The sky was yellow, and the grass was gray
We signed the papers, and we drove away
I do it for your love

The rooms were musty, and the pipes were old
All that winter, we shared a cold
Drank all the orange juice that we could hold
I do it for your love

Found a rug in an old junk shop
And I brought it home to you
Along the way, the colors ran
The orange bled the blue


Found a rug in an old junk shop
And I brought it home to you
Along the way, the colors ran
The orange bled the blue
The sting of reason
The splash of tears
The northern and the southern hemispheres
Love emerges, and it disappears
I do it for your love
I do it for your loveEmbed
