I Live off You Lyrics
I live off you
And you live off me
And the whole world
Lives off of everybody

See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody

The cat eats the rat
While the pimp beats the whore
As she just screams out
For more and more

See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
La la la

I live off you
And you live off me
And the whole world
Lives off of everybody
See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
La la laEmbed
