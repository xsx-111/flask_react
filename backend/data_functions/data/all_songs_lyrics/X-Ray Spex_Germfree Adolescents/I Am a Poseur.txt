I Am a Poseur Lyrics
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare

Exhibition is the name
Voyeurism is the game
Stereoscopic is the show
Viewing time makes it grow
(Grow, grow, grow, gro-ow)

I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare

My fa√ßade is just a fake
Shock horror no escape
Sensationalism for the feed
Caricatures are what you breed (Breed, breed, breed, bree-eed)

I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare

Anti-art was the start
Establishments like a laugh
Yes we're very entertaining
Overtones can be betraying
('traying, 'traying, 'traying, 'tray-ing)

I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare

I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare1Embed
