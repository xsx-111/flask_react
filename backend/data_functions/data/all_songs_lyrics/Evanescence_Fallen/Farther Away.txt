Farther Away Lyrics
I took their smiles and I made them mine
I sold my soul just to hide the light
And now I see what I really am
A thief, a whore, and a liar

I run to you
(And run away from this town)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away

I'm numb to you - numb and deaf and blind
You give me all but the reason why
I reach but I feel only air at night
Not you, not love, just nothing

I run to you
(And run away from this town)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away
Tried to forget you
But without you I feel nothing
Don't leave me here, by myself
I can't breathe

I run to you
(And run away from this town)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away

I run to you
(And run away from this town)
Call out your name
(Giving up, giving in)
I see you there
(Still you are)
Farther away
Farther away
Farther away
Farther away
Farther away
