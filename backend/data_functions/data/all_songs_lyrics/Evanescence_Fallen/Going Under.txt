Going Under Lyrics
Now I will tell you what I've done for you
Fifty thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me (Going under)

Don't want your hand this time, I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (Wake up for once)
Not tormented, daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom

I'm dying again

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under

Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
(So I don't know what's real)
So I don't know what's real and what's not
(Don't know what's real and what's not)
Always confusing the thoughts in my head (Oh)
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm

So go on and scream
Scream at me, I'm so far away (So far away)
I won't be broken again (Again)
I've got to breathe, I can't keep going under


I'm dying again

I'm going under (Going under)
Drowning in you (Drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (Falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm
Going under (Going under)
I'm going under (Drowning in you)
I'm going under30Embed
