Neal and Jack and Me Lyrics
I'm wheels, I am moving wheels
I am a 1952 Studebaker coupe
I'm wheels, I am moving wheels, moving wheels
I am a 1952 Starlite coupe

En route
Les Souterrains
Des visions du Cody
Sartori a Paris

Strange spaghetti in this solemn city
There's a postcard we're all seen before
Past wild-haired teens in dark clothing
With hands-full of autographed napkins
We eat apples in vans with sandwiches
Rush into the lobby life
Of hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait
Hurry up and wait
For all the odd-shaped keys
Which lead to new soap and envelopes
New soap and envelopes

Hotel room homesickness on a fresh blue bed
And the longest-ever phone call home
No sleep no sleep no sleep no sleep no sleep
And no mad video machine to eat time
A city scene I can't explain
The Seine alone at 4am
The Seine alone at 4am
The insane alone at 4am
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers, absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers, absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers, absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers, absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers, absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers, absent lovers, absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent lovers
Neal and Jack and me
Absent loversEmbed
