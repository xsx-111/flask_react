Heartbeat Lyrics
I need to feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
So close, it feels like mine
All mine
I need to feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
So close it feels like mine
All mine

I remember the feeling
My hands in your hair
Hands in your hair
I remember the feeling
Of the rhythm we made
The rhythm we made

I need to land sometime
Feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Right next to me
Right next to me

I need to feel your heartbeat
So close, it feels like mine
All mine
I need to feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
So close it feels like mine
All mine
I remember the feeling
My hands in your hair
I remember the feeling
Of the rhythm we made

I need to land sometime
Feel your heartbeat
Right next to me
Right next to me


Oh, I remember a feeling
My hands in your hair
Hands in your hair
I remember the rhythm
Oh, rhythm we made
Rhythm we made

I need to land sometime
Right next to you
And feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Feel your heartbeat, heartbeat
Right next to me
Right next to me1Embed
