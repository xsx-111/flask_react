Firewater Lyrics
The fire in the sky
B'Ism'illahir'Rahmanir'Rahim, shahadats mustaqim
B'Ism'illahir'Rahmanir'Rahim, shahadats mustaqim
B'Ism'illahir'Rahmanir'Rahim, shahadats mustaqim
B'Ism'illahir'Rahmanir'Rahim, shahadats mustaqim
The fire in the sky

If you think we're alright
If you're breathing in the water
We're all sinking in the flesh
We're all covered in the father
Do you ask yourself "Where am I now?"
When I'm six feet down
Through the pre-shifted ground
Did the vine we climb carry us throughEmbed
