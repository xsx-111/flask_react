Solar Plexus LyricsI am breathing in dirt
God, I need some sleep
Now I bleed life out of you
Can't sit still and here I am
I am
I, I, burn, burn
I, I, burn, burn
I wish I get more
Money for more
I wish I get more
Money for more
Grieving now for your love
Baggage at the door
Put your hand inside
I, I, burn, burn
I, I, burn, burn
You are a bitch
You suck shit
Fucking suck
Hope you're in luck
Fucking luck
I, I, burn, burn
I, I, burn, bur-
Baby  sweet eyes
Missed her look in mine so bright
Shocking things that stay with you
Spinning my mill
Maybe then it's safe
Black as rage and 
Counting seconds in silence
Time is waiting to leave my headEmbed
