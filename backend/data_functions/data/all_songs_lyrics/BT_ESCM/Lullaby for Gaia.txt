Lullaby for Gaia Lyrics
If it's in space and all is lost
A million shattered pieces
Then let it be
I'll tell you tales you won't believe
I'll tell you anyway
I'll be released
I'll be released

Blissful bubbles
Let me sleep
Rock me gently
Don't let me think
Blissful bubbles
Let me sleep
Rock me gently
Don't let me think
Too deep
Too deep
Too deep

Don't listen to the hearts of the world
The answer lies within
You know the truth
An instrument you can become
Play real loud for me/you
Your future's just begun
Your future's just begun
Blissful bubbles
Let me sleep
Rock me gently
Don't let me think
Blissful bubbles
Let me sleep
Rock me gently
Don't let me think
Too deep
Too deep

I'll tell you tales you won't believe
I'll tell you anyway
I'll be released
Don't listen to the hearts of the world
Answer lies within
You know the truth
You know the truth

Blissful bubbles
Let me sleep
Rock me gently
Don't let me think
