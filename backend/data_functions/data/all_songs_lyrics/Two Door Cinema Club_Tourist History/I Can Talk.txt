I Can Talk Lyrics
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh (Hey, hey)
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh (Hey, hey)
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh (Hey, hey)
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh (Hey, hey)

You won't believe what I tell you
White coats and clever minds will choose
You get a lot from this, loose tongue and arrogance
It's not appropriate, don't think that this is it

Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off

A longer sentence brings no more
Than one that I had said before
It's hard to compromise when I see through your eyes
It's just a common view, I guess it's lost on you
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off


Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh
Ah-oh, ah-ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-ah-oh

Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off
Now I can talk, no one gets off
I know how you'd like to
Now I can talk, no one gets off13Embed
