Costume Party Lyrics
You're too young, you're never gonna know what hit me
When I fell down in silence
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now

You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know

You're too young, you're never gonna know what hit me
When I fell down in silence
No one thinks what I'm doing is the right way forward
You'll see it's not just a dream now

You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
It's what you get when you try to educate a black sheep
You can't, you won't, you never will
I'm gonna show you what it takes to see the future
It's hard but not impossible

You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't know
You think you know, you don't
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow
You think you know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow
Know-ow-ow-ow, know-ow-ow-ow

Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over
And I believe this costume party is over
Before it gets started
And I believe this costume party is over
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh2Embed
