Do You Want It All? Lyrics
We're low in our hearts, we're low in our heads
All in good time

Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?

We're low in our hearts, we're low in our heads
All in good time
All will take charge, we'll all take our chances
All in good time

Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it all?

All because you want to be
All because you want to be

All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be
All because you want to be1Embed
