Cigarettes In the Theatre Lyrics
It starts in the theatre, a night of encounters
If I hadn't been there, if not for a cigarette

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
We'll just keep talking on
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things

Difference in opinion was never an issue
Collect all your questions, 'cause this time we've all night

And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
We'll just keep talking on and on, oh, oh, oh
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things
Oh


And you could see it change
Look past the blinding light, look past the blinding light
We'll just keep talking on
Tell me your favourite things, tell me your favourite things7Embed
