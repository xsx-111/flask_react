Big Sur Lyrics
Highway One
Crystalline-haunted sun
With the Pacific masculine crash
My little one
Enthralled by the redwoods
As I write amongst monarchs and mist

Me and Anaïs and Henry and Jack Kerouac
Me and the Ohlone, the Esselen, the Salinan
Me and Julia, Helmuth and Brautigan
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur
Clear celestial and frogs
Fritz in cabins of logs
Amongst the springs we are barefoot and warmed
Me and Anaïs and Henry and Jack Kerouac
Me and the Ohlone, the Esselen, the Salinan
Me and Julia, Helmuth and Brautigan
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur

I am climbing on the Bluff
Beseeching god to answer us
Not much distracts from our shamanic creek breakfast
This watery heartbeat by the forest
Me and Anaïs and Henry and Jack Kerouac
Me and the Ohlone, the Esselen, the Salinan
Me and Julia, Helmuth and Brautigan
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur
Me and Mickey and a path high on the Molera
Me and Lolly and Bill watching a red-tailed hawk
Me and the posts take it all in through the big Ventana
All roads lead to Big Sur
All roads home to Big Sur3Embed
