Guru Lyrics
I started young
I was enthralled
By your agape
As a student
I kept going
Colour me captured
Disillusioned enough
Needed your guidance
And so I turned
Over to you
To lead me home
And then I said

Guru teacher
Guruji I bow to you
Humbled by your knowledgeable education
Guruji I bow to the divine in you
Please consider me your utmost humble student

And so I fell
Under your spell
I was enraptured
Your every word
I held onto
Til it was gospel
You weren't deterred
From your asserts
Weâ€™re identical
I will admit
I saw your face
Inside my face
Guru teacher
Guruji I bow to you
Humbled by your knowledgeable education
Guruji I bow to the divine in you
Please consider me your utmost humble student


You had enough of subservience, and so you stopped me
You saw my light seen as your light, gave it back to me
I eventually saw that your jewel was in my pocket
It had been there the whole time throughout my search
And I finally saw

Guru teacher
Guruji I bow to you
Humbled by your knowledgeable education
Guruji I bow to the divine in you
Please consider me your utmost humble student
Guru teacher
Guruji I bow to you
Humbled by your knowledgeable education
Guruji I bow to the divine in you
Please consider me your utmost humble student2Embed
