Empathy Lyrics
There are so many parts that I have hidden and denied and lost
There are so many ways that I have cut off my nose to spite my face
There are so many colors that I still try to hide while I paint
And there are so many tunes that I secretly sing as I wait

You come along and invite these parts out of hiding, oh
This invitation is the one that I've stopped fighting, oh

Thank you for seeing me
I feel so less lonely
Thank you for getting me
I'm healed by your empathy, oh
This intimacy, oh

There were so many times, I thought I'd die not being truly known
There've been so many moments: forever lonely in my vocation

You come along and celebrate each feeling, oh
And there you are all honor and inquiring, oh

Thank you for seeing me
I feel so less lonely
Thank you for getting me
I'm healed by your empathy, oh
This intimacy, oh
There was a day where the trust that was being asked of me
Required too much you see to accept your generosity
And to know myself enough to let you help me

Thank you for seeing me
I feel so less lonely
Thank you for getting me
I'm healed by your empathy, oh
This intimacy, oh2Embed
