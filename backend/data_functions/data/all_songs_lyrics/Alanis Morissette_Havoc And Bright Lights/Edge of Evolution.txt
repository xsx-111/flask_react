Edge of Evolution Lyrics
Here I leave my story, I leave it in the dust
Although this psychology's been entertaining enough
Herein lies the witness objective with my stuff
But we're ready to push envelopes into full-blown consciousness

So here we go out here on the edge of evolution
Numbers growing out here on the edge of evolution

I have had my glimpses with and without substances
I have had awakenings non-abiding for the most part

So here we go out here on the edge of evolution
Numbers growing out here on the edge of evolution

In this sacred duality
The highs and lows and the heres and there's
These aversions and these cravings
Push me beyond identity into pure awareness (we're already here)

So here we go out here on the edge of evolution
Numbers growing out here on the edge of evolution
So here we go out here on the edge of evolution
Numbers growing out here on the edge of evolution1Embed
