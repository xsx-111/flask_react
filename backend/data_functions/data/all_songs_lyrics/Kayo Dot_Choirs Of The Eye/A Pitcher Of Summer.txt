A Pitcher Of Summer LyricsOne morning, before the leaves began changing
I caught a piece of summer and poured it into a pitcher;
This I placed in the cellar on a shelf collecting dust
Autumn, then winter, rose up from the sea, and my
Garden was a garden filled with unbroken snow
No flower strained it's face to the ice giants' whisper
No life coloured the vision of a newborn Spring babe
My cellar-water dripping into a pail
And I lifted my piece of summer
Like a piece of a memory or a dream
Like these, caught on film
And carried it to the garden floes
The wind turning drifting stars to madness
Poured forth gracefully, this ctheric tincture
Lifts winter's coat-of-arms with coaxing aromas and electricity
Used with vigilance, a Pitcher of Summer stirs a memory into swooning
And bravely, the flowers of the past will stretch their limbs into the sky
While snow falls quietly all aroundEmbed
