Marathon LyricsAnd so ten centuries solemnly collide
Love failed and I have
Lost my Name
Secrecy hoards the treasure
Coveted most by me
As rainwater collects in barrels
Sleep covers Abuse with Time
Too many dream-haunted hours
Leaves me with seasons swelling and growing
And without welcome, fading
Something makes sense in ripples
Grief is the corpse from which worms feed
Alas, I am not this stricken man
Suspended by sunlight, shadows break
Their silent vigil
As rainwater collects in barrels
Lucifer rose up to kiss the analgesic dawn
While below, Something roll'd the stone away
Something makes sense in ripples
Gradually, I saw Abuse is a Name
And ghosts will seem forever
Less fantastic
Like a kiss, soft, and wild with the delicate steps of petals fallen in a stream
This swirling ballerina turns in faint and sighing grandeur
Across the floor to me
A monarch plays the violin to a summer's afternoon
Whilst quietly the earthworm adores the soil in winter's sparkling gloom
It breaks away, growing as the flowers do
A thunderhead embraces his enraptured lover
And kisses with a gale that also makes the cattails shudder
His tears cannot, as he proclaims his love, be held with lightning back;
They fondly dance into an open window
And fondly dance with mine
Our eyelashes weaken with a weight that is sweet and fine
And this feels like frogs and spiders in the sweet outside
Tell me why world, unfathomable and good
The beauty of everything is infinite and cruel
An airplane, a puppet, an orange, a spoon
A window, and outside
Stars and the moonEmbed
