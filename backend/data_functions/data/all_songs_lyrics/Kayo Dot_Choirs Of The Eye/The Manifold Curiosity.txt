The Manifold Curiosity LyricsIt never hurt this much before
And I feel I'm courting Saturn
The Twelve-Eyed Secret gazes through a prism
Staring into raindrops swirling slow
It lifts it's horrible heads
With lidless orbs of limitless vision
I dream with fluid movements in a lake
The ripples cast from skipping stones
We speak below a gushing mind
Crouching in a corner, hid behind a box
Full of Worms and stalking shadows
Magnetism draws me to a cone of space;
I sift still through hours of it's plasma
Biding time until the clocks collapse
Music shattered my spine on the steps outside;
I cannot move; my liquid breathing
Is sculpted with this binding gel
But come, my love, and rescue me
From failure
Cover me with an opium sheet
Embrace me with gossamer;
Kiss the moonstones from my eyes
And brush the cobwebs from my bones
It all sings beautifully;
With all your strength believe this
But I know you can't understand
Why I threw myself from the glass againEmbed
