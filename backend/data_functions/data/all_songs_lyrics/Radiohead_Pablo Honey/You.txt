You Lyrics
You are the sun and moon and stars are you
And I could never run away from you


You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?

It's like the world is gonna end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
Myâ€“


You, me and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see me drowning
Caught in the fire
You, me and everything
Caught in the fire
I can see me drowning
Caught in the fire15Embed
