Prove Yourself Lyrics
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray

I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I wanna breathe, I wanna grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg and pray

But I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
I'm better off dead, I'm better off dead
I'm better off...

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Why?
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
