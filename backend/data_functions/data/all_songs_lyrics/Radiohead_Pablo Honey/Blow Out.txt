Blow Out Lyrics
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone

I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out

And everything I touch
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(All wrapped up in cotton wool)
(All wrapped up and sugar-coated)
Turns to stone
