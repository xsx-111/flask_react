The Cardinal Sin LyricsSail to the stars
On your shining desires
"Reasons? There are none"
Cried the whisky laden brain
"When all is said and done
It amounts to just the same"
There in your starry eyes
Lie hopes that have been betrayed
The cause of your desire
Can also lead to your demise
When all is said and done
It will be you who pays the price
As countless fools
Are often loathe to testify
"It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our demise"
Sail to the stars
On your shining desires
Lucretia waits in vain
For the child of her dreams
Within her aching womb
There burns a funeral pyre
There in your starry eyes
Lie hopes that have been betrayed
The prize that you claim
Can never be yours to take
Like castles in Spain
Hope is all that will remain
Abstain from the fools paradise
It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our desire
 fools
Are often loathe to testify
"It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our demise"
Contemplate the world
And its traitors to the soul
The forces of derision
And its legions manifold
Usurpers of the crown
All pretenders to the throne
Your world is linked in chains
"All in one, one in all"
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
All in one, one in all
 fools
Are often loathe to testify
"It's an illusion of life
The whole cause of our demise"
It's an illusion of life
It's an illusion of life
It's an illusion of life
It's an illusion of life1Embed
