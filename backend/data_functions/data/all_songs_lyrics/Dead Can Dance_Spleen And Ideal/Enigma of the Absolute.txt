Enigma of the Absolute LyricsSaloman hung down her head
Laid bare her heart
For the world to see
She craved for intimacy
Through darkened doors
Her aspect veiled with indecision
Gazed out to sea
She craved lucidity
Cast adrift
Fom past relationships in her life
Hoisted up the ideal
This was her saving grace
Seas of rage that once assailed
Her concern for the truth
Had passed her by
And left her high and dry
In her saviour's arms
In her saviour's arms
In her saviour's arms
In her saviour's arms
Across the sea
Lies the fountain of renewal
Where you will see
The whole cause of your loneliness
Can be measured in dreams
That transcend all these lies
And I wish and I pray
That there may come a day
For a saviour's arms
For a saviour's arms
For a saviour's arms
For a saviour's arms2Embed
