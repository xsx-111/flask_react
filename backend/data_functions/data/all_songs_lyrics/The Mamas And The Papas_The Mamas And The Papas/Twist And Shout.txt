Twist And Shout LyricsShake it up, baby
Now twist and shout
Shake it, shake it up, baby
C'mon and work it on out
You know you move real good, girl
(Shake it up baby, now)
You know you move real fine
(Twist and shout)
C'mon and move a little closer
(Shake it up baby, now)
Show the world that you're mine
(Now work it on out)
You know you got me goin'
(You know you got me goin')
Like I knew you would
You really really got me goin', yeah
Just like I knew you could
(Like I knew you could)
C'mon, baby (C'mon baby)
Twist and shout (C'mon baby)
Shake it up baby
(C'mon and) work it on out
You know you move real good
You know you move real fine
C'mon and move a little closer, girl
And let 'em know you're mine
(Shake)
You know you got me goin' girl
Like I knew you would
You really got me goin' yeah
Like I knew you could
Like I knew you would
Shake it up, baby
Shake it, baby, c'mon
Move a little closerEmbed
