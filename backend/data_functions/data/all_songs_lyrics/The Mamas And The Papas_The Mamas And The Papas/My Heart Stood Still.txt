My Heart Stood Still LyricsI took one look at you;
That's all I meant to do
And then...and then my heart stood still
My feet could step and walk;
My lips could move and talk...and talk
And yet...and yet my heart stood still
Though not a single word was spoken
(Not a single word was spoken)
I could tell you knew you knew (yeah)
That unfelt clasp of hands
Told me so well, yeah...
I never lived at all until the thrill of that
Moment when my heart stood still, yeah---
And I never lived at all until the thrill
Of that moment when my heart stood still..Embed
