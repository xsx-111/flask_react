No Salt on Her Tail LyricsNot in my arms, but on my mind
Yes, on my mind, but not in my arms
Time passes by
And I watch her fly
Yes, I watch her fly
And time passes by
Though it's hard for me
I'm going to leave her free
'Cause that would be the best philosophy
Then she'll come to me
So I feel that to be real now
This little bird, she can fly away
No salt on her tail
No cage to make her stay
Though it's hard for me
I'm going to leave her free
'Cause that would be the best philosophy
She'll come to me
So I feel that to be real
This little bird, she can fly away
No salt on her tail
No, she can fly away...
(No cage to make her stay)
No cage to make her stay...
(No cage to make her stay)
This little bird can fly away...
(No cage to make her stay)
(No cage to make her stay)Embed
