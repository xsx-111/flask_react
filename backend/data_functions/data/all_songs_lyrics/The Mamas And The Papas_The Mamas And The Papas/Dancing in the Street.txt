Dancing in the Street LyricsCallin' out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat?
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancin' in the streets
They're dancin' in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
Up in New York City
All we need is music (Sweet music)
Sweet music (Sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (Oh, everywhere)
There'll be swingin', swayin', and records playin'
And dancin' in the street
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grab a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancin'
They're dancin' in the street
This is an invitation across the nation
A chance for the folks to meet
There'll be laughin' (And singin')
And music swingin'
And dancin' in the street
Philadelphia, PA (Philadelphia, PA)
Baltimore and D.C., now (Baltimore and D.C., now)
Yeah, don't forget the Motor City (Can't forget the Motor City)
All we need is music (Sweet music)
Sweet music (Sweet music)
There'll be music everywhere (Oh, everywhere)
There'll be swingin', swayin', and records playin'
And dancin' in the street, yeah
Oh, it doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on, every guy, grasp a girl
Everywhere around the world
There'll be dancin'
They dancin' in the street
Philadelphia, PA (Philadelphia, PA)
Baltimore and D.C., now (Baltimore and D.C., now)
Can't forget that Motor City (Can't forget the Motor City)
Ah, way down in L.A., California (Way down in L.A., California)
Not to mention Halifax, Nova Scotia (Not to mention, indeed)
And ** they do that **, ** you know (Yes, I know)
Manchester? (And, oh, Amherst, Amherst)
Alexandria? (Virginia, Virginia)
Falls Church (Where's that?)
Ooh, Boyle Heights! (Boyle Heights, never heard of it)2Embed
