Look Through My Window LyricsAnd the rain beats on my roof
And it does not ask for proof
It's not that lovers are unkind
She always said there'd come a time
When one would leave and one stay behind
We both knew people sometimes change
And lovers sometimes rearrange
And nothing's quite as sure as change
And the rain beats on my roof
Look through my window to the street below
See the people hurryin' by
With someone to meet, some place to go
And I know I should let go
She always said "I'm not like you"
"When love is dead, for me it's through"
"And I will find and love someone new"
Look through my window, yeah, to the street below
See the people hurryin' by
With someone to meet, some place to go
And I know I should let go
I must admit she knew her mind
And it will not take her long to find
Another place where the sun will shine
And the rain beats on my roof
If I still require proof
Well, the rain beats on my roof (She's gone)
If I still require proof (She's gone)
Well, the rain beats on my roof (Look through my window)
If I still require proof (All the people)
Well, the rain beats on my roof (I love her)
If I still require proof (She's gone)1Embed
