Glad to be unhappy - single version LyricsFools rush in, so here I am
Awfully glad to be unhappy
I can't win but here I am
More than glad to be unhappy
Unrequited love's a bore, yeah
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mama and no papa
I'm so unhappy, yeah
Unrequited love's a bore, yeah
And I've got it pretty bad
But for someone you adore
It's a pleasure to be sad
Like a straying baby lamb
With no mama and no papa
I'm so unhappy, yeah
But oh so gladEmbed
