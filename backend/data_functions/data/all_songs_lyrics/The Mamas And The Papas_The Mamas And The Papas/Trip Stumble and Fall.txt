Trip Stumble and Fall LyricsYou're gonna trip, stumble, and fall
And though I know you're having a ball
You'd better listen my friend
(Oh listen my friend, yeah...)
This is the end -
(This could be the end...)
Someone's gonna make you crawl
(Someone's gonna make you crawl.)
You're gonna stumble and fall
You've no respect (no respect)
You see it; you grab it (you see it; you grab it)
You've got yourself (you've got yourself..)
A very bad habit (a habit, yeah)
You know you're on soft ground
(Oh, you're on soft ground,)
You'd better look around
(Yeah, you better look around.)
One wrong step and that's all
(One wrong step and that's all.)
You're gonna stumble and fall
Some little bird is gonna put her eye on you, yeah
And when she does you know you're gonna be blue -
You're gonna be....(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Blue
Then you're gonna trip (trip), stumble, and fall
(Trip, stumble, and fall...)
And when you land (and when you land...)
It's no fun at all (it's no fun at all)
You'd better listen, my friend
(Oh, listen my...won't you listen my...)
Yeah, this is the end
(This could be the...)
Someone 's gonna make you crawl
(Someone's gonna make you crawl.)
You're gonna stumble and fall
(Down, down, down, down)
You've never been burned
But everybody's somebody's fool (yeah)
And when it's your turn to burn
You'll know that it's cruel
You're gonna be a...(yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fool
You're gonna trip (trip), stumble, and fall
(Trip stumble and fall...)
And when you land (and when you land...)
It's no fun at all (it's no fun at all.)
You're gonna trip (trip, stumble), trip, stumble, stumble and fall
You're gonna trip (trip, stumble), trip, stumble, stumble and fall
You're gonna trip (trip, stumble), trip, stumble, stumble and fall
You're gonna trip (trip), stumble (stumble)
Trip (trip), stumble and fallEmbed
