My Girl LyricsI've got sunshine on a cloudy day
And when it's cold outside, I've got the month of May
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, I'm talkin' 'bout my girl
I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the tree
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, I'm talkin' 'bout my girl
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I don't need money, fortune or fame
I got all the riches, baby, that one man can claim
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, talkin' 'bout my girl
Got so much honey, the bees envy me
I got a sweeter song than the birds in the tree
Don't need no fortune, no money or fame
'Cause when I got my girl, I've got all the riches one man can claim
Talkin' 'bout my girl, yeah my girl1Embed
