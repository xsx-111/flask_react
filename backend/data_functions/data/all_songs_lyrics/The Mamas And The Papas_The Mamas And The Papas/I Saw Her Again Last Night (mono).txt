I Saw Her Again Last Night (mono) LyricsVerse 1:
I saw her again last night
And you know that I shouldn't
To string her along's just not right
If I couldn't I wouldn't
Pre-chorus:
But what can I do?
I'm lonely too
Chorus:
And it makes me feel so good to know
She'll never leave me
Verse 2:
I'm in way over my head
Now she thinks that I love her
Because that's what I said
Though I never think of her
Pre-chorus
Chorus
Bridge:
Every time I see that girl
You know I wanna lay down and die
But I really need that girl
Though I'm livin' a lie
It makes me wanna cry
