Janine LyricsIt's such a joke
What he asked me to do
He must think I'm a fool
Janine, don't go with those guys
What's in it for you?
In another day
The dream it will appear
I touched you on the arm
You were so warm
It's such a joke
What he asked me to do
He must think I'm a fool
Janine, you know I'm your friend
Whatever they say
In another day
Your dream it will appear
I touched you on the arm
I meant you no harm
It's such a joke
What he asked me to do
He must think I'm a fool
Janine, you know I'm your friend
Whatever they say
In another day
Your dream it will appear
I touched you on the arm
You were so warm
It's such a joke
What he asked me to do
He must think I'm a fool
Janine, you know I'm your friend
Whatever they say
In another day
Your dream it will appear
In another day
Your dream it will appear
I touched you on the arm
You were so warm...Embed
