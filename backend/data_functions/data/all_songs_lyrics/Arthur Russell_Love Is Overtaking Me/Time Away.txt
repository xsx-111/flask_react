Time Away LyricsI'm taking time away to dream
I'm taking time out to clean up my room
And when I clean up, my room will gleam
Because dreams aren't as unreal as they seem
I'm taking time away to dream
I'm taking time out
Put my records in their covers and then
I'll put the albums back into their place
And I'll sweep up this morning and when
I look at the clock, I see it says ten
I'm taking time away to dream
I'm taking time out
Well I just can't be sure any more
I just can't be sure
No, I just can't be sure any more
I just can't be sure
I'll pick up my pants even though
I might wear them, wear them today
Smooth out my covers on my bed so
After I wash them I've got some place to go
I'm taking time away to dream
I'm taking time out
Well I just can't be sure any more
I just can't be sure
No, I just can't be sure any more
I just can't be sure
I'm taking time away to dream
I'm taking t-time out to clean up my room
And when I clean up, my room will gleam
Because dreams aren't as unreal as they seem
I'm taking time away to dream
I'm taking time outEmbed
