Planted A Thought LyricsI planted a thought where I saw where there was you
I planted a tree where the big door opens
There's a symbol of what could happen
Oh what we wanted to happen
I planted a thought where I saw where there was you
I planted a tree where the big door opens
I'll stop the point and love's broken
You came over and I made certain
What you wanted and I wanted
Both near and far
Both near and far
Both near and far
I will find you and
There's a symbol of what could happen
Oh what we wanted to happen
I planted a thought where I saw where there was you
I planted a tree where the big door opensEmbed
