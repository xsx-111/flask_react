Big Moon LyricsBig moon
Don't let me down
Like they said that it would be
Big moon
Up on the pole
Come and bring her back to me
Two years ago
In the cold and blowing snow
I never seen her before
But now her face is all I know
Big big big moon
Don't let me down
She might let you talk to me
Big big big moon
Don't let me down
She might give you one more chance
Big moon
Don't let me down
Like they said that it would be
Big moon
Up on the pole
Come and bring her back to me
Heat in her face
She can't have a face like you
Moonlight it falls all over space
Heard you put the message through
Big big big moon
Don't let me down
She might let you talk to me
Big big big moon
Don't let me down
She might give you one more chance
Big moon
Don't let me down
Like they said that it would be
Big moon
Up on the pole
Come and bring her back to me
Two years ago
In the cold and blowing snow
I never seen her before
But now her face is all I know
Big big big moon
Don't let me down
She might let you talk to me
Big big big moon
Don't let me down
She might give you one more chance
She might give you one more chanceEmbed
