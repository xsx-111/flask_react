Maybe She LyricsMaybe she would take a walk
Even though I just have met her
Together we could maybe talk
Or maybe I should just forget her
The only thing she could say is "no"
Best try now while the sky is lighter
I'll just let my feelings show
I'll just go up and invite her
She might think I'm very strange
She might think I want to date her
That would be hard to arrange
Maybe I should ask her later
Wonder if she knows I'm scared
Does she know I'm glad to meet her?
Standing with my feelings bare
She'll know when I start to greet her
Won't do any harm to try
Better than just looking at her
I'll just look into her eyes
If she won't come, it doesn't matter
I'd be cool if she refused
She might think that I won't fit her
I won't show it if I lose
I won't be sad and I won't be bitter
Maybe she would take a walk
Even though I just have met her
Together we could maybe talk
Or maybe I could just forget herEmbed
