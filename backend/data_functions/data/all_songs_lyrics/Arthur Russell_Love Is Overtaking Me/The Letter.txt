The Letter LyricsHey there's a letter for you
Downstairs can I read it too
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs on the table
Any other day
So you never could find her
In the morning you'd be gone
She came in from out of town
What more could a country boy want
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs can I read it too
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs on the table
Played it cool so long
That he couldn't remember
How a broken heart could feel
She came in from out of town
He tore out just to find her again
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs can I read it too
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs on the table
Wasn't hard to mount
It's hard with a letter
Now his life is hers
She came in from out of town
What more could a country boy want
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs can I read it too
Hey there's a letter for you
Downstairs on the tableEmbed
