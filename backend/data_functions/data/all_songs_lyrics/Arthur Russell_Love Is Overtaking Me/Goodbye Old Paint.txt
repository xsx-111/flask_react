Goodbye Old Paint LyricsGoodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Old Paint's a good pony
She pays us when she can
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
My horses ain't hungry
They won't eat your hay
My wagon is loaded
And rolling away
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
When I take my saddle
Down from the wall
Put it on my pony
Lead him from the stall
Tie my bones to his back
Turn our faces West
We'll ride the prairie
That we love the best
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving Cheyenne
Goodbye Old Paint
I'm leaving CheyenneEmbed
