Your Motion Says LyricsYour motion says
You're in the mood
But what you want is far away
It's plain that I
Spend my time on you too much
But tell me it's alright
And I can laugh all night
Just tell me, and I'll be happy again
Eyes, they are just glances
A mouth, it is just kisses
A hand, it's just a handshake
And I am just another guy
Your motion says
You're in the mood
But what you want is far away
It's plain that I
Spend my time on you too much
Tell me it's alright
And I can last all night
Just tell me and I'll be happy again
Your eyes, they are just glances
Your mouth, it is just kisses
Your hand is just a handshake
And I am just another guy
Your motion says
That you are in the mood
But what you want is far away
It's plain that I spend my time on you too muchEmbed
