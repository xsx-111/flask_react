Habit of You LyricsWhen I opened the door and saw
You smiling once again
I felt so lucky
And so warm inside;
Opened the door and saw
You smiling even though
The snow was blowing
It's so warm inside
Hey, I think I'm falling in love
I guess you didn't know
Hey, I think I'm losing my cool
In case it didn't show
But a habit of you
Would be hard to give up
A habit of you
Would be hard to give up
Yes, a habit of you
A habit of you could be hard to give up
When I opened the box and saw
My orange birthday cake
I felt like crying
That's all I could do
When I opened the box and saw
My orange birthday cake
That's all that's left of
Mama's birthday boy
Hey, I think I'm falling in love
I guess you didn't know
But a habit of you
Would be hard to give up
A habit of you
Would be hard to give up
Yes, a habit of you
A habit of you could be hard to give up
When I opened the door and saw
(Uh oh)
You smiling back at me
I felt like crying
That's all I could do
When I opened the door and saw
You smiling back at me
That's all that's left of
Mama's birthday boy
Hey, I think I'm falling in love
I guess you didn't know
Hey, I think I'm losing my cool
In case it didn't show
Cause a habit of you
Is hard to give up
Cause a habit of you
Is hard to give up
Cause a habit of you
A habit of you can be hard to give upEmbed
