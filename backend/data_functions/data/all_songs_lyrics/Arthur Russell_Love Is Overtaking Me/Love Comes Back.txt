Love Comes Back LyricsIn the soft energy
We are away
Intelligence in your hands
It's winning me again
And it's too soft
For meeting in the moonlight
When you are there
Rising in the moonlight
Love is back
Being sad is not a crime
Want you to know that
Love is back
So put your little hand in mine
Love comes back
Skiing down, lying down
There's a lot of words I know
But still afraid to leave
Where do you go
Is where I go already
Oh no no no
Is where I go already
Love comes back
Being sad is not a crime
Want you know that
Love is back
Put your little hand in mine
In the soft energy
We are away
Intelligence in the air
It's winning me again
Intelligence in the air
It's winning me again
It is too soft
Waving in the moonlight
Where you are there
Oh it's rising in the moonlight
When you are there
It's rising in the moonlight
Love comes back
Being sad is not a crime
Once you know that
Love is back
Being sad is not a crime
Once you know that
Skiing down, lying down
Best of all worlds I see
Still afraid to move
Where do you goEmbed
