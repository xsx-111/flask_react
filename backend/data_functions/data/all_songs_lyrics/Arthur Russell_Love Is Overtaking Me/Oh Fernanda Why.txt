Oh Fernanda Why LyricsIf I try to be so free that you
Can't remember me
When I come back next fall
I take my time to learn but forget it all
I write myself a letter instead of writing you
See your mind makes faces
See your mind makes faces in the mirror at you
Oh Fernanda why
Oh Fernanda why
The best of me is still alone
Outside the house
Outside Milano
Oh Fernanda why
Oh Fernanda why
Goodbye to Milano
And goodbye to them all
I stood in the grass in my shoes
Like a foreigner
In the nature I loved
It's so so hard to tell
If it's really really true
It used to be the two of us
But now it's three
See your mind makes faces
See your mind makes faces in the mirror at you
Oh Fernanda why
Oh Fernanda why
The best of me is still alone
Outside the house
Outside Milano
Oh Fernanda why
Oh Fernanda why
Goodbye to Milano
And goodbye to them allEmbed
