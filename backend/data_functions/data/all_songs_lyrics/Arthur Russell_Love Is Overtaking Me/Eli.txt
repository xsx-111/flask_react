Eli LyricsEli, Eli, Eli
Eli, Eli, Eli
A simple dog with ears and nose
Eli, Eli, Eli
I don't why nobody likes him
There's some people trying to put him away
When he comes up to them
They always say
Go away
Go away
Please take him home
Make him stay
Eli, Eli, Eli
Eli, Eli, Eli
Several times I've tried to tell him
Please don't make them say that
But he won't listen to me
Sometimes I pray that there could be more between us
But some people never are satisfied
Eli, Eli, Eli
Eli, Eli, EliEmbed
