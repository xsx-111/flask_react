Love is Overtaking Me LyricsIs it so different now?
Or is it just the way I feel
Just the way I feel
Love is overtaking me
And my heart pounds out your name in the night
It's the same when I see you cry
And it's waking my heart
And it's breaking my heart
But mostly taking it over
Like the sun shines gloriously through the sky
I know it seems like we just met
Oh, but it's so different now
Is it so different now?
Is it so different now?
Is it so different now?
Or is it just the way I feel?
Love is overtaking me
I know you're shivering and you're wet
Oh, but won't you please lie still?
Won't you please lie still?
Won't you please lie still?
Oh, it's just the way I feel
Just the way I feelEmbed
