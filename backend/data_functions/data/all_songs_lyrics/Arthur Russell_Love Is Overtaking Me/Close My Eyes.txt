Close My Eyes LyricsI close my eyes and listen
To hear the corn come out
Don't you hear the stars they glisten
As we go in and out
Down where the trees grow together
And the western path comes to an end
See the sign it says clear weather
I'll meet you tonight, my friend
Will the corn be growing a little tonight
As I wait in the fields for you
Who knows what grows in the morning light
When we can feel the watery dew
I just can't be there with no other
I know those hills will be true
Away from my sister and brother
Down through the grasses so new
The air is sweet and steady
And flowers bloom out of sight
I know the sky is ready
Come meet me down here tonight
Will the corn be growing a little tonight
As I wait in the fields for you
Who knows what grows in the morning light
As we can feel the watery dew1Embed
