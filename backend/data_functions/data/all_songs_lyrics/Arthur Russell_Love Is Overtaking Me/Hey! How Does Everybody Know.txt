Hey! How Does Everybody Know LyricsHey, hey
How does everybody know
How I feel
Feel about you
Guess it somehow just can't help but show
What is realer really is true
Walking
Walking all along the block
They see me
See me go by
Guess they know just by the way I talk
Or even say
Even say hi
But it ain't what they're saying
What they're saying to me
That makes me want to
Want to be
All alone
Alone with you
When they
Caught me running through the door
Tried to keep me
Keep me behind
How they knowing that I do adore
The nicest girl
Girl I can find
But it ain't what they're saying
What they're saying to me
That makes me wanting
Wanting to be
All alone
Alone with you
Listen boy
Here's how everybody knows
How you feel
It's because
You can't help it
Showing what's really real
If you see me
Coming down the stairs
Passing by
Right by your side
If I
Let you know I really care
At least don't hurt me
Don't hurt my pride
'Cause it ain't what they're saying
What they're saying to me
That makes me wanting
Wanting to be
All alone
Alone with you
Hey, hey
How does everybody know
How I feel
Feel about you
Guess it somehow just can't help but show
What is realer really is true
Walking
Walking all along the block
They see me
See me go by
Guess they know just by the way I talk
Or even say
Even say hi
Hey, hey
How does everybody know
How I feel
Feel about you
Guess it somehow just can't help but show
What is realer really is true
Hey, hey
How does everybody know
How I feel
Feel about you
Guess it somehow just can't help but show
What is realer really is true
Hey, hey
How does everybody know
How I feel
Feel about you
Guess it somehow just can't help but show
What is realer really is true
Hey, hey
How does everybody know
How I feel
Feel about you
Guess it somehow just can't help but show
What is realer really is trueEmbed
