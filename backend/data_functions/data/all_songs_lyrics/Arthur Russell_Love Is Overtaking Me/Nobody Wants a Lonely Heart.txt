Nobody Wants a Lonely Heart Lyrics
Now as you eat
Don't think of the one you love
And on the street
Don't look at the sky above
If there's no one home
Don't expect nothing
'Cause nobody wants a lonely heart

Now like a dog
Who's homeless and can't be sleeping
Like a log;
He knows that's he's best off keeping out of sight
Don't expect nothing
'Cause nobody wants a lonely heart

And in the door
There's nobody coming through it anymore
But I'm looking through it to some other way
Don't expect nothing
'Cause nobody wants a lonely heart
Nobody wants a lonely heartEmbed
