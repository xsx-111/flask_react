Weightless Again LyricsWe stopped for coffee in the redwood forest
Giant dripping leaves, spoons of powdered cream
I wanted to kiss you, but I wasn't sure how
Like those Indians lost in the rain forest
Forced to drag burning wood wherever they went
They had all forgotten how to start a fire
This is why people OD on pills
And jump from the Golden Gate Bridge
Anything to feel weightless again
Those poor lost Indians when the white man found them
Most died of TB, the rest went insane
In our motel room you're drinking slice and gin
Reading Moby Dick on the other bed
Remember the first time we slept together
You said it felt like when you learned to float
This is why people OD on pills
And jump from the Golden Gate Bridge
Anything to feel weightless againEmbed
