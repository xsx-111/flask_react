I Fell LyricsThere's a mountain north of Winnipeg buried under ice
And as the black clouds roll above
White pines crack like glass
Walking under those swaying trees branches bowed with ice
I wanted one to fall on me to pin me in the snow
That silver forest reminded me of you and how I kissed you
And I fell down to the bottom of a well
Down a dirt road west of El Paso behind a burning barn
I stumbled on a horse's bone bleaching in the sand
But when I reached down to touch the skull underneath my hand
A stream of orange lizards poured out from the bone-white mouth
That empty mouth reminded me of you and how I kissed you
And I fell down to the bottom of a wellEmbed
