Where The Birch Trees Lean LyricsNow that there are green sproutspushing through dead leaves
And fat yellow jackets float on the breeze
The waves kiss the shore and the air is warm
But birch trees are falling now that you're gone
Once we walked the crumbling cliffs where the birch trees lean
Once I kissed your apple lips high above the sea
A year ago it was since the last clover grew
Under creaking birch trees I would wait for you
We kissed in the salt air beneath the leaning trees
White slender branches bent to the sea
Once we walked the crumbling cliffs where the birch trees lean
Now who will kiss your apple lipsunder the salty seaEmbed
