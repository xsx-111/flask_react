Last Night I Went Out Walking LyricsLast night I went out walking out on the edge of town
Not going no place special, only wandering around
I came upon a river, I thought about what you said
And couldn't stop it flowing and running through my head
You said that I've been changing and never seemed to laugh
But I can't recall the last time you smiled and it's tearing me in half
I want to run and tell you the thoughts that are in my head
But I don't think that you'd believe a single word I said
The river's water runs so cool, it calms my burning skin
It takes away my aching thoughts and cleanses all my sin
So let it flow on, take me down to sleep that quiet sleep
And roll my body back to you my love you may always keepEmbed
