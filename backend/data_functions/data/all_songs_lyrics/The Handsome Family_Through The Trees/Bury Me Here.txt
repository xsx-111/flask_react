Bury Me Here LyricsDown that foggy road slow centipedes crawl
Plump blackberries fall, and the ground is dark as blood
Down that foggy road the moon burns red as flame
Weeds snap in the rain, dogs are dragged off in the flood
Bury me here in the silvery mist
Bury me here with the spiders and fish.
Down that foggy road black bears crawl to sleep
Tree sap slowly seeps and the sunrise never comesEmbed
