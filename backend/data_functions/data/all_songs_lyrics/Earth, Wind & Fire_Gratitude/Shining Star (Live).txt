Shining Star (Live) LyricsWhen you wish upon a star, hey
Your dreams will take you very far, now, oh yeah
But when you wish upon a dream
Life ain't always what it seems, oh yeah
What you see on nights so clear, hey
In the sky so very dear, yeah?
You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be (What you could truly be)
Shining star comes into view, alright
Shine its watchful light on you, yeah
Give you strength to carry on, yeah
Make your body big and strong, hear me now
Born a man-child of the sun, well
Saw my work had just begun, yes it did
Yeah, found I had to stand alone, yeah
Well, bless it now I've got my own, oh yeah, oh yeah
So, if you find yourself in need
Say, why don't you listen
To these words of heed? (Yeah, why don't cha listen?)
Be a giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom
Yes, I can
You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be
You're a shining star
No matter who you are
Shining bright to see
What you could truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be

Born a man-child of the sun, oh, yeah, huh
Saw my work had just begun, yeah
Hey, found I had to stand alone, yeah
Well, bless it now I've got my own, oh yeah, oh yeah
So, if you find yourself in need
Why don't you listen
To these words of heed? (Yeah)
Be a giant or grain of sand
Words of wisdom
Yes, I can
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be

Shining star for you to see what your life can truly be
You a shining star for you to see (c'mon) what your life can truly be
Shining star
