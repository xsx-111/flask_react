Reasons (Live) LyricsNow, I'm craving your body, is this real?
Temperature's risin', I don't want to feel
I'm in the wrong place to be real
Whoa, and I'm longing to love you just for a night
Kissin' and huggin' and holdin' you tight
Please let me love you with all my might
Reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear, oh
And after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all our reasons start to fade
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
La, la la la, la, la la la
After all the reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all the reasons, love
Love was left aside
I'm longing to love you for one night
Please let me love you with all of my might, baby
Ooo, baby, oo, yeah
Whoa... reasons, the reasons that we're here
The reasons that we fear
Our feelings won't disappear (They won't disappear)
And, after the love game has been played
All our illusions were just a parade
And all the reasons start to fade
And, in the morning when I rise
No longer feeling hypnotized
Find our reasons, our reasons, our reasons
Had no pride
After all the reasons why
All our reasons were a lie
After all the reasons, love
Love was left aside
Whoa, yeah
Yeah, oo, baby
I can't find the reasons
Why my love, it won't disappear
Can't find the reasons why I love you
Hey... I love you
Love you
Whoa, yeah... baby
