Rawhide Lyrics
God damn, well let's do a tune called Rawhide, okay
God damn tape's rollin', let's go

Let's move 'em out!
One! Two!
Three! Four!

Rolin', rollin', rollin'
Rolin', rollin', rollin'
Rolin', rollin', rollin'
Rolin', rollin', rollin'
Keep rollin', rollin', rollin'
Though the streams are swollen
Keep them doggies rollin'
Keep them doggies rollin'
Keep them doggies rollin'

Rawhide
Don't try to understand them
Just throw a rope and brand 'em
Soon they'll be kneeling high and wide
Movin', movin', movin'
Movin', movin', movin'
Movin', movin', movin'
Keep movin', movin', movin'
Though they're disapprovin'
Keep them doggies movin'
Keep them doggies movin'
Keep them doggies movin'
Rawhide

Through rain and wind and weather
Hell bent for leather
Wishin' my gal was by my side
All the things I'm missin'
Good viddles, love and kissin'
Are waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em out, head 'em up, get 'em up
Move 'em out, head 'em up, get 'em up
Rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Ride 'em in, cut 'em out
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Ride 'em in, Rawhide (Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin')
Rawhide! (Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin')Embed
