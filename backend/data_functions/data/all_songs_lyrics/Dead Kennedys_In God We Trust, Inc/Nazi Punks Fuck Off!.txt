Nazi Punks Fuck Off! Lyrics
'Nazi Punks Fuck Off', overproduced by Martin Hannett, take four
(Two three four!)

Punk ain't no religious cult
Punk means thinking for yourself
You ain't hardcore when you spike your hair
When a jock still lives inside your head

Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Fuck off!
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Fuck off!

If you've come to fight, get outta here
You ain't no better than the bouncers
We ain't trying to be police
If you ape the cops it ain't anarchy
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Fuck off!
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Fuck off!

Ten guys jump one, what a man
You fight each other, the police state wins
Stab your backs when you trash our halls
Trash a bank if you've got real balls
You still think swastikas look cool
The real Nazis run your schools
They're coaches, businessmen and cops
In a real Fourth Reich you'll be the first to go

Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Fuck off!
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Nazi punks
Fuck off!
You'll be the first to go
You'll be the first to go
You'll be the first to go
Unless you think!15Embed
