Hyperactive Child Lyrics
"Hyperactive Child", take four...
(One, two, three, four!)
I'm tired of kissing ass
I can't sit still all day
You know I know your school's a lie
That's why you dragged me here
'You're a hyperactive child
You're destructive, you're too wild
We're going to calm you down
Now this won't hurt a bit'
Drag me to the floor
Pulling down my pants
Ram a needle up my butt
Put my brain into a trance
'No more hyperactive child
Got too much of a mind
Wouldn't you rather be happy?
Now this won't hurt a bit'
Cameras in the halls
No windows, just brick walls
Pledge allegiance to a flag
Now you will obeyEmbed
