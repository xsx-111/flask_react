Religious Vomit Lyrics
All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions make me sick
All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions suck

They all claim that they have the truth
They'll set you free
Just give 'em the money and they'll set you free
Free for a fee
They claim that they have "the Answer"
When they don't even know the Question
They're just a bunch of liars
They just want your money
They just want your consciousness

All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions make me sick
All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions suck
All religions suck
All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions suck
All religions make me wanna BLEARGH
They all claim that they have the truth
They'll set you free
Just give 'em the money and they'll set you free
Free for a fee
They claim that they have "the Answer"
When they don't even know the Question
They're just a bunch of liars
They just want your money
They just want your consciousness

All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions make me sick
All religions make me wanna throw up
All religions suck
They really make me sick
They really make me sick
They really make me sick
They really make me sick
They really make me sick
They really make me ill2Embed
