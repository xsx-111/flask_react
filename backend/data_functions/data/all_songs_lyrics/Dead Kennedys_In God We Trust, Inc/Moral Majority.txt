Moral Majority Lyrics
We are gathered here tonight... to pay tribute to our Lord, and money unto me! Oh Lord in Heaven, let us pray! You, T.V. viewers, give me your pay, and sing M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E!
(One, two, three...)

You call yourselves the Moral Majority
We call ourselves the people in the real world
Trying to rub us out, but we're going to survive
God must be dead, if you're alive

You say, 'God loves you. Come and buy the Good News'
Then you buy the President and swimming pools
If Jesus don't save 'til we're lining your pockets
God must be dead if you're alive

Circus-tent con-men and Southern belle bunnies
Milk your emotions and steal your money
It's the new dark ages with the fascist toting Bibles
Cheap nostalgia for the Salem Witch Trials

Stodgy ayatollahs in their double-knit ties
Burn lots of books so they can feed your their lies
Masturbating with a flag and a Bible
God must be dead if you're alive
Blow it out your ass, Jerry Falwell
Blow it out your ass, Jesse Helms
Blow it out your ass, Ronald Reagan
What's wrong with a mind of my own?

You don't want abortions, you want battered children
You want to ban the pill as if that solves the problem
Now you wanna force us to pray in school
God must be dead if you're such a fool

You're planning for a war with or without Iran
Building a police state with your Ku Klux Klan
Pissed at your neighbor? Don't bother to nag
Pick up the phone and turn in a fag

Blow it out your ass, Terry Dolan
Blow it out your ass, Phyllis Schlafly
Ram it up your cunt, Anita
Cause God must be dead if you're alive
God must be dead if you're alive!1Embed
