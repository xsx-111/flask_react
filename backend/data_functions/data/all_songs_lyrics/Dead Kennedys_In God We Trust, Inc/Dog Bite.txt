Dog Bite Lyrics
(One, two, three, four!)
Ah!
Hold it, it's too slow
(One, two, three, four!)

Dog bite, on my leg
Not right, supposed to beg
Dog bite, on my leg
Not right, supposed to...

Daily to the filling station
Underwater navigation
Ooh, ooh

Dog bite, on my leg
Not right, supposed to beg
Dog bite, on my leg
Not right, supposed to...

Ooh, ooh
Daily to the filling station
Underwater navigation
Ooh, ooh
Dog bite, on my leg
Not right, supposed to beg
Dog bite, on my leg
Not right, supposed to!Embed
