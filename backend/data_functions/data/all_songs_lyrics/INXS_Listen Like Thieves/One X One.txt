One X One LyricsAnd when you heart stops beating
And the stars stop shining
When all your tears go dry, honey
One by one
I will still be there
I will sing your song
And come to you
Oh, oh, all night long
And is this all that you see?
'Cause this is all that we need
When all the thorns are cut away, baby
One by one
Will you still be there?
Will you sing my song
And come with me, baby
Oh, all night long?
And all your kisses linger
Like they always do
Let all that spirit in you
Take it to the end
I will still be there
I will sing your song
And come to you, honey
All night long
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come to you
Yes, I will be there
All night long
All night longEmbed
