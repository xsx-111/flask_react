What You Need Lyrics
Hey, here is the story
Forget about the troubles in life
Don't you know, it's not easy
When you gotta walk upon that line

That's why - You need
Oooo, that's why - This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

Oooohh
Don't you get sad and lonely
You need a change from
What you do all day
Ain't no sense in all your crying
Just pick it up and throw it into shape
Ooo yeah

That's why - You need
Oooo, that's why - This is what you need
I'll give you what you need

Hey you, won't you listen
This is not the end of it all
Don't you see there is a rhythm
I'll take you where you
Really need to beEmbed
