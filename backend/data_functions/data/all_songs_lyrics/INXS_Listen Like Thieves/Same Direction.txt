Same Direction LyricsCHORUS
And we all just need the same things
Tell you what I know
We're heading in the same direction
So never let it go
There are few of us
Who will never know
We're counting on every day
I'm not sure about
You're not sure about
Why things are going this way
BRIDGE
Oo, yeah
Believe it
Oo, yeah
You see it, see it
CHORUS
And we all just need the same things
Tell you what I know
We're heading in the same direction
So never let it go
BRIDGE
Oo, yeah
Believe it
Oo, yeah
You see it, see it
CHORUS
And we all just need the same things
Tell you what I know
We're heading in the same direction
So never let it go
I will turn around
Try to understand
All of the feelings unsaid
If you are serious
Love is dangerous
It changes my world every day
BRIDGE
Oo, yeah
Believe it
Oo, yeah
You see it, see it
CHORUS
And we all just need the same things
Tell you what I know
We're heading in the same direction
So never let it go
Never let it go
Believe it
Yeah, see it, see it
We're headed in the same direction, yeah
Believe it, believe it
Never let it go
No, no, no, no, no, no-noEmbed
