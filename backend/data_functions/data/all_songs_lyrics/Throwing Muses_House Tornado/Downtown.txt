Downtown LyricsShe's downtown Lies in the street
Been lying in the sheets
She's gone home Lies in the street
Been lying in the bed Through her teeth
Stares at his sky Going blind Going blind
Step on corners Pick up puzzles
Eating all the grain
It was just a date in '80 now I can't remember the face
But I can see the still I see his of the and...
I'm a little bored and a little scared I come home
I look up to see all the noise I...
Can't remember now I can't remember now
She's seeing everyone Stares at her spreads that love around
And leaves
Can't even catch the face Don't think you can grab the face
So I left
She's downtown Lies in the sheets
Been lying in her sleep to his face
She's gone home Lies in the street
Been lying in the bed Through her teeth
Don't have to be so brave
Here he comes Here he comesEmbed
