Colder LyricsThey took a picture
And from this cold lightning living me through
So I feel like an alarm clock
Fire came from my mouth Is pushing me around
And I'm not loving and I'm not hating
I'm not creating
I'm losing my friends and my young dreams
That was vicious air spilled in my face out of love
And out of love
Keep walking
If I did the same thing 500 times
Could you see it in the dark?
I trust the weather
I try to make the bodies give me strength
Do we see them in the yard?
Who cares if they're rolling in bed?
There's only darkness upstairs
Does love sit cold 'til you put it somewhere?
Do objects split it at your heart?
I don't see that anymore
I'm colder and colder and colderEmbed
