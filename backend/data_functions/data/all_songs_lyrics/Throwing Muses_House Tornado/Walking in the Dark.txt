Walking in the Dark LyricsI can't forget a dream
You own a question, it's a body
You can make me cry
You have a right
I can see you live
I can't forget you die
You own a question, it's a garden
You can, you can can
Where'd you go? Where'd you
Boxing, writhing, twist and burrow
Walking in the dark
A hunter, runner
Walking, picking up the sticks
I had a dream, I had a dream
Rub the peers away, they dont invade me
I just turned 35
A round-bottomed beaker
I could glow, I could glow
And swell
I could wail, oh
Turn black
Turn back
Ride and forget
My ghost of seasons past asked this bedroom what to say
It said stay
I have to sleep tangled in my family's hair
Build a house of sticks
And grow the grass
And build a mask
Pull the grapes
Turn black
Turn back
I can't say it
Till you grow a face
Walking in the darkEmbed
