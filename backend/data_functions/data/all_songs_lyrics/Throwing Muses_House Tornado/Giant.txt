Giant LyricsHold the man up to your hands Old hands
Make the man work again
Giant can I Giant can get high again
Hold again or hurt
You will walk to the front and be blessed
Make my bones shiver again Trust it again
Make my bones work
Giant can I I Giant can get high again
I can't hold your head with both hands burned
You will walk to the front and be blessed again
One bed to sweat too scared to
So unsettling
One bed to sweat too scared too tired
One bed to sweat too scared to
So I'm settling in
One bed to sweat too scared to
Grieve
Giant can Giant can look down look down
Too small to look down to
Too small to look down look down
Just one time not to trip
Just once not to tripEmbed
