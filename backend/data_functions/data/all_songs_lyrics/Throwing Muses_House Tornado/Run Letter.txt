Run Letter LyricsSo many tears I'm shaking out
Squeezing them out and bend it
The way things work together
If I write this letter you can bend it
Please hope can I give hope
The sky won't fall
Just look
If I mail this letter you can send it back to me
If you can dance If you can live I love you
I love you
Knocked me on the head and sent me spinning
It was a blast I can't remember the last time
Stand between two poles and hold your arms up
I'll kick me over your head and stock down
Carry him Carry him Carry him And pray
If I mail this letter you can send it back to me
Just look, I love you
It isn't fair
Hope you can hold your head up
I can pray if you meet my gaze
I can laugh if you bring me home and dry me off
Count your cans and
Hold them up
And count them all
A piece of ground where I can lay my head
Where I can lay a piece of my heart
I don't remember I don't remember
If I saw God there or not
Give me home Give me all Give me what I want
I want a place at the door
I surrender I surrender
My place My goods My dayEmbed
