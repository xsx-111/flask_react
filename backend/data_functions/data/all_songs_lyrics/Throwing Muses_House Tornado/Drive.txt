Drive LyricsDrive your car
Through the kitchen cupboard door
Through the winter
Down to the floor
Drive your head
To your bathroom tile
Smile 'round the corner and your friends
They wanna play
Do you wanna play games?
It's alright...square your head Your head is square
Go out with me
Come out
1 2 3...1 2 3 I didn't care...
I wanted you to know I didn't care
I always loved your hair
I wanna fight the clouds with your head on a stick
Fight the bush with your water and your leaves
And you leave so...
Fight with me
Run the grass
Run the road
The road home
Home with me
In my head
In your heart
Under your ribs
In my mind
Sleep your box
I sleep in your mind
I don't care...Embed
