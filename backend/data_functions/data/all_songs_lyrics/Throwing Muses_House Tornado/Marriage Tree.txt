Marriage Tree LyricsLike an old man in a dress
Treat me like a 12-year-old man
No more hearts
Don't know what 20 is
Don't know where the tree stands
Only follow these hands
At midnight I reach for the blind
Toward your head, but don't touch it
I'll wish I had but when I'm dead
At midnight I hit your song
It sings again
Don't know what age is
Don't know where the tree stands
I only follow these hands
I couldn't make you crazy if I tried
We've been swinging around the tree
For how long now?
Maybe she wants to be cared for
Stay home a month here, a month there
Maybe take to their open roads
Maybe take to their open roads
Maybe take to their open roads
At the marriage tree, the marriage
At the marriage treeEmbed
