The River LyricsLose your war and we can stay out all night
Lose your keys and we can't go home
In a little time In a little gin
We can touch hands again
Lose your head
Lose your warhead
Wrote a song for a room I left long ago
It was my home
It was my hell
Now the girl that lives there
She's an exotic, a drunk
Leaves her clothes off when it rains
Run to the river
She carry me
She run me
All the way down
To the floor
Where it's warm
And dirty like a river
My whole Hell
Carry me
No, run me
All the way down
To the river
All I want is to be worthy of my
Hands, but she's got plans
Dirty like a river
(You can't) run me down
Lose it
Lose your warEmbed
