Cosmic Vibrations LyricsI don’t know, can’t decide
Should I wed or should I take her life?
I don’t know who’s in the hive
Haven’t been down there since ‘35
If you want me, you can have me
You can have me but I’m all used up
In the sun, in the sunlight laughing
3-D visions
Look at me, look at you
See the sunlight on the ocean
In my head, when the wind
Whistles and your head blows bells
I put my mind into the ocean
Haven’t been down there for many long years
Tropical fruit, mystery cave snail stones
All books come from Minnesota
So heed my relation at the radio stations
I am your patient
Lovely red raincoat
If you want me, you can have me
You can have me but I’m all used up
In the sun, in the sunlight laughing
Cosmic vibrations, love is the answer
But where must we go again to become friends?
Where must we go again to become friends?
Where must we go again to become friends?
Where must we go again to become friends?
Where must we go again to become friends?
Where must we go?
Where must we go to become friends?Embed
