Brooklyn Police Station LyricsEverybody knows the time is right for fighting in the street
Brooklyn Police Station
I don’t want to go to where they want to kidnap me
Brooklyn Police Station, Brooklyn Police Station
Brooklyn Police Station, Brooklyn Police Station
Everyone says she lives in a fantasy world
Brooklyn Police Station
Rain, shine, I know she will be fine down there
Brooklyn Police Station, Brooklyn Police Station
Brooklyn Police Station, Brooklyn Police Station
I heard somebody say, “I’d like to be where everybody knows me"
I’d like to be where no one knows my name but me
I’d like to be in love
I’ve never been in love
So it’s cool if you’re straight
We like you anyway
And it’s fine if you’re high
‘Cause we’d like to get high, too
We like you just the way you areEmbed
