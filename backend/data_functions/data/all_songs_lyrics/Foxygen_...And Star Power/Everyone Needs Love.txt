Everyone Needs Love LyricsEveryone needs love
Everyone needs love
You've got to try, try, try, try
You got to hang on, hang on
All right (All right)
You got to hang on, hang on, hang on
Everyone needs love
Everyone needs love
You've got to try
You’re a star, you've got to shine, shine on
Shine on
You've got to shine on, shine on, shine on
Hang on, hang on, hang on

We can make it together
We can change the world, it’s true
We can make it together, it's true
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, you’re a star
If you believe you are
Everyone needs love
Everyone needs love
