Mattress Warehouse LyricsCaptain Eddie is
Taking over ships in the sea
But my eyes can't see you
And he says he has
Great deals on mattresses
Come and see, oh yeah
But my eyes can't see you now
But my eyes can't see you now
When my eyes saw the light
But my eyes can't see you now
He wants for me to say
That there's a sale today
At the Mattress Warehouse, oh yeah
Does your mother say
"Don't let your children play
At the Mattress Warehouse?"
Oh no
But my eyes can't see you now
But my eyes saw the light
And my eyes can't see you nowEmbed
