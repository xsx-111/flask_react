Cannibal Holocaust Lyrics(We can work together)
I know those people in the sky
Erased these visions of you and I
But after all, I’m leaving
To my home up in the sky
We can work together, you and I
Take these visions, don’t tell me lies
Take these ribbons, don’t know why
Take these visions, useless visions
On my lawn (Useless visions)
But after all the children
Have lost their minds
After all, they are free
And after all the alcohol
He was free
To have known him
Oooh, stop
Stop telling, stop telling me lies
Stop telling, stop telling me lies
Stop telling me lies1Embed
