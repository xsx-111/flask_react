The Game LyricsDo I be, do I be of love
Do I contain love
Should I persuade you
To not continue
Should I persuade you
Do not continue
The game
Do I be, do I be of love
Do I contain love
Should I persuade you
Do not continue the game
My name's Chris
And I'm so pissed about everything
I draw pentagrams on everythingEmbed
