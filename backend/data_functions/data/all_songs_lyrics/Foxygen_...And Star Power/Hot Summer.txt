Hot Summer LyricsThis song is called Hot Summer
Hot summer
I love you, baby
Hot summer
I love you, baby
Hot summer
Hot summer
I love you, baby
But you got a man
I love you, baby
Will you please understand?
I love you, baby
Yeah, but you got a man
I love you, baby
Won't you please understand?
I love you, baby
Gonna take you from your man
I saw you at the flea market, baby
With your life-size alien doll
I don't care
I'm gonna take you from your man
That's right, I don't care
Won't you please understand?
Gonna take you from your man
Won't you please understand?Embed
