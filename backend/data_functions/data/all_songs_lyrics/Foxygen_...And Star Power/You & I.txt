You & I LyricsIf it’s better in the know, how come we do it again?
If you don’t love me anymore, how come you never say it to my face?
I saw you coming so I looked okay but now I’m all strung out
I saw you in town and I thought you were gone but now I’m on a train
You and I will always be here, ooh
Yes, and I don’t even know
Who you’ve been hangin’ around with
Yes, and I don’t even wanna know
Who you’ve been hangin’ around
You and I will always be here in love
Why doesn’t anybody help me?
Why doesn’t anybody care?
Why doesn’t anybody love me?
Why doesn’t anybody care?
Oh!Embed
