Coulda Been My Love Lyrics(If I do what you want)
Could I make it with you?
(If I do what you want)
(You can do what you want)
You can do it all the time
(You can do what you want)
But I won’t ask you why
About the time before
You coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
(You can do what you want)
I can take it from you
(If I do what I want)
Will my feelings show through?
(We can do what we want)
If you don’t got a clue
(We can do what we want)
Well, that’s just what we do
(We can do what we want)
Me and you
But I won’t ask you why, I know
Why you’re not low anymore
And it’s not my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
How am I gonna make it with you, baby?
When all we do is get high
(How am I gonna make it with you?)
Cry

(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my love
(Coulda been my love)
Coulda been my
