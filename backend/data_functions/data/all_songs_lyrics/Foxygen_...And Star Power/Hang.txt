Hang LyricsIf you say you have to go now, I will never make you cry
And you know it’s not the same now, I will never...
If I’m no good, if I’m no good for you
Would you let me know if I’m no good for you?
I don’t even have to know, I don’t want to make you cry
I don’t know just what to say now that you left without saying goodbye
And you know it’s not the same now, yeah
If I’m no good, if I’m no good for you
Would you let me know if I’m too young for you?
Would you let me know if I’m no good for you?
If I’m no good, oh, if I’m no good for you
Would you let me know if I’m no good?
Would you let me know if I’m too young?
Would you let me hang, hang?
Hang, hang, hang, hang
Hang, hang, hang, hang
Hang, hang, hang, hang

Music gon' give you the rhythm
Music gon' make you dance
Music gon' give you the rhythm
And music gon' make you dance!
Music, music, music, music!
Music, music, music, music!
That's allEmbed
