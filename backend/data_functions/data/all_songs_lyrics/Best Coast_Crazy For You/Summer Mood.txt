Summer Mood Lyrics
Walking away, talking all day
Ooh, I want you
Ooh, I want you
Walking away, talking all day
Ooh, I want you
Ooh, I want you

But there is something about the summer
There is something about the summer
There is something about the summer

Walking away, talking all day
I can't stand this
I can't stand this
Walking away, talking all day
I can't stand this
I can't stand this

But there is something about the summer
There is something about the summer
There is something about the summer
That makes me moody
That makes me moody
That makes me moody
That makes me moody
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ahEmbed
