The End Lyrics
I walked to the bottom of my block and thought
About how you, how you
How you'd be home soon, how you
How you'd be home soon

Last night I went out with this guy
This guy, he was nice
He was nice and cute but he
He wasn't you

You say that we're just friends
But I want this till the end
You say that we're just friends
But I want this till the end

The end
'Til the end
The end
'Til the end
The end
'Til the end
The end
'Til the end
Why do we have to make this hard
When it doesn't have to be
Why do we have to make this hard
When it doesn't have to be

You say that we're just friends
But I want this till the end
You say that we're just friends
But I want this till the end

The end
'Til the end
The end
'Til the end
The end
'Til the end
The end
'Til the end3Embed
