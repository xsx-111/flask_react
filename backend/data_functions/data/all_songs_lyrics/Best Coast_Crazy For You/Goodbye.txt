Goodbye LyricsMy highs are high, my lows are low
And I don't know which way to go
Every time you leave this house
Everything falls apart
I can't get myself off the couch
I don't wanna talk to anyone else
Every time you leave this house
Everything falls apart
I lost my job, I miss my mom
I wish my cat could talk
Every time you leave this house
Everything falls apart
But I don't love you
I don't hate you
I don't know how I feel
But I don't love you
I don't hate you
I don't know how I feel
And nothing makes me happy
Not even TV or a bunch of weed
Every time you leave this house
Everything falls apart
And everyt ime you go away
I feel like I could cry
But I will never really cry, because
You're the worst at goodbyes
You're the worst at goodbyes
You're the worst at goodbyes
Goodbyes, at goodbyes
Goodbyes, at goodbyes
Goodbyes, at goodbyes
Goodbyes, at goodbyes1Embed
