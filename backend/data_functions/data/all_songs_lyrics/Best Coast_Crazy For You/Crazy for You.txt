Crazy for You LyricsI can't do anything without you
Can't do anything with you
Drive me crazy but I love you
Make me lazy but I love you
Want to hate you but then I kiss you
Want to kill you but then I miss you
Drive me crazy but I love you
Make me lazy but I love you
I'm always waiting by the phone
I can't wait for you to get home
I'm always crazy when I miss you
I'm always lazy when I miss you
And even though you are my guy
I always freak when I get high
I'm always crazy when I miss you
I'm always lazy when I miss you
Maybe I'm just crazy
Maybe I'm just crazy
Maybe I'm just crazy
Crazy for you, babyEmbed
