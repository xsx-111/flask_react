Boyfriend Lyrics
I wish he was my boyfriend
I wish he was my boyfriend
I'd love him 'til the very end
But instead he is just a friend
I wish he was my boyfriend

There's nothing worse
Than sitting all alone at home
And waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting
Waiting by the phone
I hope that he's at home waiting by his phone
I wonder if he knows that I want him

I wish he was my boyfriend
I wish he was my boyfriend
I'd love him 'til the very end
But instead he is just a friend
I wish he was my boyfriend

The other girl is not like me
She's prettier and skinnier
She has a college degree
I dropped out when I was seventeen
If I could only get her out of the picture
Then he would know how much I want him

One day I'll make him mine
And we'll be together all the time
We'll sit and watch the sunrise
And gaze into each other's eyes
I know that he knows
Know that he knows
I know that he wants to be my boyfriend
Boyfriend
Boyfriend

I'd love him 'til the very end
But instead he is just a friend
I wish he was my boyfriend
I wish he was my boyfriend
I'd love him 'til the very end
But instead he is just a friend
I wish he was my boyfriend2Embed
