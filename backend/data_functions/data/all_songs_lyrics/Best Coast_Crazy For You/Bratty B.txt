Bratty B Lyrics
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

Pick up the phone, I wanna talk
About my day, it really sucked
The sun was out, I thought I was fine
But then you slipped into my mind
I wanna see you but I know I can't
'Cause you're not home, you're never home
I can't remember why you left
And why you took back all your stuff
I'm sorry I lost your favorite t-shirt
I'll buy you a new one, a better one
Pick up the phone, I wanna talk
About how I miss you
I miss you so much
Hop on a plane
Come back and see me
I promise I won't be such a brat
I promise I won't be such a brat
If I promise you anything, I promise you that
I promise you that I won't be a brat
If I promise you anything, I promise you that
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you, I miss you, I miss you1Embed
