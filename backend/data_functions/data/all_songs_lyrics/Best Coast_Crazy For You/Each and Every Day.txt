Each and Every Day Lyrics
Every day's the same
I feel like I'm losing my mind
All I do is think about you all of the time
I don't even know why I care as much as I do
I just wish that you would tell me is this real or are we through
Ooh, ooh, ooh, la la la
Ooh, ooh, ooh, la la la

Everything I said to you that's not what I meant I've been crazy
That I want you to know that I meant it, I meant it
I meant it all, baby

You
You
You
You will never fall in love
You will never fall in love
You will never fall in love
You will never fall in love

Even though I never get to see what I always want to
And even through the cheatin', all I know is that I want you
I wish we could go back to when I was 17
And I wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't, wouldn't
I wouldn't have been so mean
You
You
You
You will never fall in love
You will never fall in love
You will never fall in love
You will never fall in love

Everyday I wake up and I thank the stars above
For sending me a man who I could really love
If only I could convince you to feel the same way
We could be so very happy each and every day
Each and every day
Each and every dayEmbed
