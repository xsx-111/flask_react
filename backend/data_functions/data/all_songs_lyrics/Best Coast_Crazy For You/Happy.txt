Happy LyricsYeah, there's blood on the wall but I'm happy
Yeah, there's blood on the wall but I'm happy
I'm happy
I'm happy
I'm happy
I'm happy
Yeah, my name's on the wall but I'm happy
Yeah, my name's on the wall but I'm happy
I'm happy
I'm happy
I'm happy
I'm happy
You, you make me happy
Happy

Yeah, your name's on the wall but you're happy
Yeah, your name's on the wall but you're happy
You're happy
You're happy
You're happy
You're happy
When I wake you up you're so cranky
When I wake you up you're so cranky
But you're happy
You're happy
You're happy
You're happy
You, you make me happy
Happy

Happy
You, you make me happy
Happy

Happy
You
And even when you're gone
I listen to my favorite songs
And think about you all night long
'Cause you're the one for me
You're the one for me
You make me so very happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
You make me happy
