Harajuku Girls Lyrics
Wa-mono; there's me, there's you
(ホコ天)
In a pedestrian paradise
Where the catwalk got its claws (Meow)
A subculture, in a kaleidoscope of fashion
Prowl the streets of Harajuku
(いらっしゃいませ)

Super lovers, tell me where you got yours
(At the Super Lovers store)
Yohji Yamamoto, I'm hanging with the locals
Where the catwalk got its claws
All you fashion know-it-alls
With your underground malls
In the world of Harajuku
Putting on a show, when you dress up in your clothes
Wild hair color and cell phones
Your accessories are dead on

Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You're so original, girls
You got the look that makes you stand out
Harajuku Girls, I'm looking at you, girls
You mix and match it, girls
You dress so fly and just parade around
(Arigato)
I'm fascinated by the Japanese fashion scene
Just an American girl in the Tokyo streets
My boyfriend bought me a Hysteric Glamour shirt
They're hard to find in the states, got me feeling couture
(It's really cool)
What's that you got on? Is it Comme des Garçons?
Vivienne Westwood can't go wrong
Mixed up with second-hand clothes
(Let's not forget about John Galliano, no)
Flipped the landscape when Nigo made A Bathing Ape
I got expensive taste, oh well
I guess I better save up

Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
Work it, express it, live it
Command your style
Create it, design it
Now let me see you work it
Create it, design it
Now let me see you work it

You bring style and color all around the world
You Harajuku Girls
You bring style and color all around the world
You Harajuku Girls

Your look is so distinctive, like DNA
Like nothing I've ever seen in the USA
Your underground culture, visual grammar
The language of your clothing is something to encounter
A Ping-Pong match between Eastern and Western
Did you see your inspiration in my latest collection?
Just wait till you get your little hands on L.A.M.B..
'Cause it's super kawaii
That means (Super cute in Japanese)
The streets of Harajuku are your catwalk
(Bishoujo, you're so vogue)
That's what you drop
(Cho saikou, Harajuku Girls)
And that's what you drop, that's what you drop
(Cho saikou, Harajuku Girls)
I'm your biggest fan
Gwen Stefani, you like me
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan (Cho kawaii)
Harajuku Girls, you got the wicked style
I like the way that you are, I am your biggest fan
(Gwen Stefani aishiteru)

Style detached from content
A fatal attraction to cuteness
Style is style, fashion is fashion
Girl, you got style3Embed
