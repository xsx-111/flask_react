The Real Thing Lyrics
I've seen your face a thousand times
Have all your stories memorized
I've kissed your lips a million ways
But I still love to have you around
I've held you too many times to count
I think I know you inside out
And we're together most days
But I still love to have you around

And you're the one I want, and it's not just a phase
And you're the one I trust, our love is the real thing

Don't go away
My love (My love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (My love)
I'm happiest when we spend time

You're a salty water ocean wave
You knock me down, you kiss my face
I know the storms will always come
But I still love to have you around
And Heaven knows what will come next
So emotional, you're so complex
A rollercoaster built to crash
But I still love to have you around
And you're the one I want, and it's not just a phase
And you're the one I trust, our love is the real thing

Don't go away
My love (My love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (My love)
I'm happiest when we spend time
(It's only you and I)
(It's only you and I)

It's you there when I close my eyes
And you in the morning
I never thought you'd still be mine
Or I'd really need to have you around

Don't go away
My love (My love)
I want you to stay
In my life
Don't go away
My lover (My love)
I need you, you're my love supply
Don't go away
In my love supply
I want you to stay
In my life (Every day, every day)
Don't go away
My lover (My love supply)
I need you, you're my love supply3Embed
