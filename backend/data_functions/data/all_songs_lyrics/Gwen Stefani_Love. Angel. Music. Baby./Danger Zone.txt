Danger Zone Lyrics
I can't imagine how hard it must be to be you
Adopting all your history, it's hard bein' me too
Are your secrets where you left them?
'Cause now your ghosts are mine as well
I think it's time I met them, and I think it's time you tell
And you should have told me when you met me all these things I should know
And I should have asked, we should have talked about this so long ago

It's not fair, it's not fair, you don't need me here
Oh, how's this happening to me? It feels so lonely here

We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
What will happen next? You never know

Now we share the closet, now you've let me come inside
And now you're finally undressing, and I feel like I might die
The damage is infectious, the confession is too late
And how can I accept this? How is this happening to me?

It's not fair, it's not fair, help me come up for air
Oh, how's this happening to me? It feels so lonely here
We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
What will happen next? You never know
We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
What will happen next? You never know
You never know (You never know)
You never know

All your secrets
All your lies
All of it

We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
What will happen next? You never know
(I'm completely paralyzed)
We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
(I've crashed ten thousand times)
What will happen next? You never know
(This is the last time)
We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
(How do I deserve this?)
What will happen next? You never know
(I don't know what's going to happen)
We are in a mess, a danger zone (A danger zone)
What will happen next? You never know
(Why would you do this?)
(How could this be happening to me?)1Embed
