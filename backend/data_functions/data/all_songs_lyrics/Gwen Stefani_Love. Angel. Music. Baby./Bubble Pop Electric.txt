Bubble Pop Electric Lyrics
C'mon, Johnny! When you gonna get here?
All right, hold your pretty horses, I'll be there in a minute
You just get yourself dolled up, alright Toots?
You pick a place, you just pick a place!
Um, Johnny?
Yeah, Gwennie-Gwen-Gwen?
You might wanna hurry, because tonight is the night!

I'm empty
I need fulfilling, yes I do, love
A-to the ceiling when I do, love
I get this feeling when I'm in love
I'm restless
Can't you see I try my bestest?
To be good girl, because it's just us
So take me now and do me justice
I'm waiting
A-patiently anticipating
Your arrival, and I'm hating
It takes so long to get to my house
To take me out

Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the backseat
Bubble pop electric
Bubble pop electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble pop electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!
Okay now
I understand he's on his way now
But jeez Louise, I mean today now
I can't wait, I wanna play now (Oooh ooh ooh)
I'm antsy
Bubble pop electric pansies
My sweet tooth, I want your candy
The Queen of Eng would say it's randy (Ha-ha-ha-ha)
I'm itchy
I wish you would come and scratch me
Tonight I'm falling, won't you catch me?
Swoop on by so you can snatch me and take me out

Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the backseat
Bubble pop electric
Bubble pop electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble pop electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!

(I'll get it!)
The need to be satisfied
(Hey Johnny! Lemme go grab my sweater)
Come pick me up, I want a ride
(Hi, Mrs. Stefani) (Bye, Mom!)
Hurry, hurry come to me
(So, baby, where you wanna go, huh?)
Drive-in movie
Drive in, move me
Drive into me
Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie
Take it to the backseat, run it like a track meet
Come to me, drive-in movie
Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie
Take it to the backseat, run it like a track meet
Come to me, drive-in movie

Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the backseat
Bubble pop electric
Bubble pop electric
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
Bubble pop electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!
Tonight, I'm gonna give you all my love in the backseat
(Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie)
Bubble pop electric
(Take it to the back seat, run it like a track meet)
Bubble pop electric
(Come to me, drive-in movie)
Gonna speed it down and slow it up in the backseat
(Bubble pop electric, you've gotta get it
Straight to me, drive-in movie)
Bubble pop electric
Uh-oh, in the backseat!
Yeah, tell your father, I said hello!
Johnny, get outta here!5Embed
