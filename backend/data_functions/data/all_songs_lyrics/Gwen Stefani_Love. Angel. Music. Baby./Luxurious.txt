Luxurious Lyrics
C'est pascet amour
C'est incroyable
Tu me fais transpirer
C'est parfait

Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back

Champagne kisses, hold me in your lap of luxury
I only wanna fly first-class desires
You're my limousine
So elegant, the way we ride
Our passion, it just multiplies
There's platinum lightning in the sky
Look, I'm livin' like a queen

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, ba-by
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton
We're so rich in love, we're rollin' in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly
Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard every night and day
And now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back

Sugar, honey, sexy baby
When we touch, it turns to gold
Sensitive and delicate, kinda like a tuberose
You know you are my treasure chest
It's pure perfection when we kiss and
You're my Mr., I'm your Ms
Gonna be until we're old

This kind of love is getting expensive
We know how to live, baby
We're luxurious, like Egyptian cotton

Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the pay back
The pay back, the pay back
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're loaded, and we're not gonna blow it
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We're hooked up with the love 'cause we grow it
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We got hydroponic love and we're smokin'
Cha-ching, cha-ching
We burn it, you and I, we are so lit

We're so rich in love, we're rollin in cashmere
Got it in fifth gear, baby
Diamond in the rough is lookin' so sparkly

Working so hard every night and day
And now we get to lay back (This is how we roll)
Trying so hard, saving up the paper
Now we get to lay back (Luxurious)
Working so hard, every night and day
And now we get the payback (Baby, we are so... ex-pen-sive ...oh)
The payback, the payback, oh

T'es si jolie
C'est pas possible...  (This is how we roll)
(Luxurious)
(Baby, we are so... ex-pen-sive ...oh)
(This is how we roll)
