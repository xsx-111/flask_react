The walker Lyrics
I am out for a walk
And I will not be back til they're staining my skin
This is how I chose to talk
With some violent hits, violet blossoms akin
Every night I do walk
And if they're looking down I'm offering my chin
This is how I chose to talk
With some violent hits, violet blossoms akin

There's
A way to truly be seen
By furiously skimming in
Forget the jewels, I'm livid
Veins are jutting out fine on their own
Blood on my cheeks, birds come by
One of my stomps and they fly
People politely smile to make sure I won't come any closer

I am out for a walk
And I will not be back til they're staining my skin
This is how I chose to talk
With some violent hits, violet blossoms akin
Every night I do walk
And if they're looking down I'm offering my chin
This is how I chose to talk
With some violent hits, violet blossoms akin
Now
A swollen eye is four days
Of curious calm, snow in May
Way better off on my own
Since no one cries there's no one to blame
It hurts, I feel everything
As my sense of self's wearing thin
Such pains can be a delight
Far from when I could drown in my shame

I am out for a walk
And I will not be back til they're staining my skin
This is how I chose to talk
With some violent hits, violet blossoms akin
Every night I do walk
And if they're looking down I'm offering my chin
This is how I chose to talk
With some violent hits, violet blossoms akin3Embed
