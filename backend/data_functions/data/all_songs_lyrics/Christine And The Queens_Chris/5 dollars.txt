5 dollars Lyrics
Every absent-minded day
I let myself carried away
Then you get 5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby

Kneeling down for all they cared
You let them pay and went ahead
It is still 5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby
5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby

You’re eager and unashamed
I grieve by dying every night baby
Prove them wrong when you get
5 dollars
You’re eager and unashamed
I don’t think the race is over baby
Prove them wrong when you get
5 dollars
5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby

Some of us just had to fight
For even being looked at right
Then you get 5 dollars, baby blues, 5 dollars baby
Pockets full and dried eyes
It turns me on because it’s time
Now throw me 5 dollars baby blues, 5 dollars baby
Throw me 5 dollars baby blues, 5 dollars baby
Throw me 5 dollars baby blues, 5 dollars baby

You’re eager and unashamed
I grieve by dying every night baby
Prove them wrong when you get
5 dollars
You’re eager and unashamed
And I don’t think the race is over baby
Prove them wrong when you get
5 dollars
You’re eager and unashamed
I grieve by dying every night baby
Prove them wrong when you get
5 dollars
You’re eager and unashamed
And I don’t think the race is over baby
Prove them wrong when you get
5 dollars1Embed
