Feel so good Lyrics
You were looking for somebody
Knocking down the steps behind me
You were looking for somebody
Drenched over this acme
Do you feel remotely guilty?
You were looking for somebody

Then it occurred to me
That I might be the one just in place
To remind you
Of something you loathe
I let it backfire in my face
It was just another one
That reminded me
Of when I stand tall

What if the odd balls are dropping just for one fling?
What if the second verse, it doesn't even mean a thing?
What if their politics was just an idea of fun?
I'd be scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
What if the first born it didn't even have a name?
What if the obvious is suddenly so insane?
What if they found how to blossom even more shame?
I'd be scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
Scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
We're all losing to somebody
They lashed out at me: "c'est la vie!"
I was losing to somebody (Losing to somebody)
Crafting our own TVs
Choosing channels over ideas
We're all losers to somebody (We're all losing to somebody)

Then it occurred to me (To me)
That you might (Might)
Be the one (The one)
Just in place to remind me
Of something I lost
I let it backfire in my face
'Cause all of those sorry places
They infected me with high fevers and hope, oh yeah

What if the odd balls are dropping just for one fling?
What if the second verse, it doesn't even mean a thing?
What if their politics was just an idea of fun?
I'd be scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
What if the first born, it didn't even have a name?
What if the obvious is suddenly so insane?
What if they found how to blossom even more shame?
I'd be scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
Scared, as one should, but I'd still feel so good
Scared, as I should, but I'd still feel so good
Scared, as I should, but I'd still feel so good1Embed
