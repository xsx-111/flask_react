Damn (what must a woman do) Lyrics
Let me taste
On a butch babe in LA
Iron and clay, and clay, and clay
Let me spit
On this young man fresh asleep
The end of our friendship
Too deep, too deep

Damn, what must a woman do?
Para follarse, para follarse
Damn, what must a woman do?
Para joderse, para joderse
Do I have to pay?
'Cause I sure can pay, can pay
Do I have to wait?
I don't wanna wait, no way

Let me mourn
The one that corrupted all
How cold she doesn't call, no calls, no calls
Just like before
I'm worn out but I want some more
Naked with opened door
Encore, encore
Damn, what must a woman do?
(Is it how I'm supposed to feel once again?)
Damn, what must a woman do?
(Shame and isolation, crippled with lust)
Damn, what must a woman do?
(Can't you see that I'm soft to the touch, my sister?)
Damn, what must a woman do?
(Brother, can't you see that I'm soft to the touch?)

Damn, what must a woman do?
Para follarse, para follarse
Damn, what must a woman do?
Para joderse, para joderse
Do I have to pay?
'Cause I sure can pay, can pay
Do I have to wait?
I don't wanna wait, no way, ohEmbed
