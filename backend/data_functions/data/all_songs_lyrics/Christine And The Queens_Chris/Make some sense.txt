Make some sense Lyrics
I was nothing before you came out of the bunch of golden players
I didn't think you'd see me
And my, blood is thicker than I thought
We were nothing, nothing at all
We took the bus when the rain would fall
We talked about some comics
I thought I, I would make a great villain

Oh, what did you say then again?
No, no, no

Make some sense out of it all
'Cause I won't make it for you
Choose which side you are on
'Cause I can't do that for you
Oh, now you tell me

How odd to see you on TV
A red right hand and lost at sea
It feels like you can see me
Oh my, what did you just say again?
All the nights we lost in here
When you told me you were a puppeteer
I didn't think you meant it
And now what happened to the mean girls?
Oh, what happened to the mean girls?
No, no, no

Make some sense out of it all
'Cause I won't make it for you
Choose which side you are on
'Cause I can't do that for you
Oh, now you tell me
Make some sense out of it all
'Cause I won't make it for you
Oh, now you tell me
Choose which side you are on
'Cause I can't do that for you
I won't do that for you
I can't do that for you
I won't do that for you1Embed
