The stranger Lyrics
(Water)
Water

Scales fallen from my eyes I followed the bronco
If they ever ask you tell them that I've said no

From the Maserati
I only kept the headlights
From their promised land
I only figured the fights
From his declaration
I only tasted the tears
From the congregation
Flames have been busting for years

Ten, twenty years from now
Nobody will know how
Is it precisely why
You let the mire flow by?

Who is the stranger
Behind the barrels?
Water
For us animals!
Who is the stranger
Behind the barrels?
Water
For us animals!
It took hours to loosen their solid embrace
Force fields are flowing strongly with every displace (Water)

From the Maserati
I only kept the headlights
From their promised land
I only figured the fights
From his declaration
I only tasted the tears
From the congregation
Flames have been busting for years

Ten, twenty years from now
Nobody will know how
Is it precisely why
You let the mire flow by?

Who is the stranger
Behind the barrels?
Water
For us animals!
Who is the stranger
Behind the barrels?
Water
For us animals!
Who is the stranger
Behind the barrels?
Water
For us animals!
Who is the stranger
Behind the barrels?
Water
For us animals!Embed
