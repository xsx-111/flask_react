Big Mistake Lyrics
There's no sign on the gate
And there's mud on your face
Don't you think it's time we re-investigate this situation
Put some fruit on your plate

You've forgotten how it started
Close your eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late
Oh, don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake
I see you fallin'

Got a buzz in my head
And my flowers are dead
Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation
Don't believe what you said

You've forgotten how it started
Close your eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made
And you're down on your knees
It's too late
Oh, don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake
I see you fallin'

I could sting like a bee
Careful how you treat me
Baby, I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation
Close the door as you leave

You've forgotten how it started
Close your eyes
Think of all the bubbles of love we made

And you're down on your knees
It's too late
Oh, don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake (Big mistake)
I see you fallin'
And you cry over me
I can't wait
I feel you stallin'
And you try to reach me
What a big mistake
I hear you callin'
And you're down on your knees
It's too late
Oh, don't come crawlin'
And you lie by my feet
What a big mistake (Big mistake)
I see you fallin'Embed
