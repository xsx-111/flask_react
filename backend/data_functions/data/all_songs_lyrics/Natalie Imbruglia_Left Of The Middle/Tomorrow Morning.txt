Tomorrow Morning LyricsLonely
Lost every part of me
Maybe
Outstayed my company
Walking into sad scenes
Hold me tight
And say goodbye
I've seen behind tomorrow's sky
You'll be my missing alibi
Pull me over backwards
Turn around
And change my mind
Cos I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking
Into my appetite
Tomorrow morning
Are you a friend of mine?
I swear you've left me open
Nowhere to hide this moment
Overcrowded daydreams
We are lost
Or so it seems
Cos I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking
Into my appetite
Tomorrow morning
Are you a friend of mine?
Cos I've been thinking
About our world tonight
Slowly sinking
Into my appetite
Tomorrow morning
Are you a friend of mine?Embed
