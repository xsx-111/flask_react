One More Addiction Lyrics
First the good news, it's gonna feel very nice
Then the bad news, you gotta pay a heavy price
Riptide, we slide, we ride on a deep forbidden sea
Under we go, so slow, and you're hangin' on to me
And I say

Oh, oh, one more addiction in my world
Oh, one more connection to let go
Oh, floating down the river
Out of sight forever from my world
It's the only thing I know how to do

I reject you, but I can't follow through
And I'd forget you, but you end up tappin' on my back door
Somehow I lost myself in a tunnel long and black
Somewhere at the end I pretend there's a way of turnin' back
And I say

Oh, oh, one more addiction in my world
Oh, one more connection to let go
Oh, floating down the river
Out of sight forever from my world
It's the only thing I know how to do
Take a breath, let it out
All the things you frown about
Are meaningless, of course, unless
You're doing this for real, I guess
I meant to, but I don't know what
Is in the way and could I say
It's you, I bet I won't forget
Maybe I'm not ready yet

Oh, oh, one more addiction in my world
Oh, one more connection to let go
Oh, floating down the river
Out of sight forever from my world
Oh, one more addiction in my world
Oh, one more connection to let go
Oh, floating down the river
Out of sight forever from my world

It's the only thing I know how to do
It's the only thing I know how to do
It's the only thing I know how to do
It's the only thing, only thing that I
It's the only thing, the only thing that I
It's the only thing I know, I know how to do
It's the only thing, the only thing that I know how to do
'Cause I'll forget you
