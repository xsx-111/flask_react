Diving In The Deep End LyricsWhy should it be
Someone like me
Could make the same mistakes again
Haven't I learned
People get hurt
When they go diving in the deep end
In the deep end
In the deep end
In the deep end
Thought I was smart
Controlling the art
Of turning off my intuition
Haven't I seen
Since I was fourteen
That life is all just repetition
You lose all your will
You sink or you swim
When you go diving in the deep end
In the deep end
In the deep end
In the deep end
Now it's time to realize
You don't have to agonize
You don't have to compromise
But one thing you must do is open your eyes
Your eyes
Your eyes
Why should it be
Someone like me
Could make the same mistakes again
Haven't I learned
People get hurt
When they go diving
Diving...Embed
