Sunglasses After Dark LyricsI got somethin' to say to you and you better listen
I'm'a tell ya how to be cool in one easy lesson
Go!
Sunglasses after dark!
AAAAAHHHH! They're so sharp!
And you'll be cool
...And the squares'll drool
It's real simple...
Sunglasses after dark!
AAAAAHHHH! They're so sharp!
Listen to this:
Went out last Saturday night
Got myself in a knife fight
Everybody got cut includin' me
'Cause not one of us cats could see!
We had on S.A.D
That's right
I was hangin' around on the street
When this great big guy ran right into me!
I could hardly make him out, everything was so dim
But then I seen what was wrong with him...
He was wearin' sunglasses...after dark
Sunglasses after dark!
Whooooo! They're so sharp!
Sunglasses after dark!
Whooooo! It's so simple!
...Uh, where am I, by the way?
...Oh, yeahEmbed
