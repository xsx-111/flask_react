Mystery Plane LyricsMy Daddy drives a UFO
Drops me off and then he goes
Leaves me on this mystery plane
But he'll be back for me again
Oh, Oh yes he will
Yeah!
Now I just can't identify
With this world so I don't try
Square pegs don't fit in round holes
And I can't fit into these clothes
No
My daddy's unidentified
My mom says I just appeared inside
Looks like a case of hit and run
But off the record it's no fun
No, no, no fun
No!
My daddy he'll come back again
And take me from this mystery plane
And maybe if I go real slow
He'll let me drive his UFO, Oh, Oh, Oh
Oh Boy
My Daddy drives a UFO
My Daddy drives a UFO
My Daddy drives a UFO
U
