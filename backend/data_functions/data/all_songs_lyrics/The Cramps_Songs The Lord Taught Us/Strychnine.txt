Strychnine LyricsSome folks like water
Some folks like wine
But I like the taste
Of straight strychnine
You may think it's funny
That I like this stuff
But once you've tried it
You can't get enough
The wine is red
And poison is blue
Strychnine is good
For what's a-ailin' you
The wine is red
And poison is blue
Strychnine is good
For what's a-ailin' you, oh oh oh
If you listen to what I say
And you try strychnine someday
Make you choke
It'll make you shout
It'll even knock you out
Some folks like water
Some folks like wine
But I like the taste
Of straight strychnine
Strychnine(ay ay)
Strychnine(ay ay)
Strychnine(ay ay)
Strychnine(ay ay)Embed
