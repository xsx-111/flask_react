I Was a Teenage Werewolf LyricsI was a teenage werewolf
Braces on my fangs
I was a teenage werewolf
And no one even said thanks
And no one made me stop
I had a teen-land mind
I had to blow my top
And under teen full moon
No one could make me stop
No one could make me stop
A teenage werewolf
Parallel bars
A teenage girlfriend
Got a lot of scars
Somebody please make me stop
Ohhh please…
You know, I have puberty rights
And I have puberty wrongs
No one understood me
All my teeth were so long
And no one made me stop
A Midwest monster
Of the highest grade
All my teachers thought
It was growing pains, oh no no
Somebody stop this pain, ohhh…2Embed
