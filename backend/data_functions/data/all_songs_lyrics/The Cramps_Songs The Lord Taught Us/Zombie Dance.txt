Zombie Dance LyricsAt the Zombie Dance
Here's Ben and Betty
They tap their toes
But they don't get sweaty
They don't give a damn
They're done dead already
At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
They tap their toes
Yeah, wiggle their ears to get in the groove
Yeah
They do 'The Boogaloo'
At the Zombie Hall
They write "BORN TO LOSE"
On Zombie restroom wall
The kinda life they choose
Ain't life at all
At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
They tap their toes
Yeah, wiggle their ears to get in the groove
Yeah (move!)
Everybody calm down
Nobody blow their cool
Nobody hang around
Zombie dancing school
They do the swim face-down
In the Zombie pool
At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
They tap their toes
Yeah, wiggle their ears to get in the groove
Yeah
At the Zombie Dance
Nobody moves
YeahEmbed
