TV Set Lyrics
Oh baby, I see you in my TV set
Yeah baby, I see you in my TV set
I cut your head off and put it in my TV set
I use your eyeballs for dials on my TV set
I watch TV
I watch TV
Since I put you in my TV set

Oh baby, I hear you on my radio
Yeah baby, I hear you on my radio
You know I flip, flip, flip for my radio
You're going drip, drip, drip on my radio
AM radio
PM radio
Since I tuned you inside my radio... Like this!

Oh baby, I see you in my Frigidaire
Yeah baby, I see you in my Frigidaire
Behind the mayonnaise, way in the back
I'm gonna see you tonight for a midnight snack
But though it's cold
You won't get old
'Cause you're well preserved in my Frigidaire... Yeah!
Oh baby, look so good in my crib at night
Yeah baby, look so good in my crib at night
Oh, I could give you a million hugs
You look so good all covered up in bugs
Oh, I missed some there
Under your chair
But that's all right, I'll sweep you under the rug... Ah ha ha!

Oh baby, I see you in my TV set
Yeah baby, I see you in my TV set
I cut your head off and put it in my TV set
I use your eyeballs for dials on my TV set
I watch TV
I watch TV
Since I seen you I've been so upsetEmbed
