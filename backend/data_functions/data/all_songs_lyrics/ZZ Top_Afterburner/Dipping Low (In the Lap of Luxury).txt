Dipping Low (In the Lap of Luxury) Lyrics
I went around the world till I found the right spot
It was ultra sweet and just a little bit hot

Dipping low in the lap of luxury
Dipping low in the lap of luxury

Now if you get down there you'll be doing it right
Yeah, once you got it you better hold on tight

Dipping low in the lap of luxury
Dipping low in the lap of luxury

Now if you wanna break down I'll hold my head up high
I'm a good mechanic, I'll go over you in style

Dipping low in the lap of luxury
Dipping low in the lap of luxuryEmbed
