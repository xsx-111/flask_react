Delirious Lyrics
I went down to dock number ten
To see what just came in

They seemed a little bit mysterious
I think I'm gonna get delirious
Delirious
Delirious

I got nailed in a raid last night
They tried to haul me off to jail

Things were looking kind of serious
Until everybody got delirious
Delirious
Delirious

I fell into a hand of cards
And almost blew the night away

Things were looking kind of furious
Until everybody got delirious
Delirious
Delirious
I overloaded and I saw the light
Decadence was on my mind

Everything was getting ridiculous
Until everybody get delirious
Delirious
DeliriousEmbed
