Stages Lyrics
It's a fine time to fall in love with you
I ain't got a single thing to do
It happened before I knew what was going on
I fell out and knew that I was gone

Stages keep on changing
Stages rearranging love

Then you left me standing all alone
I couldn't even get you on the phone
Were you just confused and didn't know
If you should stay or if you had to go?

Stages keep on changing
Stages rearranging love

Now you're back and say you're gonna stay
I wouldn't have it any other way
Tell me it's for real and let me know
Why does loving have to come and go
Stages keep on changing
Stages rearranging loveEmbed
