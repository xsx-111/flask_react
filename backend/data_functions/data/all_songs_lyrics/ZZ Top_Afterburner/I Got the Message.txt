I Got the Message Lyrics
I'm picking up on a signal
That's in the air tonight
It's sparking my receiver
It feels like dynamite

I got the message
But I want to get it straight from you

My mind is electric
I'm about to blow a fuse
The cockpit is empty
So shoot it down the tube

I got the message
But I want to get it straight from you

I've got to make a connection
I'm on needles and pins
Working up a printout
And I'm going to zero in
I got the message
But I want to get it straight from youEmbed
