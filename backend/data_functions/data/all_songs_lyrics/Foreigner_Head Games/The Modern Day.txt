The Modern Day Lyrics
I stand up for my pride
I don't want to be just like anyone
In this world I cannot hide
I must finish what I have begun
That's the way I play
In the modern day
Because I want to stay
In the modern day
Got a picture in my mind
Of the way that I wanna be
So I search until I find
The power inside of me
It's another phase
Of the modern day

Got to face up to this life
Can't let it get the best of me
So I make a sacrifice
If that's the way it has to be

I'm doing what I feel is right
I'm ready if I need to fight
In the modern way

Like a motor in overdrive
I feel good and I feel alive
I got no need to beg or borrow
Got a shortcut to tomorrow
And I'm on my way
To the modern day
Got a lot to say
In the modern day
Because I need to stay
In the modern day

In the modern dayEmbed
