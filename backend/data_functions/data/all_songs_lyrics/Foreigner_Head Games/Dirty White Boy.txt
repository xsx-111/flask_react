Dirty White Boy Lyrics
Hey, baby, if you're feeling down
I know what's good for you all day
Are you worried what your friends see
Will it ruin your reputation loving me

'Cause I'm a dirty white boy
Yeah, a dirty white boy
A dirty white boy

Don't drive no big black car
Don't like no Hollywood movie star
You want me to be true to you
You don't give a damn what I do to you

I'm just a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, dirty white boy
Dirty white boy

I've been in trouble since I don't know when
I'm in trouble now and I know somehow I'll find trouble again
I'm a loner, but I'm never alone
Every night I get one step closer to the danger zone
Because I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, yeah, dirty white boy
Dirty white boy, I'm a dirty white boy
Dirty white boy

Yeah!Embed
