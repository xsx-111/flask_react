Seventeen Lyrics
Late last night
I get a call from a so-called friend
He wouldn't give his name
Says he saw you with another man
Feels like seventeen years
It's only seventeen days
Since I saw the real you
And I let you walk away
You left me broken
You left me stranded
The way you play this game of love
It's just plain underhanded
I spent a lot of time
And I spent all my money
Don't want no other fool
To put his hands on you
Who you been talking to?
Yeah who you been walking with?

Seventeen, you're just seventeen
Seventeen

They said I was playing with fire
I knew I had to take a chance
I had to take you higher
To a new experience
But little did I know
I'd never get that far
Girl, you know you put on quite a show
You're going to be a star
When you grow older, girl
You'll remember I told you, girl
