Women Lyrics
Women behind bars
Women in fast cars
Women in distress
Women with no dress
Women in aeroplanes
Women who play games
Women in uniform
See that woman with her clothes torn

Women who satisfy
Women you can't buy
Like women in magazines
And women in a limousine
Women who sip champagne
Women who feel no pain
Women in a disco
And women who don't wanna know, know, know

Oh women wanting sympathy
Women feeling ecstasy
Women who live in fantasies
Bringing man to his knees
Women who fall in love
Women who need a shove
Women who can't be beat
Get that woman in the back seat, yeah, yeah
Women in the U.S.A
Those women steal your heart away
Women into rock and roll
Women who steal the show, go, go, go

Women that you write songs about
Women that turn around and kick you out
Women you dream about all your life
Women that stab you in the back with a switchblade knife

Oh women, ooh, ooh
Talk about women
Around the world
Yeah women
Oh no, it goes
Talking about women
Come on babyEmbed
