Ignition LyricsThe sick and complicated eyes are mine to find
A way inside
The hold you break, the one you break, you should have done
Inside
Leave me alone
I can't take forever I know
Leave me alone
I can't take forever I know
The sick and complicated eyes are mine
The sick and complicated eyes are mine to find
A way inside
Watch out, you're going to burn yourself, you hate yourself
Which way inside
Leave me alone
I can't take forever I know
Leave me alone
I can't take forever I know
Happiness is hard
When I am stretched out ahead
On the floor that's what I readÂ­Embed
