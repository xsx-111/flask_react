(No One) Not Even The Rain LyricsThe first and lonely days have come
A sea of state and a heaven unknown
And I don't like the air that I breathe
It can't escape from me
I don't belong to this world
No more to better myself
Why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again
Why don't you save me again
I can't do anything
Not even the rain has such small hands
Another kick my soul can't stand
And I don't like the air that I breathe
And I don't like the air that I breathe
It can't escape from me
I don't belong to this world
No more to better myself
Why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again
Why don't you save me again
I can't do anything
When honesty is mine to ride
A gem dissolving shadowslide
Down you better not drown
What are you going to do
When the sky falls out of this world
I don't belong to this world
No more to better myself
Why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again
Why don't you save me again
I can't do anything
I don't belong to this world
No more to better myself
Why don't you do it again
Why don't you say it again
Why don't you save me again
I can't do anythingEmbed
