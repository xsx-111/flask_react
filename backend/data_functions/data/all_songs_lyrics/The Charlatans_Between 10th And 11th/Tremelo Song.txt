Tremelo Song LyricsThe birds don't sing they crush my skull and I am worthless
And the heights of what I stand up to are not in you
And I can't get no words with no feelings from nothing
I don't know where you could ever go

I wonder why you bleach the sky
You could not break these strings of mine
I never knew to walk back to
A place that now belongs to you
In body
A three point conversation in doors with no meaning
When the world won't listen then you make your own way forward
Get out not going to waste outside
And I don't know where you could ever know

I wonder why you bleach the sky
You could not break these strings of mine
I never knew to walk back to
A place that now belongs to you
In body
I wonder why, you bleach the sky
And could not break these strings of mine
I never knew to walk back to a place
That now belongs to you
I wonder why you reach the sky
For liars and lies and turns
For terms sake I never going to walk back to a place
That nows belongs to you
