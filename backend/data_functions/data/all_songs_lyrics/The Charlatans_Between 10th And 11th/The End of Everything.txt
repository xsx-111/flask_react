The End of Everything LyricsThere's no soldier in me
Although I try to believe
That all is not in always what you see
Army featherweights are bully boys without homes
I recognise the mastermind device
The end of everything
You're dead in me forever
The end of everything
You're dead in me forever
No education I want
Besides the one that I've got
Divorce me from the zeros what do they know
20th century cultureless stereotypes
Waving words worth nothing to me now
The end of everything
You're dead in me forever
The end of everything
You're dead in me forever
They only want a "yes-man"
They will tell you what to believe and no
Yes I do
I only want to be strong
There is no soldier in me
I want my guts where they are
Not dumb to these false leaders anymore
And now you want to achieve another worthless defeat
Welcome here the heroes they're on their way home
The end of everything
You're dead in me forever
The end of everything
You're dead in me forever
They only want a "yes-man"
They will tell you what to believe and no
Yes I do
I only want to be strongEmbed
