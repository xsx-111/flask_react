Chewing Gum Weekend LyricsDon't ask me to socialise
A third degree has blown my eyes
Express a feeling captured once
The one I want surprised me once
A citrus state to be in one
And one is like a God in lime
A black inside I know too well
To wear my worth and buy the grind
And not to waste this scene on
And it's not my Independence that I'm afraid of this time
And not to base this scene on
And it's not my Independence I'm ashamed of
And one dissolved in sea again
A third degree has blown my eyes
And in the end your end is clean
A conscious state to call my own
I don't remember the way you used to be
And not to waste this scene on
And it's not my Independence that I'm afraid of this time
And not to base this scene on
And it's not my Independence I'm ashamed of
Don't ask me to socialise
The world has blown the love outside
And I can't tell if you are wrong
The one who turns to me alone
And not to waste this scene on
And it's not my Independence that I'm afraid of this time
And not to base this scene on
And it's not my Independence I'm ashamed of
I don't remember the way you used to beEmbed
