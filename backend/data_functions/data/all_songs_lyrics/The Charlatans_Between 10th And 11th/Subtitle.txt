Subtitle LyricsMouth like sugar shiver
Finger-lashes stick on
I don't know how to get off on this
You're not the same as everybody else why talk to her
Most song shambles pick on
Normal hang on(s) stick on
I don't know how to get off on her
You're not the same as everybody else why
Observation taken on, our way on
A body kiss for you and I am straight on
I don't prescribe the why's outside I weigh up all the ghost
You're not the same as everybody else why talk to her
I don't know how to get off on this
You're not the same as everybody else why talk to her
Mouth like sugar shiver
Rant on worship heaven
One on - one eye - with eye
Wankers over workers
What I want I hang on
I have negative unbalance my gutsEmbed
