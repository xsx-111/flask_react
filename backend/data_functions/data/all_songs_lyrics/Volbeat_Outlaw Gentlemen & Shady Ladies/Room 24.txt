Room 24 Lyrics
Caught in the darkness
The room's feeling colder
My body's on hold
Lying in bed and unable to move

The darkness in twenty-four
Former guests who live no more
So many hands to hold you down (Down, down)

My mind is awake
I open my eyes
But it's so hard to breathe
Something is in here
To silence my screams

The darkness in twenty-four
Steal your breath away once more
Oh, it's happening again


See the old hag sitting over me
The smell of rotten breath and blasphemy
No way out, only darkness here
Feel my eyes filling up with fear
Will someone hear me crying out for help
In room twenty-four
In room twenty-four
In room twenty-four
Caught in the darkness
The room's feeling colder
My body's on hold
Lying in bed and unable to move

Sadness is a falling tear
Turning into liquid fear
Who killed who, we'll never know
Oh, we'll never know
(Never tell, never tell, never tell, never tell)

See the old hag sitting over me
The smell of rotten breath and blasphemy
No way out, only darkness here
Feel my eyes filling up with fear
Will someone hear me crying out for help
In room twenty-four
In room twenty-four
In room twenty-fourEmbed
