Dead but Rising Lyrics
Dear wind of Mississippi, can you call him by name?
I have followed his wings on a sunny day

I like to believe he's The Chosen One
I like to believe he's the fallen one
Dead but rising

I raise the fist, raise the fist with power and fate
And wishing that his claws will grab onto my hand

I like to believe he's The Chosen One
I like to believe he's the fallen one
Dead but rising

I have been to the end of waters
I have been to the end of Earth
I've been over mountains and riding the storms
Dear son, your words have reached me
And for that, I can carry on
I'll guide you in Spirit, today I'll be home
I like to believe he's the fallen one
I like to believe he's The Chosen One
The rebirth of man heals a bleeding Heart
The Eagle of Kings wears my father's Soul
Dead but rising6Embed
