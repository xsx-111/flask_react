Ecotone Lyrics
I'm the wilderness that eats your bones
You crossed the mark from your civil zone
I might be narrow I might be wide
We share the same line at the same time
Alienized that's how I feel
One foot here and another there
And in between I'll find a name
But what I see is all the same

When you think you are alone
I'm right by your side
Well they call me ecotone
The cold boundary knife

I'm the second when the lights go out
Caught in between there's no way out
The edge effect that's what it is
But still in the center of the place
Changing colors right in front of you
Even though we are one in two
Sharing the balance of the ecotone
Makes the alien breathe no more
When you think you are alone
I'm right by your side
Well they call me ecotone
The cold boundary knife

When you think you are alone
I'm right by your side
Well they call me ecotone
The cold boundary knife

When you think you are alone
I'm right by your side
Well they call me ecotone
The cold boundary knife

Well you thought you were alone
But I was right there by your side
Still they call me the ecotone
The cold boundary knifeEmbed
