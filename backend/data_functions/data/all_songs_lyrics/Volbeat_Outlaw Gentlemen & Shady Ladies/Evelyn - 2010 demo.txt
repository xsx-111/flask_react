Evelyn - 2010 demo LyricsGet off my shoulders I told you to stay away you're still a big part of me
Dance with delusional angels of sin
Kill false demons you might kill false angels too
That's not what we wanna do
Together as one we do as we're told living together and fighting as one
Rejecting what's "good" with so called evil included
The dominant mind will prove you all blind
Finding the balance to leave you behind
I've learned so far controlling all the dark
Evelyn visions in the sky, all on my shoulder, all in my mind
I still hear you sing my sweet love Evelyn
In fact I'm so cold, but I made up my mind to see where it will lead
In fact I'm so lonely I...

Stay away you're still a big part of me
Dance with delusional angels of sin
Kill false demons you might kill false angels too
That's not what we wanna do
Evelyn visions in the sky, all on my shoulder, all in my mind

I still hear you sing my sweet love Evelyn
In fact I'm so cold, but I made up my mind to see where it will lead
In fact I'm so lonely I...
Don't listen to all the bollocks
There's nothing on either shoulder
Spreading the fire fever into something more that needs ya
Maybe you fall forever and maybe we die together

Angel Evelyn I die
I still hear you sing my sweet love Evelyn
In fact I'm so cold, but I, I made up my mind to see where it will lead
In fact I'm so lonely I...1Embed
