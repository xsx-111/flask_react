The Sinner Is You Lyrics
What's life without a little pain?
The good thing is on a little break
You'll be fine and up again, yeah
The goal is to bring the human back
To the world, cause nothing will last
But bring it home as a friend, yeah yeah

The sinner is you
The sinner is you

I'm the collector of the good
Spirits of mother earth
Hell is life drying up, yeah
I see and hear more than I wish
The seal has broken up again
One life on earth fades away again

The sinner is you
The sinner is you

There's been a kill in the spirit world
The ultimate sinner just don't know
There's been a kill in the spirit world
The ultimate sinner just don't know
Is there forgiveness?
Do we all deserve our blessing
Is there forgiveness?
Do we all deserve our blessing from the spirit world?
Is this a sign for all of us
To take care of the life we have
Please wake up, feel love, yeah
I see and hear more than I wish
The seal has broken up again
One life on earth fades away again

The sinner is you
The sinner is youEmbed
