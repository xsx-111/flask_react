Pearl Hart Lyrics
Lady Pearl in jail, lady Pearl in jail
You'll rise
Lady Pearl in jail, lady Pearl in jail
You'll fight

A letter from her mother now dying in her bed
Get on home quickly with the medicine
No money in her pocket, no wheels to get ahead
She grabbed her Colt .44 and

Went along the mountain side
Mama love I'm on my way, don't you cry
I'll make it just in time, oh
Mama love I'm on my way, don't you cry
Please hold on

The young lady Pearl was dressed in a man's jeans and a shirt
A stagecoach was stopped and robbed were three passengers
Gave each of them a dollar, enough for them to eat
Then she disappeared down south and

Went along the mountain side
Mama love I'm on my way, don't you cry
I'll make it just in time
Mama love I'm on my way, don't you cry
Lady Pearl in jail, lady Pearl in jail
You'll rise
Lady Pearl in jail, lady Pearl in jail
You'll rise


Lady Pearl in jail, lady Pearl in jail
You'll rise
Lady Pearl in jail, lady Pearl in jail
You'll rise
