My Body Lyrics
Stop, the train is ridin' down to the station
Where you lived when we were school kids
Hey, the rails are caught now
And I am falling down fools in a spiral
Round this town of steel

My body tells me, no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more
My body tells me, no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more

Stop the train is riding down to the station
Where I lived when I was a cool kid
Hey, is it my fault that the fallen embers
Burn down in a spiral
Round your crown of thieves?

My body tells me, no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more
My body tells me, no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more
And it rides out of town
Oh, it's my road, it's my road, it's my road
It's my road, it's my road, it's my road
And it's my war, it's my war, it's my war
His eyes are open, his eyes are open
Oh, 'cause I want more, I want more, I want more
His eyes are open, his eyes are open
Hey, hey, hey

My body tells me, no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more
My body tells me, no, but I won't quit
'Cause I want more, 'cause I want more
And it rides out of town1Embed
