You Say LyricsHere in the light
It burns you up inside
Here in the shell of a sun
We echo on
Too much listening
Not enough living
CHORUS
And you say
What did
I say
What did
You say
We just
Go away
Go away
Go away
It helps you out
Knowing I'm left out
Locked in a box with a light
That won't shine
Turn it on and wait for
Someone to come
CHORUS
I'm here now
Waiting
Holding on to reasons
Wasted
I faced it
Watching you deny me
Here in the light
It burns you up sometimes
Here in the shell of a sun
We echo on
Left alone forever
All alone together
CHORUS to fadeEmbed
