All of You LyricsSo you say
I'm too quiet
Holding things
Up in my head
I say so much
But you don't buy it
I don't want to wake up
Alone in my head
Say that you'll never go now
Don't go don't go
CHORUS
I need a lot of you
I want a lot of you
I need a lot of you
All of you
I tend to think
I'm getting nowhere
I drag it out
Whenever I can
Someday
I'll get back there
And find the world
You dropped from your head
Oh but some things you'll never show now
I know
I know
CHORUS
Watch you coming up
Out on top now
Watch you coming up
