Remember the Tin Man Lyrics
There are locks on the doors
And chains stretched across
All the entries to the inside
There's a gate and a fence
And bars to protect
From only God knows what lurks outside
Who stole your heart? Left you with a space
That no one and nothing can fill
Who stole your heart? Who took it away?
Knowing that without it you can't live

Who took away the part
So essential to the whole?
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber?
What thief?
Who stole your heart?
And the key?

Who stole your heart?
The smile from your face
The innocence the light from your eyes
Who stole your heart or did you give it away?
And if so then when and why?
Who took away the part
So essential to the whole?
Left you a hollow body
Skin and bone
What robber?
What thief?
Who stole your heart?
And the key?
Now all sentiment is gone
Now you have no trust in no one

Who stole your heart?
Did you know but forget
The method and moment in time?

Was it a trickster
Using mirrors and sleight of hand?
A strong elixir
Or a potion that you drank?

Who hurt your heart?
Bruised it in a place
That no one and nothing can heal
You've gone to wizards
Princes and magic men
You've gone to witches
The good, the bad, the indifferent
But still all sentiment is gone
But still you have no trust in no one

If you can tear down the walls
Throw your armor away
Remove all roadblocks barricades
If you can forget there are bandits
And dragons to slay
And don't forget that you defend an empty space

And remember the Tin Man
Found he had what he thought he lacked
Remember the Tin Man
Go find your heart and take it back

Who stole your heart
Maybe no one can say
One day you will find it I prayEmbed
