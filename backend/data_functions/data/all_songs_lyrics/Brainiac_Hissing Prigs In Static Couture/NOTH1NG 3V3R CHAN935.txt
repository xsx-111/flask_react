NOTH1NG 3V3R CHAN935 Lyrics
If you never fake a grin on your face
What you would understand
That the hands that are changing
You're an accident, never could happen
You wish you never learned of this dress
The greatest of fashion, worn by a passionate debutante
Your favorite thing she wears

Scream if you want to scream
Put your hands on a livewire
And cross that reasoning out
Do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Your body can't tell you how
Do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Nothing ever changes
On its own

Brush the dust off the wheel
You turn it over but it veers like an open jalopy
The motor scrapes but the wheel is stuck
Stuck on a straight line
While everything else is just a big fat proof that further disaster can happen
Scream if you want to scream
Put your hands on a livewire
And cross that reasoning out
Do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Nobody can tell you how
Do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Nothing ever changes
Wipe your face and move these tears
It's time you put them out

Of course that's the reason we're out
Do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Nobody can tell me how
Do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Nothing ever changes
Wipe your face and move these tears
A conversation ebbs and twists
Wipe these fears
It's time you put them outEmbed
