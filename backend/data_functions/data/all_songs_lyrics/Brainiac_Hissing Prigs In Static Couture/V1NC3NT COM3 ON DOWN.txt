V1NC3NT COM3 ON DOWN LyricsKiss all the babies, and rub the politicos
Vincent come on down
The boys are rock stupid, but the girls can tell
And they tell and they tell and they tell
Slice one open for the unknown soldier
Vincent come on down
It's half past the minute
And you're stuck down in it, get up get on or get out!
I don't think you can tell me
The things that I want you to
Short of a cataclysmic seduction
Nothing can stop my car crash attack on you (Ah!)
Give me the medicine, give me the medicine
Vincent come on down
Dance on the back of a pauper in suede
To the rhythm of the sights of sounds
Shake those cleats out, take off your raincoat
Vincent come on down
You're one shot under and you've blown your cover
Put your hands and your face or the ground
I don't think you can tell me
The things that I want you to
Short of a cataclysmic seduction
Nothing can stop my car crash attack on you!
Said come on down
2, 4, 6, 8!
Tell me who I'm supposed to hate!
I can't quit the goose step, tell me it's a two-step process!
Da-da-da-da-da-da
AHHHHHHH!
Oh, Vincent come on down
Vincent come on down
Vincent come on down
