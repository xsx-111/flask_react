B33K33P3R5 MAX1M Lyrics
Forget about the drones
Forget about the spots
On your eyes
And your hands
And your hands

Shine high, birdseye
Caught in high tide
Caught in hi-fi now

I am the beekeeper's queen
He keeps me wrapped in a film that's translucent
I can see you
I can see you

Shine high, birdseye
Caught in high tide
Caught  in high tide now

Shine high, birdseye
Caught under there
Shine high, birdseye
She's caught in high tide nowEmbed
