TH15 L1TTL3 P199Y Lyrics
Which little piggy has dirtied her nails? Who who? You do
Tell me the story, where do you get it? Softly, voodoo?
When you stain with your sparkly teeth, what do you hear?
Pick up transmission with your tin bunny ears
Do I respect you? Admire your tricks? No

(You can't win)
What do you think about that?
(You can't win)
This little piggy's been a welcomed out

This little piggy has a fork in her tongue, ooh ooh, my my
Will I decode all the words from your mouth? Do you? Tell me
Well I'm strung out, and brimming with peculiar words
Don't think she'll follow, but I know what I heard
Do I believe all your cheap rhetoric? No

(You can't win)
What do you think about that?
(You can't win)
This little piggy's been a welcomed out
They offer your friends up for acrobats
(Ay, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, so, so, so)
Some can call it a time
When I say, "Why couldn't you?"
Why do me?

This little piggy, is locked in a vault
Hates light, Sunlight
Hides in the daytime, comes out after dusk
Ooh ooh, scares you
I could huff and I could puff and blow your stick house down
Flatter than flat, imagine the sound
Should I go easy? Forgive and forget? No

(You can't win)
What do you think about that?
(You can't win)
This little piggy's been a welcome out
They offer your friends up for acrobatsEmbed
