70 K9 MAN Lyrics
Mistakes mistakes, we are owed
Reason restate manipulate and do it again

Wake the tragics, then shine out the magnets, then fire up the hissing machine
Rocket in my pocket is a picture of number one
The sheriffs are stupid, humanoid blueprint nicknamed catch of the day
Retarded spider with a hot splash shooting the sun

Get the guards
Run them over
Cracker smash the gate
Rule the world
Break the tether
Slipknot saves the day

Three cheers, one kiss, and a punch
We love him like a shot of crutch
So let's all give a warm, warm hand
To the 70 kilogram man

Site the target, forget the margin and tear the fishnet down
Approach when the hero steps off in the pillar of salts
Flip the prediction and put on your friction suits and a couple of gloves
Lay the decoy heroin down for the count
Split the trap, hold the last token
Magic for the guns
Hold it in, hold it open
Snap this cap and run

Three cheers, one kiss, and a punch
We love him like a shot of crutch
So let's all give a warm, warm hand
To the 70 kilogram man
Three cheers, one kiss, and a punch
We love him like a shot of crutch
So let's all give a warm, warm hand
To the 70 kilogram man

Mistakes mistakes, we are owed
Reason restate manipulate and do it again
Mistakes mistakes, we are owed
Reason restate manipulate and do it again
Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes, mistakes
Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes, mistakesEmbed
