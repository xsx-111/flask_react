5TRUN9 Lyrics
I've got you for the day
Don't you try to escape

Watch the telephone
With my handsome face
Slowly it sinks
Gives me time to think
Looove

I told the fire
No response is wired
Don't try to break
Loose, get's in my way
Out of my way

I've got you for the day
Don't you try to escape

Hey, don't you go
Never promise spoke
Was I all that bad
Was I all that bad
LoooveEmbed
