1 AM A CRACK3D MACHIN3 LyricsI am a cracked machine
I am a guide wire hussy
I am your favorite DJ
A blip on the screen
I am a cracked machine
I am a hotshot robot
Short my position
I guarantee
You cannot get to me
You cannot get to me
Burn honey halo
Just for my shoulders
Mercy for me
I won't pretend that I deserved it
Bitched up static, burnt cinematic
Tragedy
Don't melt me down, till the crisis is over
No
I am a cracked machine
I am a guide wire hussy
I am your favorite DJ
A blip on the screen
Sixteen sergeants stacked like matchsticks
Mercy for me
Knock the first one down and they all fall over
Waaaaaohhhhhh
First time I forced myself to be real
And when the turn it up
To saturate it
And they all tear me apart
They never gave me a chance
It's an answer, to the question
It's planned, obsolescent to fact
I am a cracked machine
I am a hotshot robot
I am a guide wire hussy
I am your blip on the screen
Aaaaaaah
I am a cracked machine
I am a guide wire hussy
I am your favorite DJ
I am a cracked machineEmbed
