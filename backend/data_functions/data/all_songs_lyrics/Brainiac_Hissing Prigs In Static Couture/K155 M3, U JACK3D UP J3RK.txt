K155 M3, U JACK3D UP J3RK Lyrics
(?Spanish?? locos )
Why does the bad luck chase me around
And nip at my cuffs
Like a psychotic Japanese chihuahua
(Chi-wa-wa, chi-wa-wa, chi-wa-wa)
That's right, a chihuahua-wa-wa
What can I do?

I tried nasty little phrases
And repellent creams
Stole Mondale's bulletproof limousine
I wrote in lazy espa√±ol
But I think she only speaks in jazz
(Como el Satchmo)
Da-boom-di-ba, dyah!


I wish I had a brain in my head
Then I could tell when I'm lying
And tell when I'm telling the truth
Wait, is this a candid observation -
Or a calculated gift for the myth I've created
That's based on a story that could eat me alive
As quick as the noon is high
Narrated by Charole and hispanic retro-ghetto jive
Give me five
Sixteen seconds ago
They fell fell back and was over then
Now she's dragging me down
Slap my hands on the chalk again

Let me kill you
Crazy eyes, crazy hands
I want it over, under
Your safety's falling
Like a goddamn shark attack

Like a goddamn shark attack
(incomprehensible hyperactive screams)
I believe she said, "Kiss me"
Kiss me, you jacked up jerk
Kiss me, you jacked up jerk
Kiss me, you geeked(?) up son of a cutthroat bambito-kapow
(Besame tu manatada)
I guess you like me now
