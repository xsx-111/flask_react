Birdie Told Me Lyrics
Birdie, told me, I must get over you, somehow
And she told me, never to think of you, right now

But it's hopeless to say
How can I forget the way she used to love me
I think about her in my time
Know in my mind, it's over

Looks like falling
Heaven is calling my name to me
Funny faces loving the traces, memory




Birdie taught me, how to get over youEmbed
