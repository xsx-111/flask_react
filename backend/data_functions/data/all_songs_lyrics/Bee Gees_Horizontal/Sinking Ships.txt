Sinking Ships LyricsSinking ships
Watching them sail and the sun as sinks in the sea
Crashing planes
Only the eyes of the doomed with a smile on their face
So I say to myself Is it real?
So I look inside myself
Can I feel?
Coloured cups
Windows that slide up and down with a squeak in the side
Funny day
Banging the door to a close as it's hurting my kneeEmbed
