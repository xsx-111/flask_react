The Change Is Made LyricsLook out my window. I can see tomorrow
Just a whole way of sorrow when the change is made
And I've been a-cryin'
Oh, Lord, I've been a cryin'
But I'll go on a-cryin' when the change is made
And I been a good man. Oh Lord, Lord, I've been a good man
But what's good's a good man after the change is made? Yeah!
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, the love, the love I been a-gettin'
I've got to go on a-livin' after the change is made
And I been a-cryin'. Oh Lord, Lord, I been a-cryin'
But I got to go on a-cryin' after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, love I been a-gettin.'
'Cause I got to go on living after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love, all the love I been a-gettin'
And I got to go on livin' after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' all the love I been gettin'
But I got to go on living after the change is made
And I'm not forgettin' ...Embed
