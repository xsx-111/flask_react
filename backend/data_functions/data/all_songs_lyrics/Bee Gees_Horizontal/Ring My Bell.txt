Ring My Bell LyricsLet me show you how to be alive
There's no use to worry
Good luck's not far behind
Let me see you keep a steady life
It's no use to hurry
Nobody needs your wife
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Lend him a gentle hand
Show him that we can laugh
Be at his side
It's not so far away
Let me show you how to be alive
There's no use to worry
Good luck's not far behind
Let me see you keep a steady life
It's no use to hurry
Nobody needs your wife
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me to
Ring my bell if you want me toEmbed
