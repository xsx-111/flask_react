The Earnest of Being George LyricsYou better run just as fast as you can
I've got no reason to try
You did it to me and I'm taking a stand
You've got a reason to cry
Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me
Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid (all right)
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me
Spent my life making my love to you
I've got no reason to try
Got no reason left for making you blue
You've got a reason to cry
Fairy stories in the penny arcade
You bought my love and I paid
I'm not trying to make history
You could have been good to me
You better run just as fast as you can
You better run just as fast as you can..Embed
