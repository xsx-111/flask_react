With the Sun in My Eyes Lyrics
I do not need you
Nor do I listen to the words you say
Strongly I heed you
But every promise seems to fade away

Who is the clown
That walks in the steps of my shadow?
Is it the man
Who does what he can but never does it right?

How can I prove?
There is no reasoning or asking why
Only to prove
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes



I love you deeply with the sun in my eyes
I love you deeply with the sun in my eyesEmbed
