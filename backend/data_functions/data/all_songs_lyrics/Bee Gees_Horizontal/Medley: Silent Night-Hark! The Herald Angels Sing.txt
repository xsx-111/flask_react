Medley: Silent Night/Hark! The Herald Angels Sing LyricsHark the herald angels sing
A new king born today
And man will live forevermore
Because of Christmas Day
Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon virgin, mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleeping heavenly's peace
Sleeping heavenly's peace
The first Noel, the first Noel
Born is the king of Israel
The first Noel, the first Noel
Born is the king of Israel
Hark the herald angels sing
Listen to what they say
That man will live forevermor–µ
Because of Christmas dayEmbed
