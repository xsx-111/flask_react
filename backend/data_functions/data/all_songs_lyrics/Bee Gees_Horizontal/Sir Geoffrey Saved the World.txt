Sir Geoffrey Saved the World LyricsAh.....
Ev'ry day's Saturday, feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicar Hays approaching town, preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Dinner time, anytime, see a crown, should be mine
Ev'ryone's grabbing but no one will get
Sunny day, should I care, taking in the garden air
Ev'ryone's happy though no one can see
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Ah...
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
Ev'ry day's Saturday, feeling in steadily
Laughing at people with stars in their eyes
Vicar Hays approaching town, preaching in the underground
Talking with the lambs who came out of the sky
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the world
You know how Sir Geoffrey saved the worldEmbed
