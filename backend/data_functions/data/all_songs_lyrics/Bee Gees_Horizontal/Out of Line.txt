Out of Line LyricsOne day, when you’re out of line
You’ll say, can you spare the time?
Oh I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will play
Some say, there’s another day
I’m sure, that my thing’s ok
Though I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will play
I am your friend
Though I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will say
One day, when you’re out of line
You’ll say, can you spare the time
Though I know you’re out of line
Yes I know you’re out of line
And you will say, everyday
And you will play
We say yes, we say yes, we say yes, we say yes
We say yes, we say yes, we say yes, we say yesEmbed
