Harry Braff LyricsCheckered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Goodbye Harry Braff, it's so good to see him win the race
And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there
And getting a good view of Harry Braff, Harry Braff
Realise Harry Braff and the Mayor of Gordon cheers him on
Ev'ry mile, see him smile with the dust in his eyes
Ev'ryone's crying for Harry Braff. Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye! Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye!
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Checkered flag, checkered flag, checkered flag for Harry Braff
Goodbye, Harry Braff, its so good to see him win the race
And the crowd, feeling proud to spend all day out there
And getting a good view of Harry Braff. Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye! Harry Braff
Goodbye! Harry Braff. Goodbye!
