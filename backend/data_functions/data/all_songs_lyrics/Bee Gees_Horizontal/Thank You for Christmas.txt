Thank You for Christmas LyricsThank you for Christmas
For every little thank
We stand alone
And thank you a lot
For every child we'll sing
In your town, your dreamer bells
And time pass ticks away
A child you always think about
He is all night and day
Thank you for Christmas
For every little thank
We stand alone
And thank you a lot
Every child will singEmbed
