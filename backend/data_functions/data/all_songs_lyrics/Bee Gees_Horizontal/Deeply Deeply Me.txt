Deeply Deeply Me LyricsDeeply deeply deeply me
Deeply deeply deeply me
Gave my love a diamond ring
Platinum engagement thing
She told me our love can be
Deeply deeply deeply me
Taking thousand footstep drops
To the (parts) and from the top
I can't live without her now
Ending life I think somehow
Deeply deeply deeply me
Deeply deeply deeply meEmbed
