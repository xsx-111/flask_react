Resuscitation Lyrics
Short circulated
Sleeping through the dopamine
When you’ve got nothing
You’ve got nothing to fear
Too low to notice
Superman in disco jeans
Having a good time
Just wish I was here

Resuscitation
Bring me around
Resuscitation
Bringin’ me down

So separated
Underwater gun ballet
When you’ve got no map
You’ve got no place to go
You sexy killjoy
Bringin’ everybody down
Well, I eat confusion
And spit it out slow
Resuscitation
Bringin’ you ‘round
Resuscitation
Bringin’ you down

The road is paved with hope and glory
My shoes are hiding under the bed
I need a little evaluation
Rejuvenation
Of soul and head

So underneath
Hanging on the bathroom rug
Holding it together
With rubber bands and chewing gum
This mansion’s crashing
I’m just the butler’s maid
So what do we care?
We just need our own parade

Resuscitation
Bringin’ me down
Resuscitation
Bringin’ me ‘round
Resuscitation
Bringin’ you down
Resuscitation
Bringin’ you ‘round
Resuscitation
Bringin’ you ‘roundEmbed
