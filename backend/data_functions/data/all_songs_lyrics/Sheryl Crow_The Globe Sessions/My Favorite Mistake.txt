My Favorite Mistake Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

I woke up and called this morning
The tone of your voice was a warning
That you don't care for me anymore

I made up the bed we sleep in
I looked at the clock when you creep in
It's 6 a.m., and I'm alone

Did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I was just beginning?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake

Your friends are sorry for me
They watch you pretend to adore me
But I'm no fool to this game
Now here comes your secret lover
She'd be unlike any other
Until your guilt goes up in flames

Did you know when you go, it's the perfect ending
To the bad day I've gotten used to spending?
When you go all I know is
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake

Well, maybe nothing lasts forever
Even when you stay together
I don't need forever after
It's your laughter won't let me go
So I'm holding on this way

Did you know, could you tell
You were the only one that I ever loved?
Now everything's so wrong
Did you see me walking by?
Did it ever make you cry?
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake
You're my favorite mistake2Embed
