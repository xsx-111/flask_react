Crash and Burn Lyrics
I watched the sun come up on Portland
I waved goodbye to all my friends
I packed my car and headed to LA
I gave away all my loose ends
Somebody said you got to get away
To wanna go back home again
I left my universe standing there
Holding the hand of my best friend

And it's laughter that I feel when I think of you
It's one more dusty rose about to turn
I'll see you when I reach New Mexico
If I'm in the mood to crash and burn

I wrote a letter that I never mailed
I rehearse a dialogue in my head
In case you ever wanted to track me down
I'll take my cell phone to bed
And it's laughter that I hear when I close my eyes
And it's one more punchline I forgot to learn
I call you up when my bottle's dry
And I'm on my way to crash and burn
Antigone laid across the road
And let a Mack truck leave her there for dead
Just because her lover split the scene
Well, love might be great, but why lose your head?

Well, it's laughter that comes up when I cry for you
And my heart may break again before it learns
And I might be stupid enough to want to fall again
Cos I've gotten used to crash and burn
I say, I've gotten used to the crash and burn

Crash and burn
Crash Crash
