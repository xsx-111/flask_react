There Goes the Neighborhood Lyrics
Hey let's party
Let's get down
Let's turn the radio on
This is the meltdown
Get out the camera
Take a picture
The drag queens and the freaks
Are all out on the town
And cowboy Jane's in bed
Nursing a swollen head

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

The photo chick made to look sickly
Is standing in her panties in the shower
She plays the guitar in the bathroom
While the police dust her mother's plastic flowers
And Schoolboy John's in jail
Making a killing through the U.S. mail
Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

This is the movie of the screenplay
Of the book about a girl who meets a junkie
The messenger gets shot down
Just for carrying the message to a flunkie
We can't be certain who the villains are because everyone's so pretty
But the afterparty's sure to be a wing-ding as it moves into your
City

Sunshine Sally and Peter Ustinov
Don't like the scene any how
I dropped acid on a Saturday night
Just to see what the fuss was about
Now there goes the neighborhood

There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhoodEmbed
