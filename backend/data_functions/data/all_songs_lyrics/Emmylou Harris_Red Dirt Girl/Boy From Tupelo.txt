Boy From Tupelo Lyrics
You don't love me, this I know
Don't need a Bible to tell me so
I hung around a little too long
I was good, but now I'm gone

Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
Any way the wind can blow
That's where I'm gonna go
I'll be gone like a five and dime
It'll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he ought to know

The shoulder I've been leanin' on
Is the coldest place I've ever known
There's nothing left for me round here
Looks like it's time to disappear

Like the buffalo
That boy from Tupelo
The old wall down in Jericho
Maybelle on the radio
I'll be gone like a five and dime
It'll be the perfect crime
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he ought to know
You don't love me, this I know
Don't need a Bible to tell me so
But it's a shame and it's a sin
Everything I could have been

Your last chance Texaco
Your sweetheart of the rodeo
A Juliet to your Romeo
The border you cross into Mexico
I'll never understand why or how
Oh but baby, it's too late now
Just ask the boy from Tupelo
He's the king and he ought to know1Embed
