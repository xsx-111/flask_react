Hour Of Gold Lyrics
I have seen your soul turn black and then retreat
To that dark place where no one else may follow
I waited here for your returning
To roll your cigarette and wash your bloodied feet

You have heard the silent running of my dreams
Broke me from the grip of grief and fever
With the sound of your voice speaking my name
And a kiss that I will feel forever

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our heads
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead

I have watched you riding on the wall of death
And when it finally breaks you and you fall
I will tear this dress of muslin that you gave me
To bind the fatal wound and catch your last sweet breath

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our heads
In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
But the world will be my witness when they excavate my heart
And find the image of your face
Imprinted there like some Shroud of Turin
That neither time nor tundra could erase

In the hour of gold, the hour of lead
We did forge our wedding bed
On a hard and holy road
We lay down our heads
In the hour of gold, the hour of leadEmbed
