One Big Love Lyrics
Let's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
Just wear your shorts and your long hair
Don't forget the lawn chair
Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and its groovy
They went to the one about the big war
I didn't, I'd seen it before

I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring
Throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things
For a couple wings on a little white dove
And one big love
One big love
One big love
One big love

Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk and count down to zero
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want to
Everything before is gone or going somewhere
I guess I'm taking my chances
Giving up the ring
Throwing in my gloves
I guess I'm taking my chances
Trading in my things
For a couple wings on a little white dove
And one big love
One big love
One big love
One big love

I don't know where we are and I don't care
And now we're out of gas and riding on air
And one big love
One big love
One big love
One big love

Let's take a ride to the seaside
We can go out swimming in the high tide
One big love
One big love
Everybody's gone to the movies
Everybody's gone and its groovy
One big love
One big love
Everybody do like a monkey
If you want to go on and be funky
One big love
One big love
No need to talk like a hero
Talk a walk and count down to zero
One big love
One big love
No sense defending your honor
Just go on and kiss him if you want to
One big love
One big loveEmbed
