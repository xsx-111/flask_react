Tragedy LyricsSome say it's destiny, whether triumph or tragedy
But I believe we cast our nets out on the sea
And nothing we gather comes for free
I would have paid down through the years
A price beyond rubies, beyond tears
To keep you safe with me
But your suspicion and your fear
Your vow to let nobody near was your Trinity
Such a tragedy
I drew the best hand you'd ever hold
Then cashed my winnings in long ago
Settled for silver, how could I know
You were waiting with the gold?
I could have caused your heart to yield
But I was only a disturbance in the field of your dreams
And I will never see you cry
You won't be with me when I die
A waste of you and me, a tragedy
We took the wrong train to kingdom come
No more damage can be done, baby
It's just what the world don't need
It's another stinking tragedy
That's how the story goes
Our chapter's coming to a close
We are history
But I will always think of you
Everyday until my days are through
You made me believe in tragedyEmbed
