My Baby Needs A Shepherd LyricsMy baby needs a shepherd, she's lost out on the hill
Too late, I tried to call her when the night was cold and still
And I tell myself I'll find her, but I know I never will
My baby needs a shepherd, she's lost out on the hill
My baby needs an angel, she never learned to fly
She'll not reach sanctuary just by looking to the sky
I guess I could have carried her, but I didn't even try
My baby needs an angel, she never learned to fly
Oh, I ran so far through a broken land
I was following that drummer beating in a different band
Somewhere on the highway, I let go of her hand
Now she's gone forever like her footprints in the sand
Toora loora loora lo, first the seed and then the rose
Toora loora loora li, my kingdom for a lullaby
My baby needs a pilot, she has no magic wand
To help her part the troubled waters of the Rubicon
But in my soul, I know she'll have to go this one alone
After all that is the only way she's ever known
But there is no lamp in all this dark
That could chase away her shadow from the corners of my heart
I pray she rides a dolphin, but she's swimming with a shark
Out where none can save her, not even Noah and his ark
Toora loora loora lo, to the cradle comes a cross
Toora loora loora li, my kingdom for a lullaby
My baby needs a mother to love her 'til the end
Up every rugged mountain and down every road that bends
Sometimes I hear her crying, but I guess it's just the wind
My baby needs a mother to love her 'til the endEmbed
