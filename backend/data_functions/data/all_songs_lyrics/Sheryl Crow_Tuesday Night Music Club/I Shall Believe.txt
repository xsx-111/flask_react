I Shall Believe Lyrics
Come to me now
And lay your hands over me
Even if it's a lie
Say it will be alright
And I shall believe
I'm broken in two
And I know you're on to me
That I only come home
When I'm so all alone
But I do believe

That not everything is going to be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
And I shall believe
And I shall believe

Open the door
And show me your face tonight
I know it's true
No one heals me like you
And you hold the key
Never again
Would I turn away from you
I'm so heavy tonight
But your love is alright
And I do believe
That not everything is going to be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say honestly you won't give up on me
And I shall believe
And I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
That not everything is gonna be the way
You think it ought to be
It seems like every time I try to make it right
It all comes down on me
Please say, honestly
You won't give up on me
And I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
And I shall believe
Please say, honestly
You won't give up on me
And I shall believe
I shall believe
And I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe
I shall believe1Embed
