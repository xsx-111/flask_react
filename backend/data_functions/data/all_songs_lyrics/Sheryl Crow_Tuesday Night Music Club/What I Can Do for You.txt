What I Can Do for You Lyrics
I'm so glad you're awake
That you're not like the others
Cause they're so straight-laced
And no fun
Gosh, that's nice
That lingerie
Makes me feel like
Oh, I don't know
You're a very pretty thing
You remind me of someone
You must have heard
Some awful nasty things about me, but

What I can do for you
There's no one else
On God's green earth can do
What I can do for you
There's no one else
On God's green earth can do
Just ask anybody
They'll tell you that it's true
There's no one else on earth
Can do the things that I can do for you
You're never going to make it
All by yourself
You're going to need a friend
You're going to need my help
I have so much to offer
If you just be nice
If you do what I say
And don't make me say it twice
Do you mind if I just
Rub my hand up thus
Come on just my hand
Come on just my hand
You got to understand
I'm going to be your man
I'm going to be your manEmbed
