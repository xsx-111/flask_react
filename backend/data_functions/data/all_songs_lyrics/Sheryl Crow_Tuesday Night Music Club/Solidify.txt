Solidify Lyrics
Pouring in and around the great wellspring
Of simple feeling
And I need bearings in the face of your
Cool cool fire
Walking backwards with the pounding of your voice
Makes my soul tired
And concrete is
As concrete doesn't
And voices can drown

Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Solidify
Make me real
So you can see me

I guess you thought
I'd hide the sun from my liquid thoughts and
Make ice for you
You thought I'd seed my clouds
With the rain of your personal dreams
I guess you thought I'd throw confetti
At your parade of lofty thoughts
I guess you thought I'd shine good morning
In some good morning Jack
Surprise
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I
Solidify
Make me real
So you can see meEmbed
