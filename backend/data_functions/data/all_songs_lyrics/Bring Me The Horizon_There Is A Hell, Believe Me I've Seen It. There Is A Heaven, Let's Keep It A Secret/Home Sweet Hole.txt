Home Sweet Hole Lyrics
Cross my heart, I don't wanna die
But heaven knows it seems like I try
Lost in a labyrinth for weeks on end
I live and I learn from my mistakes, then I forget them again

Got a feelin' in my stomach and it just won't quit
It's subtle as a shotgun and heavy as a brick
'Cause I'm staring at the devil and the truth of it is
He's a lot more familiar than I'd care to admit
If only I could focus, maybe if I could see
If I didn't know any better, I would say he looks just like me

The roof is crashin' down, the walls are cavin' in
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction
The roof is crashin' down, the truth is spillin' out

Oh shit, I've done it again
I'm in way too far in over my head
(No) Crossed the line (No) So many times
That I don't even know what it stands for
Oh shit, I've done it again
I'm in way too far in over my head
(No) Crossed the line (No) So many times
That I don't even know what it stands for
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole and just be careful what you say

Got a feelin' in my stomach and it just won't quit
It's subtle as a shotgun and heavy as a brick
Bite your tongue, just bite your tongue
You've already said quite enough

The roof is crashin' down, the walls are cavin' in
We discover all your stories are just works of fiction
The roof is crashin' down, the truth is spillin' out

Oh shit, I've done it again
I'm in way too far in over my head
(No) Crossed the line (No) So many times
That I don't even know what it stands for, yeah
Oh shit, I've done it again
I'm in way too far in over my head
(No) Crossed the line (No) So many times
That I don't even know what it stands for
(You wear your lies like a noose around your neck)
(So kick the chair and let's be done with it)
(You wear your lies like a noose around your neck)
(So kick the chair, so kick the chair)
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair and let's be done with it
You wear your lies like a noose around your neck
So kick the chair, so kick the chair

Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you wish for
Home sweet hole, just be careful what you say7Embed
