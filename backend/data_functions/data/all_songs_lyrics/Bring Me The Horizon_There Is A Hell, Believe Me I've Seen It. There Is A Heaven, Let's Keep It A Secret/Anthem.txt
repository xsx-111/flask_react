Anthem Lyrics
This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing (So fuckin' sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Someone call an ambulance, I got wounds to attend
Someone call a doctor, I fear this is the end
This happens all the time, this happens every day
But I never seem to quit, the wolves never stay at bay

I hate to say, "I told you so," but fuck it, I told you so
And don't say a word, I already know

This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing (So fuckin' sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Someone, call an exorcist and help me kill this curse
I can't stop the bleedin', and it's only gettin' worse
This happens all the time, this happens every day
But I never seem to quit, the wolves never stay at bay
No, they don't stay
I hate to say, "I told you so," but fuck it, I told you so
And don't say a word, I already know, I already know

This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing (So fuckin' sing)
A dedication to the end of everything

Yeah, get the fuck up
This is it, the sound of givin' in
Yeah, get the fuck up
This is it, the end of everything

Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
Lost in a dream, never fell asleep
Tastes so bitter, feels so sweet
I've come back to old remedies

This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing
This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing

This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing
A dedication to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing (So fuckin' sing)
A dedication to the end of everything, to the end of everything
This is an anthem, so fuckin' sing
A dedication to the end of everything

 Do you feel different now?
 Yes
 Less anxious?
 Much less
 Do you have any special feelings?
 I feel like my heart is being touched by Christ10Embed
