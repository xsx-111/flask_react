Blacklist Lyrics
So just like that, you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone

So just like that, you're fucking dead and gone
You can only wear a crown of thorns for so long
We built an empire and you took the throne
But you built it from bayonets and sat there alone
I hope your queen was worth it
Do you still serve her on your knees?
'Cause you sat when the world was at your feet
Just slept while we lived the dream

You won't miss the water till the river runs dry
You won't miss the sunset till it burns out the sky
You won't miss what you have till it's finally lost
But you don't miss a bastard when you're bearing his fucking cross

Blacklist
Nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you, there's no need for enemies
With friends like you, there's no need for anything
Blacklist, you're nothing but a blacklist
Well, truth be told, I'm a little bit gutted
I mean you were always a prick, but we still seemed to love you
We started this together, and it should've stuck
But there's no room for a useless, miserable fuck
Well, I know I was a cunt in the final days
It just filled me with venom, filled me with rage
To see someone not give a shit
Despite of all of this

I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist, and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones, dragging dead fucking weight
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
Blacklist, blacklist

Blacklist
Nothing but a blacklist
With friends like you, there's no need for enemies
With friends like you, there's no need for anything
Blacklist, you're nothing but a blacklist

I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist, and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones, dragging dead fucking weight
I won't see you around, I couldn't give a fuck
I'd rather slit my wrists than keep in touch
You're on my blacklist, and there's nothing left to say
We're finished breaking our bones, dragging dead fucking weight7Embed
