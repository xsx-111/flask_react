Fuck Lyrics
Let's fuck till the sun comes up
'Cause we haven't got long but we got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
Don't stop till we pirouette
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playin' heart piñata
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
The only way we know, the only way we know
The only way we know, the only way we know
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?

Oh, let's fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck
Let's fuck till our hearts give up, it won't be long
A night to remember, a day to forget
If our eyes were diamonds, we'd be rich
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet 'fore it quits on me
Your voice makes my heart skip beats
So keep quiet before it flatlines
Before it flatlines
I'm dead, tell them all we're dead
We can hold the wake right here in this bed
Sunk into you, tangled in sheets
Buried in blankets, six-foot deep again
Kick it
Fuck, fuck, fuck

Let's fuck till the sun comes up
'Cause we haven't got long but we got enough
A night to remember, a day to forget
Don't stop till we pirouette
I'm no saint, you're no martyr
One more night playin' heart piñata
How do you say goodbye?

How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
How do you say goodbye when you've hardly said hello?
Oh

We're young and in love, heart attacks waitin' to happen
Come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waitin' to happen
Come a little closer, tell me those three little words
We're young and in love, heart attacks waitin' to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waitin' to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words
We're young and in love, heart attacks waitin' to happen
So come a little closer, tell me it's all in our heads
We're young and in love, heart attacks waitin' to happen
So come a little closer, tell me those three little words10Embed
