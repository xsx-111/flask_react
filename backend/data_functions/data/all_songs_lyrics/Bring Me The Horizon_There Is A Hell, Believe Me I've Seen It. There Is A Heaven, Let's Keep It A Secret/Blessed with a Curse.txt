Blessed with a Curse Lyrics
Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse, I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you, I was lyin', girl, it beats for two
'Cause I've got your love when I've got these vices

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you

Ever since this began, I was blessed with a curse
And for better or for worse, I was born into a hearse
I know I said my heart beats for you
I was lyin', girl, I've been lyin' to you

Everything I touch turns to stone, turns to stone
So wrap your arms 'round me and leave me on my own
Everything I touch turns to stone, turns to stone
So wrap your arms 'round me and leave me on my own

Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said
Because everything I touch turns to stone, turns to stone
So wrap your arms around me and leave me, I can't hold on


Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, every word I've said
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every word I've said, ever said to you
Take back every thing I've said, ever said to you
Take back every thing I've said, ever said to you27Embed
