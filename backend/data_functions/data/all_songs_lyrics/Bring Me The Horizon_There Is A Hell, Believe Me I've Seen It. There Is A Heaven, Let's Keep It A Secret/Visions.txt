Visions Lyrics
This is a call to arms, so grab your guns and get your horses
Only the dead have seen the end of this fight
This is a call to arms, so all you fallen soldiers, sing with me
Death or glory

So march with me if you believe there's any hope for us
I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long
All is fair in love and war, or so they tell me
All is fair in love and war, or so they say

Come on, come on, there has to be a better way
Get up, get up, let's leave this mess
I know a place that we can get away from all of this
Come on, come on, get up, get up

I've been dreaming of us leaving
Everything and everyone we've ever known
I've been thinking all these visions
Must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go

No, we can't leave 'till you tell me everything
So come clean, don't talk in tongues, talk in tongues
It's time to bring out your dead
And all the skeletons that you've been hiding
Tell me everything, I need to know
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead, oh!

So march with me if you believe there's any hope for us
I've been hiding in these trenches for far too long
All is fair in love and war or so they tell me
All is fair in love and war or so they say

Come on, come on, get up, get up
I know a place that we can get away from all of this, yeah

I couldn't see a thing 'till I shut my eyes
I never knew a thing 'till I lost my mind
I would sell my soul to know it all
But I held the keys all this time
I couldn't see a thing 'till I shut my eyes
I never knew a thing 'till I lost my mind
I would sell my soul to know it all
But I held the keys all this time!

I've been dreaming of us leaving
Everything and everyone we've ever known
I've been thinking all these visions
Must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go
I've been dreaming of us leaving
Everything and everyone we've ever known
I've been thinking all these visions
Must be a sign, so hold on and don't let go
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead
Bring out your dead!11Embed
