It Never Ends Lyrics
Started off as a one night stand, lingered to a fling
The sirens and the sergeants didn't seem to mean a thing
Hide your fangs all you want, you still need the blood
Tell us that it's different now, you're up to no good

Take my hand, show me the way
We are the children that fell from grace
Take my hand, show me the way
We are the children who can't be saved

One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away
How has it come to this?

I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it 1000 fuckin' times
That I'm okay, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me and I can't seem to sleep
And it's not 'cause you're not with me, it's 'cause you never leave

I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it 1000 fuckin' times
You say this is suicide?
You say this is suicide? I say this is a war
And I'm losing the battle, man down, man down, oh
Is this what you call love?
This is a war I can't win

One more nail in the coffin, one more foot in the grave
One more time I'm on my knees as I try to walk away
Everything I loved became everything I lost

I've said it once, I've said it twice, I've said it 1000 fuckin' times
That I'm okay, that I'm fine, that it's all just in my mind
But this has got the best of me and I can't seem to sleep
And it's not 'cause you're not with me, it's 'cause you never leave
And it's not 'cause you're not here with me, it's 'cause you never leave

Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends
Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
It never ends, it never ends31Embed
