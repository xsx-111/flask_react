Her And I (Slow Jam 2) Lyrics
I had to put up some kind of a fight

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us
'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I

It wouldn't hurt to give you more of my love
The sun shone through into a wave of thought
It said the one I'll wed has got a thinking head on her
Her will will shine from up above on us

'Cause every day, I build on precious her and I
It wouldn't hurt to put in some work on this angel
I'll fill her heart with a lot of love
So the sun can shine a little brighter

On her and I
On her and I
On her and I
On her and I7Embed
