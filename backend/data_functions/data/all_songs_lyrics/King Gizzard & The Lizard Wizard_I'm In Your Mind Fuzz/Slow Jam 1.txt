Slow Jam 1 Lyrics
I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low

And when it feels like coming on
Boy, it makes it hard to talk for me, for me

I need to slow my mind down low
I need to slow my mind down low

And when it feels like coming on
Boy, it makes it hard to talk for me, for me2Embed
