Satan Speeds Up Lyrics
You brought us to your gift of generosity
And all our silly games wreak havoc on your soils

When I stop to think of all that

Every life is like a song that takes forever to be sung
When all our silly games wreak havoc on our spoils

When I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door

Every second, every minute, every hour, every day
He's watching you and passing judgement to everybody you hold dear

And when I stop to think of all that we've done
Satan's at the door
Who's he looking for?1Embed
