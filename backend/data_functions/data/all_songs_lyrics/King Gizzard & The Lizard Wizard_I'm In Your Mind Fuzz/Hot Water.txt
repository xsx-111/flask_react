Hot Water Lyrics
Water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water


Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water

Eat up, vomit
Date line, repay
System failure
Wish for old way
Straighten, bend it
Decline, spend it
Believe sceptic
Everybody's standing in
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water


Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water

Sheet of paper
Mountain raper
Moment silence
I am spineless
Echoes ending
Whispers trending
Heat is coming
Everybody's stranded in

Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water

Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
Hot water, hot water
