Am I In Heaven? Lyrics
I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brain will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
Mother Nature made everybody else so far

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

And everybody that I knew
Has taken bits and pieces out of you
And I swear, even the sky has changed, it's blue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?

And everybody that I knew
Has jumped right in and taken over you
And I swear, even the ocean's changed its hue
The lesson rings again
Repeats within my brain
Let's all put her to the test
C'mon, suck our mother's breast

I've got ideas in my brain about the end of the world that I won't even say
When all the bricks that built our brains will be turned into sand by the eternal wave
Oh, if we save her, we'll live on a star
'Cause Mother Nature made everybody else so far

Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?
Am I in heaven? Am I in heaven?1Embed
