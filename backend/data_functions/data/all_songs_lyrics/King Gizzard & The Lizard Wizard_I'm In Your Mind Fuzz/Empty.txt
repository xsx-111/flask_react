Empty Lyrics
Empty
Life is nothing like it used to be
People used to be so nice to me
Feeling so empty
Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty

Life is death
It's because I shot it through its head
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty
And now I know
It's because I never set in stone
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty

But I don't feel empty when I'm with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

Empty
There is nothing deep inside of me
Life is nothing like it used to be
Feeling so empty
And now I know
It's because I never set in stone
I'm wandering around so lazily
And feeling so empty
But I don't feel empty when I'm with you
I feel like you level me too
Who? Empty

What I got myself into
What I got myself into
Empty

What I got myself into
What I got myself intoEmbed
