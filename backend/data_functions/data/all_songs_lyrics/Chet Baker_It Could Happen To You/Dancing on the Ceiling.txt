Dancing on the Ceiling LyricsShe dances overhead
On the ceiling near my bed
In my sight
Through the night
I try to hide in vain
Underneath my counterpane
There's my love
Up above
I whisper, go away, my lover
It's not fair
But I'm so grateful to discover
She's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my love
I whisper, go away, my lover
It's not fair
But I'm so grateful to discover
She's still there
I love my ceiling more
Since it is a dancing floor
Just for my loveEmbed
