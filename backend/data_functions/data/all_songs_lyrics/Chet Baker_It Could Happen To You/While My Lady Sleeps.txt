While My Lady Sleeps LyricsThe moon will rise
But all in vain
For there's no use in shining
While my lady sleeps
The breeze will sing
A sadain
Because of heart is pining
While my lady sleeps
Starlight and moonlight
And every melody wasted
What can they mean
When i'm yearning for kisses never tasted
The night may hold a million dreams
But when her eyes discovered
Just a lonely lover
She will hurry on
With a sight to the dawn
While the world weeps
And my lady sleepsEmbed
