Do It the Hard Way LyricsDo it the hard way
And its easy sailing
Do it the hard way
And it's hard to loose
Only the soft way
Has a chance of failing
You have to choose
I tried the hard way
When I tried to get you
You took the soft way
When you said "we'll see"
Darling, now i let you
Do it the hard way
Now that you want meEmbed
