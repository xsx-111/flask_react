How Long Has This Been Going On LyricsAs a tot, when I trotted in little velvet panties
I was kissed by my sisters, my cousins, and my aunties
Sad to tell, it was hell, an inferno worse than Dante's
So my dear I swore
"Never, never more !"
On my list, I insisted that kissing must be crossed out
Now, I find I was blind, and oh my! How I lost out!
I could cry salty tears
Where have I been all these years?
Listen, you, tell me true:
How long has this been going on?
There were chills up my spine
And some thrills I can't define
Listen, sweet, I repeat:
How long has this been going on?
Oh, I feel that I could melt
Into Heaven I'm hurled!
I know how Columbus felt
Finding another world
Kiss me once, then again
What a dunce I was before
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
Dear, when in your arms I creep
That divine rendezvous
Don't wake me, if I'm asleep
Let me dream that it's true!
Kiss me twice, then once more
That makes thrice, let's make it four!
What a break! For Heaven's sake!
How long has this been going on?
How long has this, been going on?Embed
