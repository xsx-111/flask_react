Everything Happens To Me LyricsI make a date for golf, and you can bet your life it rains
I try to give a party, and the guy upstairs complains
I guess I'll go through life, just catching colds and missing trains
Everything happens to me
I never miss a thing. I've had the measles and the mumps
And every time I play an ace, my partner always trumps
I guess I'm just a fool, who never looks before he jumps
Everything happens to me
At first, my heart thought you could break this jinx for me
That love would turn the trick to end despair
But now I just can't fool this head that thinks for me
I've mortgaged all my castles in the air
I've telegraphed and phoned and sent an air mail special too
Your answer was goodbye and there was even postage due
I fell in love just once, and then it had to be with you
Everything happens to me
