Innocent Son Lyrics
You left me there
Waiting at the bottom of the stairs
With my eyes closed
Holding my right hand in my left
There is no time for hesitation now
You come or go, or go

Rust suddenly falling beside me
On the ghost of a morning
Riding in sorrow to the harbor
Far behind, oh, me!
The bodies of my friend
Hanging alone, alone again

Some twisted thorn
Tells me you saw me in the night with another
Keep all my promises to break them
I am no, oh, no, innocent son
You run, rabbit run3Embed
