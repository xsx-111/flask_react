Flying High Again Lyrics
Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh now
Here we go now

Got a crazy feeling I don't understand
Got to get away from here
Feeling like I should have kept my feet on the ground
Waiting for the sun to appear

Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

Because you can't see what my eyes see
(I can see it, I can see it)
And you can't be inside of me
Flying high again
I can see through mountains, watch me disappear
I can even touch the sky
Swallowing colours of the sound I hear
Am I just a crazy guy (you bet)
Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

If you could be inside my head
You'd see that black and white is red
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Come on and join me

Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
Come on and join me

Oh no, oh no
Here we go now
Oh no, oh now
Here we go now
Daddy thinks I'm lazy he don't understand
Never saw inside my head
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand
Never heard a thing I said

Mamma's going to worry
I've been a bad, bad boy
No use saying sorry
It's something that I enjoy

Flying high again
Flying high again
Flying high again
