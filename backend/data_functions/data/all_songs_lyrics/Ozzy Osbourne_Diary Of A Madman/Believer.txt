Believer LyricsWatching the time go
And feeling belief grow
Rise above the obstacles
People beseech me
But they'll never teach me
Things that I already know (I know)
Dreams that have shattered
May not have mattered
Take another point of view
Doubts will arise, though
Like chasing a rainbow
I can tell a thing or two (That's true)
You've got to believe in yourself
Or no one will believe in you
Imagination like a bird on the wing
Flying free for you to use (OK baby)
I can't believe they stop and stare
And point their fingers, doubting me
Their disbelief suppresses them
But they're not blind
It's just that they won't see
I'm a believer
I ain't no deceiver
Mountains move before my eyes
Destiny planned out
I don't need no handout
Speculation of the wise2Embed
