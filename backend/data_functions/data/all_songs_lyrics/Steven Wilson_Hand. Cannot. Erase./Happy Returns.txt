Happy Returns LyricsHey brother
Happy returns
It's been a while now
I bet you thought that I was dead
But I'm still here
Nothing's changed
Nothing's changed
Hey brother
I'd love to tell you I've been busy
But that would be a lie
Cause the truth is
The years just pass like trains
I wave but they don't slow down
Don't slow down
Hey brother
I see the freaks and dispossessed on day release
Avoiding the police
I feel I'm falling once again
But now there's no one left to catch me
Hey brother
I feel like I'm living in parentheses
And I've got trouble with the bills
Do the kids remember me?
Well, I've got gifts for them
And for you much sorrow
But I'm feeling kind of drowsy now
So I'll finish this tomorrowEmbed
