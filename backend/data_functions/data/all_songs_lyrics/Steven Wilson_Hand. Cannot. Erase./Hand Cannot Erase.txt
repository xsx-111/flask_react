Hand Cannot Erase Lyrics
Together we
Have this love
Even so
It's not enough
Bruised and burned
We won't lose heart
Just because
Life gets hard

Writing lying e-mails to our friends back home
Feeling guilty if we sometimes wanna be alone

Hand Cannot
Erase this love
Hand Cannot
Erase this love

And a love like this
Makes us strong
We laugh it off
When things go wrong
It's not you, forgive me if I find I need more space
'Cause trust means we don't have to be together everyday

Hand Cannot
Erase this love
Hand Cannot
Erase this love


Hand Cannot
Erase this love
Hand Cannot
Erase this love6Embed
