Routine Lyrics
What do I do with all the children's clothes?
Such tiny things that still smell of them
And the footprints in the hallway
Onto my knees, scrub them away
And how to be of use? Make the tea and the soup
All of their favorites, throw them away
And all their schoolbooks and their running shoes
Washing them clean in the dirty steel sink

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Concentrates my mind
Helps me to sleep

Keep making beds, keep the cat fed
Open the windows, let the air in
Keep the house clean, keep the routine
Paintings they made still stuck to the fridge
La da-da, dah
La da-da, dah
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
La da-da, dah
La da-da, dah
La, da-da-da
La, da-da-da
Mother I am far from you
Left behind a dream of my youth
All these years now gone

Keep cleaning, keep ironing
Cooking their meals on the stainless steel hob
Keep washing, keep scrubbing
Long until the dark comes to bruise the sky
Deep in debt to night

Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep
Routine keeps me in line
Helps me pass the time
Helps me to sleep

The most beautiful morning forever
Like the ones from far off, far off away
With the hum of the bees in the jasmine sway
Don't ever let go
Try to let go
Don't ever let go
Try to let go
Don't ever...1Embed
