Home Invasion Lyrics
Download sex and download God
Download the funds to meet the cost
Download a dream home and a wife
Download the ocean and the sky

Another day on earth has passed me by
But I have lost all faith in what's outside
The awning of the stars across the sky
And the wreckage of the night

Download love and download war
Download the shit you didn't want
Download the things that make you mad
Download the life you wish you had

Another day on earth has passed me by
But I have lost all faith in what's outside
The awning of the stars across the sky
And the wreckage of the night1Embed
