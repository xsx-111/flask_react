Transience Lyrics
Cut through the country, speed through the dark
A child in a train, Tristessa departs
It's only the start (Start, ah)

Filigree circles 'round her young wrist
Her mother is frowning, it's something she missed
She fixes her hair (Start, ah)

At the failing of the day she heard
Her father always say, "Remember, it's only the start
It's only the start."
When she drifted off to sleep
She had the whole world at her feet because
It's only the start, it's only the start
Before they fell away, it seemed to matter all the same
But it was only the start, it's only the start
It's only the startEmbed
