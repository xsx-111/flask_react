The Sound of Settling Lyrics
I've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots
That my tongue has tied off
My brain's repeating, "if you've got an impulse, let it out"
But they never make it past my mouth

Bop bah
This is the sound of settling
Bop bah, bop bah (bop bah)
Bop bah (bop bah)
This is the sound of settling
Bop bah, bop bah (bop bah)

Our youth is fleeting
Old age is just around the bend
And I can't wait to go grey
And I'll sit and wonder
Of every love that could have been
If I'd only thought of something charming to say

Bop bah
This is the sound of settling
Bop bah, bop bah (bop bah)
Bop bah (bop bah)
This is the sound of settling
Bop bah, bop bah (bop bah)
Bop bah
This is the sound of settling
Bop bah, bop bah (bop bah)
Bop bah (bop bah)
This is the sound of settling
Bop bah, bop bah (bop bah)

I've got a hunger twisting my stomach into knots4Embed
