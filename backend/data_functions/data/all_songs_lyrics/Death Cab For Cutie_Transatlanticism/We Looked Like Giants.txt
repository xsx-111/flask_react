We Looked Like Giants Lyrics
God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of springtime
Remembering when you were mine
In a still suburban town
When every Thursday I'd brave those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes
And we'd learn how our bodies worked

God damn the black night, with all its foul temptations
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside

And together there
In a shroud of frost the mountain air began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer than anyone would ever guess

Do you remember the J.A.M.C.?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you, but I swear on my name
They could smell it on me
But I've never been too good with secrets
No...

And together there
In a shroud of frost the mountain air began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer5Embed
