Tiny Vessels Lyrics
This is the moment
That you know
That you told her that you loved her, but you don't
You touch her skin
And then, you think
That she is beautiful
But she don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she is beautiful
But she don't mean a thing to me

I spent two weeks
In Silver Lake
The California sun cascading down my face
There was a girl
With light brown streaks
And she was beautiful
But she didn't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she was beautiful
But she didn't mean a thing to me

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling, all the playful misspellings
And every bite I gave that left a mark
When tiny vessels oozed into your neck and formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did, and so did I that day
And all I see
Are dark grey clouds
In the distance, moving closer with every hour
So when you ask, "Is something wrong?"
I think, "You're damn right there is
But we can't talk about it now"
No, we can't talk about it now

So one last touch, and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more
But it was vile, and it was cheap
And you are beautiful
But you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, you are beautiful
But you don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, you are beautiful
But you don't mean a thing to me11Embed
