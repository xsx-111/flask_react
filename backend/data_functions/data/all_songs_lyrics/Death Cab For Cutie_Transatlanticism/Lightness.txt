Lightness Lyrics
There's a tear in the fabric
Of your favorite dress
And I'm sneaking glances
Looking for the patterns in static
They start to make sense
The longer I'm at it

Ivory lines lead
Ooh-wha-ho
Ooh-wha-ho

Your heart is a river
That flows from your chest
Through every organ
Your brain is the dam
And I am the fish
Who can't reach the core

Ivory lines lead
Ooh-wha-ho
Ooh-wha-ho
Oh, instincts are misleading
You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you what
You know you should want

Ivory lines lead
Ooh-wha-ho
Ooh-wha-ho
Ivory lines lead
Ooh-wha-ho
Ooh-wha-ho

Oh, instincts are misleading
You shouldn't think what you're feeling
They don't tell you what
You know you should want

Ivory lines lead
Ooh-wha-ho
Ooh-wha-ho
Ivory lines lead
Ooh-wha-ho
Ooh-wha-ho14Embed
