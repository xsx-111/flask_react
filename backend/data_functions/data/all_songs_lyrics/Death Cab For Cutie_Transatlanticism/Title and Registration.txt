Title and Registration Lyrics
The glove compartment
Is inaccurately named
And everybody knows it
So I'm proposing
A swift, orderly change
Because behind its door
There's nothing to keep my fingers warm
And all I find
Are souvenirs from better times
Before the gleam
Of your taillights fading east
To find yourself a better life

I was searching
For some legal document
As the rain beat down on the hood
When I stumbled upon
Pictures I tried to forget
And that's how this idea
Was drilled into my head
'Cause it's too important
To stay the way it's been

But there's no blame
For how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone
It's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest
Where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night

And there's no blame
For how our love did slowly fade
And now that it's gone
It's like it wasn't there at all
And here I rest
Where disappointment and regret collide
Lying awake at night
Up all night
When I'm lying awake at night9Embed
