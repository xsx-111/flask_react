Tramp Lyrics
Tramp
What you call me?
Tramp
You didn't
You don't wear continental clothes, or Stetson hats
Well, I tell you one dog-gone thing
It makes me feel good to know one thing
I know I'm a lover
Matter of opinion, baby
That's all right, mama was, (So?) papa too (Hmm)
And I'm the only child
Lovin' is all I know to do

You know what, Otis?
What?
You're country
That's all right
You straight from the Georgia woods
That's good
You know what?
You wear overalls
And big old brogan shoes
And you need a haircut, tramp
Haircut?
Woman, you foolin', I'm a lover (Yeah)
Mama was, grandmama, papa too (I'll make you)
Boogaloo, all that stuff
But I'm the only son of a gun, yeah
On this side up, or something
Tramp
Alright, that's what you got
With that old, ragged hat? That?
You don't know how to trap

You know what, Otis?
I don't care what you say, you're still a tramp
What?
That's right
You haven't even got a fat bankroll in your pocket
You probably haven't even got twenty-five cents
I got six Cadillacs, five Lincolns, four Fords
Six Mercuries, three T-Birds, Mustang
Ooh, I'm a lover, mama was (Not really by me), papa too (What?)
I tell you one thing (Well, tell me)
I'm the only son of a gun this side of the Sun (Alright)

You're a tramp, Otis
No I'm not
I don't care what you say, you're still a tramp
What's wrong with that?
Look here, you ain't got no money
I got everything
You can't buy me all those minks
And sables and all that stuff I want
I can buy you minks, rats, frogs, squirrels, rabbits
Anything you want, woman

Look, you can go out in the Georgia woods and catch them, baby
Oh, but you foolin'
You're still a tramp
(That's all right)
You a tramp, Otis, you just a tramp
(That's all right)
You wear overalls
You need a haircut, baby (Yeah)
Cut off some of that hair off your head
You think you a lover, huh?Embed
