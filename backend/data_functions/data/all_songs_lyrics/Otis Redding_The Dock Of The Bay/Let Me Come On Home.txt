Let Me Come On Home Lyrics
Oh baby, yeah, I want to come home to you
Baby, yeah, oh, said, I got to get home to you
Days and nights, feeling so blue, baby
Lord, I just don't know what I'm gonna do
Oh, baby, yeah yeah, said I wanna come home

Oh baby, you're one thousand miles away
Baby, yeah, baby, you're just one thousand miles away, yeah
Take these chains from 'round my heart
Never, never, never leave you, no, no, you'll never be apart
Baby, baby, baby, baby, please, please, oh, let me come on home to you
Yeah, yeah

Oh, I love you, baby, let me come on home
Please, please, please, please, baby
Please let me come on home to you, girl
Crying my eyes out over you
I don't know nothing in the world that I'm gonna do
But I'm gonna
Come on, come on, come on, girl, I said I got to get home
Yeah, baby girl, I love you, honey
Please let me come home
Oh please, please, let me, let me, let me, let me come on home nowEmbed
