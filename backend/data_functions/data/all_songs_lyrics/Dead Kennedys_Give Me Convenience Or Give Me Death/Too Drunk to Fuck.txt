Too Drunk to Fuck Lyrics
Went to a party, I danced all night
I drank 16 beers and I started up a fight
But now I am jaded, you're out of luck
I'm rolling down the stairs
Too drunk to fuck

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm too drunk, too drunk, too drunk
To fuck

I like your stories, I love your gun
Shooting out truck tires
Sounds like loads and loads of fun
But in my room, wish you were dead
You bawl like the baby in Eraserhead

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
It's all I need right now
Too drunk to fuck

Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck
Too drunk, to fuck
I'm sick, soft, gooey, and cold
Too drunk to fuck

I'm about to drop, my head's a mess
The only salvation is
I'll never see you again
You give me head, it makes it worse
Take out your fuckin' retainer
Put it in your purse

I'm too drunk to fuck
You're too drunk to fuck
Too drunk to fuck

It's all I need right now, oh baby
I'm melting like an ice cream bar, oh baby
And now I got diarrhea
Too drunk to fuck
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, gah!1Embed
