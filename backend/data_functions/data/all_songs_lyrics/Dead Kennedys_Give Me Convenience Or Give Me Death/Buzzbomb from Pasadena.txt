Buzzbomb from Pasadena LyricsLet 'er rip!
Here we go, weeeeeeeee!
Buzzbomb, buzzbomb macho-mobile
The road's my slave, that's how I feel
I cruise alone, I cruise real far
Shoo young punk! I love my car
Cross Nevada at a 110 
Highway 50 and there's nobody there
Sign says, 'Next sign 30 miles!'…
My pension comes each penny saved
Buys more escape from home
I'd rather carouse around all day
Than move into a home
Plow through rest area San-o-Lets
Splat goes the lonely salesman
Still wanking in the men's room…
Buzzbomb buzzbomb tape up loud
Lawrence Welk cranked up to 10!
Faster faster in my car
Buzzbomb is my pride and joy
King of the trailer court
Waiting for a nice young man
Who'll love me for my car
Who tells me why I'm cool
Tells me just what I like
When I pretend he's here, ahhhh
Shred through Palm Springs across the golf course
Cops 'round here scratching their heads
Flashing sirens, State patrol…uh oh
They're scuffing up the side of my car
They're shooting out my tires
This ain't no way to go to heaven
Buzzbomb cornered at the 7-11
Shit!
Damn!
Let go of me motherfucker, I wanna live by my rules!Embed
