A Child & His Lawnmower LyricsSome clown in Sacramento was dragged into court
He shot his lawnmower, disobeyed, it wouldn't start
Might makes right, it's the American way
They fined him 60 dollars and sent him on his way
You know some people, don't take no shit
Maybe if they did, they'd have half a brain left
You know some people, don't take no shit
Maybe if they did, they'd have half a brain leftEmbed
