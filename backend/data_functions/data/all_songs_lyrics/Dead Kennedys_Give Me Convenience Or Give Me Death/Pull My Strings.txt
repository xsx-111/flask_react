Pull My Strings Lyrics

Hold it!
We've gotta prove we're adults now
We're not a punk rock band... We're a new wave band

I'm tired of self-respect
I can't afford a car
I wanna be a prefab superstar
I wanna be a tool
Don't need no soul
Wanna make big money
Playing rock and roll

I'll make my music boring
I'll play my music slow
I ain't no artist, I'm a business man
No ideas of my own
I won't offend
Or rock the boat
Just sex and drugs
And rock and roll
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!

You'll pay ten bucks to see me
On a fifteen foot high stage
Fatass bouncers kick the shit
Out of kids who try to dance
If my friends say
I've lost my guts
I'll laugh and say
That's rock and roll
But there's just one problem

Is my cock big enough
Is my brain small enough
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

And when I'm rich
And meet Bob Hope
We'll shoot some golf
And shoot some dope

Is my cock big enough
Is my brain small enough
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
Guitar!

Everybody, put your hands together!

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star
Everybody sing it one time!

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star
Shut up and dance, everybody!

Is my cock big enough?
Is my brain small enough?
For you to make me a star

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far
One more time!

Give me a toot, I'll sell you my soul
Pull my strings and I'll go far

And drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Drool, drool, drool, drool, drool, drool
My Payola!
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, we sure do love you, we'll see you next time, having a good time playing good and loud rock and rollEmbed
