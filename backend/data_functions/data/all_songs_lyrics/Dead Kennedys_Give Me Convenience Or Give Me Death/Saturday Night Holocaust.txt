Saturday Night Holocaust LyricsThere's a prefab building and a funny smell
Around the hills outside of town
Every now and then we wonder
But we shrug our shoulders and get back to work
There's a railroad there and trains go by
And there's people locked in cattle cars
And have you noticed the french fries at the A&W
Taste a little strange?
I drive down to the disco
Pompadour and pink lamm√©
I bow and blow the doorman
He parts the chain, says "Join the game"
A quick line in the girls room
To the bar for the electrodes
A coin into the right slit
Tape my temple, watch me go
Blacks are banned, except on the records
Oh, life's a cabaret
Like in Berlin, 1930
All I crave is my escape
Now I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Run my fingers down your Barbie-doll dress
Up and down your spandex ass
If I lit a match for you
You'd melt before my eyes
Come here, my pretty glow worm
You look so fine so dance with me
The fly-eye lights are throbbing
I'm burning up the floor
Whirling, twirling
Close my eyes, no faces judging me
But I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Slip my fingers down your Barbie-doll dress
Up and down your spandex ass
A Hitler youth in jogging suit
Smiling face band 'round his arm
Says "Line up, you've got work to do
We need dog food for the poor"
A scream bleats out, we're herded into lines
Customized vans wait outside
I'm getting scared of my new home
To Auschwitz condominiums we go
Now I want your perfect Barbie-doll lips
And I want your perfect Barbie-doll eyes
Let my fingers down your dress
