I Fought the Law LyricsDrinking beer in the hot sun
I fought the law and I won, I fought the law and I won
I needed sex and I got mine
I fought the law and I won, I fought the law and I won
The law don't mean shit if you've got the right friends
That's how this country's run
Twinkies are the best friend I've ever had
I fought the law and I won, I fought the law and I won
I blew George and Harvey's brains out with my six-gun
I fought the law and I won, I fought the law and I won
Gonna write my book and make a million
I fought the law and I won, I fought the law and I won
I'm the new folk hero of the Ku Klux Klan
My cop friends think that's fine
You can get away with murder if you've got a badge
I fought the law and I won, I fought the law and I won
I fought the law and I won
I am the law so I wonEmbed
