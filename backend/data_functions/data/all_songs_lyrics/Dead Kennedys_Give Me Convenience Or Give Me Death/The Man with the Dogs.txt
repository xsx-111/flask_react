The Man with the Dogs Lyrics
I am no one, but I am well known
For I am the Man with the Dogs
I stare at you shopping, watch while you're walking
Two dogs run around your toes
You turn around, two eyes break you down
"Now, who does that guy think he's starin' at?"
Stop in your tracks, you're being laughed at
You armored ego is nude

And I do and I do
Crack up 'cause I'm getting to you
I see you, I see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah

Down to your church, I'm looking for victims
Spell of the Man with the Dogs
I'll haunt you and follow you to work
That ghost is back again
Creep into you, I won't go away
You're taking yourself too seriously
I smile as you frown, and turn to walk away
Your habits for all to see
I see a shrew, I see you
And the rodent things you do
You see you I see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too

And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah and I'm gonna laugh
Open wiiiide, ee-yeah!
Aw, yeah!

Saw you again, you'll see me tomorrow
Curse of the Man with the Dogs
You may not like me, you won't forget me
Not safe even in Walgreen's
They've seen me, ask your friends
"Oh, I know him," seen but I'm never heard by your lot
A stare is worth a thousand biting phrases
See how stupid you are?

I dare you I dare you
To erase my laser tattoo
You see you you see you
And you're pretty self-conscious too
And I'm gonna crack your mask
Yeah, and I'm gonna laugh
What's inside?
Is it pubic hair?
Is it cobweb air?
I bet you just don't care!
As you go to work and you cash your check
You come home and you got enough to pay the rent
Turn on the TV to the football game
Tell your kids to shut up and go away
Close your eyes when you see me on your sidewalk
That does not sound like us
While you and your wretched corporation lies are slowly disintegrated into ashes!
Ashes!
Ashes!
Ashes, and we all fall downEmbed
