Glorified G Lyrics
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Got a gun, fact I got two
That's okay man 'cause I love God
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly when armed

(Glorified version of a) pellet gun
(Glorified version of a) pellet gun
(Glorified version of a) pellet gun
(Glorified version of a) pellet gun

Don't think
Dumb is strength
Never shot at a living thing
Glorified version of a pellet gun
Feels so manly
When armed

(Glorified version of a) pellet gun
(Glorified version of a) pellet gun
(Glorified version of a) pellet gun
(Glorified version of a)
Always keep it loaded
Always keep it loaded
Always keep it loaded
(Kindred to be an American)

(Life comes) I can feel your heart
(Ooh, life comes) I can feel your heart in your neck
(Life comes) I can feel your heart in your neck
(Like some) I can steal your heart from your neck
Glorified
