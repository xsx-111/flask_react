Blood Lyrics
Spin me round! Roll me over!
Fucking circus!
Stab it down! One way needle!
Pulled so slowly!
Drains and spills! Soaks the pages!
Fills their sponges!

It's my blood!
It's my blood!

Paint Ed big, turn Ed into
One of his enemies

It's my blood!
It's my blood!
It's my blood!

Stab it down! Fill the pages!
Suck my life out!
Maker of my enemies!
Take!
My!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck!Embed
