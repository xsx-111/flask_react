Rearviewmirror Lyrics
I took a drive today
Time to emancipate
I guess it was the beatings
Made me wise
But I'm not about to give thanks
Or apologize

I couldn't breathe
Holding me down
Hand on my face
Pushed to the ground
Enmity gauged
United by fear
Forced to endure
What I could not forgive

I seem to look away
The wounds in the mirror waved
It wasn't my surface
Most defiled

Head at your feet
Fool to your crown
Fist on my plate
Swallowed it down
Enmity gauged
United by fear
Tried to endure
What I could not forgive, yeah
Saw things, saw things
Saw things, saw things
Clearer, clearer
Once you were in my rear-view mirror
I gathered speed from you fucking with me
Once and for all
I'm far away
Hard to believe
Finally the shades are raised
Hey, yeah

Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
(Once you, once you) Rear-view mirror
Saw things so much clearer
(Once you) Oh yeah7Embed
