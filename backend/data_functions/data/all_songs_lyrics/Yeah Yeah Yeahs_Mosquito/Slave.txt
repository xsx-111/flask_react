Slave Lyrics
It eats your soul
Like tears, you fall, my slave
You steal, you heed the call, my slave
The keys, the keys are gold, my slave
You keep me beating on
It eats your soul
Like tears, you fall, my slave
You steal, you heed the call, my slave

You keep me, keep me your slave
You keep me, keep me your slave

On my own, you keep me, keep me
On the throne, heads down, all obey
On my own, you keep me, keep me
On the throne, heads down, all obey

Keep me, keep me your slave
You keep me, keep me your slave

Can I feed on your love?
Can I feed on your love?
Can I feed on your love?
(The keys are gold, my slave)
Can I feed on your love?
(You keep me beating on)Embed
