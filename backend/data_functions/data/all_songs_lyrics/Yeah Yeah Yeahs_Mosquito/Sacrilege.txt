Sacrilege Lyrics
Fallen for a guy
Fell down from the sky
Halo 'round his head
Feathers in our bed
In our bed, in our bed
Fallen for a guy
Who fell down from the sky
Halo 'round his head
Feathers in our bed
In our bed, in our bed

It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say

Asked if I would try
To leave this all behind
Halo 'round his head
Burning in our bed
In our bed, in our bed
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say

And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray

And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I ṗray
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
And I plead and I pray
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
And I plead and I pray
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
And I plead and I pray
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
And I plead and I pray
It’s sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say5Embed
