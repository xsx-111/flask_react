Always Lyrics
Always, always, always, always, always, always
Always, always, always, always, always, always
Always, always, always, always, always, always
Always, always, always, always, always, always

Forget the time, forever mine
Impossibility is possible to me
To me and you
We'll see it through

Always, always, always, always, always, always
Always, always, always, always, always, always

Forget 'bout time, forever mine
Impossibility is possible to me
To me and you
We'll see it through

Always, always, always, always, always, always
Always, always, always, always, always, alwaysEmbed
