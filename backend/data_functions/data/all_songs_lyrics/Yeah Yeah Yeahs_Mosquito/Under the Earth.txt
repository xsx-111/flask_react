Under the Earth LyricsDown, down under the earth goes another lover
Down, down under earth goes another lover
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Twelve tongues put a hex on you
Small mouths don't dare shout out
No fun for a night out
No fun for a night out on the town
Twelve tongues put a hex on you
Small mouths don't dare to shout it out
No fun for a night out
No fun for a night out on the town
Run away, run away
Not a ghost or roach would stay
You're on your own
On your own, you're not safe
Run away, run away
Not a ghost or roach would stay
You're on your own
On your own, you're not safe
Down, down under earth goes another lover
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Milk you for what you're worth and call it murder
Down, down under the earth goes another lover
Twelve tongues put a hex on you1Embed
