Mosquito LyricsMosquito, mosquito, mosquito
Mosquito sing
Mosquito cry
Mosquito live
Mosquito die
Mosquito drink
Most anything
Whatever's left
Mosquito screams
I'll suck your blood
I'll suck your blood
I'll suck your blood
Suck your, suck your, suck your blood
Suck your blood
I'll suck your blood
I'll suck your blood
Suck your, suck your, suck your blood
Mosquito sing
Mosquito cry
Mosquito live
Mosquito die
Mosquito land
On your neck
Mosquito drink
Whatever's left
He'll suck your blood
He'll suck your blood
He'll suck your blood
Suck your, suck your, suck your blood
Suck your blood
He'll suck your blood
He'll suck your blood
Suck your, suck your, suck your blood
They can see you but you can't see them
They can see you but you can't see them
So are you gonna let them in?
They're hiding beneath your bed
Crawling between your legs
They're stickin' ya in your vein
Were you itching when they called your name?
Were you itching when they called your name?
They'll suck your blood
They'll suck your blood
They'll suck your blood
Suck your, suck your, suck your blood
Suck your blood
They'll suck your blood
They'll suck your blood
Suck your, suck your, suck your blood
Suck!1Embed
