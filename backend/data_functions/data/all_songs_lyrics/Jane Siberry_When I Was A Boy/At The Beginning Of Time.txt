At The Beginning Of Time Lyrics
Now?

At the beginning of time
Before there were waves
We'd sit in our boats
We'd float there all day
And there weren't any waves
'Cause there wasn't any wind
'Cause there wasn't any sun
We were waiting for the world to begin

We were waiting in the darkness
We were waiting in the darkness

Each of us in our own boats
Each in our own thoughts
Sometimes you could hear people
Talking amongst themselves but...
Someone had a boat with wheels and I said
You're a bit early but I know how you feel
But mostly it was just silence
The silence only broken by
The absence of the clinking of the masts
And every now and then a bird would not fly by
And someone would look up and say
Huh, what wasn't that?
We were waiting in the darkness
We were waiting in the darkness

And one night, or was it day?
I was awoken from a dream
I was dreaming of someplace like I'd never been
And I heard someone say
Someone's fallen in and they can't swim
So I leaned out and I, I pulled them in
And he was holding his head
And it was huge and shaped like a fish
And he slid down to the crook of the keel
And when I was sure he'd fallen asleep
I fell back to my reverie

We were waiting waiting waiting
We were waiting in the darkness

You know what I miss most about that time?
It was the quality of blackness
It was soft somehow
In the absence of fear
You could take it into your mouth
And send it out through your teeth
My dear
But the silence...
Oh if, if I could go back to those times
I'd take that silence there
I'd take it into myself and bring it back to you
And this is what I'd say
We were waiting in the darkness

At the beginning of time
Before there were waves
We'd sit in our boats
We'd float there all day
(Or was it night?)
And there weren't any waves
'Cause there wasn't any wind
'Cause there wasn't any sun
We were waiting for the world to begin
We were waiting for the world to begin

Now?
