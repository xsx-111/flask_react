An Angel Stepped Down (And Slowly Looked Around) Lyrics
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on give me
Mmm hmm
Come give your love to me again
And send me across the water

An angel stepped down
Touched lightly to the ground
Is there something that you haven't said?
Me and my friend
That you haven't said?
We stared at her soul
Mmm hmm, yeah
Mmm hmm, yeah yeah
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Someone help me someone help me
Someone help me someone help me
I'm holding you
Come give your love to me again
And send us across the water
An angel stepped down
And slowly looked around
Is there something that you haven't said?
We stared at her soul
That you haven't said?
I, I, I can't
I believe
Haven't said?
(I believe that love)
I believe that love
Mmm hmm, yeah yeah
I believe that love is the only thing
(I believe that)
The only thing that can heal us all
Mmm hmm, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Is equal to the love you make
The love you take (The love you take)
The love you make (The love you make)
The love you take (The love you take)
And so we give and give and give again
Ah, again

An angel stepped down
Touched lightly to the ground
We started at her soul
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
(I believe that love)
Come on baby come on give me
Come on baby come on give me
Someone help us someone help us
Someone help us someone help us
We're holding you
(I believe)
We're holding you
An experiment in longing
(I believe that love is the only thing that can heal us all)
Is no one asking for this dance?
Were you not asking for this chance?
Come on (i can't)
Come on (i, i can't')
Come on
Come onnnnnnnnnnnn!
Come give your love again again (I can't)
Again again (I can't)
Again again
Again again
Again again
Again again
Again againEmbed
