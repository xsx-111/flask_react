Sweet Incarnadine Lyrics
And when he came I fell into his deepest eyes, oh yeah
And begged the difference between love and open

Come on give your love to me
Ah, the first time I leaned over you and looked into your eyes
I said to myself this is what it must be like
To have everything you'd ever want
And a voice inside my head said
Go
I am
I give you everything
Kaikobad, Kaliere, Pehlevi and in-between
Sweet sweet Incarnadine, incarnadine
Sweet sweet sweet Incarnadine
Come let your love rain down on me again

When you said that it would feel like this
Oh, the love potion
The razor's edge
The open sesame of the kiss
Oh, I swear it was all I felt
I swear it was all I heard
And then, and then we, oh, began to pray
Bless this union, make us whole
Give me strength to let him go
And give us fire and give us flow
To always love like this
The never idle pressing
Silent confessing
The endless versions of the lonely heart
When we love like we love
And we want like we want
And then we cry like a child
Never like this
Never like this
Never like this

Oh, and when he came I fell into his deepest eyes
And begged the difference between love and openEmbed
