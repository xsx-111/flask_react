The Gospel According To Darkness Lyrics
I know there's a place that you call your own
And you're safe and warm and you feel like you're home
And the peace of it and the faith involved
And you go to say, but there's no need to explain it
Still you try and then you see that it's okay
You're on your own

I see you lookin' around at the people on the street
Well, things aren't what they seem
If you push them hard enough
You'll find that most of them do not feel worthy of love
Now how did this come to be?

Oh, my sweet sweet darlin' (Yes?)
Look at me
You're telling me you can't pierce
The darkness into the light? (Yes)
Can you see me? (No, I can't)
Can you see the figure standing on your right?
(Nobody, it's just darkness, it's just darkness)
Come on, I know you understand (I'm trying)
Oh (I'm trying)
Oh (Oh)
Oh, say (Oh)
Love, will you let us know
Will you let us know when it's time
When we can leave this darkness behind?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Oh, my sweet sweet darlin' (Wait)
You know when you open up your eyes?
(Oh, I'm afraid there won't be anyone)
I'm beaming you all this light (Something's happening)
Who is it? (It's a. I'm holding my sweet mama in my arms)
Is she dying? (No, I think she's just been born)
Mmm hmm (And she looks, she look so... sweet)
I know there's a place
(And she looks so... hopeful)
That you call your own
(And she looks so... trusting)
Safe and warm
(She doesn't know, she doesn't know how hard)
And you feel like you're home

I see you lookin' around at the people on the street
Well, things aren't what they seem
If you push them hard enough
You'll find that most of them do not feel worthy of love
Now how did this come to be?
(I know there's a place)
I know there's a place that you call your ownEmbed
