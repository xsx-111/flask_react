Sail Across The Water Lyrics
Love is trembling
Trembling like the little bird we hold within our hands
Love is bending
Bending towards the worried brow
Here, let me wipe away your tears
Love is kneeling
Above the broken body
The ever-upturned face
Love is missing
All the words are broken, help me, I cannot find my way
No I can't
I need you love
Come on love

Will you sail 'cross the water
And lay your wisdom down?
And love will you sail 'cross the water
And tell us what you found?
And love will you sail 'cross the water
And hold us when we drown?
And love will you sail 'cross the water?
Is anybody listening...?

Love is trembling
Trembling like the leaves above the baby's bed
Love is streaming
Streaming with the tears that we cannot seem to shed
Love is frozen
Frozen in the figure they just pulled from the subway grate
Love is burning
Burning with the anger that we all feel
Against which we kneel
Our faces pressed into the lap of loneliness
Come on love
Will you sail 'cross the water
And lay your wisdom down?
And love will you sail 'cross the water
And tell us what you found?
And love will you sail 'cross the water
And hold us when we drown?
And love will you sail 'cross the water?

Are we not willing?
Are we not trying?
Are we not trusting?
Are we not crying?
Are we not children?
Are we not stumbling?
Are we not wondering?
Are we not?
Oh

Sail 'cross the water
And lay your wisdom down?
And love will you sail 'cross the water
And tell us what you found?
And love will you sail 'cross the water
And hold us when we drown?
And love will you sail 'cross the water?
Are we not willing?
Are we not bending?
Are we not frozen?
Are we not trembling?
Are we not children?
Are we not trying?
Are we not wondering?
Are we not?
Oh

Oh
Love is trembling
Love is trembling (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love is trembling (Yeah, oh)
Love is tremblingEmbed
