Calling All Angels Lyrics
Santa Maria, Santa Teresa, Santa Anna, Santa Susannah
Santa Cecilia, Santa Copelia, Santa Dominica, Mary Angelica
Frater Achad, Frater Pietro, Julianus, Petronilla
Santa, Santos, Miroslaw, Vladimir and all the rest

Oh, a man is placed upon the steps and a baby cries
High above you can hear the church bells start to ring
And as the heaviness, oh the heaviness, the body settles in
Somewhere you can hear a mother sing
Then it's one foot then the other as you step out on the road
Step out on the road
How much weight? How much?
Then it's how long? And how far?
And how many times, oh, before it's too late?

Calling all angels
Calling all angels
Walk me through this world
Don't leave me alone
Calling all angels
Calling all angels
We're tryin'
We're hopin'
But we're not sure how
Oh, and every day you gaze upon the sunset
With such love and intensity
Why it's, uh, it's almost as if you could only crack the code
Then you'd finally understand what this all means
Ah, but if you could., do you think you would trade it all
All the pain and suffering?
Ah, but then you'd miss the beauty of the light upon this earth
And the, and the sweetness of the leaving

Calling all angels
Calling all angels
Walk me through this world
Don't leave me alone
Callin' all angels
Callin' all angels
We're tryin'
We're hopin'
But we're not sure why
Calling all angels (Calling all angels)
Calling all angels (Calling all angels)
Walk me through this world (Walk me through this world)
Don't leave me alone
Callin' all angels
Callin' all angels
We're tryin'
We're hopin'
We're hurtin'
We're lovin'
We're cryin'
We're callin'
'Cause we're not sure how this goesEmbed
