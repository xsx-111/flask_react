The Vigil (The Sea) Lyrics
Sail ho heave ho come on let go
Your time on earth is over
I watch you sleeping on the bed
I'm talking to your soul
Did you ever think it'd be like this?
Did you ever think you'd laugh so much?
Did you ever think you'd have to try so hard?
Oh

I'm watching my sweet mama
From my vigil on this chair
I close my eyes I feel a change
Is this my lover here?
Did you ever think it'd be like this?
Did you ever think you'd walk away?
You and me running through
The back streets of the world
Like a pack of hounds of two
Wanting more and more love
And how much is too much?
Did you ever think we'd love so hard?
Fighting hard and hurting worse
Oh, you're sailing away
Go away
Mm hey
(And she looked at the sky and said
I've fallen and I can't get up
Brothers and sisters, come alive!)

Next time I open my eyes
Is this my father here?
I know it's you because
I recognize the smiling little boy
On the sunny front porch
Holding his mama's hand
Remember when your mama said
"We all need love"?
Well, we all need love
Did you ever think you'd refuse love after all?
Did you ever think you would give love
And then take it away?
And leave the lives around you
In such a shame and disarray and pain

It's all right
Put your arms around my neck
Hold me tight as we drift out now
While I have the strength of ten
Oh hold me close, we drift out into the darkness
I think
Pigeons rushing up past our heads
People in doorways
I think this is Europe somewhere
You're so thin you're so light
Don't let go hold me
Hold me
Are these yours? Or mine?
There is nothing I'd rather have
Than for you to put your hand upon my forehead
Just keep it there don't take it away
And tell me that even though you may not like
All the things I do but say, say that you love my soul
And remember me
Oh, remember me

Hold me close put your arms around my neck
As we drift out into the darkness
(I've finished it)
You're so thin
It's only a movie
(And when I came up to the tree)
(Run Bambi run)
It's only a movie
(Run Bambi run)
(Brothers and sisters)
Fire
(I'm there and there's, and there's a body there)
Hold me close we're moving out across the water now
And you're lying on this beach, sleeping
And a tiger's watching you from the edge of the jungle
And, and the sun through the leaves, and his stripes, and it's...
And you're sleeping
And I'm watching and he's watching
You're so beautiful...
Sail ho heave ho come on let go
Your time on earth is over
You have done well it's time to rest
I'm talking to your soul
Did you ever think it'd be like this?
Do you ever think we'll meet again?
How will I ever know it's you?
Maybe will it be the love that I'll feel
When I look into a stranger's eyes
When I look into a stranger's eyes
Oh, you're sailing away

I keep my vigil on this chair
Is this my lover here?
Is this my brother here?
Is this my, my, my baâ€“ my baby?
Is this me lying here?Embed
