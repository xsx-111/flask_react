All The Candles In The World Lyrics
And how many of us will there be?
More than we are now
And where will we come from?
The rivers, the oceans
The ends of the darkest inlets
The lightest-coloured seas
Would not
Would not be enough
Would not be enough to match the fever in my soul
And the fervor in my heart
And the darkness that I feel
As I'm goin' goin' goin' goin' goin' goin' down

And how many of us?
And how many of us will there be?
All the candles in the world
Would not be enough to match the burning in my soul
And the fever in my heart
Count the places of devotion
Count the altars of despairs
As we're goin' goin' goin' goin' goin' goin' down

And how many of us will there be?
And how many of us?
All the candles in the world would not be enough
To match the burning in our souls
And the fever in our hearts
And the fervor in our eyes
As we're hoping and we're praying
And we're setting out into the streets
The back streets of the world
And a prayer going up
And a prayer going down
And the darkened eaves the pigeons
And the candlelight processions
On the streets down below
As we're searching and we're seeking
And we're goin' goin' forgive us Lord
We're goin' goin' down
Goin' down on our knees
AmenEmbed
