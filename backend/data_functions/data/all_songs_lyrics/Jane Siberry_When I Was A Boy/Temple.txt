Temple Lyrics
Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme

You call that hard?
(Mmm gimme, mmm gimme)
You call this cold?
(Mmm gimme, mmm gimme)
That's nothing

Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
Let me into your temple
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
I want into your temple

Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme
Mmm gimme
Come on come on
Mmm gimme
You call that far?
(Mmm gimme)
You call that hot?
You call that darkness?
(Mmm gimme)
Well, it's not
Ah

Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
Let me into the temple
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
I want into the temple
The temple
The temple
The temple

Come on come on
Come on come on
Stop
Mmm gimme
I mean
Mmm gimme
Go
Mmm gimme
You call that loving?
(Mmm gimme)
You call that rain?
(Mmm gimme)
You call that giving?
(Mmm gimme)
You call this pain?
Ah
(Mmm gimme)

You call that rough?
(Mmm gimme)
You call that sad?
(Mmm gimme)
You call that tough?
Well, it's not tough enough

Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
Let me into your temple
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
I want into your temple
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
Let me into the temple
Come on come on come on come on come on
Come on come on come on come on come on
I want into the templeEmbed
