Born This Way - Jost & Naaf Remix Lyrics
It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
Just put your paws up
'Cause you were born this way, baby
(Or capital H-I-M)

Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby love yourself
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby love yourself

My mama told me when I was young
We are all born superstars
She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on
In the glass of her boudoir
"There's nothing wrong with loving who you are"
She said: "'Cause he made you perfect, babe"
"So hold your head up girl and you'll go far
Listen to me when I say"
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track, baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Born this way

(Don't hide yourself-) 
I was born-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I- (Born this way)

Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be a drag, just be a queen
Don't be!

It doesn't matter if you love him
Or capital H-I-M
I born this way
Give yourself prudence
And love your friends
Subway kid, rejoice your truth
In the religion of the insecure
I must be myself, respect my youth
A different lover is not a sin
Believe capital H-I-M
I love my life I love this record and
Mi amore vole fe yah (same DNA)

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way

I'm beautiful-
'Cause God makes no-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I-
I'm beautiful-
'Cause God makes no-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
I was born this way
I'm on the right track baby
I'm on the right track baby
Just love yourself
Just love yourself
I was-
I'm on the right-
Just love yourself (Just love yourself)
I was born-
I'm on the right-
Just love yourself (Just love yourself )
I'm on the right track baby

I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
I'm beautiful in my way
'Cause God makes no mistakes
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Don't hide yourself in regret
Just love yourself and you're set
I'm on the right track baby
I was born this way
Born this way

(Don't hide yourself-) 
I was born-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I-
Don't hide yourself
(Don't hide yourself-) 
I was born-
Don't hide yourself-
Just love yourself-
I'm on the right-
Baby, I- (Born this way)

Don't hide yourself-
Don't hide yourself-Embed
