Electric Chapel Lyrics
My body is sanctuary
My blood is pure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
You want me bad
I think you're cool, but I'm not sure
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something more from you
It's not about sex or champagne, you holy fool
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

Confess to me, where you have been
Next to the bar
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Pray for your sins right under the glass disco ball
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Follow me, don't be such a holy fool
Follow me, I need something sacred from you
Together, we'll both find a way
To make a pure love work in a dirty way

If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel

Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh, uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh
Meet me, meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me

If you want me, meet me at Electric Chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
Oh, if you wanna, meet me at Electric Chapel
(Meet me, meet me)
If you wanna steal my heart away
Meet me, meet me, baby, in a safe place
C'mon, meet me in Electric Chapel
Oh
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me
Meet me, meet me13Embed
