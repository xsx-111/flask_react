Judas Lyrics
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

When he calls to me, I am ready
I'll wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Gaga

I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his goofy way
I've learned love is like a brick
You can build a house or sink a dead body

(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
(Ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah)
A king with no crown, king with no crown
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Ew...
Ew...
In the most Biblical sense, I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench vomits her mind
But in the cultural sense, I just speak in future tense
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, or wear ear condom next time

I wanna love you
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my virtue, and Judas is the demon I cling to
I cling to

Just a Holy Fool, oh baby
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby (Just a Holy Fool, woah-oh-oh-oh)
It's so cruel, but I'm still in love with Judas, baby
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as (Juda-a-a-as)
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
Judas, Juda-ah-ah
