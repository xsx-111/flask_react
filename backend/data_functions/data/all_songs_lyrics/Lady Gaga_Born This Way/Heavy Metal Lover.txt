Heavy Metal Lover Lyrics
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover
Heavy metal lover

I want your whiskey mouth all over my blonde south
Red wine, cheap perfume, and a filthy pout

Tonight bring all your friends, because a group does it better
Why river with a pair?
Let's have a full house of leather

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Dirty pony, I can't wait to hose you down
You've got to earn your leather in this part of town

Dirty pearls and a patch for all the Rivington Rebels
Let's raise hell in the streets, drink beer and get into trouble

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover

I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover

Whip me, slap me, punk funk
New York clubbers, bump drunk
Bud Lite, liquors, bar slam
Move it, this is your jam
Wash the night with St. Jame-son
Like a baptism, heavy metal lovers play
Baby, we were born this way
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
(I could be your girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl)
(But would you love me if I ruled the world, world, world?)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, who-who-who-who
Heavy metal lover
