Government Hooker Lyrics
Gaga, ga-oh-ah
Gaga, ga-oh-oh-oh
Io ritorne, io ritorne
Io ritorne, io ritorne
Government Hooker, eh

I can be good, if you just wanna be bad
I can be cool, if you just wanna be mad
I can be anything, I'll be your everything
Just touch me, baby, I don't wanna be sad

As long as I'm your hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Hands on the ground)
As long as I'm your hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Get down)

Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)

I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
'Cause I know you love me, baby
I know you love me, baby
I could be girl, unless you want to be man
I could be sex, unless you want to hold hands
I could be anything, I could be everything (Iku, iku)
I could be mom, unless you want to be dad (Ay, mi papito!)

As long as I'm your hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Hands on the ground)
As long as I'm your hooker (Back up and turn around)
As long as I'm your hooker (Get down)

Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)

Put your hands on me
John F. Kennedy (Hahahaha)
I'll make you squeal, baby (Hahahaha)
As long as you pay me (Ow)

I'm gonna drink my tears tonight
I'm gonna drink my tears and cry
'Cause I know you love me, baby
I know you love me, baby
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)
Hooker (Yeah, you're my hooker)
Hooker (Government hooker)

I could be girl, unless you want to be man
I could be sex, unless you want to hold hands
I could be anything, I could be everything
I could be mom, unless you want to be dad

I wanna fuck, government hooker (Back up and turn around)
Stop shitting me, government hooker (Hands on the ground)
I wanna fuck, government hooker (Back up and turn around)
Stop shitting me, government hooker (Get down)
