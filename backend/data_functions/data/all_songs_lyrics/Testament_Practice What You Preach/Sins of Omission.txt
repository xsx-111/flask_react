Sins of Omission LyricsThe day's vanished in the night, soon the children pray, pray themselves alone
The hate built from their pride, you can't take away, can't take what they own
The eyes watching from the sky guides them through the haze, calling far away
The rain is black as black, black as night, oh, let them pray
False sense of pride satisfies, there's no reason for suicide
Use your mind and hope to find, find the meaning of existence
The cry's answers wonder why, why it's time to die, time to die alone?
'Cause I'm wasting too much time wandering down the line, reasons why I go my own
False sense of pride satisfies, there's no reason for suicide
Use your mind and hope to find, find the meaning of existence
Yeah!
The eyes watching from the sky guides them through the haze, calling far away
The rain is black as black, black as night, oh, let them pray
False sense of pride satisfies, there's no reason for suicide
Use your mind and hope to find, find the meaning of existence
False sense of pride satisfies, there's no reason for suicide
Use your mind and hope to find, find the meaning of existenceEmbed
