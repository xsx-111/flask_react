October LyricsSo you showed me 'round your town
To hell again and back
Our love has served to alienate all the friends you depend on
I know it might seem odd
But kid, you're not the only one
I remember myself as a lonely child, so I was
And you've got me wrong
You got me wrong

Wrong just seemed so right
'Til the spike of morning light
And all those searching eyes
Do they scald your tender hide?
Remember what they say
"There's no shortcut to a dream
It's all blood and sweat
And life is what you manage in between"
But what you don't know
Is you're too young and eager to love
This evening I see you're about to get into the ditch that your old man dug

Wrong just seemed so right
'Til the spike of morning light
And all those searching eyes
Do they scald your tender hide?
See the stars align
And leave you behind
You want it so, and I
I come by light of an Autumn moon
Sister you know enough
But for now just let it go
Don't run, don't rush
Just flow
Through the give and take you've had to learn
How to cross the coals and not get burned
But you're really just a little girl
Playing in the park 'til the sun goes down
So twenty-one arrives
One day and your time is up
No doubt you think you braided your own hair
So you're all grown up
Should you wander 'cross the line
Which way do you want to fight?
Pretending at love could help you find your way
But you've got me wrong
Yeah, you got me wrong1Embed
