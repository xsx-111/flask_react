Citizen LyricsThis is a day without
A trace of reason
No matter where you turn
And the walls will fall
Affirming nothing
So what's it all about?
Call on the brightest star
Or play your hand as it lays
Wounds always speak too loud

Get along for a while
Citizen, and you'll see
How the innocent are bound to the damned
What is, just is, I know
So we're trapped by answers
Love haunts 'til the end
Are we all to ride
The edge of nothing?
Shake hands with fighting eyes
And if they don't know
Their heart is stopping
Cause everyone is right
Get along for a while
Citizen, and you'll see
How the innocent are bound to the damned
What is, just is, I know
So we're trapped by answers
Love haunts 'til the end
 (x2)
From the moment that we're born
'Til we're old and tired
Do we ever know people?Embed
