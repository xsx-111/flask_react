Trap Doors Lyrics
Walk out before you make it worse on yourself
Now's not the time for that elegant laugh
Daggers from the people once by your side
Once by your side but, now that is over
You have to pick up
And just start again, start again

You've fallen to Earth and you're collared in ice
But burning yourself ain't no challenge to winter
Gotta clip the lines and move for yourself
Just move for yourself, love
Now that it's over, you'll have to pick up
And just watch your back, watch your back

And close your eyes to run
Far, far
Trap doors to the endless fields of our young land
Have we grown too tired in our land to fight

Look, Valentine, if you want it to end
Your life at this temperature, life underwater
You've gotta let these fools all trample themselves
They trample themselves, just dying to enter
You're preaching to the choir
So turn around, turn around
 (x2)
And close your eyes to run
Far, far
Trap doors to the endless fields of our young land
Have we grown too tired in our land to fightEmbed
