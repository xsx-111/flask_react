The Mall and Misery LyricsUse your intuition, it's all you've got
Keys are rare and there's a thousand locks
Stand in your way
So goes the gold age
Your tired life
Digging for a way, you cast a spell
Carve a path from all the things they sell
But they don't let go
Just thought you should know, either way

I know what I know
Would not fill a thimble
So let my mind go
Straight down the runway
Does one want to
Get more used to
The mall and misery
The debt mounts, the cost to be alive
Your eyes are burning from the biting cold
If only to learn what you've never been told:
That there's a real world
And somewhere a good girl
Lives and breathes
Powdered hope in my callow mind
An idea stolen by the morning tide
Now there's a dark time
And this is your dark rhyme
To fill your heart

I know what I know
Would not fill a thimble
So let my mind go
Straight down the runway
Does one want to
Get more used to
The mall and misery
The debt mounts, the cost to be alive3Embed
