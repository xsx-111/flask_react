Your Head Is On Fire Lyrics
Run and hide, your head's on fire
Whirling masses, rolling ashes
Dream of morning, grey earth dawning
Life in stasis, 40 paces

To turn away from the night
Allowing the light alone
Is surely fooling yourself
Leaving half on the shelf
You’ll never know
How low an angry heart can go
So hold onto that certain hand
As we’re turning in


Does anybody else here
Feel that fear?
That none of all these good things had to be?
Or is it just me?Embed
