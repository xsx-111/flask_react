First Caress Lyrics
Ex-lover, where you staying?
Every time that I come back again
I know you're just the same
And when you say
And when you say the wrong thing
Oh, I know I hear the right thing
I know it's just the same

Angel, my love, my first caress
I come back and I find you never changed
Then I think all the years from your love
I've been dispossessed
Aw ha, from your love
My first caress

All your friends have come and went
Found a way to make a certain change
Coconut milk, coconut water
Aw ha, you still like to tell me they're the same
Aw ha, and who'm I to say?

Angel, my love, my first caress
I come back and I find you never changed
Then I think all the years from your love
I've been dispossessed
Aw ha, from your love
My first caress
From your love
Oh yes
From your love
My first caress1Embed
