Can I Sit Next to You Lyrics
Can I sit next to you?
Can you sit next to me?
Get the stars out your eyes
Come and bring them to me

I been down so long
I been working on a plan, yeah
It's just that
I been down so long
I gotta give me my mine when I can

Can I sit next to you?
Can you sit next to me?
I walk to Memphis alone
'Cause you'd do it for me
Oh, I know you would
All of the kicks from the sticks
All the kicks that we knew
I put all that aside, concentrate on you
All the kicks from the sticks
All the hits that we took
All the stitches we got
All our brains so cooked
Oh oh oh
Some day I'm gonna get right (You oughta)
I've been down so long
Been down but now I gotta get lifted up

I'm gonna walk a tightrope
Gonna get kicks every night
No one's holding me back
No one's changing my mind, oh
Gonna walk a tightrope
Gonna get kicks every night
No one's holding me back
No one's changing my mind
Get the stars out your eyes
Come and sit next to me
Under Tennessee skies
Down on South Front Street
Oh oh oh

I been working on a plan, yeah
I been down so long
Been down but now I gotta get lifted up

Get the stars out your eyes...2Embed
