Hot Thoughts Lyrics
Hot thoughts melt in my mind
Could be your accent mixing with mine
You got me uptight, twisting inside
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, babe

Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, yeah
Hot thoughts all in, all in my mind, all of the time
(Woo!)

Your teeth shining so white
Light up this side street in Shibuya tonight
Hot thoughts melting my cool
Is it your motion signaling cues
Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time
You must be trouble for sure

Hot thoughts all in my mind and all of the time, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
I tell it to you slow when I want you to know
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
Hot thoughts all in, all in my mind all of the time
Took time off from my kingdom
Took a break from the war
Took time off from my kingdom
Raise up my creatures
Diamonds from space
Pure facets and features
Last drag drug from your lips
Making you think how good it was to let baby kiss 'em
And those hot thoughts melting your cool
(Hot thoughts all on my mind and all of the time)
Could be that motion signaling cues
You've got

Hot thoughts all in your mind, all of the time, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
All that do my rhyme maketh you mine, yeah
(Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh)
You know, I think all, I think all your love is enough2Embed
