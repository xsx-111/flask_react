Do I Have to Talk You Into It Lyrics
Here we go down a long dark road
Same place where we used to go
And the words get stuck on the tip of my tongue
Feeling cut off from everyone, oh

Do I have to talk you into it?
Do we have to make sense of it?
When I've known you such a long long time
And we never had to act polite
I wanna whisper down the tube
All the words you would never use
Do I have to talk you into it?

Jimmy digs in his long dark coat
Comes up with a tender throat
And he hides it away in Bronson Park
So he can't get to it after dark

Do I have to talk you into it?
Do we have to make sense of it?
They say I better seal you up in wax
So that you're never gonna bite me back
And I can feel it when I'm away
I got to get back tomorrow if not today
To try to talk you into it
Oh, I have to talk you into it
Knock knock
When the mood of the era's gone
Everybody fading me, even my ma
And the words get stuck on the tip of my tongue
Feeling cut off from everyone, oh
Oh, oh, whoa

Do I have to talk you into it?
Do I have to talk you into it?
Well, here we go down a long dark road
Been here, man-many times before
I wanna whisper down the tube
All kinds of words you would never use
Do I have to talk you into it?1Embed
