Pink Up LyricsIf you leave us for later
Break off from everyday
Spend a week in the moment
Take the train to Marrakesh
Just when you would change your focus
We get our own ideas
Go cut down some things you wouldn't
Hope you don't end up alone
Everything you think we are we are
We're come to mesmerize
Everything you fear we are we will be
The time is gonna come
The time is gonna come
We got our own ideasEmbed
