If Lyrics
If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late
And if I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do

If I were asleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane
Please don't put your wires in my brain

If I were the moon, I'd be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man
I'd understand the spaces between friends

If I were alone, I would cry
And if I were with you, I'd be home and dry
And if I go insane
Will you still let me join in with the game?

If I were a swan, I'd be gone
If I were a train, I'd be late again
If I were a good man
I'd talk with you more often than I do7Embed
