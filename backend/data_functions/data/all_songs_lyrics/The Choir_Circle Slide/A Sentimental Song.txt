A Sentimental Song LyricsChildren tremble
Flowers fade so sadly
Love is strange to understand
Winter winds blow
Does the truth sting badly?
Let your tears fall into my hands
Let your tears fall into my hands
Listen closely
And I will sing for you
A sentimental song
And you will know just how I feel
Listen closely
I will sing for you
A sentimental song
Hide with me tonight
Love endures the weather
Let the rain make everything new
In the morning
We will dance together
Let my song fall down around you
Let my song fall down around you
Listen closely
And I will sing for you
A sentimental song
And you will know just how I feel
Listen closely
I will sing for you
A sentimental song
And you will know my love is real
Listen closely
And I will sing for you
A sentimental song
And you will know my heart is true
Listen closely
I will sing for you
A sentimental song
And you will know how I love youEmbed
