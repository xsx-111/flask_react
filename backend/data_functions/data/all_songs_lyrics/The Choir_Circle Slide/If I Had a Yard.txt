If I Had a Yard LyricsIf I had a yard
I would play in it
We could play in it
If we had a yard
If we had a yard
If we had a yard
On a sunny day
I would play croquet
In the early spring
You could grow green things (and purple flowers)
Should the children frown
We would hose them down
If I had a yard
I would play in it
We could play in it
If we had a yard
If we had a yard
If we had a yard
Sleep outside at night
When the Moon is bright
Watch the laundry wave
Dig the dog a grave (in the garden?)
Drink the acid rain
'Til we go insane
If I had a yard
I would play in it
We could play in it
If we had a yard
If you had a yard
If I had a yardEmbed
