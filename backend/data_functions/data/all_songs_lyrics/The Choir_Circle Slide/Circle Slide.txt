Circle Slide LyricsImagine one perfect circle
Above the stratosphere
Where lovers hide away
And children cheer
Because the ground has melted
Where the devil stood
Never mind the carnival
In your own neighborhood
Come on let's ride
The circle slide
Come on, let's ride, ride
The circle slide
Around my neck against my heart
I wear a wooden cross
And sometimes I remember
What freedom costs
Shake off your golden shackles
Children of time no more
Consider now the crimson crown
The Man of Sorrows wore
Come on let's ride
The circle slide
Come on, let's ride, ride
The circle slide
I know it's hard to imagine
When someone makes you cry
Fire in the Heavens
And laughter in the sky
Just let the wind blow through your spirit
Let the sun shine on your face
Let's look into each others eyes
And sing, "Amazing Grace"
Come on let's ride
The circle slide
Come on, let's ride, ride
The circle slideEmbed
