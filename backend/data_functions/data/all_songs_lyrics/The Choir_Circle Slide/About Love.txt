About Love LyricsThe taste of your sweet breath
The salt of morning tears
Again I say good-bye to you
Hold on tight
So good to hurt so bad
So sad to ride away renewed
Go on laugh, go on cry
It's alright
There's something wonderful about love
There's something wonderful about love
There's something lost about me with you
There's something blind about the chosen few
There's something wonderful about love
Was I meant to be yours
The will of Christ above
Do you believe true love is blind
'Cause I don't know
When I get home come spring
Won't you be glad to be mine
Just don't laugh
Please don't cry
Just say so
There's something wonderful about love
There's something wonderful about love
There's something dark about destiny
There's something blue about you with me
There's something wonderful about love
Sorry to call so late
The planet turned four times
You're on my mind but you're nowhere
In my world
Please, kiss the little bird
God bless the cozy cage we share
You kill me
You thrill me
You threaten my dreams, girl
There's something wonderful about love
There's something wonderful about love
There's something liberating death alone brings
There's something funny about a lot of sad things
There's something wonderful about loveEmbed
