Blue Skies LyricsI've got a cause I should surely defend
I hope you will agree
I've got a tire I would love to suspend
I'm searching for a tree
And I'm running down the street
But I haven't found my feet
If I close my eyes
Will I see blue skies
If I close my eyes
Will I find you
Will I find you
I told the truth and it saved one girl's life
And then a blind man screamed
One sister saw me go under the knife
I'm glad it was a dream
And the night is nearly done
So I'm praying for the sun
I've got a cause I should surely defend
Most of my friends agree
I've got a tire I would love to suspend
I think I've found a tree
But sometimes I don't see you
And I wonder what to doEmbed
