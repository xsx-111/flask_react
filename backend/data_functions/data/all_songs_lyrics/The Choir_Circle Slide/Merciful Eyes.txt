Merciful Eyes LyricsDemon of love
Seraph of treason
Heaven above
Show me the reason
Was the ruler of darkness the angel of light
Did I wake up one morning a creature of night
Can a justified sinner discern wrong from right
When I turn
From your face
Render mercy and grace
Red blood rain
From the sky
God have merciful eyes
Merciful eyes
Innocent tears
Day of the dancer
Heaven come near
Whisper the answer
Did the dead man arise when she entered the room
Did I smell love decaying and call it perfume
Should a justified man know the grave from the womb
When I turn
From your face
Render mercy and grace
Red blood rain
From the sky
God have merciful eyes
Merciful eyes
Swear by the Ghost
Promises broken
Baby come close
Sorry words spoken
Would the Spirit of Truth make a liar understand
If I reach for the blue with my face in the sand
Could a justified slave call himself a free man
When I turn
From your face
Render mercy and grace
Red blood rain
From the sky
God have merciful eyes
Merciful eyes
Merciful eyes
Merciful eyes
Merciful eyesEmbed
