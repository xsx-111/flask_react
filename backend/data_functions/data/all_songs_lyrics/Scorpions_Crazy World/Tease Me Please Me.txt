Tease Me Please Me Lyrics
I've been around the world
I've known a lot of girls
Living and loving
It's hard to keep them all in line
I've seen a lot of sights
Many crazy nights
Cruising and boozing
It's a wonder that I'm still alive

Never wasted any time
Never missed a beat
Total satisfaction
Always guaranteed

Tease me
Please me
No one needs to know
Tease me
Please me
Before I have to go

Spread the word around
The boys are back in town
Reeling and rocking
We're rolling with it win or lose
The girls are dressed to kill
Looking for a thrill
Sliding and gliding
Sometimes they make it hard to choose
So hard to choose


Tease me
Please me
We'll take it nice and slow
Nice and slow
Tease me
Please me
Just let the feeling grow
Let it grow
