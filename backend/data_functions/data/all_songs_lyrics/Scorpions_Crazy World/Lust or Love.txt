Lust or Love Lyrics
The innocence is gone
But still I'm holding on
Searching for love that lasts forever
Looking for a place
Where love can hide away
Taking a chance it's now or never

Maybe it's time to draw the line
There's just one thing that's on my mind

Is it lust, is it love
Whatever it is I can't get enough
Is it lust, is it love
When I look around tell me who can I trust
Is it love

Lovers come and go
Sometimes it's hard to know
If this will be a night to treasure
When the damage has been done
And the hurting has begun
You'll justify a moment's pleasure

Is it lust, is it love
Whatever it is I can't get enough
Is it lust, is it love
It ain't nothing that I can't rise above
Is it lust, is it love
When I look around tell me who can I trust (who can I trust)
Is it love
Is it love
Lust or love


Is it lust, is it love
Whatever it is I can't get enough
Is it lust, is it love
It ain't nothin' that I can't rise above
Is it lust, is it love
Still lookin' for more, it's never enough
Is it lust, is it love
When I look around tell me who can I trust (who can I trust)
Is it love, is it love, is it love
Is it love, is it love1Embed
