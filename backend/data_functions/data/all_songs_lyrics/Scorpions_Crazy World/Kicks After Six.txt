Kicks After Six Lyrics
Another morning, such as ordinary day
She's doing time from nine to five
The hours waste away
There's no escape, she's a part of the big machine
She's a slave to the suit and tie
Seven days a week

But every night, Ohoooo
She can hardly wait
It feels alright
To give it all away, Ohoooo

Good girls get their kicks after six
Good girls get their kicks after six
(She needs it bad, real real bad)
She wants what she never had
All the things that make a good girl bad
She gets her kicks after six

Some days its hard to face the cruel reality
Just waiting for the bell to ring
She wants to be free
It feels so good to start another endless night
She spreads her wings for another flight
She's running wild
