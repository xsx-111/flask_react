Southern Exposure Lyrics
Well, I work all the week in the blazin' sun
Lord, I work all the week in the blazin' sun
Lord, I work all the week in the blazin' sun
Can't buy my shoes, Lord, when my payday come

I ain't treated no better than a mountain goat
I ain't treated no better than a mountain goat
I ain't treated no better, Lord, than a mountain goat
Boss takes my crop and a poll tax takes my vote

I'm leavin' here 'cause I just can't stay
Yes, I'm leavin' here, just can't stay
Lord, I'm lea-leavin' here 'cause I just can't stay
I'm goin' where I can get more decent payEmbed
