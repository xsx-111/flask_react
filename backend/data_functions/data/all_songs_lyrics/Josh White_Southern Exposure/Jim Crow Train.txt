Jim Crow Train Lyrics
Can't you hear that train whistle blow?
Can't you hear that train whistle blow?
Can't you hear that train whistle blow?
Lord, I wish that train wasn't Jim Crow

Stop the train so I can ride this train
Stop Jim Crow so I can ride this train
Stop Jim Crow so I can ride this train
Black and White folks ridin' side by side

Now hear that train whistle blow
Can't you hear that train whistle blow?
Can't you hear that train whistle blow?
Oh Lord, this train is Jim CrowEmbed
