Defense Factory Blues LyricsWent to the defense factory, trying to find some work to do
Had the nerve to tell me, "black boy, nothing here for you"
My father died, died fighting 'cross the sea
Mama said his dying never helped her or me
I'll tell you brother, well it sure don't make no sense
When a Negro can't work in the national defense
I'll tell you one thing, that boss man ain't my friend
If he was, he'd give me some Democracy to defend
In the land of the free, called the home, home of the brave
All I want is liberty, that's what I craveEmbed
