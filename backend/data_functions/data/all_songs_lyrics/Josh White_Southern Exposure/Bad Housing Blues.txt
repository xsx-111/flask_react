Bad Housing Blues Lyrics
I woke up this morning, rainwater in my bed
I woke up this morning, rainwater in my bed
You know, my roof was leaking, Lord, leaking on my head

Now there ain't no reason I should live this way
Now there ain't no reason I should live this way
I done lost my job, can't even get on the WPA

Lord, I wonder when I'll hear good news
Lord, I wonder when I'll hear good news
Right now I'm gonna tell you how I got them bad housing blues

I'm goin' to the capitol, goin' to the White House lawn
Well, I'm goin' to the capitol, goin' to the White House lawn
Better wipe out these slums, been this way since I was bornEmbed
