Uncle Sam Says Lyrics
Well, airplanes flyin' 'cross the land and sea
Everybody flyin' but a Negro like me
Uncle Sam says, "Your place is on the ground
When I fly my airplanes, don't want no Negro 'round"

The same thing for the Navy when ships goes to sea
All they got is a mess boy's job for me
Uncle Sam says, "Keep on your apron, son
You know I ain't gonna let you shoot my big Navy gun"

Got my long gov'ment letters, my time to go
When I got to the Army, found the same old Jim Crow
Uncle Sam says, "Two camps for black and white"
But when trouble starts, we'll all be in that same big fight

If you ask me, I think democracy is fine
I mean democracy without the color line
Uncle Sam says, "We'll live the American Way"
Let's get together and kill Jim Crow todayEmbed
