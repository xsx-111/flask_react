Welcome to New York Lyrics
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanting something more
Searching for a sound that they haven't heard before

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack
I can dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
They never blind me, me

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
You can want who you want
Boys and boys, girls and girls
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack
I can dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
They never blind me, me

Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
Aahhh... Aahhh...
Oohh...Embed
