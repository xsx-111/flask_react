Clean Lyrics
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back-and-forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained shirt I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
Think that I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, covering my room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, and I screamed so loud
But nobody heard a thing

And the rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
That morning, gone was any trace of you
Think that I am finally clean
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
Now I'm clean, not gonna risk it

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
By morning, gone was any trace of you
I think that I am finally clean
It came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
By morning, gone was any trace of you
Gone was any trace of you
Gone was any trace, gone was any trace
Gone was any trace, gone was any trace
Gone was any trace, gone was any trace of youEmbed
