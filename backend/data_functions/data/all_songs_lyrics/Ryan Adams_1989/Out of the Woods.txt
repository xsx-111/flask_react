Out of the Woods Lyrics
Looking at it now
All seemed so simple
We were lying on the couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
We were in screaming color
I remember thinkin'

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good

Lookin' at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't forget, when we decided
To move the furniture just so we could dance
Like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good

I remember when you hit the brakes too soon
20 stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby I did too
When the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I was settin' you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good. (good)Embed
