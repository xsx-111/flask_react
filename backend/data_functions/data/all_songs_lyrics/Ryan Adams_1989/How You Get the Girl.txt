How You Get the Girl Lyrics
Stand there like a ghost
Shakin' from the rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
That's how it works
That's how you get the girl

Say "I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever"
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl

Remind her how it used to be
Of pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone and you never told her why
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
I want you for worse or for better
I will wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl

You could know that I don't wanna let you go
You could know that I don't wanna let you go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And you say, you say you want me
And you say, you say you want meEmbed
