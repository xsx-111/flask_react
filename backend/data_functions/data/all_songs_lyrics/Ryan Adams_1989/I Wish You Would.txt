I Wish You Would Lyrics
It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street, memories start
Say it's in the past
You drive straight ahead
Thinking that I hate you now
But you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 am, in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
And I think of you
We're crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Makes you wanna turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish that you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing
This mad love makes you come running
Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would

It's 2 am, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run, makes you wanna hide
Makes you wanna turn right back around
I wish you would come back
Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And know what we were fighting for
I wish that you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you wouldEmbed
