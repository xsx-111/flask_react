I Know Places Lyrics
You stand with your hand on your waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, it's a bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame
It could burn out, it could burn out

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
We run, we run

Cause baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
Yeah, I know places

Lights flash and we run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time, not this time
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
We run, we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, we're bulletproof
And you know for me, it's always you
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
And I know for you, I know for you
I know for you, it's always me

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places
I know places we can hide
I know places we can hideEmbed
