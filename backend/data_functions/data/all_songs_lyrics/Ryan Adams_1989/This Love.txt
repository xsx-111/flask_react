This Love Lyrics
Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is back from the dead
And these hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me

Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I can go on and on, on and on, and I will
Lantern burning, flickering in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone
Been losin' grip, these sinking ships
It's like you showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is back from the dead
And these hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
I kiss your cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young, you run
When you're young, you run
When you're young, you run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is back from the dead
And these hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
This love came back to meEmbed
