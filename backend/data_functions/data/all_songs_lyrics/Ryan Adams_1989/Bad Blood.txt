Bad Blood Lyrics
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

It's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know we used to have mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
Now we've got problems
I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood

Did you think we'd be fine?
Got scars on my back from your knife
Don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they always last
Did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
Time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming' my way
Just don't
It's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
And now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, your blood runs cold

And baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, heyEmbed
