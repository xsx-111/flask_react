Banned From the Roxy LyricsBanned from the Roxy...Ok
I never much liked playing there anyway
They said they only wanted well behaved boys
Do they think guitars and microphones are just toys?
Well, i've chosen to make my stand
Against what I feel is wrong with this land
They just sit there on their overfed asses
Feeding off the sweat of less fortunate classes
They keep their power cos their finger's on the button
They got control and won't let it be forgotten
The truth of their reality is at the end of a gun
The proof is all in history and is no fun
Seeing the army in your front yard
Seeing the machine guns resting on the fence
Finding the entrance to your door is bared
And they got the nerve to call back defence
Seems their defence is a just the threat of strength
Protection for the privileged at any length
The government protecting their profits from the poor
The rich and the fortunate chaining up the door
Afraid that the people may ask for a little bit more
Than the shit they get, the shit they get, the shit they get
The shit they get
Defence it's nothing less than war
And no one but the government knows what it's for
Oh yes they say it's defence, say it's decency
Mai Lai, Hiroshima, know what I mean?
The same lies with depressing frequency
They say "We had to do it to keep our lives clean"
Well whose life? Who are they talking to?
I'll tell you one thing, it ain't me and you
And their systems, christ, they're everywhere
School, army, church, the corporation deal
Our reality based on fear
A conspiracy to stop you feeling real
But they're wrong
I'd say they're wrong
I swear they're wrong
I know they're wrong
I ain't quite ready with my gun
But we've always got our song
So i've been
Banned from the Roxy, Ok
Never much like playing there anywaysEmbed
