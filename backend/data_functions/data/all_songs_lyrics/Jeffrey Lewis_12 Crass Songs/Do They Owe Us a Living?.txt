Do They Owe Us a Living? LyricsOne, two, three, four
Politics, election, here's something I want to say
About the state of the nation, the way they treat us today
At school, they give you shit, drop you in a pit
You try, you try, you try to get out, but you can't because they've fucked you about
Then you're a prime example of how they must not be
This is just a sample, what they've done to you and me
Do they owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they fucking do)
They don't want me anymore, 'cause threw it on the floor
Used to call me sweet thing, I'm nobody's plaything
And now that I am different, they'd love to bust my head
They'd love to see me cop-out, they'd love to see me dead
Do they owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they fucking do)
But the living that is owed to me, I'm never going to get
They buggered this whole world up, up to their necks in debt
They give you a lobotomy for something you ain't done
They make you the epitome of everything that's wrong
Do they owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they fucking do)
But they don't take any notice of what the public thinks
They're so hyped up on the TV, they just don't want to think
They'll use you as a target for demands and for advice
And when you don't want to hear it, say you're full of vice
Do they owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they do, course they do)
Owe us a living?
(Course they fucking do)Embed
