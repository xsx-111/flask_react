Walls (Fun In The Oven) LyricsDesire, desire, desire, desire
Desire, desire, desire, desire
Desire, desire, desire, desire
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
No air to breath inside your walls
Left to dream inside your walls
Left us in a wilderness
Well I can make my paradise
Without your walls I am alive
No body I, in rank and file
Girl and boy and man and wife
Flesh your measure with a smile
Have and hold and hold and have
Have and hold and hold and have
Desire, deny, deny, desire
Have a child to justify
Images that you apply
I won't bow my head in shame
I won't bow my head in shame
I won't play the game the same
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls we all survive
Without your walls no guilt to bear
Without your love, our love to share
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Desire, desire, desire, desire
Desire, desire, desire, desire
Desire, desire, desire, desire
Describe, fire, file, denial
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
No air to breath inside your walls
Left to dream inside your walls
Left us in a wilderness
Well I can make my paradise
Without your walls I am alive
No body I, in rank and file
Girl and boy and man and wife
Flesh your measure with a smile
Have and hold and hold and have
Have and hold and hold and have
Desire, deny, deny, desire
Have a child to justify
Images that you apply
I won't bow my head in shame
I won't bow my head in shame
I won't play the game the same
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls we all survive
Without your walls no guilt to bear
Without your love, our love to share
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am alive
Without your walls I am aliveEmbed
