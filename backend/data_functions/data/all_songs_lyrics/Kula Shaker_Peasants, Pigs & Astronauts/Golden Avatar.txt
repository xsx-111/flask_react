Golden Avatar LyricsWell I called you the keeper of my heart
'Cos I felt that you'd been there waiting
From the start, From the start yeah
Well you said "Do you remember who you are?
Did you know you fell from heaven like a star?"
Would we like to be that way again?
Born beside a holy river
Darkened moon eclipsed the future
Your name is gold forever
Your name is gold forever
Well they call you the golden avatar
But nobody really knows you as you are
And we'd like to see you shine
Yeah we'd like to see you shine
I can see by the light that you shine on me
If I could surrender tomorrow
But the flames of fire inviting me
Are sending me further and further away
Further and further and further
And further awayEmbed
