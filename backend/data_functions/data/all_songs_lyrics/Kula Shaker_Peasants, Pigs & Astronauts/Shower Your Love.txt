Shower Your Love LyricsShower your love on me
Don't make it so hard to cry
Shower your love on me
You don't need a reason why
'Cos I'm not even half the way there
But I'm just too stupid to care
So help me now
Before I'm trough
The scenes in my open mind
Confusion and flashing lights
Shower your love on me
Cos nothing here feels right
Cos I'm not even half the way there
But I'm just too stupid to care
So help me now
I've done all I can do
Shower your love on me
I can't wait, I'm losing faith
Like we may just explode
Comfort me with a melody
Show me that I'm gonna know the answer
Show me that I'm gonna knowEmbed
