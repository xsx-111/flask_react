Great Hosannah LyricsIf we stand here together
And we see the world as one
We may think there's no future
But it's the same for everyone
It's like the world has lost its head
And it's like all the prophets said
But will we arise to a new world
If we stand here together
We can laugh at what we've done
All our time has been wasted
And there's nowhere left to run
There may be trouble up ahead
Will we be sleeping in our beds
Or will we arise to a new world
Look for signs and portents
I'm looking for a reason to believe
Will we arise in our time
At the dawn of another meaning
Will we awake at the break of a great hosannah
Well if there's nothing left to do
Just hold your breath and hope it's true
That we'll arise to a new worldEmbed
