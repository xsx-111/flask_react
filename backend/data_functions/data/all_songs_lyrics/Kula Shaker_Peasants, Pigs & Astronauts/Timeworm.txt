Timeworm LyricsOh brother please
We are born to this world again
How can we see
When we're travelling in time
Love is the key
And the key is the name my friend
When will we see that we're
Travelling in time
Know that your soul
Is on fire
Like a million suns
Burn like a star
And be travelling in timeEmbed
