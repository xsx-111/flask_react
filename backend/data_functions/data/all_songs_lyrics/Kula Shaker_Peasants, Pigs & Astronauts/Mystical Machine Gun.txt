Mystical Machine Gun LyricsAlien identities don't hide your pretty face from me
You awoke to the riddle of your life but no-one was there for you
Open to where you first began as a nicotine junkie, singing for a kodacam
Are you glad to see how far you've come?
You're a wizard in a blizzard
A mystical machine gun!
Mystical machine gunfire
Watch the skies
For the mystical machine gunfire
Alien identities don't hide that special place from me
You walked through a fire with a ten headed lion and turned on your destiny
Open up, forget your life
Breathe in, breathe out, retain a sense of suicide
Are you glad to see how far you've come?
You're a wizard in a blizzard
A mystical machine gun!
Mystical machine gunfire
Watch the skies
For the mystical machine gunfire
Well you've got to be stronger now than them
Now you've got to be strong
You'll be singing the song of life 'til then
You'll just have to be strongEmbed
