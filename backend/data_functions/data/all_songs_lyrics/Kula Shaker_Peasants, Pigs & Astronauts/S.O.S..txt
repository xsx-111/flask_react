S.O.S. Lyrics(It's two o'clock)
Blood transfusion, revolution
Satellites on Mars
Man became the spawn of Satan
Driving round in cars
I read the news but the news didn't fascinate
I stayed at home, watched the media ejaculate
This is the age of decay and hipocrisy
Sometimes I feel like the world isn't ready for me
Every time I turn a microscopic worm is telling me he's it
Dressed in robes of cosmic ego, crawling around in shit
I read the news but the news didn't fascinate
I stayed at home, watched the media ejaculate
This is the age of decay and hipocrisy
Sometimes I feel like the world isn't ready for meEmbed
