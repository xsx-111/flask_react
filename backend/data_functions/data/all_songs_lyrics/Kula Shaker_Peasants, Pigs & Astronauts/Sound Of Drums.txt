Sound Of Drums LyricsI hear the sound of drums on a melody, I hear the sound of drums
Well singing the names above in the city, yeah, revolution for fun
I feel the time has come like a remedy, I feel the time has come
We're shaking the spear of love in the city, yeah, I hear the sound of drums
Yeah, yeah, can you feel the love for me, yeah yeah
I feel the time has come, I hear the sound of drums
I hear the sound of drums on a melody, calling me to return
Well light up and catch the sun, 'cause its gonna be revolution for fun
Yeah, yeah, can you feel the love for me, yeah, yeah
I feel the time has come, I hear the sound of drums, drums
Well I feel the time has come with a melody, I see the golden one
Well I'm not the only one with the remedy, I'm not the only one
I feel the time has come, I hear the sound of drums, drumsEmbed
