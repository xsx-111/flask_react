The Other Side of Mt. Heart Attack LyricsI won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far
I can always be found
I can always be found
If you need me
If you need me
If you need me
I can always be found
I can always be found
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
If you want me to stay
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
I won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far
I can always be found
I will stay by your side
And I want you to find me
So I'll stay by your side
If you need me
If you need me
If you need me
I can always be found
I can always be found
I can always be found
I won't run far
I won't run far
I won't run far
I can always be found
I can always be found
I can always be found2Embed
