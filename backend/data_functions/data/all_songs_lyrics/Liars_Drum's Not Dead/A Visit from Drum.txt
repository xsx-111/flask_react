A Visit from Drum LyricsYour blood can tell you
All the others say
Arched waves of ceiling
Could stand outside the door
When the powers out and it's dark in the house
I will run
When the powers out and it's dark in the house
I will run
Run
Run
Run
Your blood reveals it
Reveals it
Reveals it
Reveals it
All the others say
All the others say
All the others sayEmbed
