Drum Gets a Glimpse LyricsIt seems like all our friends are gone
You drove them out
Was I naive to think they'd stay?
You were a bore
Why can't we just try start again?
It just won't work
There's so much that we couldn't say
You speak in tongues
I'm bothered by these trembling stars
Then close your eyes
Why should we try to stay awake?
'Cause you can't sleep
Then why should I be here at all?
'Cause you can't sleepEmbed
