It Fit When I Was a Kid LyricsDeep
At the end of space
Further than the Sun
Is a crowd of chairs
Way out
On a crystal sea
Protecting you and me
Is a battleship
I...
I aimed my eyebrows
Into a question
Who is this captain
And where do his friends live?
We were walking in the snow
Down the street from your front door
I jumped a neighbor's fence at dawn
Danced my way across your lawn
Used a diamond on the glass
Slithered slowly through the dark
Made my way up o'er your stairs
Crystals flying everywhere
I...
I...
We will
Drive you in the boot
Through the crooked past
To your resting place
We will leave you in the woods
Tell your friends you slipped
Down the looming tree
If you're
Seen there
Blooming
Inside
Each time I
Hope that
Talking
Improves
I will
Remember
You...
You...
Follow lonely crowds as clouds will come
Follow lonely crowds as clouds...
Follow lonely crowds as clouds will come
Follow lonely crowds as clouds will come1Embed
