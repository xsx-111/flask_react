The Wrong Coat for You Mt. Heart Attack LyricsThey will discover you
Drawing in the living room
Time won't have altered you
If they uncover you
Proving all your theories
It would not discredit you
Laws of all gravity
Dancing out in front of me
Time won't have altered me
Regrets a little more
With each step we take
These steps to your doomEmbed
