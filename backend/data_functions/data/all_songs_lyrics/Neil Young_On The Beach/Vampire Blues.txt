Vampire Blues Lyrics
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, babe, sell you twenty barrels worth
I'm a black bat, babe, banging on your window pane
I'm a black bat, babe, banging on your window pane
Well, I'm a black bat, babe, I need my high octane

Good times are coming, I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are coming, I hear it everywhere I go
Good times are coming, but they sure coming slow
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
I'm a vampire, babe sucking blood from the earth
Well, I'm a vampire, babe, sell you twenty barrels worth
Good times are comingEmbed
