Jordan River Lyrics
No wicked shall not enter this-a river
The fittest of the fittest shall enter
Who is the son of he from Buzz Rock
With his garment dipped in blood?
All I know is that

Jordan River gonna roll, roll, roll
Jordan River gonna roll
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Roll, roll, roll
Jordan River gonna roll
Let it roll, let it roll, must roll
Roll, roll, roll
Jordan River gonna roll
Jordan River go roll, a go roll
Jordan River a go roll, a go roll
Roll,Jordan River
Roll,Jordan River
Roll,Jordan River
Let it roll, let it roll, let it roll
Roll, roll, roll
Jordan River a go roll
Jordan River a go roll, a go roll
Roll, River Jordan, roll
Roll, River Jordan, roll
Roll, River Jordan
Roll, River Jordan
A go roll, a go roll, a go roll
Roll, roll, roll
Jordan River a go roll
My black brothers and sisters
Waiting up on I and I come forth home
Hold hands in hands
Be side by side
Sing happy songs at River Jordan's side

Jordan River gonna roll, roll, roll
Jordan River gonna roll
River gonna roll, gonna roll
Roll, roll, roll
Jordan River gonna roll
No wicked shall not enter this river
Roll, roll, roll
The fittest of the fittest shall enter
Wicked shall not enter
Wicked shall not enter
People come and see it flow
Roll, roll, roll
People come and see the river flow
A go roll, a go roll, a go roll, a go rollEmbed
