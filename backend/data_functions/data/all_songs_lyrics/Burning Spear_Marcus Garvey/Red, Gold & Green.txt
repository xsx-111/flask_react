Red, Gold & Green Lyrics
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river
When your journey has end
Right over there
Right over there

Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow

The rainbow
Oh, the rainbow
The the rainbow
Whoa the rainbow

Chanting home again around the rainbow circle throne
Chanting home again around the rainbow circle throne
The lion, the lion, the lion, the lion, crown the king
The lion, the lion, crown the king
In Addis Ababa, Africa
The, yes, continent, continent, continent, continent
Continent, continent, continent, continent, continent
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow

Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river
Meet me at the bank of the beautiful river
Right over there, Right over there
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbow
Ites, green and gold, it's the rainbowEmbed
