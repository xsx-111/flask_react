Give Me Lyrics
Give me what is mine
(Give me) Free access
(Give me) Free access
(Give me) Set me free let me be
(Give me) Free from all misery
(Give me) Why won't you give me
(give me)

People people (good people heed me)
People people (good people heed me)
Yeah.. why won't you, why won't you
(Give me) Free I sence
(Give me) Set me free let me be
(Give me) Free
(Give me)

Sit up every day (only want to receive)
Sit up every day (only want to receive)
You never have a thing to give away
You never have a thing to give away
But you must

Give me what is mine
(Give me) I want it
(Give me) Give it to me
(Give me) It belongs to me
(Give me)
You go your ways, and I go mine
You go your ways, and I go mine
You go your ways, and I go mine
I'm sure I will hold my head up straight on the line
I'm sure I will hold my head up straight on the line
But you must

Give me what is mine
(Give me) I want it
(Give me) Give me what is mine
(Give me) Can't you see it's mine
(Give me) It belongs to me
(Give me) I want it
(Give me) I wouldn't commit no crime
(Give me) Give me what is mine Give me
(Give me) Give it to me
(Give me) Can't you see
(Give me) Wo-ho-ho
(Give me) Wo-ho-ho, wo-ho-ho
(Give me) Give me! Give me!
(Give me) Give me! Why won't you..Embed
