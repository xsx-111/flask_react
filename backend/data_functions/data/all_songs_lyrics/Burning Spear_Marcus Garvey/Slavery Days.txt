Slavery Days LyricsDo you remember the days of slavery?
Do you remember the days of slavery?
And how they beat us
And how they worked us so hard
And they used us
'Til they refuse us
Do you remember the days of slavery?
And a big fat bull
We usually pull it everywhere
We must pull it
With shackles around our necks
And I can see it all no more
Do you remember the days of slavery?
My brother feels it
Including my sisters too
Some of us survive
Showing them that we are still alive
Do you remember the days of slavery?
History can recall, history can recall
History can recall the days of slavery
Oh slavery days!
Oh slavery days!
While I remember, please remember
Do you do you do you, do you do you do you
Oh slavery days!
Oh slavery days!Embed
