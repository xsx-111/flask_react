Old Marcus Garvey Lyrics
No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey

No one remember him, no one
They been talking about Paul Bogle
They been talking about William Goddon
They been talking about Norman Washington Manley
Including Bustamante

No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey

Finest time
John the Baptist's head were cut off
Put it away into a saucer
Still disciples have oh Lord believe me
Yes they stoneth him to death

No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey
This day the right way
This day the right way
This day the right way
All us got to do is
A true black Lou I
A hatred scatter, even melt before the fire light go out

No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey

Children, children, children, children
Humble yourself and become one day somehow
You will remember him you will

No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey

Garvey's old yet young
Garvey's old yet young
Garvey's old yet young
Garvey's old yet young
They been talking about Paul Bogle
They been talking about William Goddon
They been talking about Norman Washington Manley
Including Bustamante
John the Baptist's head were cut off
Put it away into a saucer
Still disciples have oh Lord believe me
Yes they stoneth him to death

No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus Garvey
No one remember old Marcus GarveyEmbed
