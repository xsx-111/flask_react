Resting Place Lyrics
Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find it?
Where must I find my resting place?
Over the hills, across the valley
Over the hills, across the valley

I'm sure I can see, I'm sure I can see
Too much pollution, too much
Too much pollution, too much pollution
Too much pollution, too much pollution

I would like to see
The broad shaded tree
Just I can rest my head underneath
'Cause the sun is so hot
What says the Father
Oh gosh!

Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find my resting place?
Over the hills, across the valley
I'm sure I can see, I'm sure I can see
Too much pollution, too much pollution

I would like to see
A broad-shaded tree
Just I can rest my head, my head underneath
'Cause the sun is so hot
What says the Father
Oh gosh! Oh gosh! Oh gosh!

Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find my resting place?
Where must I find my resting
My resting, my little resting?
Where must I find my resting place?Embed
