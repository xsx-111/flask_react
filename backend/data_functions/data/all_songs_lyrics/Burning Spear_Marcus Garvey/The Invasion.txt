The Invasion Lyrics
They take us away from Africa
With the intention to steal our culture
The good father pass by and say
Humble yourself, my little one
Humble yourself, my children
Humble yourself

Oh my brothers it is
Wadada wo-oh-oh wadada
Who I-lier than I-ly
Wadada wo-oh-oh wadada
Means love in Africa
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Love I-niversally
My interpretation love universal
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada

Love in Africa
Love in America
Love in Canada

Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Who I-lier than I-ly
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Every knee shall bend (shall bend, shall bend)
Every tongue shall tell (shall tell, shall tell)
Down in this valley, down in this valley
Down in this valley of Jehoshaphat
Where is your love Jamaicans?
Where is your love Jamaicans?
Where is your love Jamaicans?

I can't see your love
I can't feel your love
Nor even touch your love
I don't know about your love
Taught them the way to love one another

Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Who I-lier than I-ly
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Black guidance be with I
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Even within I-man black race
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
No plague shall come up on I, to eat up I flesh
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Keep them away Wadada
Keep them away Wadada
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Black Wadada
Revive for I and I
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Food, clothes and shelter
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Grant unto I my heart desire
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Each and everyone entitled to their heart's desire
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
Be with I and I and I
Wadada wo-ho-ho wadada
They take us away from AfricaEmbed
