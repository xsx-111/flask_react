Live Good Lyrics
Try my best to live good
Yes, yes, yes
Try my best to do the right. All the right I can
Yes, yes, yes

I don't know what wrong have I done you
I don't know. No, no, no
I don't know what wrong have I done you
I don't know. No, no, no

All I know I must speak I must
Yes, yes, yes
All I know I must speak. I must
Yes, yes, yes

Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes

I don't know what wrong have I done you
I don't know, no, no, no
I don't know what wrong have I done you
I don't know, no, no, no
All I know I must speak, I must
Yes, yes, yes
All I know I must speak, I must
Yes, yes, yesEmbed
