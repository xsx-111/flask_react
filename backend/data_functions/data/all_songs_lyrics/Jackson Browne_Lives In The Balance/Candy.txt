Candy Lyrics
Daughter of a woman who comes and goes
Candy
Daughter of a man she barely knows
Candy
All grown up about the things
People know to do
How to take a love and tear it in two
No no no that isn't how it's gonna be
For Candy
Oh Candy

She wants to be in love
But she doesn't know why
Candy
They think she's a child
But look at her now
My my Candy
Candy Candy

Step by step this is her debut
Looking for love that's made to stay true
Step by step she's looking for more than I see
Candy
Oh Candy
Candy
You know what your love is worth
It's a good thing baby
Candy
Take care of your own love first
What the world needs now

All the young men want to pin her down
Candy
If you're looking for a real love
It's a ghost town
Candy

Step by step this is her debut
Looking for love that's made to stay true
Step by step she's looking for more than I see
Candy
Oh Candy

Candy
Candy
Candy
Candy
