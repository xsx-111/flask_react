Cold Lyrics
Scarred, your back was turned, curled like an embryo
Take another face, you will be kissed again
I was cold as l mouthed the words and crawled across the mirror
And wait, await the next breath

Your name like ice into my heart

A shallow grave, a monument to the ruined age
Ice in my eyes and eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon, another past time

Your name like ice into my heart

Everything as cold as life (Can no one save you?)
Everything as cold as silence (And you will never say a word)

(Your name like ice into my heart)
(Your name like ice into my heart)8Embed
