The Hanging Garden Lyrics
Creatures kissing in the rain
Shapeless in the dark again
In the hanging garden, please don't speak
In the hanging garden, no one sleeps

(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)

Catching halos on the moon
Gives my hands the shapes of angels
In the heat of the night, the animals scream
In the heat of the night walking into a dream

Fall, fall, fall, fall into the walls
Jump, jump out of time
Fall, fall, fall, fall out of the sky
Cover my face as the animals cry

(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)
Creatures kissing in the rain
Shapeless in the dark again
In a hanging garden, change the past
In a hanging garden wearing furs and masks

Fall, fall, fall, fall into the walls
Jump, jump out of time
Fall, fall, fall, fall out of the sky
Cover my face as the animals die

(In the hanging garden)
As the animals die
Cover my face as the animals die

(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)
(In the hanging garden)4Embed
