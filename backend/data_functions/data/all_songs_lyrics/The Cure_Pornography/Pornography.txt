Pornography Lyrics
Before we finally  BBC 2 today  A reminder that there's a treat in store for opera lovers  tomorrow evening with a sparkling performance from the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden of one of the world's best-loved Romantic operas: Pavarotti  Puccini at 5-past-8 tomorrow. Well now there's the last look at the clock this eve, and the time's just winding its way round to eight minutes to one. If you're still up and about and want a bit more entertainment, a reminder that our colleagues over at BBC Radio are still on the airwaves. On Radio 2 in eight minutes Sheila Tracey - that's Radio 2's "Tiger Tim" - takes over with the Truckers' Hour, and then at 2 o'clock You and the Night and the Music with Tim Gudgin through 'til five. But for now, on behalf of everyone here on BBC 2, this is Robin Whitting-

Yeah, a green sedan. No, the licence plates were covered with mud. They took tyres and gas. (Tell him they took all the cash.) They robbed the cash register too. I got word that the police had them bottled up... but they slipped through again. (I wonder if the baby is born yet.) Poor Joan. They're being blamed for every crime committed in the country


A hand in my mouth
A life spills into the flowers
We all look so perfect
As we all fall down
In an electric glare
The old man cracks with age
She found his last picture
In the ashes of the fire

An image of the queen
Echoes round the sweating bed
Sour yellow sounds inside my head
In books
And films
And in life
And in heaven
The sound of slaughter
As your body turns...
But it's too late
But it's too late

One more day like today and I'll kill you
A desire for flesh
And real blood
And I'll watch you drown in the shower
Pushing my life through your open eyes...

I must fight this sickness
Find a cure
I must fight this sickness11Embed
