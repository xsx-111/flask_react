One Love Stand LyricsIt's been a one man show that I been runnin'
On a two way street for love
And I see no end to the dead end (dead end)
'Til you come back home
I tried everything to keep remembering
One good woman, one good man
Two shots of happiness in one life span
It takes a one good woman
The only thing that hurts is the memory
Of having once lived by myself
And I've tried every kind of woman
I said woman, put my love out on the shelf
Took everything and left my ears ringing
One good woman, one good man
Two shots of happiness in one life span
It takes one good woman to make a one love stand
I feel at home in a foreign land
Know what's next when there's nothing planned
Talking about love (Talking about love)
You know it takes two
She took everything and left my ears ringing
One good woman - one
Two shots of happiness - two
It takes one good woman
To make a one love stand
One good womanEmbed
