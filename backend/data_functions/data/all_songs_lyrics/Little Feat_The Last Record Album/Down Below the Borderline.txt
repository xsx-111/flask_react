Down Below the Borderline LyricsA side shot from south of the border
Was a hot spot for all the fools from here to the corner
Looking for a square deal
A fair deal
She don't need a gun
She's an ultimatum
She can turn on a dime
She can turn on a dime
They're just fine darlin'
You can drop me anywhere there
Down below the borderline
Down below the borderline
Down below the borderline
Holding out your hand she be acting so demanding
She don't leave no stone for you to stand on
And if you think you might not be down here sometime
Down below the borderline
Onomatopoetry symmetry in motion
They heard about that girl clear across the ocean
To love her is a thrill, so tell me it's for real
Shell break away and leave you crying at some stop sign
Down below the borderline
Down below the borderline
Down below the borderline
Holding out your hand she be acting so demanding
She don't leave no stone for you to stand on
And if you think you might not be down here sometime
Down below the borderlineEmbed
