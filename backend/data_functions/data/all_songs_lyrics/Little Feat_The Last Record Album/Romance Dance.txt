Romance Dance LyricsMe and you, nothing to do
What am I gonna do with you
How's the chance
You and I go make romance
'Cause that's the kind of rockin' I need
Takes a pinch and a bite and squeeze
And I'm down on my knees
Well come on girl take a chance with me
A good ol' romance dance for me
Well I loved my way through the South one day
Runnin' scared all along the way
Wandering, looking to hide
Decided to head for the Mexico line
I had nothing going for me but my shoes
When I ran into a girl from Jaurez
Didn't care who or from where I came
Don't matter where in the world you goin'
Comes to lovin' it's all the same
All the same
And it's so insane
But I can't complain
What I need to be happy
Pretty girl in a lonely town
What I got to do to you
To get you to do the mess around
'Cause that's the kind of rockin' I need
Takes a pinch and a bite and squeeze
And I'm down on my knees
Well come on girl take a chance with me
A good ol' romance, no pants dance for meEmbed
