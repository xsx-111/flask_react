Long Distance Love LyricsOh, hello...give me missing persons, they said
"What is it that you need"?
I said oh, I need her so...They said you've
Got to stop your pleading
And no matter what I do
Even pray to heaven above
All you'll ever get from her is
Long distance love
I read the papers
And I got the blues
I was so sad to hear the news
Help wanted, but not enough
You know these times are gettin' rough
Cos no matter what I do
I even pray to heaven above
All I ever get from her is long distance love
(Whoo-oo-oo)
You know her toes were so pretty
And her laugh so sweet
I wonder does she know
Does she know she hurt me so
And no matter what I do
I even pray to heaven above
All I seem to get from her is
Long distance love
Long distance love
