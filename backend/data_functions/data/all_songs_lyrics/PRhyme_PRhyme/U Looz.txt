U Looz Lyrics

"Let's take 'em back"

Yeah
'94 shit

Uh, as the preacher takes the pulpit
Fix your coat, prepare for 40 below spit
Seven days of Heaven's ways and Hell's hangups
Chris and Ryan again and we wishing anybody who wasn't wishing us well bankrupt
A "L" and whatever else ain't up
As far as me I'm still caught up in all the gun shit
Still calling my bullets expendables 'cause it's hard to believe
I can fit all of them boys in one clip
I squeeze off and the streets start trembling
It's way too many niggas that seen shit, too many witnesses
Up and down with their visions of what a street nigga is
I call it the See-Saw Syndrome
Syndrome maybe you make a mistake, you lose
And this is for the real hip-hop niggas
Who will never ever ever ask me, am I here to replace Guru?
Word, that's what you feel up in this track?
Let a bitch-nigga try to shit on that

Oh what you trying to rap now?

Haha!
Yeah, yo Royce (what up, man)
We just lamping in the studio
You know, doing our thing (Okay)
We bugging out, you know (Right)
A little test run
So

So
I need you to speak with your hands
*scratches*
On the count of three
Everybody now
1

"2"
"3"
Go

"Talk to 'em"
"Who stepped up in this rap game, a sane actin' fool"
"Me and Preem, both names go together"
"Lot of niggas fronting like they're ill"

Word
I think it's time to move on to the next one!
