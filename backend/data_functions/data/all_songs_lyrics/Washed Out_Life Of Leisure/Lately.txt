Lately LyricsIt's all I want
It's all I've got
Don't forget to let it in
I feel the weight
I'm unsure
Don't race to let it in?
It's so
It' so alive
It's so
It's all starting
It's all I want
It's all I've got
Don't forget to let it in
I feel the weight
I'm unsure
Don't race to let it in
It's so
It's so alive
It's so
It's all starting1Embed
