New Theory Lyrics
Your choice was right
No chance to be there now
I swear I'm done
You'll want to lead your path

It's yours to find
It's all you've ever done
You're falling down
You're falling back to Earth

Do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da
Do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da

Your choice was right
No chance to be there now
I swear I'm done
You'll want to lead your path

It's yours to find
It's all you've ever done
You're falling down
You're falling back to Earth
Do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da
Do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da
Do-do-do-do
Da-da-da-da-da
Do-do-do-do
