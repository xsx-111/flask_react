Feel It All Around Lyrics
You feel it all around yourself
You know it's yours and no one else
You feel the thought of love again
It's all alright
In spite of all the things you did
We'll work it out

You feel it all around yourself
You know it's yours and no one else
You feel the thought of love again
It's all alright
In spite of all the things you did
We'll work it out30Embed
