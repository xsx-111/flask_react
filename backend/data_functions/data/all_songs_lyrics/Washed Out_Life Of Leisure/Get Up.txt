Get Up Lyrics
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away

You are
On fire
You are
Mine
You are
The one
So
You are
On fire
You are
Mine
You are
The one
So
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
You are
On fire
You are
Mine
You are
The one
So

You are now
You hide that
You're the road
So

Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get up
Gotta get away
Gotta get upEmbed
