Nothing Has to Be True LyricsEach and every breath we take
A step towards death
And the moon is pale
And we might have seen something
But we ain't seen nothing yet
And I may have dreamt it
Or it may have happened
When I stood right here
Waiting for a sign
For me to walk away
But I give in so easy
And I give up instantly
I chase what is gone
And my friends are gettin' tired
Of the shit that I pull
They say "Why do you love those
Who turn you into a fool?
Why do you let them get to you?
You should have been running
When you chose to stay"
Now I feel so far away
From the person I once was
I thought love was enough
You can tell yourself so many things
And nothing has to be true
Did you wake up last night
Drenched in your own sweat and tears?
No, it's not always easy
You get lost countin' the years
Since you last felt like you were home
Since you last felt like you were home
Since you last felt like you were home
Oh, I thought you were homeEmbed
