Fireworks Lyrics
I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night
As the lights flickered and they failed
I had it all figured out

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

I took a trip out to the frozen lake
And you felt so far away
But I could feel it washing over me
There's no escaping the harsh light of day

Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

Stood out on that beach in Chicago
Woke up next to you on Silver Lake Avenue
Wherever I went I always knew, always knew
'Til I didn't know
Why do I do this to myself every time?
I know the way it ends before it's even begun
I am the only one at the finish line

I could've sworn I saw fireworks
From your house last night11Embed
