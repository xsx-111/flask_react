My Wild Sweet Love Lyrics
Oh what comes after this?
Our momentary bliss
Oh I need you more than ever now
And here we are somehow
The world shines gold and new
I see it all in you
Oh I need you more than ever now
But night breaks through somehow

Will I know what this all means
When we're a hazy memory
With all the colors of a dream
My wild sweet love
My wild sweet love

Outside, invited in
But now I'm lost again
Oh I need you more than ever now
I'll make through somehow

Will I know what this all means?
When we're a hazy memory
With all the colors of a dream
My wild sweet love
My wild sweet love
I can't blame you for taking that path
No matter how I wish you'd come back
Too late now to reclaim the past
Yet I choose you

Will I know what this all means?
When we're a hazy memory
With all the colors of a dream
My wild sweet love
My wild sweet love
My wild sweet love
My wild sweet love1Embed
