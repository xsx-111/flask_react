Distant Star Lyrics
Well, a goodbye never seems finished
Just like these songs that I write
They hang aloft like stars in the night
But there's nothing there but the illusion of a light
And you, you could've been mine
Your mother, she's an actress
And we're all putting on a play
Here's some conviction, pretend it's all real
Try to ignore how sad it all feels
Yes, try not to break her heart if you can

Hold on
To whatever you can until it's gone
Carry on
For none of us will be here for too long

I'll try not to let the world and its darkness bring me down
Think of the love and the beauty I've found
The simple things that I've left behind
Oh the way he'd make me laugh

But I'll hold on
To whatever I can until it's gone
I'll carry on
For none of us will be here for too long
But you're are a distant star
But darling, you're so far away
You were never meant to stay
I reach out to see
If you're still here with me
Babe, we could've made it easy
Couldn't we?

Now I will never know you
You were just someone passing by
And it makes me sad to think about
All the stories and fates I'll be without
But I think I'm getting used to the silence nowEmbed
