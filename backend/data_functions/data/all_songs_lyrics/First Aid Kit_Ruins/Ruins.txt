Ruins Lyrics
Today, I climb the highest mountain I have ever climbed
And I turned to look at ruins I had left behind
And you, where were you so far removed from any truth
I lost you, didn't I?
First I think I lost myself

Children, then and forever locked in a memory
Holdin' that mirror searching for some kind of certainty
That you were just the same as everyone
But you were wrong
And it hurt you, didn't it?
All you couldn't be

Ruins
Ooh
Ruins
Ooh

I tried to hold on to some kind of dignity
Too long I waded through a vast and endless sea
Thinking I could find the secret there within
But I gave up, didn't I?
It seemed the only way
Ruins, all the things we built assured that they would last
Standing amongst ticket stubs
And written notes and photographs
And where are you in here
Somewhere I cannot go
I am sorry, I am
But I don't take it back

And in the night I hear your voice
Sometimes but it quickly passes
In dreams I saw what I had thought
Could be some kind of answer
You try and try and try
Until you cannot try no more
Captured in our own

Ruins
Ooh
Ruins
Ooh
