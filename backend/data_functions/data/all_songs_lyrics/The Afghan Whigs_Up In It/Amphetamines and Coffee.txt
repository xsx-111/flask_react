Amphetamines and Coffee Lyrics(Paul K.)
Hey man what's that you're thinking?
Maybe you can get away
There must be lots of pressure
And lots of bills to pay
Amphetamines & coffee
It almost makes you gag
Too many big decisions
No more time to play
Slip into something classic
Turn on the television
Ignoring all your children
Accepting their derision
Routine is acknowledged
With pinnacle precision
The statistician stares at
A family in division
Hey!
Amphetamines and coffee!
Amphetamines and coffee!
Amphetamines and coffee!
It almost makes you gagEmbed
