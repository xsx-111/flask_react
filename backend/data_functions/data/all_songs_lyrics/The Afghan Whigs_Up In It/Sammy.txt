Sammy LyricsStay with me
Why don't you try to be my friend?
Why don't you try a little harder?
Open your arms, open your legs
Won't you try, try to open your mind
Baby, don't you open it up too far
Or your brains will fall out on the sidewalk
That we've walked together
I know what you're thinking about
And I understand, try
Okay now, seems that it's happened again
Don't let it smack you down the hallway
Like your husband did last night
Don't you cry, cry, cry little girl
But baby, let the freezing teardrop fall
Open your eyes and lie awake
Close your eyes and lie awake
Baby, I know what you're thinking about
And I understand
If you try to be your man, if you try
You maybe lost your mind
And you cry, cry
As if your fate were mine
Won't you stay with me?
Will you try to be my friend?
Open your arms, open your legs
Open your mind, open your mind
Baby, I know what you're thinking about
I understand
If you try to be your man
If you try to be your manEmbed
