Son of the South LyricsJane had a bottle of pills
She kept beside her bed
She took a couple when the sky came falling down
"what do you see in me"
She used to say out loud
I see myself in a year
If i'm still around
& i don't feed the doll no no
Jane used to touch herself to make it go away
The loneliness that would follow her all around
& hold her pretty hand
& wanna be her friend
& hold the ceiling when the sky came falling down
I don't really need you
But since you're here
Tell me all about yourself my dear
Are YOU queer?
What happened to your wrists
Do YOU need some help
I can't be checking on YOU like this all the time
YOU want some help then bleed somebody else
YOU know YOU ain't gonna be mineEmbed
