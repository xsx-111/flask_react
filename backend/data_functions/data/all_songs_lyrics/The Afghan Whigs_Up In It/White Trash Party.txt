White Trash Party LyricsHoney, your junkie ass is frying
Honey, why don't you stop your whining
Your barn door opens and you don't say black
The sidewalk swallows don't you step up on the crack
Honey, I know what worth was waiting for
You got your white coat, mama
You got your heart of soul
I see some crucifixion
Behind those two eyeholes
Gonna take your white trash
Better take your white trash home
I see your hardon for the black girl
Keep your bloody hands off me, and now
Take me to your white trash party
Leave me swinging from a tree
Take out your white trash, take out your white trash, take our your
Take out your white trash, take out your white trash, take our yourEmbed
