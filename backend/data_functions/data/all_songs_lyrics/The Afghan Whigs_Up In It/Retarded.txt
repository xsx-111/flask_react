Retarded LyricsTelevision's gone
And I'm alone with Lucifer
What a drag
Muthafucker lied to you
Muthafucker took me head
You're never alone with your Jones
And all you can't forget
So roll on up the price is down
So come on, come on, come on, come on
Today the retard speaks to me
And now I have it all
What a drag
Muthafucker lied to you
It could never get that bad just ask
So go on, go on, go on, go on
I said, who you call retarded now?
Well, I said, who you call retarded now?
I said, who you call retarded now?
I see you standing proud
Come on down and swallow hard
And trust the boy
Who you call retarded now?
I said, who you call retarded now?
I said, who you call retarded now?
I see you standing proud
I see you
I see you standing proud
I see you
And I see youEmbed
