Now We Can Begin LyricsMother's very proud of YOU son
Come & sit upon her knee
I've got some new denial
I want to change my plea
I've seen through alcohol
Raise up the sheets again
Told YOU that YOU should fear me
I love to pretend
If i was to correct YOU every time YOU was wrong
I'd be talking all the time
& laughing at YOU twice as long
I've seen through alcohol
I've seen the auctioneer
Raise up the sheets again
Right now i need YOU near
Through him with him in
Now we can beginEmbed
