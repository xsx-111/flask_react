Call It Pretending LyricsWhat would you have me do?
Just turn and walk out on you
And leave you standing there pretending I don't care?
When you know as well as I, that would be nowhere
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
What would you have me say
After I walk away?
Would it be the end or just a second wind
For the good old song that we used to call pretending?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
It's not the first time that you had me turn away
And I know it won't be the last time
But you've got to say it, you've got to
Should we make a brand new start
Or are you gonna break my heart
And leave me standing there pretending I don't care?
When you know as well as I, that would be nowhere
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
It's not the first time that you had me turn away
And I know it won't be the last time
But you've got to say it, you've got to
Should we make a brand new start
Or are you gonna break my heart?
Will it be the end or just a second wind
For the good old song that we used to call pretending?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?
Shouldn't I be with you?Embed
