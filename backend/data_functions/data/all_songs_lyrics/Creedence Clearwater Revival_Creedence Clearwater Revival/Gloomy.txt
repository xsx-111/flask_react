Gloomy Lyrics
Some people laugh in the dark
Some people cry alone
Some people talk without saying a thing
And everything turns out gloomy
Some people count your money
Someone is counting your days
And somebody got to keep track of your mind
When everything turns out gloomy
Brothers'll make you look sideways
Fathers'll make you look back
And when you're done talking, you still got to shoot
Cause everything turns out gloomyEmbed
