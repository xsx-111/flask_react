Wake Me Lyrics
Right from the start I knew
You'd set a fire in me
And I'd rather be sad with you
Than anywhere away from you

And hey
I can't believe I captured your heart
Oh whoa oh
I can't believe I captured your heart

Stake my life on it
If somebody's gonna quit
Then I'd rather be sad with you
Than with any other girls but you

And hey
I can't believe I captured your heart
Oh whoa oh
I can't believe I captured your heart

If you're lonely lonely lonely wake me
If you're lonely lonely lonely wake me
If you're lonely lonely lonely wake me
If you're lonely lonely lonely wake me
If you're lonely (if you're lonely) lonely lonely (ah! if you're lonely) wake me
If you're lonely lonely lonely (ah! life is so sad) wake me
If you're lonely lonely lonely wake me (wake me hey)
I can't believe I captured your heart
Right from the start I knew
You'd set a fire in me
And I'd rather be sad with you
Than anywhere away from you

And hey
I can't believe I captured your heart
Oh whoa oh
I can't believe I captured your heart13Embed
