Shadow Lyrics
There are some girls
Some girls they really just want to hurt you
And there's some boys
Some boys who'll laugh when they break your heart
But how love dies is a place that I'm not going
And we could try, cause

If you're feeling small
I will love your shadow
And if you're feeling small
I'll love your shadow

There are those girls
Those girls that are waiting by the phone on the weekend
Oh yeah, like those boys, those boys that are home with the broken hearts
But the heart wants fear
So we're looking for a villain
I'll be there

If you're feeling small
I will love your shadow
And if you're feeling small
I'll love your shadow
When the lights go down
I will stand right beside you
If you're feeling small
I´ll love your shadow
I´ll love your shadow!
And I know that they have hurt you
And I know the love you gave feels cheap and used
And I know it's getting harder
And I know the lights have all gone dark on you
Still I will love your shadow
When the love you gave feels cheap and used
Yes I will love your shadow
When the lights have all gone dark on you
How love dies is a place that I'm not going
And we could try...

If you're feeling small
I will love your shadow
And if you're feeling small
I'll love your shadow
When the lights go down
I will stand right beside you
If you're feeling small
I´ll love your shadow
I´ll love your shadow!12Embed
