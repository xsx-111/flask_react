Take Me Away LyricsI'll let you take it, I'll let you take it, I'll let you
I know you're sorry
I'll let you take it, I'll let you take it, I'll let you
I'll let you take it
(Now you're hungry and you want to take me away, take me away)
I know you're, I, I know you're sorry
(You pushed me farther than I've been)
(Falling for me, me)

I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry
I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry
I've broke my silence in an angry yell
(I know you, you)
Someone who'll take you long way home
And now you're hungry and you want to
Take me away, take me away
I know you're sorry
I felt like a fool
I understand that you're
I'll be in the shadows above
That you had ever seen me coming

I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry
I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry, I know you're sorry
I'll be in the shadows above
(I, I I know you're sorry)
Better off before you, alone
I'm waiting to find out
Love will wake us, love won't break us
Love will take you
And if I can find, find a way out of myself again8Embed
