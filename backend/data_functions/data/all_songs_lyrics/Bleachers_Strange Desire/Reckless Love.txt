Reckless Love Lyrics
I could use a bad disguise
To guard me in the darkest nights
I keep finding my way to the harshest words
I've got a strange, strange vision

Of a reckless love
Standing in a world of my own
They call it reckless love

So give me a chance to remember
What I've given up to defend you
I would burn my dreams away
Just to stand in the thankless shadows

Of your reckless love
Standing in a world of my own
They call it reckless love

(Standing on the other side of your reckless love)
Thinking on the other side of your reckless love
Get out
Stand back
If you don't let go you're gonna break me
And you get out
Stand back
If you don't let go you're gonna break me
And you get out
Stand back
If you don't let go you're gonna break me
And you get out
Stand back
If you don't let go you're gonna break me

So give me a chance to remember
What I've given up to defend you
I have burned my dreams away

To stand in the broken shadows
Of your reckless love
Your thankless love
Your restless love
A thankless love
Your reckless love
It's a thankless love
Your reckless love
Your reckless love4Embed
