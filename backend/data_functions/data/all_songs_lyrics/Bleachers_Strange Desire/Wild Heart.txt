Wild Heart Lyrics
I want to be grateful
I really wanna be grateful...

They closed the parkway late last night
And as I sat with the echoes of the
Lies that I told
I felt young, never changed
By crooked hearts
So put the shotgun back in the glove
Come on and wait another year for the
Dream far away
To come home, to be brave

Well, everything has changed
And now it's only you that matters
I will find any way to your wild heart

They boarded up the windows
And the doors to my house
No one will ever read the letters
Or the lies that I told
From the years I was changed
By crooked hearts
Why did they have to go and do us like that?
Why did they have to go and run from the
Dream far away?
Were we there? Was I brave?
To think everything must die
For anyone to matter
Got to find any way
To your wild heart
Oh, I will find any way to your wild heart
Oh, I will find any way to your wild heart

Well, everything has changed
And now I can't tell what matters
I will find any way to your wild heart
Your wild heart
Your wild heart
Your wild heart
Your wild heart
Your wild heart
Your wild heart
Your wild heart
(Your wild heart)10Embed
