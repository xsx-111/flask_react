Who I Want You to Love Lyrics
I'm tired, of replacing my dreams
Always twisting, always screams
To follow down the strangest roads
In back seats, indoors

And love what you want me to love
Oh, I will bleed when you want me to bleed
But I don't want to know too much of anything
Because it all hurts me

Come on, don't push me down that road
Always twisting, always sold
I will follow, all made up how you'd like
In back seats, indoors

And love when you want me to love
Oh, I will bleed when you want me to bleed
I don't want to know too much of anything
Because it all hurts me
Oh, it all hurts me

(And I really wanna be grateful for the experience that I've had)
(And I really wanna be grateful for the experience that I've had)
(And I really wanna be grateful for the experience that I've had)
(And I really wanna be grateful for the experience that I've had)
(Being trapped in like a total weird bubble world)
(Because there's a giant ocean frozen underneath it's surface)
(And the cracks on it's surface made it clear that there was warm water bubbling up from within)
(And I really wanna be grateful for the experience that I've had)3Embed
