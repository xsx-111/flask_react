My Possession LyricsHanging and banging and cussing and bitching
And scratching and twitching at my demand
Grabbing and poking and bruising and choking
I'm sprinkled I'm tinkled I'm losing my man
I found a new way
I found a better way
I found the only way
To cure frustration
I don't care what you say
About my moral ways
Get on your knees and pray
Cos you're slaves anyway
Coming and going and moving and groaning
And hitting that kitten and making him yowl
Wailing and flailing and trudging and flogging
And punching my doggie and making him howl
I found a new way
I found a better way
I found the only way
To cure frustration
I don't care what you say
About my moral ways
Get on your knees and pray
Cos you're slaves anyway
My possession, my possession, my possession, mine, all mine
Kicking that butt now licking that butt
Now kneel on that gut now the red light's on
Pushing and shoving that bread in the oven
I'm paying them back for what they've done
I found a new way
I found a better way
I found the only way
To cure frustration
I don't care what you say
About my moral ways
Get on your knees and pray
Cos you're slaves anyway
My possession, my possession, my possession, mine, all mineEmbed
