Where You At Now? / Crash and Burn / Twitch (Version II) LyricsWhere You At Now
I seen God!
Tell us to talk
Tell us to smile
Tell us a story
Tell us a lie
Tell us to talk
Tell us to smile
Tell us a story
I seen God! (x 2)
Oh!
I seen God! (x 4)
Come on, get outta here! (x 3)
I seen God!
Come on, get outta here (x 4)
Where you at now?
Where you at now? (x 2)
Come on, get outta here
Where you at now?
Come on, get outta here
Where you at now?
Come on, get outta here
I seen God!
(x 4)
Come on, get outta here
Where you at now?
(x 3)
Come on, get outta here (x 2)
