Just Like You Lyrics
What's the matter, Eddie?
Does it frighten you?
(Frighten me?
No Frank, I think startled is a better word)

Standing on corners and begging for quarters for what?
(For you!) (and you)
Busting my head 'cause that's what you said for all of us
(Fuck you!)

(Just like you)

People are happy when they're not so trapped by someone
(Just like you!) (and you)
Many more years of nothing but fear of anything
(You do!)

1980s was run by a person who's crazy
(Like you!) (and you)
The 1990s will be unkindly, exactly
(Like you!) (and you)
(Just like you!) (and you)
(You!)

When one dictator is the same as the leader
(Just like you!) (and you)
We work, we survive
(Just like you!) (and you, and you, and you)
We work, we twitch
(You!) (and you)
(And you, and you, and you)

Just like youEmbed
