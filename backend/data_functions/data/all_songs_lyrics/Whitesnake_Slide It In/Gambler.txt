Gambler LyricsI've been a gypsy for a thousand years
A victim of circumstance
I go wherever my destiny calls
I'm caught in a game of chance
I stand on the outside, looking at love
I wanna get inside
I stand on the outside, looking at love
Just trying to get inside
No fame or fortune, no luck of the draw
When I dance with the queen of hearts
A jack of all trades but a loser in love
It's tearing my soul apart
Still I stand on the outside, looking at love
I wanna get inside
(I'm on the outside, looking in)
I stand on the outside, looking at love
Just trying to get inside
(I'm on the outside, looking in)
The jack of diamonds an' the ace of spades
Try to use me, and to abuse me
It seems the dealer, won't give me a chance
I'm victim of circumstance
So I stand on the outside, looking at love
I wanna get inside
(I'm on the outside, looking in)
So I stand on the outside, looking at love
Just trying to get inside
(I'm on the outside, looking in)
So I stand on the outside, looking at love
I wanna get inside
(I'm on the outside, looking in)
So I stand on the outside, looking at love
Just trying to get inside
(I'm on the outside, looking in)1Embed
