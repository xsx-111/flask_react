Guilty of Love LyricsI believe my love for you
Is a love that will last forever
And I'm here to testify
I'm a prisoner of your heart
Baby, don't you believe when I tell you I love you
That I really mean it
Don't you walk away
Don't turn your back on me
I'm guilty of love
It's a crime of passion
Guilty of love
And there's no doubt about it, no doubt about it
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
In the first degree
Guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
In the first degree
I can never forget all the times
When I took what you gave me for granted
So I stand accused
And I plead guilty to the crime
You can lock me away if you want
Just as long as your arms are around me
And I won't mind
If you just throw away the key
I'm guilty of love
It's a crime of passion
Guilty of love
And there's no doubt about it, no doubt about it
Guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
In the first degree
Guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
In the first degree
Guilty of love
Guilty of love
It's a crime of passion
Guilty of love
And there's no doubt about it, no doubt about it
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
In the first degree
Guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
Guilty of love
I'm guilty of love
I'm guilty
In the first degree
