Homeland LyricsRemember that summer
Down by the shoreline
I still can hear those old
Forgotten songs
And we made promises
To last forever
I just can't believe those
Days are gone
There used to be a place
That we could call our own
We used to think tomorrow
Was a long, long time
But sadness filled my heart
When I knew the moment had come
When I had to leave those days
Behind
I felt so free
Where I wanted to be
The days went so fast
How I wish they could last
So far from my homeland
I'm lost in time
My soul's still searchin'
For that peace of mind
Those sacred landscapes
Come miles around
And my heart's still beatin'
For those country grounds
Remember when our hearts
Were filled with laughter
It echoes in my trail
Of fallen tears
But no matter where I am today
Or what the future might bring
I will remember those
Long gone years
I can't let go
I wanna know
Does it have to end
For the best of friends
So far from my homeland
I'm lost in time
And my soul's still searchin'
For that peace of mind
Those sacred landscapes
Come miles around
And my heart's still beatin'
For those country grounds
Lord I know
That those days are gone
Long, long gone
I felt so free
Where I wanted to be
Days went so fast
How I wish they could lastEmbed
