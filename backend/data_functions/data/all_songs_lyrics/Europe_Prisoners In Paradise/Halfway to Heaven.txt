Halfway to Heaven LyricsAnother day has come can't face it on my own
I almost let you walk away and I guess I should have known
I'll give it to you straight 'cause some things just can't wait
I' ve got to make it up to you and I'll pray it's not too late
'cause when you look at me with those sad blue eyes
It stops me cold and I realize you're all I need tonight
We're halfway to heaven lyin' beside you on a night so still
We're halway to heaven I ask you if you'll stay and baby say you will
So what's a man to do to get it through to you
Another lost and lonely night would break this heart in two
So let's take a chance and it'll be allright
Just put your trust in me toniht girl we're almost there
We're halfway to heaven there's something magic 'bout the way you kiss
We're halfway to heaven runnin' with you baby on a a night like this
We're halfway to heaven I never dreamed that I could get this high
We're halfway to heaven girl I couldn't leave you even if I tried
You got me captured in a crazy spin
You got me so I just can't tell the shape I'm in
We're halfway to heaven there's something magic 'bout the way you kiss
We're halfway to heaven runnin' with you baby on a a night like this
We're halfway to heaven I never dreamed that I could get this high
We're halfway to heaven girl I couldn't leave you even if I triedEmbed
