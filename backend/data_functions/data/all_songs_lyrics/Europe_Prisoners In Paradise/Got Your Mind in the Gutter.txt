Got Your Mind in the Gutter LyricsWhat's a man to do when he's bein' acused
I hear you talkin' it's real bad news
Nothin' happened with that girl last night
So baby won't you tell me why
You got your mind in the gutter
You got your mind in the gutter
You're jumpin' to conclusions and it's plain to see
You got your mind in the gutter
Don't blame me
You say I'm foolin' 'round playin' the field
Baby let me tell you it's not big deal
No I ain't gettin' a little on the side
But I feel like a prisoner with both hands tied
You say you found a number on a matchbook in my coat
And lipstick smeared on my shirt
I hate to disappoint you and it scares me to death
That if your shovel ain't full you just keep diggin' up some dirt
You've pushed me into a corner
You've got my back to the wall
I stand accused of bein' some kind of liar
Hey I wouldn't those you down if you were on fire
You got your mind in the gutter
You got your mind in the gutter
Baby I keep those women Far away from my skin
But since your mind's in the gutter man I just can't win
I too her aside to give her my point of view
What you tryin' to pull babe it just ain't true
There should be a warnin' up above your cage
Sayin' don't feed the lion she's in a state of rage
How can I prove That I've done nothin' wrong
You know in your heart that you're all that I want
You're all fired up just a little too tight
Now babe what can I tell you you just ain't right
Ain't got a bad reputation
So why you tearin' it down
Don't know what happened but your mind's gone south
No I can't believe what comes out of your mouth
You got your mind in the gutter
You got your mind in the gutter
I know what you're sayin' but it just ain't true
You've got your mind in the gutter baby shame on you
You say I'm foolin' 'round playin' the field
Baby let me tell you it's not big deal
No I ain't gettin' a little on the side
Baby what can I tell you you just ain't rightEmbed
