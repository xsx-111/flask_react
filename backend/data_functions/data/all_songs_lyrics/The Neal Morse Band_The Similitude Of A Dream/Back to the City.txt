Back to the City Lyrics
I'm slipping in the slime
I'm running out of time
Abandoned in this hell
You said all would be well
But you lied!
Yeah, you lied
So, I'm going back
I'm going back
Yeah

(I'm going back to the city)
Knockin' on the door
(Back to the city)
To where I was before
(Back to the city)
Where I am not alone
I'm going home


Why would you leave me here?
As soon as troubles rise
Don't give a place to fear
He'll wipe every tear from your eyes
I've got my ball and Jack
And now I'm goin' back
If now it's dark and cold
What more awaits you down this road?

(I'm going back to the city)
I can hardly wait
(Back to the city)
Passing through the gate
(I'm going back to the city)
The lights, the stars, the show
I'm coming home
(I'm going back to the city)
Knocking on the door
(Back to the city)
To where I was before
(I'm going back to the city)
Light up the Superdome
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

The man sank deep in that miry ground
With the pack on his back still weighing him down
While his friend left them there
Without even saying goodbye
He reached to the side and found hope was there
As a hand helped him out of the pit of despair
He shook himself off and walked in the way of the skyâ€¦Embed
