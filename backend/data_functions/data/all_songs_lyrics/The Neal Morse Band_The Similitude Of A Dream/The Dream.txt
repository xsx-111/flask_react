The Dream LyricsA man falls asleep in a faraway place
And dreams of a land outside time and space
That he once read about
Or maybe he never heard
He saw in his dream through a child's eyes
A slave or a king he could not decide
And the man called him forth
Without ever saying a word
"Love is awaiting you," He cried
"Beg plead or borrow
But leave here tomorrow
Seek what's beyond the other side
It's life that awaits you
No one will make you
It's yours to decide..."Embed
