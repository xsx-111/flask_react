Breath of Angels Lyrics
There through the trees
Something is in the clearing
Is this the way?
A glimpse of the gate
As music beyond all hearing
Begins to play

Is that my father smiling?
What are those steps he's climbing?
He waves me forward
As if to say it's OK

With the breath of angels
Charging up the atmosphere
And all around me
Is the love that casts out all fear
And the breath of angels
Dries away every tear

There up ahead
A place beyond understanding
Somewhere I've known
And I, I belong
Like a child who's been abandoned
Returning home
This burden I've had upon me
Has sucked all the life out from me
And I thought many times I'd reached the end
Yes, I did

But with the breath of angels
Charging up the atmosphere
And all around me
Is the love that casts out all fear
Oh, God, my father
In Your mercy You brought me here
Where the breath of angels
Dries away every tear

The river's overrun
And it's flowing from the sky
We live to fall in love
In a city made of light


With the breath of angels
Charging up the atmosphere
And all around me
Is the love that casts out all fear
In the host of heaven
Sing along so the world can hear
As the breath of angels
Dries away every tear â€“ oh, oh
As the breath of angels
Dries away every tearEmbed
