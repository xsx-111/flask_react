Sloth More Lyrics
Sloth...
And sloth...

I have no need
No indeed
I have no need for speed
Take a rest
I suggest
You are already blessed

Why do you work so hard?
It's necessary to be sedentary
Be in the place you are
Life's not habitual when you're spiritual like me

It is no sin
Nothing makes me grin
More than sleeping in
I yawn and drool
But I know it's cool
My debts been paid in full
Why do you work so hard?
It's necessary to be sedentary
Be in the place you are
Life's not habitual when you're spiritual like me

And it's been a long day
And it's easy to stumble
But we're headed somewhere
And I don't always know
I can't sleep or slumber
Or I could get lost here
And it's been a long day now
But it's time to move on â€“ it's time to move on
It's time to move on
