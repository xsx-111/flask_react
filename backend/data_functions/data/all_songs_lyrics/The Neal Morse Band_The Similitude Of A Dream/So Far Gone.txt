So Far Gone Lyrics
I walked into the change
But now it feels so wrong
There's mountains in my way
And I just can't go on

How did I get so far gone
To who I am today?
How did I get so far gone?

I veered off to the left
I took the man's advice
With just one little step
But in the course of time

How did I get so far gone
To who I am today?
Now my life seems painted on
And I'm so far gone
Maybe too far gone
To ever find the way â€“ hey, yeah, yeah. Woo!

I used to seize the day
Living from the heart
But now I'm torn apart
But I have lost my way
And now it's getting dark

How did I get so far gone
To who I am today?
Now my life seems painted on
And I'm so far gone
Maybe too far gone
Yes I'm too far gone
Maybe too far gone
To ever find the way


You can turn
You're not too far
The King loves you
With all his heart
And every lie can be made true
For I have seen the broken sky turn blue
The broken sky turn blue
You think He would have me still
After I left His will
And did some things I knew were wrong
(You choose your destiny)
Now I begin to see
The man I would like to be
Deep as a river song
(It now makes sense to me)
Go to the wicket gate
Go and don't hesitate
His will is the way
(It now makes sense to me)
Don't be deceived again
By the sleight hand of men
With feet made of clay
(It now makes sense to me)
Shine to the mountain peak
Shine to the place you seek
That won't fade awayEmbed
