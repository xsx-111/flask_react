Draw the Line Lyrics
We've come to bring you back around
You're lost but you can still be found
What makes you think that you just couldn't stay
That you know the way anyway?
Come back to who you are
Let's hit the road
What makes you better than us all?
You think you know but you are wrong
Come back and make yourself some better pay
What you say, say anyway?
This isn't who you are
Let's smoke a bowl

I can't go with you
I have made up my mind
Something better awaits
Worth all you'll leave behind
Draw the line

You're the one who's deaf and dumb and blind
For whack jobs like you I got no time
You're crazier than what the people say
I'll be on my way, way anyway
We'll see you later days
C'mon
Let's hit the road
Oh

I won't go with you
Can't you see that you're blind?
You should come with me
Don't be fooled, you're not fine
Draw the line


I think I see your way
I'd really like to know
Something so beautiful
If only for one day
Something so beautiful


I think I see your way
I'd really like to know
I'd really like to know
If only for one day
Something so beautiful
Something so beautiful
I know now what it's worth
What it's worth
I'll go with you to the ends of the earthEmbed
