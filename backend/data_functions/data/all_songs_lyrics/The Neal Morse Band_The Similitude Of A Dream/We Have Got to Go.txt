We Have Got to Go LyricsWe have got to go
Can't you see that there's destruction here?
Let's leave tonight, take a ride, hit the road
I promise it will be better, dear
If you stay you'll be lost

And that would surely break my heart
But I can see that you're gone
It's all gone away
Please babe, let's go together
Where eternity flows forever
