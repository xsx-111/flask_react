Slave to Your Mind Lyrics
I thought that I was done
That I had now arrived
But he showed me so much more
Amazing to my sight
A room consumed with dust
A cloud that filled the air
The filth of sin and shame
Of corruption and despair
Then I saw myself
Even after all I'd heard
Breathing in the dust
Choking out the word
Then a woman came with water
And I drank it deep and long
We spoke in secret words
We sang a sacred song

I saw in my dream
The interpreter and the man
Behind a wall of flame
He took him by the hand
He took him by the hand
The fire was a gift
But there was one about
Wet blankets in his fists
He tried to put it out
He tried to put it out

And he said
You have not been changed
Feel your guilt and shame
You've been left behind
You're a slave to your mind

I saw someone else
On the other side
Pure oil flowed from him
'Til fire filled the sky
Ahh

You have not been changed
Feel your guilt and shame
You've been reassigned
You're a slave to your mind

You have not been changed
Feel your guilt and shame
You've been left behind
You're a slave to your mind
