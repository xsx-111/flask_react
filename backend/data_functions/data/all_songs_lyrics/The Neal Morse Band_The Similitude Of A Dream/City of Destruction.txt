City of Destruction Lyrics
Sleep depraved. Dawn patrol
My life blood's running circles 'round my soul
All the people in normal land
Rest while I get a midnight tan
But I...
I just hope I can sleep tonight
How can I shake this stain?
My family thinks that I'm insane like I
Got a vice on my head
My brain goes on like the walking dead

But I...
From within and without
It just keeps on screaming

"You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Don't wait another day
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
There is no other way"

"Why are you grieving so?
Everyone must die someday you know
I can see your trembling hand
You better flea this sun scorched land
Cause I...
I have been to the gate
You'd better not wait"

"You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Don't wait another day
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
There is no other way"
"You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Don't wait another day
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
There is no other way"
"You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Where anger breeds distain
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Where pleasure comes with pain"


"You gotta, you gotta
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Where anger breeds distain
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
Where pleasure comes with pain"
"This is your chance to escape from the corruption
Don't wait another day
You gotta get out of the City of Destruction
There is no other way"

I've got rocks in my head
Think I'd rather be dead
I don't know what it's really about
Got this rack on my back
Satan's talkin' such smack
All I know is I've got to get out
Yeah

I've gotta go talk to my wife...
She'll help me make sense of this...
She'll help me make sense of thisEmbed
