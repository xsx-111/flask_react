The Man in the Iron Cage Lyrics
I'm the man in the iron cage of fear
I've been locked in this place for 1000 years

I used to believe like you
I used to be someone who
Showed to others the way but now
I'm lost

No one ever made me what I am
Burned my bridges, sold my house
My car, my friends

I used to believe like you
I used to be someone who
Showed to others the way but now
I'm lost
I took every guardrail down
I never thought I'd be found out
But my secret sin surely had a cost

Surely you can find your way back home
Surely you can turn to God alone
You are never too far gone
His mercy's new each day
You can still sing freedom's song
You're not so far gone
You're never too far gone
To ever turn again

I'm the man in the iron cage of death
Started with a little slip, now it's such a mess

I used to believe like you
I used to have dreams like you do
But now I'm a prisoner of my rage
When you think you're sure to stand
When you're runnin' the race I ran
Remember the man in the iron cageEmbed
