Freedom Song Lyrics
Then in my dream was a highway
With tall blazing trees all around
The journey man bent as the pack on
His back weighed him down
He walked 'til he came to a clearing
A place he'd seen somewhere before
He walked up the hill
Heard a voice like an opening door

Leave all your burdens here
Cry away every tear
I'll take your pain and all your sorrow
Son you've been gone too long
This is your freedom song
Sing and the grace of God will follow now

I watched as the man fell on down to his knees
As the pack on his back hit the floor
It rolled down the hill and would never be seen anymore!

Leave all your burdens here
Cry away every tear
I'll take your pain and all your sorrow
Son you've been gone too long
This is your freedom song
Sing and the grace of God will follow

Leave all your burdens here
Cry away every tear
I'll take your pain and all your sorrow
Son you've been gone too long
This is your freedom song
Sing and the grace of God will follow nowEmbed
