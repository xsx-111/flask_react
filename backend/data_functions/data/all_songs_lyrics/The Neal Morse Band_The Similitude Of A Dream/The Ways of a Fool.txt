The Ways of a Fool Lyrics
Walking straight ahead wondering in the way I wander
My feet are feeling fine
What's that up ahead?
Someone coming up the way

He is a worldly man!
I tell him my plan and he says
"What are you doing?
You're simple as pudding
It's not worth pursuing
I know the way out!"

All the ways of a fool
They are right in his own eyes
Go on back, keep your cool
Don't you miss the city lights?
And those worldly delights
(Trust me) I know I'm right

Reason is the rule
Logic is a mighty fortress
And life is nothing more
Perception is the truth
Why not make it what you want?
And I'm a successful man!
My offer is easy
Invent your reality, made up morality
Legal legality second to none

All the ways of a fool
They are right in his own eyes
Go on back, keep your cool
Don't you miss the city lights?
And those worldly delights
(Trust me) I know I'm right


All the ways of a fool
They are right in his own eyes
Go on back, keep your cool
Don't you miss the city lights?
And those worldly delights
Trust me I know I'm right


I think I'll go the way
Walking with the worldly wise man
I'll just change it up a bit
And go the more logical way

'Cause it seems good to me
To live a life that's free from care
And my new reality
I will speak into the air
And life is awaiting me
I'll learn what they're teaching me
And surely my destiny will follow
Forget all about that dream
I'll find a place in between
And just take a turn-about tomorrow
