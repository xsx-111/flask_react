Broken Sky/Long Day (Reprise) Lyrics
I have been tormented
And I have been deceived
I have known depression
A thousand nights I couldn't sleep
Facing all my enemies
I was paralyzed with fear
But following a question
And I'm not really clear
But it led me here…

Where I have seen and I have known
By setting down the road called home
The journey is to be with you
For I have seen the broken sky turn blue
The broken sky turn blue

Why go through the trouble?
Why not just disappear?
Why all of these questions?
Why doesn't God just make it clear?
The rain becomes a river
The stream becomes a lake
Keep following the whisper
No matter what it takes
Until you reach the gate
Where I have seen and I have known
By setting down the road called home
The journey is to be with you
Your love has made the broken sky turn blue
The broken sky is blue

There's a song in the night
There's a city of light
There's a universe yet to be known
There's an opening door
There's so very much more
As together we seek to come home – home, home


Yeah, I have seen and I have known
By setting down the road called home
At journey's end, I end with you
For I have seen the broken sky turn blue – oh oh
Now I belong to you
I belong to you

And it's been a long day now
Down this road I have traveled
And it's been a dark night
And I've been searching so long
Through the rain and the fire
I have finally found you
And it's been a long day now
But this son's coming home
This son's coming home
This son's coming home – c'mon


To be the completed man
To love and to understand
To change everything I can
It now makes sense to me
To be who I could not be
To love you so easily
With your life inside of me
Let the great adventure now beginEmbed
