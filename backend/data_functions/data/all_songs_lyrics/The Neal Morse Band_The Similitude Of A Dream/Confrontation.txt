Confrontation Lyrics
He told me all I'd done
That I desired to be praised
That I was filled with selfish pride
And death would be my wage
I told him he was right
I did deserve the grave
But the Prince, the One I serve
He's strong enough to save

How can you think you're loved after the things you've done?
You are a poor excuse and not a favored son

You are surely too far gone
Just give it up today
I am the great powerful one
Give it up, my son
If you take me on
Even God can't save you now


You gotta, you gotta
You gotta go back to the City of Destruction
This clearly is your fate
You gotta go back to the City of Destruction
Your destiny awaits
You gotta go back to the City of Destruction
Don't wait another day
You gotta go back to the City of Destruction
There is no other way
I will spill you
I will kill you
This is where your search has come to
Out of my way
You are my prey
Come at me and you will surely die
Die!
You are empty
You don't tempt me
You are out but I've got plenty
You are bleeding
Not succeeding
I am ever reaching for the sky
Die!Embed
