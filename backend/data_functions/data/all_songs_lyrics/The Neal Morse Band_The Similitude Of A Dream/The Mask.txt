The Mask Lyrics

I have come a long way
I've met many a friend
Who gave to me their hearts
Their bread, and their wine
Into the lower lands
Down to the depths of self
I have come
To discover what's lying behind
The mask
My mask

It might tear me apart
If I see what's inside my heart, my heart

The ground is so dank
The air is sour in the valley of humiliation
I can see him now
Coming for me there will be no negotiation
It's here
He's here
Man, he's ugly as sin
Slimy scales are his precious pride

Should I go back in retreat
Or do I confront the beast
If I turn and run he'll get my gun
Better stand and face ApollyonEmbed
