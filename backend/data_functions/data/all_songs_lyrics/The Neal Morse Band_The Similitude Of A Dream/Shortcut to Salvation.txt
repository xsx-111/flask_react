Shortcut to Salvation Lyrics
Then in my dream
I saw two men appear
They didn't take the long way
Instead they jumped the wall
They stood in the way
The journey man was on
Accused him and confused him
About the Glory Road
They said:

You can take it easy
This life is not so hard
Why don't you come join us in our merry band?
There's a shortcut to salvation
Cruise down the boulevard
Where decadence and destiny go hand-in-hand

Then I was there
I saw him up the road
Whistlin' down the long way
He knew he had to go
And they said:
You can take it easy
This life is not so hard
Why don't you come join us in our merry band?
There's a shortcut to salvation
Cruise down the boulevard
Where decadence and destiny go hand-in-hand


You should take it easy
Life is not so hard
Why don't you come join us in our merry band?
There's a shortcut to salvation
Cruise down the boulevard
Where decadence and destiny go hand-in-hand

But I have seen the place called home
And now my life is not my own
For I was bought with the highest price
What can I do but give my life?
For I have seen the place called home
And now my life is not my own
I hear the call to Kingdom Ground
And all I am, I lay it down for You
I lay it down for YouEmbed
