Makes No Sense Lyrics
The quick, the awakening dead
Come to life as I'm led to the
Highway with few passersby
As I move straight ahead
With the city behind
A few friends tell me why I should stay
But what they say
Makes no sense to me
Makes zero sense
It makes no sense to me
Yeah, oh yeah

(It makes no sense to me)
To live like the normal man
To run like an "also ran"
To sink down the waterhole
(It makes no sense to me)
To live in the common place
A cog in the paper chase
A heart set on cruise control
Stop!
Take a look right here
Everyone's so clear
And they think they know where you should go
But in the depth there's a door
And there is a "No" at your core
While they tell you it's better their way
But what they say
Makes no sense to me

To live like the normal man
To run like an "also ran"
To sink down the waterhole
(It makes no sense to me)
To groan in the daily grind
Your love always left behind
Gain a life but lose your soul
(It makes no sense to me)
To live life painted on
To feel like I should've gone
But fear made me stay
(It makes no sense to me)
To wait when you have to go
Pretend that you didn't know
You're one step away
(It makes no sense to me)
To walk when you could have run
To live like a setting sun
Awaiting the day
(It makes no sense to me)
The road leading left or right
Toward day or toward the night
You're one step away
