For Us Lyrics
It feels like its perfect
I know, I know
It'll be like the first time 
So take it slow

It was as if the song was written for us
When we sang along to the chorus

It feels like its perfect
I know, I know
It'll be like the first time 
So take it slow

It was as if the song was written for us
When we sang along to the chorus

For us
For usEmbed
