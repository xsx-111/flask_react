Echoes Lyrics
Underneath the moonlight, watch it invade me
No need to feel worried, I’m all at ease
Its echoed in my voice
Oh slow, touchdown, you’re grounded, oh, oh
Misguided in the colors rainbow phase, oh sunlight haze


Underneath the moonlight, watch it invade me
I’m overpowered by relentless beauty, beauty
Its echoed in my voice
Oh slow, touchdown, you’re grounded, oh, oh
Misguided in the colors rainbow phase, oh sunlight hey
