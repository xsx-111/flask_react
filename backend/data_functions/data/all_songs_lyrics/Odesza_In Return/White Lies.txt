White Lies Lyrics
Let’s go out on the street
Let’s go out on the street
You take me away
Faces, faces they fade
Love, love, love stays
Here, here I’ll take you

Cross my heart and hope to die
If you ever catch me in a white lie
I lay me down in the tall grass
Tangled in the weeds in my messy bed

If you come and you come
Come and come and, if you, if you

Let’s go out on the street
Bring me under the soil in the roots I toil
Trying, crying, trying to show
Break through watch as I grow

Cross my heart and hope to die
If you ever catch me in a white lie
I lay me down in the tall grass
Tangled in the weeds in my messy bed13Embed
