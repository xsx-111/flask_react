Big Eyed Beans From Venus Lyrics
Distant cousins, there's a limited supply
And we're down to the dozens and this is why
Big eyed beans from Venus, oh my, oh my

Boys and girls, earth people around the circle
Mixtures of man alike
Big eyed beans from Venus
Don't let anything get in between us
Beam in on me, baby
And we'll beam together
I know we always been together
But there's more

Mister Zoot Horn Rollo
Hit that long lunar note and let it float

Men, let your wallets flop out and women, open your purses
'Cause a man or a woman without a big eyed bean from Venus
Is suffering with the worstest of curses
Yeah, you're suffering with the worstest of curses

Put 'em out in the sun and when the night come
You don't have to go out and get 'em
They'll glow with you, they'll go with you
They'll show with you, ain't no losers
'Cause they're on the right track
'Cause they're on the right track
You can be on the right track together
Of course, of course
Ain't no SNAFU, no fol-de-rol
Check these out
Big eyed beans from Venus
I'll let a few out
Let 'em pass in between us

Distant cousins, there's a limited supply
And we're down to the dozens, and this is why
Don't let anything get in between us
Big eyed beans from Venus
Big eyed beans from VenusEmbed
