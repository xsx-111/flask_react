Her Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles Lyrics
I look at her and she looks at me
In her eyes, I see the sea
I don't see what she sees in a man like me
She says she loves me

Her eyes
Yeah, her eyes
Her eyes are a blue million miles
Far as I can see
She loves me
Her eyes, her eyes
Yeah, her eyes are a blue million miles
Far as I can see
She loves me
Yeah, her eyes
Yeah, her eyes
Her eyes are a blue million miles

I look at her and she looks at me
And in her eyes, I see the sea
I can't see what she sees in a man like me
If she says she loves me
Yeah, her eyes
Yeah, her eyes are a blue million miles
Yeah, her eyes
Yeah, her eyes
Whoa, her eyes are a blue million miles
Her eyes
Yeah, her eyes
Whoa, her eyes are a blue million milesEmbed
