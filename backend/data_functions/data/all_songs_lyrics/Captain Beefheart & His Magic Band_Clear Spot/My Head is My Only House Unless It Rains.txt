My Head is My Only House Unless It Rains Lyrics
I'll let a train be my feet if it's too far to walk to you
If a train don't go there I'll get a jet or a bus
'Cause I'm going to find you
You're going to see my shadow soon around you

And my head is my only house unless it rains

I walk the meadow plains
Water deserts are my eyes until I find you
I won't sleep until I find you
I won't eat until I find you
My heart won't beat until I wrap my arms around you

My arms are just two things in the way
Til' I can wrap them around you
You can make my sad song happy
And a bad world good
I can feel you out there moving
You're mine, I know I'll find you

And my head is my only house until I've found you
I hate to have other people hear me sing this song
But if it reaches you before I do
Follow this song to "I love you"
That's where I'll find you

And my head is my only house unless it rainsEmbed
