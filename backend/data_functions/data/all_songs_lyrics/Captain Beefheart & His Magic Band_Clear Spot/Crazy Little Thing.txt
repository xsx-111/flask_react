Crazy Little Thing Lyrics
Crazy Little Thing has just gone crazy
Girl, how'd ya get a name like Crazy Little Thing
Probably the name that drove you crazy all along

How'd ya get a walk
How'd ya get it all to move so smooth and lazy
How'd ya learn to talk real low like that
To where it makes all the men go crazy
Every little thing, every little thing has just gone crazy

The way she move, there ain't no maybe
Talkin' way low like that
To where all the men go crazy

She brings things down lower than they should be
She brings things up higher than they could be
She got the answer to the answer
And my only question is how old, how cool, how low can you be?
(you won't find out from me)

If you're too young, girl, you know you're gonna be the ruin of me
They call her crazy, but I'm hot and she's cold
Crazy Little Thing, Crazy Little Thing
How old, how old, how old
How'd ya get built like that?
You ain't been here that long
Crazy Little Thing, Crazy Little Thing
How long, how long, how long

Crazy Little Thing has just gone crazy
Girl, how'd ya get a name like Crazy Little Thing
Probably the name that drove you crazy all along

How'd ya get a walk
How'd ya get it all to move so slow and lazy
How'd ya learn to talk real low like that
To where it drives
To where it drives the men all crazy

Crazy Little Thing has just gone crazy
Girl, how'd ya get a name like Crazy Little Thing
Probably the name that drove you crazy all alongEmbed
