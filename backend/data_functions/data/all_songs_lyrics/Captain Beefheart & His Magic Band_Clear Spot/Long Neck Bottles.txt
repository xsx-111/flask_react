Long Neck Bottles Lyrics
Woman like long neck bottles
And a big head on her beer
I don't like to talk about my women
But I hold that woman dear
Well, one night she got to drinking
Got out and shot up the town
I'll be damned if she didn't bring an airplane down
I don't like to talk about my women
But this one sure could chug 'em down
I don't like to talk about my women
But this one sure could chug 'em down

One night she started drinking down by the river
She tied up the river and backed the ocean down
I don't like to talk about none of my women
But this one sure could hold her long neck bottle beer down
When she walked into a bar
They set 'em up and got right out of town
'Cuz she picked 'em up a'plenty
And laid a lot of them down

Woman like long neck bottles
And a big head on her beer
Now you got that down
You got that down
Well, I don't like to talk about my women
But I'm gonna do it anyway
Then I'm gonna get right out of town
Well, one night she got to drinking
Got out and shot up the town
I'll be damned if she didn't bring an airplane down
I don't like to talk about my women
But this one sure could, sho'nuff could chug 'em downEmbed
