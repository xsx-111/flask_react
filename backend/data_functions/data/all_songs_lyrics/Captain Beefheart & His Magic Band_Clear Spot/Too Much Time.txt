Too Much Time Lyrics
I got a-too much time
Too much time
I got too much time to be without love
Too much time
I got a-too much time
I got too much time
Too much time to be without love

In my life, I've got a deep devotion
Wide as the sky and deep as the ocean
Every war that's waged makes me cry
Every bird that goes by gets me high

Sometimes when it's late and I'm a little hungry
I heat up some old stale beans
Open up a can of sardines
Eat crackers and dream about somebody to cook for me

(Too much time) Too much time
(I got too much time) Too much time
(Too much time) Too much time
Too much time to be without love
In my life, I've got a deep devotion
Wide as the sky and deep as the ocean
Every war that's waged makes me cry
Every bird that goes by gets me high

I got too much time
(I got too much time) Too much time
(Too much time) Too much, too much time)
(Too much time) To be without love
(Too much time) Too much time
(I got too much time) Too much time
(Too much time) Too much-uch time
(Too much time) To be without love
(Too much time) Too much, too much time
(I got too much time) Oh, yeah
(Too much time) Too much, too much time
(Too much time) To be without love
(Too much time) Too, too, too much...Embed
