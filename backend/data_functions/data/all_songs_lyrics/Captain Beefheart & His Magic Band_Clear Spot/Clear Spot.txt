Clear Spot Lyrics
I have to run so far to find a clear spot in the hot
Sun's all hottin' and a-rottin' hot
Swamp's all rotten 'n' stinkin', uhh
Vegetation's hot
Sleepin' in a bayou on a old rotten cot

Can't find my kind of folks havin' fun
I have to run, run, run, run
Run to find a clear spot

Can't shadow down on the sun big brown
Mosquitos 'n' moccasins steppin' all around
'Fraid I'm gonna get hit

Sun's all a-hottin' and a-rottin' hot
Vegetation's hot
Sleepin' in a bayou on a old rotten cot

Can't find my kind of folks havin' fun
Got to run, run, run, run
Run to find a clear spot
Can't shadow down on the sun big brown
Mosquitos 'n' moccasins steppin' all around
'Fraid I'm gonna get hit
'Fraid I'm gonna get hit
I have to run so far to find a clear spotEmbed
