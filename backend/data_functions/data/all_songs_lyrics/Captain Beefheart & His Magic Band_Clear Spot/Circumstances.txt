Circumstances Lyrics
Once you find out the circumstances
Then you can uh go out, whoa yeah


Once you find out the circumstances
Then you can uh go out, whoa yeah

Little girl, don't you know that the stars up above are
Runnin' on love
Little girl don't you know that they're
Blinkin' at you
Now the sun can sunburn you but
Not as bad as those old people do, yeah

Ah, once you find out the circumstances
Then you can uh go out, whoa yeah

Little girl, don't you know that the stars up above are
Runnin' on love
Little girl don't you know that they're-a
Blinkin' at you
Now the sun can sunburn you but
Not as bad as those old people do, yeah
Ah once you, once you find out the circumstances
Then you, then you, then you, then you can go out, ah yeah
You can go outEmbed
