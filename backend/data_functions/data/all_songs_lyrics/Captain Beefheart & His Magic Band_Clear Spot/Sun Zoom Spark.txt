Sun Zoom Spark Lyrics
Nothing makes it move
From the bottom to the top
Does it start at the bottom?
Or does it start at the top?

Magnet draw day from dark
Sun zoom spark, sun zoom spark

Now which hand's got it?
Bottom or the top?
Neither hand's got it
It's just got it, hope it don't stop

Magnet draw day from dark
Sun zoom spark, sun zoom spark

Think you can hold it
Once it start?
I don't care who you are or what size you are
I'm gonna magnetize ya
Magnet draw day from dark
Sun zoom spark, sun zoom spark

It goes every which way once it start
Does it start at the bottom?
Or does it start at the top?

Magnet draw day from dark
Sun zoom spark, sun zoom spark

Ohhh, don't let it get away
I'm gonna zip up my guitar
'n' then when I've gone too far
I'm gonna zip down my guitar

Magnet draw day from dark
Sun zoom spark, sun zoom sparkEmbed
