Golden Birdies Lyrics
Those little golden birdies, look at them

In the mystic Egypt tossle dangling down
Old sleeper-man shish, don't wake him
Up one hand broom star was an obi-man
Revered throughout the bone-knob land
His magic black purse slit creeped open
Let go flocks of them
Shish sookie singabus
Snored like a red merry-go-round horse
And an acid gold bar swirled up and down
Up and down, in back of the singabus
And the pantaloon duck white goose neck quacked
