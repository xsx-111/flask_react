Low Yo Yo Stuff Lyrics
Fast goes fast
Slow goes slow

Alright now, do the low yo yo yo yo
Now do the low yo yo yo yo yo yo

Like that girl standing on the corner
Trying to get a ride to the other side
When way down underneath all she had to do was
Move her pretty feet

And do the low yo yo yo yo
Alright baby, do your low yo yo with all your stuff
Now, baby, do your low yo yo stuff

Now, baby, it's in your beanie
Whether you're long, tall, short or skinny
Sometimes it's rough
You mean to tell me it's that low yo yo stuff?

Low yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo
Fast goes fast
Slow goes slow

Low yo yo yo yo

It's like that girl standing on the corner
Trying to get a ride to the other side
When way down deep
She knows all she gotta do is move her pretty feet

Do the low yo yo yo yo

What if my girlfriend back home
Finds out what my fingers have been doing
On my guitar since I been gone?
Don't anybody tell her
I been doing the low yo yo yo yo
Like any other fella
Away from home, all alone

Been doing that low yo yo yo yo
Yeah, I've been really carrying on!
Fast goes fast
Slow goes slow
Rich are rich and the poor are poor

Everybody's doing the low yo yo yo yo
Everybody could and deep down
Everybody knows they should
Do the low yo yo yo yoEmbed
