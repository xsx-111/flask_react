Snow Brigade Lyrics
Enable to bring out the something
You want to know beneath the snow
In winter you're an affliction
That repeatedly defeated me

I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade

Bring out the someone
You need to see for jealousy
We all know one day you'll leave behind
Your everything and feel the spring come

'Cause I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade

My arms retreat
I wish they were there to hold you
I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade
I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade

I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade
I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade
I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care
Know that there is no escape
From my snow brigade1Embed
