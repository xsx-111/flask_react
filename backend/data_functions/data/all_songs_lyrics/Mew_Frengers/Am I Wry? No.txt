Am I Wry? No Lyrics
Farah, now that we’re here, can you tell me
Exactly how I should have done?
Farah, drives with her eyes closed
Do you ever inflict unwanted memories?

I know you and I know it won’t take you long
To make me smile

Farah, angelic girl
I’ll have you know
It’s you and me potentially
Farah, don’t pull the carpet from under me
Indifference is killing me

Am I wry? Oh my! Fallacy!
Fallacy in my words am I wry

I know you and I know you’re not afraid
To say the least

Diamond ring, diamond ring
But you can’t find it
Cold is the night
Diamond ring, diamond ring
But you can’t find it
Cold is the night
Diamond ring, diamond ring
But you can’t find it
Cold is the night
Diamond ring, diamond ring
But you can’t find it
Cold is the night2Embed
