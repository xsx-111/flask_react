Eight Flew Over, One Was Destroyed LyricsHalfway through flight there-to
Where will you go?
Falling down on the ground
Where will you go now?
Do you remember what made you fall?
And does it matter to you at all?
You wanna go, you wanna see
What lies could set you free
You wanna see, right?
You'll know this night
Halfway through flight there-to
Where will you go?
It's a nice way, I think
To wake up with you
You cannot see them when it is light
This is the reason we go at night
In the darkest flight of my career
I am made blue all through
On my dark descend I persevere
I am thinking of you
It's a nice way, I think
To wake up with you
A nice way
I'm separated from you1Embed
