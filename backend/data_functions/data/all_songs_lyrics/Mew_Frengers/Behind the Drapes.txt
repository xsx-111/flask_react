Behind the Drapes LyricsAll of us now bent as we fall
To amorous light we call out
Why are we so alone
Even with company?
If not the moon will us guide
Will then the street light?
All of us now breathe it like smoke
To know what it's like
Breathe to choke
Well, for nine days
A small moth has tried to escape
Our bedroom
Why are we so alone
Even with company?
We are the prey
For each day a striking distance1Embed
