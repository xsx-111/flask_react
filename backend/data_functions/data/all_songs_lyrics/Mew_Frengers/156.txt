156 Lyrics
From my boat I can see your house
And when the lights are on I can watch you move
Hear the wind whispering your name
Twice the encouragement of the real you

Callie, if you really want me to
I can always get you down
If you've got the money for me
Callie, in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Making amends for distant wrongs, sincere

You can run away, leave your books behind you
But you should look back twice, just to be on the safe side

From my boat I can see your house
But now the lights are off, there is no one home
You are just like an avalanche, cold as I might have guessed
But at least I'm covered up for now
In a big big way I am really small
I get off my feet, but I'm still distant
Don't you just love goodbyes?
Don't you just love goodbyes?

Callie, let us get it over with
I can always get you down
If you've got the money for me
Callie, in the summer rain
You will be kept dry you see
If you got the money for me
Most of our lives we try so hard to find the time

I won't care for you like I'm really supposed to
There are things I'll do that could really hurt you
Don't you just love goodbyes?
Don't you just love goodbyes?
One-five-six
Don't you just love goodbyes?
One-five-six
Don't you just love goodbyes?
One-five-six
Don't you just love goodbyes?
One-five-six
Don't you just love goodbyes?
One-five-six
Don't you just love goodbyes?
