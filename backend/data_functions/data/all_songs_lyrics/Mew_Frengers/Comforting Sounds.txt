Comforting Sounds Lyrics
I don't feel alright in spite of these comforting sounds you make
I don't feel alright because you make promises that you break
Into your house, why don't we share our solitude?
Nothing is pure anymore but solitude

It's hard to make sense, feels as if I'm sensing you through a lens
If someone else comes, I'll just sit here listening to the drums
Previously I never called it solitude

And probably you know all the dirty shows I've put on
Blunted and exhausted like anyone
Honestly I tried to avoid it, honestly
Back when we were kids, we would always know when to stop
And now all the good kids are messing up
Nobody has gained or accomplished anything4Embed
