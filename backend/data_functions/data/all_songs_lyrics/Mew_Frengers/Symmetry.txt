Symmetry LyricsI'm caught in the symmetry of your mind
But I'm not happier than you
Did I really see you or was it a dream?
Dreaming that it was seamless
Not a trace of wrong
Wrong words that we have spoken
Little did we know. No bigotry, No tears shed
Oh if only you'd try to be polite
Thinking you were right
Only to find that you're unkind
But ironically you will always be belle of the ball
At least to me
I'm caught in the symmetry of your mind
But I'm not happier than you
But my words are frail not audible
They do not even convince me
Perhaps they are untrue
Truly with you the worst is always true
I gave you all the benefits of all the doubts
I had never hope to be as benign as me
Funny how you always get through
But ironically you will always be belle of the ball
At least to me1Embed
