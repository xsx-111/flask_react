She Came Home for Christmas LyricsDon't touch her there, she's blindfolded
She remembers on the bus
Into my heart
Don't remember
Like you left us without notice
Now you've come back
Like you left us
Like you owe us
Into my heart
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
Don't touch her there, she told me
She remembers how it felt
Into my heart
Don't remember
Like you left us without notice
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
Come home, come home
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
It's not me, it can't be
It's not you, I can't do what I do if it's you
This is not happening
Don't touch her there
He watched her
She knew his look from behind
When she came home for ChristmasEmbed
