Her Voice Is Beyond Her Years (Frengers Version) LyricsHer voice is beyond her years
She's trying to move you
She did not know where to go
And soon it was dark
If I could look you in the eyes
If I could look you in the eyes
I couldn't let you go
I couldn't let you go
I couldn't let you go
I couldn't let you go
Her voice is beyond her years
Please try not to move her
At least it was her mistake
Hers alone to make
If I could look you in the eyes
If I could look you in the eyesEmbed
