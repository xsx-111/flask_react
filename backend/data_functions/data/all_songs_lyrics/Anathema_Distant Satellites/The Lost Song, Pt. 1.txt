The Lost Song, Pt. 1 LyricsTonight I'm free, so free
For the first time
I've seen a new life, new life
Start to breathe
And you came to me in some way
And my life will never be the same
(And one day you'll feel me
A whisper upon the breeze)
And that night, as I dreamed
And I slipped away
To another place
Where you spoke to me
Of this day, of this day
And you came to me in some way
And my life will never be the same
And you came to me in some way
And my life is like a hurricane
And you came to me in some way
And my life will never be the same
For you're mine and I'm yours for life
For you're mine and I'm yours for life
For life
The fear is just an illusion
The fear is just an illusion
The fear is just an illusion
The fear is just an illusionEmbed
