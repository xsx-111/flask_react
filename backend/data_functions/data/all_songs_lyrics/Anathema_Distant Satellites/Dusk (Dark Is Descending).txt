Dusk (Dark Is Descending) LyricsLift my mind to the light 'cause I'm frozen
Lift my eyes to the sky 'cause I'm searching
To feel like I want it to, to be like I want it to
'Cause I'm trying, my love
To feel like I want it to, to be like I want it to
'Cause I'm trying, my love
Reach for my hand and take me away
Away from this place
'Cause I know I don't belong here
Away from this place
I don't know, how did I get here, my love?
Away from this place
'Cause I know I don't belong here, my love
Speak to my heart and take me away
'Cause I'm trying to be brave now
But I'm frozen in this place now and it's so cold
(To feel like I want it to, to be like I want it to)
And the hopes I had forsaken
Were replaced with such an aching, please take me home
(To feel like I want it to, to be like I want it to)
'Cause I'm trying to be brave now
But I'm frozen in this place now and it's so cold
(To feel like I want it to, to be like I want it to)
And the hopes I had forsaken
Were replaced with such an aching, please take me home
But I keep it all inside
Inside
Inside
Inside
Through the tears I watched you fly
You fly
You fly
Far away from me
Far away from me
Far away from me
And as the years went by
I found in time I smiled
I set my dreams alight
But I'll never forget you
I'll always live for you, all my love
You'll fly, you're not far away from me
You're not far away from me
You're not far away from me
You're not far away from meEmbed
