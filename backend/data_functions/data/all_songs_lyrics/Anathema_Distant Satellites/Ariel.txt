Ariel Lyrics
I found you in the dark
I found you in the dark
Don't leave me here
Don't leave me

Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts
Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts

I dreamed of you in the dark
You spoke to me from afar
What you mean to me is clear
And I'll always be near

I found you in the dark
I found you in the dark
Don't leave me here
Don't leave me

Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts
Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts
I look into your eyes
See my life defined
Look into your eyes
See your heart in mine


Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurts
Staring at the sun
A love so strong it hurtsEmbed
