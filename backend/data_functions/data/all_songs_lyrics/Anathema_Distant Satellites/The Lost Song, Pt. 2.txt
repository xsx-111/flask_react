The Lost Song, Pt. 2 LyricsIn a lifetime, there's a moment to awaken
To the sound of your heartbeat, unbroken
And you’re free now and I will remain, still dreaming
Alive and aware, the love that I once believed in
And one day you’ll feel me
A whisper upon the breeze
And I’ll watch you stand there, unafraid
And I'll speak to you silently
And know that you hear me
The feeling is more than I've ever known
And one day you’ll feel me
A whisper upon the breeze
And I’ll watch you stand there, unafraid
And I'll speak to you silently
And know that you hear me
Come back to me, please believe
The feeling is more than I've ever known
I can’t believe it was just an illusion
I can’t believe it was just an illusion
I can’t believe it was just an illusion
The feeling is more than I've ever known
And one day you’ll feel me
A whisper upon the breezeEmbed
