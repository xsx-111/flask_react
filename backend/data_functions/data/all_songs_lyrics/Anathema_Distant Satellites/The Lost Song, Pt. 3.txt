The Lost Song, Pt. 3 Lyrics
Now that I've found you
I'm not going to leave you
The world keeps on turning
Spirits reflecting
My heart beats for you
Outside my body

Tonight in my mind’s eye
I need you to hold on

A promise of future
Dreaming in colour
Being together
Spirits reflecting
The feeling is so real
The beauty is endless

Tonight in my mind’s eye
I need you to hold on

Fire at night
And souls in flight
And time can heal
All scars concealed
Because love is what we are
How near or how far
And life will bring
The truth in dreamEmbed
