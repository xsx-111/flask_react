Deathbound Lyrics
Going through the
Deep icy waves
Thrown in
End all because death waits

Throughout during the winter
Guardian of land and sea
Standing close to the throne
Violent 'cause I cannot see
Power royalty
Our presidents hanging
No one left here anymore

Going through the
Deep icy waves

Icy squall on the tundra
Obedience how we reign
Enjoy the sights we know
Soon it will be turned
Grovel, life expelled
Become Immortal
Forceful hand, unfeeling
Howling dead are near
Sordid tale of man
Molten rock renown
Distant brother of man
Howling dead are near
Sordid tale of man

Going through the
Deep icy waves
Thrown in
End all because death waitsEmbed
