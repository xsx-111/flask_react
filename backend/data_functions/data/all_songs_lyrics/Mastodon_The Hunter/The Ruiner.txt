The Ruiner Lyrics
You take life
Give nothing back
You need to return what you've stolen
You need life
To multiply
Devour all that surrounds you

Heavy weighs the crown
Low hangs the head who wears it

Destroyer
Of all that's good
We don't need a death that surrounds you
The bolt strikes
To infect
We know your intentions are impure

Heavy weighs the crown
Low hangs the head who wears it

Sickness can't kill this love
Always alive in my heart
Sickness can't kill this love
Always alive in my heart
Heavy weighs the crown
Low hangs the head who wears itEmbed
