Blasteroid Lyrics
Change your hair, change your clothes
I'll rearrange your face for you
If you can breathe when I am through
I'll give it all right back to you

I want to drink some fucking blood
I want to break some fucking glass
I want to squeeze you till you're inside out
I want it all

Change your name, change your eyes
Become the one who I despise
If you are sad and need to cry
Then turn around and go outside

I want to drink some fucking blood
I want to break some fucking glass
I want to squeeze you till you're inside out
I want it allEmbed
