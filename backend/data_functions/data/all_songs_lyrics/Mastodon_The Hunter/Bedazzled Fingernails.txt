Bedazzled Fingernails Lyrics
Give and take
We are full of pride
All is proved in time

Lay me down
Stand my ground
Lay me down
Stand my ground

Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes

Rule by the head
Endure the test of time
Plant the seed of mind

Lay me down
Stand my ground
Lay me down
Stand my ground
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes
Taking a life
I see it flash before my eyes1Embed
