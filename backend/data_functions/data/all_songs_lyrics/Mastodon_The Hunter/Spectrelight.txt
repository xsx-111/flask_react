Spectrelight Lyrics
We trip the light
Firebird flies
Burn your inside
Given a lesson
The path I've shown
Follow all I know

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

It came from the ocean
Gift from the sea
Lava forms the stone
Belief in power
Believe the dream
Trust your own truth

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlife

You listen through the light
Tolling on the sea
Barren eyes behind you
Leave the shadows waking dreams
Rising through the door
Writing with a knife
Cut speech, cut light
Cut chord and break the dawning wretch of silence
Trust your own truth
Souls of the fallen
Death of the Godhead
Listen and breathe

Into the spectrelight
Into the afterlifeEmbed
