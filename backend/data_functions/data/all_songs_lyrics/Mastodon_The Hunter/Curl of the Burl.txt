Curl of the Burl LyricsI killed a man cause he killed my goat
I put my hands around his throat
He tried to reason with the sky and the clouds
But it didn't matter, cause they can't hear a sound
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
Splinters in my skin just like needles and pins
I cut through the pine, love the feeling it gives
But I'll never die, running through these streets
I'm using my hands, cutting through the disease
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
I feed the powerless
Chew it up, spit the rest
I feed the powerless
Chew it up, spit the rest
It's just the curl of the burl
It's just the curl of the burl
That's just the way of the world
It's just the curl of the burl
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh2Embed
