Country LyricsI know a place not far from here
Where lifes sweet perfume fills the air
And if you want I'll take you there
If you want I'll take you there
Into the light out of the dark
Where only love can heal your heart
And if you want I'll make a start
If you want I'll make a start
This place I say - half hour away
Is that so far to go - so near
And further on we'll find the time
And lose the discontent we feel - that we feel
I feel the time we've yet to reach
Is not within our own belief
But I feel sure that time'll come
If it goes on at all, said - if it goes on at all, whoa - if it goes on at all
Hey - it goes on and on and on and on
I know a place not far from here
Where fresh cut grass will fill your hair
And if you want we'll lay a while there
If you want we'll lay a while there
If you want we'll lay a while there2Embed
