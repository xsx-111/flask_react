Moon on Your Pyjamas LyricsWas that a shooting star I saw
It's rare for me to make a wish at all
Because I feel that I can only hope
These dangerous time, we are barely afloat
And I hope the world will heal itself
And our worn out souls along with it
So that you will get the chance to say
That you have seen a better day
You've got the moon on your pyjamas
And the stars in your eyes
Sweet child you're a dream in disguise
Angels on silver strings hang from above
Let love and laughter shine wherever you go
Through your new eyes I've come to see
How beautiful my life can be
And I'll keep this wish this time I think
And blow it in with a kiss upon your head
And I hope the world will heal itself
And our worn out souls along with it
So that you will get the chance to see
A summer's blue sky behind green trees
You've got the moon on your pyjamas
And the stars in your eyes
Sweet child you're a dream in disguise
Angels on silver strings hang from above
Let love and laughter shine wherever you goEmbed
