Sunflower LyricsI don't care how long this lasts
We have no future, we have no past
I write this now while I'm in control
I'll choose the words and how the melody goes
Along winding streets we walked hand in hand
And how I long for that sharp wind
To take my breath away again
I'd run my fingers through your hair
Hair like a wheatfield I'd run through
That I'd run through...
And I miss you so - I miss you so
Now you're gone, I feel so alone
I miss you so
I'd send you a flower - a Sunflower bright
'Cause you cloud my days messing up my nights
And all the way up to the top of your head
Sun-showered kisses I felt we had
And I miss you so - Oh baby I miss you so
Now your gone, I feel so low - oh I miss you so, I do
But I miss you so - Oh darling I miss you so
Now your gone, I feel so low - oh I said I miss you so, I do
All I gotta do is think of you - and I miss you so
Baby I'm... I'm afraid to say why - I miss you so
Baby I'm... I'm afraid to say why - Oh I miss you soEmbed
