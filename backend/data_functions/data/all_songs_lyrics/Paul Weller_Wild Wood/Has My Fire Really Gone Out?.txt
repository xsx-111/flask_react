Has My Fire Really Gone Out? LyricsAnd if I open my eyes - will it then be morning?
First rays of summer sun - coming down and shining
And if I open my heart and say all that you would want
Hope, Faith and all I believe will be there to greet me
And put an end to all your doubts
Has my fire really really gone out?
Has my fire really gone out?
And if I open my head, remember all that we said
Hey baby what will you find - coming down to meet you?
A lot of words but with no one talking
I don't want no part of that
Something real is what I'm seeking
One clear voice in the wilderness
Has my fire really gone out?
Put an end to all your doubts - yeah
Has my fire really really gone out?
Oh, put an end to all your doubts - yeah
Has my fire really really gone out?
And if I open my eyes - will it then be morning?
First rays of summer sun - coming down and shining
And if I open my heart and say all that you would want
Hope, Faith and all I believe will be there to greet me
Something real is what I'm seeking
One clear voice in the wildernessEmbed
