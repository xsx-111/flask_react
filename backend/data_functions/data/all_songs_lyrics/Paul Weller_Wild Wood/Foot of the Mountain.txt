Foot of the Mountain LyricsLike a dream on the ocean
Always drifting away
And I can't catch up
She just slips away, (on the tide)
Sometimes a great notion
Can lead us astray
So weak to devotion'
So strong to deny
Oh baby baby won't you let me ride
-take me up on your sailboat ride
Come on now angels are on your side
But she slips away on the tide
Like mercury gliding
A silver teardrop that pours
And i can't hold on
Through my fingers she falls
At the foot of the mountain
Such a long way to climb
How will i ever get up there ?
Though i know i must try
Oh baby baby won't you let me ride
Take me up on your sailboat ride
Come on now angels are on your side
But she slips away
Oh never stays
Yeah she slips away
Oh and she slips away
(repeat last two lines ad lib)Embed
