Wild Wood Lyrics
High tide, mid afternoon
People fly by, in the traffics boom
Knowing, just where you are blowing
Getting to where you should be going

Don't let them get you down
Making you feel guilty about
Golden rain, will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve and now
(Right now)

Climbing, forever trying
Find your way out of the wild, wild wood
Now there's no justice
Only yourself that you can trust in

And I said, "High tide, mid afternoon
Oh, people fly by and the traffics boom
Knowing, just where you're blowing
Getting to where you should be going"

Day by day your world fades away
Waiting to feel all the dreams that say
Golden rain will bring you riches
All the good things you deserve now
And I say, "Climbing, forever trying
Find you way out of the wild, wild wood"
Said, "You are gonna find you way out of the wild, wild wood"
Wild, wild wood4Embed
