Ends of the Earth LyricsOnce I had a love, so sweet - I remember
She'd follow me to the ends of the earth
????and I'd let her
And everyday was like a fairy tale
Cuts me up inside to think how I failed
????I see now so well
She gave me everything she had for the better
Gave me the key to her soul - and I let her
Once I had a love, so sweet - I remember
She'd follow me to the ends of the earth
????and I let her
And every day was like a picture book
The look of love was in her eyes -
And how she'd look - but me, I just took
A fellow traveler with nothing planned
Save loving me the way I am
Expecting nothing in return -
And I through her I got to learn
Too late for me to see
I measured out my destiny
Too late for me to know
And where I lost her - I don't know
Once I had a love, so sweet - I remember
She'd follow me to the ends of the earth
Yes I let her - I let her slip awayEmbed
