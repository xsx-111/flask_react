Can You Heal Us (Holy Man) LyricsCrystal words that hang so fine - But none will stop us falling
Pulling faster all the time - Powerless to warnings
If you feel the hand of God - Can you guide it holy man?
But you are only flesh and blood - Waiting too for judgement
Still saying! Daddy don't weep Momma don't cry
Everybody gets their time
Don't be sad don't be blue - Pray for me
I'll do the same for you
Split the Father and the Son - Hand words to ease them
If you have the hand of God - Can you heal us holy man?
But you are only flesh and blood - Waiting too for judgement
Still saying!
Hang on tight hang on strong
How much longer can this go on
But don't be sad don't be blue - It's one more thing sent to confuse
Daddy don't weep Momma don't cry
Every fear must have its time
Don't be sad don't be blue - Pray for me
I'll do the same for you
Can you bring the hand of God?
Can you stop the killing?
Get us back to hope and love - Never more be needed
Still saying!
Bloods gone bad bad to worse
Worse to bad and back again
But don't be sad don't be blue - It's one more thing sent to confuse
Momma don't weep Daddy don't cry
Every fear must have its time
Don't be sad don't be blue - Pray for me I'll do the same for youEmbed
