Holy Man (Reprise) LyricsCrystal words that hang so fine but none will stop us falling
Pulling faster all the time powerless to warnings
If you feel the hand of God, can you guide it holy man?
But you are only flesh and blood, waiting too for judgment
Still saying, daddy don't weep momma don't cry
Everybody gets their time
Don't be sad don't be blue, pray for me
I'll do the same for you
Split the father and the son, hand words to ease them
If you have the hand of God, can you heal us holy man?
But you are only flesh and blood, waiting too for judgment
Still saying, hang on tight hang on strong
How much longer can this go on
But don't be sad don't be blue
It's one more thing set to confuse
Daddy don't weep momma don't cry
Every fear must have its time
Don't be sad don't be blue, pray for me
I'll do the same for you
Can you bring the hand of God?
Can you stop the killing?
Get us back to hope and love
Never more be needed
Still saying, bloods gone bad bad to worse
Worse to bad and back again
Don't be sad don't be blue
It's one more thing sent to confuse
Momma don't weep daddy don't cry
Every fear must have its time
Don't be sad don't be blue, pray for me
I'll do the same for youEmbed
