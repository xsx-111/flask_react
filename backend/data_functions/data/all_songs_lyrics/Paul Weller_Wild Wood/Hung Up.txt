Hung Up LyricsHidden in the back seat of my head
Some place I can't remember where
I found it just by coincidence
An' now I'm all hung up again
Just like a soldier from the past
Who won't be told it's over yet
Refusing to put down his gun
He's gotta hurt someone
He'll keep on fighting 'til his war is won
Waiting for the moment
Keep on looking for a sign
Extraordinary - trying to cease the war inside
Hidden in the back seat of my head
Some place I can't remember where
I found it just by coincidence
An' now I'm all hung up againEmbed
