The Weaver LyricsCan you put a smile back on - all these different faces
Of all these people from - such different places
And if you can succeed - what then will you achieve
With a different tune to play - you've been saving for a rainy day
Will you heal the scar that's on - the years been wasted
The tears spent on the past - just filling spaces
Or is love forever gone banished to a smaller part
Hide behind your wall and start - to get to the very heart
An' if you wanna shoot the moon - make sure that you know why
Careful fly too soon - better let someone else try
I'm the weaver of your dreams - I get rid of your bogeyman
I'm here to smash the shell you're under
An' get you into another thing -
I'm the weaver of your dreams - I put paid to the rocketman
I'm here to break the spell you're under
And get you started with another plan
Could you put a kiss back on - the lips so twisted
Waiting for the chance to start - dipping into wishes
Or is love forever gone - banished to a smaller part
Hide behind your wall and start - to get to the very heart
And in the midst of the darkest night
Think of me and hold me tight
So that I might live to see
All the weaving of my dreamsEmbed
