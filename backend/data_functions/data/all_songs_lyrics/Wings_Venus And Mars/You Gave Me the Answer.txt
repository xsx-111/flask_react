You Gave Me the Answer Lyrics

You gave me the answer to love eternally
I love you and you, you seem to like me

Wherever we wander, the local folk agree
I love you and you, you seem to like me

Heading back to old familiar places
Places where the cobwebs blow away
I can't forget the airs and graces

Shall we dance?
This is fun
We should do this more often

You'll never be crowned by the aristocracy
To their delight, you'd merely invite them in for a cup of tea
And I love you and you
You seem to like
You seem to like
You seem to like meEmbed
