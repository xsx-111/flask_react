Magneto and Titanium Man Lyrics
Well I was talking last night
Magneto and Titanium Man
We were talking about you, babe
They said
You was involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three in the main street

I didn't believe them (I didn't believe them)
Magneto and Titanium Man
But when the Crimson Dynamo
Finally assured me, well, I knew
You was involved in a robbery
That was due to happen
At a quarter to three in the main street

So we went out
Magneto and Titanium Man
And the Crimson Dynamo
Came along for the ride
We went to town with the livery
And we swung all over that
Long tall bank in the main street
Well there she were and to my despair
She's a five-star criminal breaking the code
Magneto said, "Now the time has come
To gather our forces and run!"
Oh no
This can't be so
And then it occurred to me!
You couldn't be bad
Magneto was mad!
Titanium too!
And the Crimson Dynamo just couldn't cut it no more
You were the law


We went to town with the livery
And we swung all over that
Long tall bank in the main street (You know the one I mean?)

Well there she were and to my despair
She's a five-star criminal breaking the code
Magneto said, "Now the time has come
To gather our forces and run!"
Oh no
This can't be so
And then it occurred to me!
You couldn't be bad
Magneto was mad!
Titanium too!
And the Crimson Dynamo
Just couldn't cut it no more
You were the law1Embed
