Rock Show Lyrics
What's that man holding in his hand?
He looks a lot like a guy I knew way back when
It's Silly Willy with that Philly band
Could be, oo-ee

Tell me, what's that man movin' cross the stage?
It looks a lot like the one used by Jimmy Page
It's like a relic from a different age
Could be, oo-ee

If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at the Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah

The lights go down, they're back in town, O.K.
Behind the stacks, you glimpse an axe
The tension mounts, you score an ounce, ol√©!
The temperatures rise as you see the whites of their eyes

If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
You've got long hair at the Madison Square
They've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah
In my green metal suit, I'm preparing to shoot up the city
And the ring at the end of my nose makes me look rather pretty
It's a pity there's nobody here to witness the end
Save for my dear old friend and confidante, mademoiselle Kitty
Kitty, kitty, kitty!

What's that man moving to and fro?
That decibel meter doesn't seem to be reading low
But they was louder at the Rainbow
Could be, ooh-ee

If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at the Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
We'll be there, oh yeah

If there's a rock show at the Concertgebouw
They've got long hair at the Madison Square
You've got rock and roll at the Hollywood Bowl
Rock show
Long hair
Rock and rollEmbed
