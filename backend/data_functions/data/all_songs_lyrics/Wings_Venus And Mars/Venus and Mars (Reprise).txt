Venus and Mars (Reprise) LyricsStanding in the hall of the great cathedral
Waiting for the transport to come
Starship 21ZNA9
A good friend of mine studies the stars
Venus and Mars are alright tonight
Come away on a strange vacation
Holiday hardly begun
Run into a good friend of mine
Sold me her sign, reach for the stars
Venus and Mars are alright tonightEmbed
