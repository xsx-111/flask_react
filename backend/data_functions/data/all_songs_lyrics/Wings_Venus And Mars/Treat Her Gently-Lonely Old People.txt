Treat Her Gently/Lonely Old People Lyrics
Treat her gently, treat her kind
She doesn't even know her own mind
Treat her simply, take it slow
Make it easy and let her know
You'll never find another way

Here we sit two lonely old people
Eking our lives away
Bit by bit two lonely old people
Keeping the time of day
Here we sit out of breath
And nobody asked us to play
Old people's home for the day
Nobody asked us to play

So treat her gently, treat her kind
She doesn't even know her own mind
Treat her simply, make it slow
Take it easy and let her know
You'll never find another way

Here we sit two lonely old people
Eking our lives away
Bit by bit, two lonely old people
Keeping the time of day
Here we sit out of breath
And nobody asked us to play
Old people's home for the day
Nobody asked us to playEmbed
