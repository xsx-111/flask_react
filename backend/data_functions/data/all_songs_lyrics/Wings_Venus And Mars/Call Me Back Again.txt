Call Me Back Again Lyrics
Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night I would call
Your number brought me joy
I called your house, every night since then

But I ain't never, no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call me back again (Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again (Call me back again)

I've heard your name every night since then

But I ain't never, no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call me back again (Call me back again)
Yeah, call me back again (Call me back again)

Well when I, when I was
Just a little baby boy
Every night, every night
I would call because your number
Brought me joy
Ooh I've called your name every night since then
But I ain't never, no no no no never
Heard you calling me
Come on and call me back again (Call me back again)
Come on and call me back again (Call me back again)
Come on and, come on and call me (Call me back again)
Boohooohoooboohooohoo babe, call me back again (Call me back again)
(Call me back again)
Well won't you call me, call me back again (Call me back again)
I ain't never heard you so why won't you call me back again (Call me back again)
Every night I'm calling your name, so why won't you call me back again (Call me back again)
(Call me back again)Embed
