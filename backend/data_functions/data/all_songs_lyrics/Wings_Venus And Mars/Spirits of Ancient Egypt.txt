Spirits of Ancient Egypt Lyrics
You're my baby and I love you
You can take a pound of love and cook it in the stew
When you've finished doing that
I know what you'll want to do
'Cause you're my baby and I love you

I'm your baby, do you love me?
I can drive a Cadillac across the Irish Sea
But when I've finished doing that
I know where I'll want to be
'Cause I'm your baby, and you love me

Spirits of ancient Egypt
Shadows of ancient Rome
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Hung on the tele-
Hung on the tele-
Hung on the telephone

You're my baby, I know you know
You could sell an elevator to Geronimo
And when you've finished doing that
I know where you'll want to go
'Cause you're my baby, I know you know
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Echoes of sunken Spain
Spirits of ancient Egypt
Hung on the phone a-
Hung on the phone a-
Hung on the phone againEmbed
