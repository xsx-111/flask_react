Love in Song Lyrics
My heart cries out for love and all that goes with loving
Love in song
Love in song

My, you're so fine when love is mine
I can't go wrong
Love in song
Love in song

I can see the places that we used to go to now
Happiness in the homeland
Happiness in the homeland

My eye cries out a tear still born misunderstanding
Love in song
Love in song

I can see the places that we used to go to now
Happiness in the homeland
Happiness in the homeland
My, you're so fine when love is mine
I can't go wrong
Love in song
Love in song
Love in song1Embed
