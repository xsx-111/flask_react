Hi-Speed Boats LyricsClouds taste better than dirt
That's why you must evaporate above the earth
Pressure can make the clouds burst
Soon you wind up in the mud
Just where you were
Leaves may not reasons to believe in love
Can't you see to me she means the whole wide world
Queen bee shields my eyes
From the force inside of my mind
And the force they may you blind
Is beautiful
On the imaginary side
Even bored it is exciting
Being a drone is better than being alone
Bees may not be reasons to believe in love
Can't you see to me she means the whole wide world
Ain't yourself that fingers mean fun
Shake a quarter flip in the air is gone
In your silent fears it's first
A little bit of help and the tournament's over 
See the bladder bleed from an itty bitty hole
Do the weird blitzing no, no, no
You bet your sweater should be all the way gone
These/bees may bot be reasons to believe in love
Can't you see to me she means the whole wide worldEmbed
