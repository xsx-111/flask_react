Downs Are Feminine Balloons LyricsYou gotta give me a scene from your battle sky zone, I don't know
Go blur the things that matter to me most, friend or foe
Your fume, baby, soon, baby, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom
Tonight I'll dig tunnels to your nightmare room
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
And if it's one thing I can't stand, it's up
Should have known better than to do that stuff
That stuff can mess you up, that stuff can mess you up
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
Kick in the crawl from your watering hole, wailing woo
My mind pines for fluid filled eyes, what to do?
Your fume, baby, soon, baby, kaboom, kaboom, kaboom
Tonight I'll dig tunnels to your nightmare room
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
And if there's one thing I can't stand, it's up
Should have known better than to do that stuff
That stuff, it can mess you up, it can mess you upEmbed
