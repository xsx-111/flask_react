Something For Joey Lyrics
Crash land in an obscene movie
And fling yourself on an outstretched finger
A passive heart has a massive hole
You see faces that you did not know

It's exact, their stinger's intact
They're designed to rule the day
Their mouths are moving a million miles an hour
And it's the only way, hey

I've seen the legions in this house
The things we never talk about
So place your lips around his spout
And slowly blow yourself awayEmbed
