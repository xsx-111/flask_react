Not That Funny Lyrics
It's not that funny is it
When you don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
It's not that funny is it?

Don't blame me!
Please 
I didn't want to bleed so
I didn't want to be this late
So don't make me wait!

It's not that funny is it
No one to turn you on
All your hope is gone
It's not that funny is it?

Don't blame me!
Please 
You're here cause I say so
Didn't want to be this late
So don't make me
Don't make me wait!
Here comes the nighttime looking for a little more
Waiting on the right time somebody outside the door

It's not that funny is it
When you don't know what it is
But you can't get enough of it
It's not that funny is it? 
But you can't get enough of it Embed
