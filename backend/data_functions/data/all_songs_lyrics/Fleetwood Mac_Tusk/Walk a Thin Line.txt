Walk a Thin Line Lyrics
I seen so many things that make me wonder
But sometimes it's hard to tell

I said, "Take your time"
But no one was listenin'
I walk a thin line

They told me that I never would recover
Still some say they knew me well

I said "Stay by my side"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

And I said "Please toe the line"
But no one said nothin'
I walk a thin line

And I said "Fate takes time"
But no one was listenin'
I walk a thin line1Embed
