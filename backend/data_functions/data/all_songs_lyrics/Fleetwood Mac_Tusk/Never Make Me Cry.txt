Never Make Me Cry Lyrics
Go and do what you want
I know that you have the need
But you know that I'll wait, as long as it takes

And you'll never make me
You'll never make me
You'll never make me cry

Now, I may not mean everything
But I'm happy to have your love
And don't worry baby, I'll be alright

And I'll never make you
I'll never make you
I'll never make you cry

So go and do what you want
I know that you have the need
And don't worry baby, I'll be alright
You'll never make me
You'll never make me
You'll never make me cryEmbed
