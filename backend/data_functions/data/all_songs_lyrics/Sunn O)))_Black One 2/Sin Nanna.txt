Sin Nanna LyricsScabs of the past peeling slowly from a dark and distant memory
Emptiness
Whispering menace glinting beneath the skin
Consumption in the vast eternal maw
Decaying teeth flickering over the tongue of the faceless
Debasement of eternal torment
Dark is the light
Dark is the light
And everything is blackEmbed
