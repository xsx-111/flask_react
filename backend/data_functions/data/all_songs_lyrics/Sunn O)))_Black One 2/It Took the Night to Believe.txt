It Took the Night to Believe LyricsPerverted within a viewing
Standing alone
It took the night to believe
The beacon lingers
Come to grasp
To the edge of Orion
Repeatedly defiling the wind's daughter
Cry yourself to ash
A perfect silhouette
What is destroyed by fire
The withering egg
Dialates full
Unnourished
In salutations of crescent eye
Cry yourself to ash
A perfect silhouette
The beacon lingers
Cry yourself to ash
The beacon lingers
Cry yourself to ash
A perfect silhouette
It took the night to believe
Vibrate
Believe
Vibrate
Defile
