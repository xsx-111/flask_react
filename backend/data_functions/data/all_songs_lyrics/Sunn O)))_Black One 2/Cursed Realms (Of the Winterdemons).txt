Cursed Realms (Of the Winterdemons) LyricsEyeless in eternal time
For I have worn the moonshine
Burning daylight glimmer
With nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Descending
Towards the frostmoon eclipse
A spectral spirit kingdom rise
In stormscreens
Covered by eyes
Night emits its shadow
There is no difference
Between the ravens
They have come for me
They will come to me
To the cursed realm
Of the winterdemons
Lavender eyes had only known
The underdark
From crypts of stone they rise
Beyond the blinding glare
Eyeless in eternal time
For I have worn moonshine
Out from the chambers
And horizons will open for me
The face of the earth
Will be to know black silence
For I saw them march for the lights
Eyeless in eternal time
For I have worn moonshine
Burning away daylight glimmer
With my nocturnal senses
Winds have come for me
Descending towards
The frostmoon eclipse
A spectral spirit kingdom rise
In stormscreens
Covered by eyes
Night emits its shadow
There is no difference
Between the ravens
They have come for me
They will come to me
To the cursed realm
Of the winterdemonsEmbed
