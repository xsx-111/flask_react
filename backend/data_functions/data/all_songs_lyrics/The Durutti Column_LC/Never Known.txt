Never Known LyricsI cry in my sleep, sometimes you stay
Sometimes you stay, you never know why
Please say my name, don't turn away
The pain is black
The pain is bright
The pain is black
The pain is bright
The pain is bright
Then I awake and in the half light
Watching my movements through half closed eyes
You're touching me as a priest loves pornography
We played beneath the patterns 
Don't turn away
The pain is black
The pain is bright
The pain is black
The pain is bright
The pain is bright
Kissed by the years, caresses of time
Marking the lines, the lines of expression
The patterns of place, the patterns of youth
The patterns of love, don't turn away
Say my name, say my name1Embed
