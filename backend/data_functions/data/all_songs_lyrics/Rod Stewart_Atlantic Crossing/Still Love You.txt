Still Love You Lyrics
I was told by a good friend
You were untouchable, out of my reach
But the first time ever I saw you
I spilled my cherry lime over your dress
You said, "Don't you worry, it's not my best one"
First encounter, hardly the best

But I would not change a thing
If I could do it all over again
All I'm tryin' to say in my awkward way is
"I still love you"

Didn't I try to impress you
But my old Chevy van kept breakin' down
And my one room over the drugstore
We watched the neon lights go out over town
And some nights we'd go out dancin'
Come home singin' by the Erie Canal
Two hearts gently poundin'
As that mornin' train came janglin' through

But I would not change a thing
If I could do it all over again
All I'm tryin' to say in my awkward way is
"I still love you"
Well darlin', didn't I promise
I'd never go so far away again?
But here I am writin' this letter
Goodbye to you, my love, see you again

But I would not change a thing
If I could do it all over again
All I'm tryin' to say in my awkward way is
"I still love you"Embed
