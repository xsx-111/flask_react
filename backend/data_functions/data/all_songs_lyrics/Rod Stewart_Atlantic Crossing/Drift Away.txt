Drift Away Lyrics
Day after day I'm more confused
As I look for the light through the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
I'm feelin' the strain, ain't it a shame

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

Beginning to think that I'm wastin' time
I don't understand the things I do
The world outside looks so unkind
I'm countin' on you, to carry me through

Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away

When my mind is free
Your melody can move me
When I'm feelin' blue
The guitar's comin' through to soothe me
Thanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You help me along, you're always makin' me strong
Oh, give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Oh give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat, boys, and free my soul
I wanna get lost in your rock and roll and drift awayEmbed
