Alright for an Hour Lyrics
Aw yeah

Oh, didn't I mess around like ev'rybody did?
I said, "Woman, you're foolin' around with a man that just don't fit"
I said, "I'd better get along before I get right under your skin"
Remember the song, wasn't it fun?
'Cause it was just one of those things

But it was alright for an hour, it was alright for a day
But it did not last, it did not last 'til the weekend
And I packed my bags and moved right away

I said goodbye to money, I don't owe no alimony
I paid my dues and payroll cues, gonna leave it all up to you
I'll take my dog and my car, the best friends I've found so far
And I'll keep goin' with the mornin' sun, singin' the same old song

But it was alright for an hour, it was alright for a day
But it did not last, it did not last 'til the weekend
And I packed my bags and moved right away

Well I guess you needed somebody to open each and ev'ry door
With a large amount in the Swiss account to give you thrills and nothing more
But my Volkswagen is hardly a custom built Ferrari
You want first-class but I pump gas, so I'll get on out of your way

But it was alright for an hour, it was alright for a day
But it did not last, it did not last 'til the weekend
And I packed my bags and moved right away
It was alright for an hour, it was alright for a day
But it did not last, it did not last 'til the weekend
And I packed my bags and moved right away
It was alright for an hour, it was alright for a day
But it did not last, it did not last 'til the weekend
And I packed my bags and moved right awayEmbed
