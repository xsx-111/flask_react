Stone Cold Sober Lyrics
Woo

Never get to bed before sun up
Always get caught in the rain
Sometimes I might get in trouble
Never was one to complain
Now gentleman, you must agree
Ain't it worth it when you're out on cloud 33

To be stone cold sober again
Down in the alley again
Stone cold sober again

Never found a dime in a gutter
Always get my best friends drunk
If the pres'dent tries to call me
Say, "Rodney, come on over for lunch"
I'd say, "Gentlemen, excuse me please
But I'm busy with my buddies up on cloud 33"

Yeah, stone cold sober again
Down in the alley again
Stone cold sober again
Sunday is a drag, so forget it
Monday you can make up for that;
Tuesday, take a taste for dinner
If you're alright, spend it in bed
But on Thursday prepare for your weekend
And let Friday disappear into Saturday mornin'

When you're stone cold sober again
Down in the alley again
Stone cold sober again
Stone cold sober again
Down in the alley again
Stone cold sober again

I don't mind stone cold sober again
Down in the alley again
Stone cold sober againEmbed
