Rattlesnake Shake Lyrics
Check this out!

Tricky little Vicky walks along South Street
She learned her French from the boys that she'd meet yeah
I gotta laugh when I hear them say
She's a sweet little cheese when the cat's away

I know what you been trying
What you got ain't worth buying
Can't make a living working door to door

Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom boom, baby out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake

Juicy Miss Lucy always diggin' on junk
She's on the corner talkin' trash with the punks
Her buried treasure is so easy to see
'Cause talk is cheap and so is she
You're lost in search of passion
But Prince Charming ain't in fashion
So let it bleed if you wanna stay

Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom boom, baby out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom boom, baby out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shake
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Boom boom, baby out go the lights
Shake, shake, shake it like a rattlesnake
Staying up late doing the rattlesnake shakeEmbed
