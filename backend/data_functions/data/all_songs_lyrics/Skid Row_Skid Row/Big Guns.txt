Big Guns LyricsShe was a ballerina on a subway train
Stiletto heels and a candy cane
Looked like a number on a station wall
Hot on the tail of a social call
I wet my lips I thought I had it made
Like Valentino with a hand grenade
I made my move with my libido on
She circled once and then she dropped the bomb
She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang-bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, she blew me away
And I went down in flames
I met a sidewalk preacher on a roller skate
He said he had the key to Heaven's gate
I'll wait for the movie 'cause I been there before
And learned that like is a battle and love is war
She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang-bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky
She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang-bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, she blew me away
And I went down in flames
I'm doing time as a backseat Romeo
Play solitaire with my hands in the air
Another night and no bullets to spare
She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang-bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, took me by surprise
She got my lovin' reachin' for the sky
She got the big guns, pointed at my heart
Bang-bang shooting like a firing squad
Big guns, she blew me away
And I went down, down, down in flames
Big guns, big guns, big guns, she blew me away
And I went down in flames
Big guns, big guns, she really really got the big guns
She shot me, and I went down in flamesEmbed
