Youth Gone Wild Lyrics
(Rollinâ€™)
Whoa, yeah

Since I was born they couldn't hold me down
Another misfit kid, another burned out town
I never played by the rules and I never really cared
My nasty reputation takes me everywhere

When I look and see it's not only me
So many others have stood where I stand
We are the young
Hey! So raise your hands

They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall
We are the youth gone wild

Boss screaming in my ear about who I'm supposed to be
"Get a 3-piece Wall Street smile and son you'll look just like me."
I said "Hey man, there's something that you ought to know
I tell you Park Avenue leads to Skid Row."
Well I look and see it's not only me
We're standin' tall ain't never a doubt
We are the young
Hey! So shout it out

They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild
Well let me hear you get wild

They call us problem child, we spend our lives on trial
We walk an endless mile, we are the youth gone wild
We stand and we won't fall, we're one and one for all
The writing's on the wall, we are the youth gone wild

Whoa, whoa
Whoa, we are the youth gone wild
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, we are the youth gone wild
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, we are the youth gone wild
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, we are the youth gone wild3Embed
