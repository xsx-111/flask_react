Piece of Me LyricsSleazin' in the city
You know I'm lookin' for a fight
I'm on my heels and lookin' pretty
On a Saturday night, night, night
Good God, bless my soul
I need a fix of rock 'n roll
Come on baby you gotta wait and see
You better hurry and get a piece of me
Caught a lonely lady
She's crying on a cigarette
I got nasty, nasty habits
And that's all she's gonna get from me
One for the money, two for the show
Round and 'round and 'round we go
Take a look at what you might need
You better hurry and get a piece of me
I don't have looks, I don't have money
But I know one thing's for sure
One night ain't enough of my love
She wanted more, more, more
Sleazin' in the city, you know I'm lookin' for a fight
Well I'm on my heels and lookin' pretty
On a Saturday night, night, night
One for the money, two for the show
'Round and 'round and 'round we go
Take a look at what you might need
You better hurry and get a piece of me
You get a piece, a piece of me
Take a piece of me, woah
