Midnight / Tornado LyricsThe night approaches, after dark you have no chance
Oh, when moonlight takes the sky, you'll feel my dark romance
I'm on your footsteps and I wait behind your back
I spread like fire upon the streets, I'm ready to attack
I'm the only thing you need
Upon your love I feed
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm on the prowl of love
When the clock strikes midnight
Yeah, the time is right to call you out
When I'm feeling wicked and my blood is running hot
Electric is my touch baby you don't know what you've got
Only in the evening at night I come alive
So try to keep your passion deep I need it to survive
I'm the only thing you need
Upon your love I feed
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm on the prowl of love
When the clock strikes midnight
The time is right to call you out
When the clock strikes midnight
When the wicked moon starts to rise
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm alive
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm on the prowl of love
When the clock strikes midnight
The time is right to call you out
When the clock strikes midnight
When the wicked moon starts to rise
When the clock strikes midnight
I'm aliveEmbed
