Here I Am LyricsHey
Six foot one and lonely
Dressed in spaghetti rags
Standing at the bus stop
With her alligator bags
What can you do?
No, no, no, what can I do?
I better see a doctor
'Cause I think I'm getting hooked on you
I ain't much for talkin'
But all I got to say is
Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come on, take my lovin' while you can
She broke a million hearts
On 2nd avenue
With her German cigarettes
And designer attitude
What can you do?
No, no, no, no, no, no, what can I do?
My loves been goin' blind
Since the first time I laid eyes on you
Ain't much for conversation
But I got to let you know
Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come and take my lovin' while you can
You don't need a crystal ball
To see she's got it all
Here I am
Close your eyes and I'll be Superman
Here I am
Come and take my lovin' while you canEmbed
