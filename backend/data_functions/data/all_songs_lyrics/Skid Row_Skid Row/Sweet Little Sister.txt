Sweet Little Sister LyricsShe blew my mind behind the record machine
She was a shitload of trouble called the Subway Queen
Had a hip with bad habits and a shake that was a bit obscene
One night I caught her running out the cellar door
There was about a million people lying flat on the floor
For such a sweet little lady I would swear she's rotten to the core
She got her hands in the cookie jar
Smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of the car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later
I know a thing or two about
Sweet little sister
Our mama'd kill her if she knew what we do she's my
Sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet little sister
Every quitting time is another disease
Too many cowboys riding high shooting low at the knees
The back hand boogie is the price you pay for being the squeeze
The petting's getting heavy, got my tongue in her ear
Her friend is doing time for kicking ass on a queer
They're in a mental state and all their friends are here
Oh yes
She's telling lies through her burgundy lips
An angel on a mission of mercy
She'll get you dancin' with the crack of her whip
She'll take you up to Heaven in her rocket ship
I know a thing or two about
Sweet little sister
Our mama'd kill her if she knew what we do she's my
Sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue
Sweet little sister
She's like Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet as candy
She got her hands in the cookie jar smiling like an alligator
Makin' headlines in the back of the car
Tight-lipped now but sink ships later
I know a thing or two about
Sweet little sister
Our mama'd kill her if she knew what we do she's my
Sweet little sister
She'll love ya black and blue, oh-oh-oh
Sweet little sister
She's like Mona Lisa with a new tattoo
She's my sweet little
Sweet little sisterEmbed
