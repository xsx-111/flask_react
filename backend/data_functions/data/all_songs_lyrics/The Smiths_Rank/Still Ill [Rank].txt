Still Ill  Lyrics
Oh

I decree today that life
Is simply taking and not giving
England is mine and it owes me a living
But ask me why and I'll spit in your eye, oh
Oh, ask me why and I'll spit in your eye
But we cannot cling to the old dreams anymore
No, we cannot cling to those dreams

Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know

Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no
Does the body rule the mind
Or does the mind rule the body?
I don't know

Ask me why and I'll die
Oh ask me why and I'll die
And if you must go to work tomorrow
Well, if I were you I wouldn't bother
For there are brighter sides to life
And I should know because I've seen them
But not very often

Under the iron bridge we kissed
And although I ended up with sore lips
It just wasn't like the old days anymore
No, it wasn't like those days
Am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, am I still ill?
Oh, no
Oh, no, ohEmbed
