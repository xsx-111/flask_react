London  Lyrics
Smoke lingers 'round your fingers
Train - Heave on to Euston

Do you think you've made the right decision this time?
Oh, oh, oh

You've left your tired family grieving
And you think they're sad because you're leaving
But did you see the jealousy in the eyes of the ones who had to stay behind?

And do you think you've made the right decision this time?

Left your girlfriend on the platform
With this really ragged notion that you'll return
But she knows that when he goes, oh, he really goes

And do you think you've made the right decision this time?
