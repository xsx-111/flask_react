Ask (Rank) Lyrics
This is our new single "Ask"

Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life that you'd like to
Shyness is nice and shyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life that you'd like to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

Coyness is nice and coyness can stop you
From doing all the things in life that you'd want to

So, if there's something you'd like to try
If there's something you'd like to try
Ask me, I won't say "no"
How could I?

Spending warm summer days indoors
Writing frightening verse
To a buck-toothed girl in Luxembourg
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that'll bring us together

Nature is a language, can't you read?
Nature is a language, can anybody read?

So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me

Because if it's not love
Then it's the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb, the bomb that will bring us together
If it's not love
Then it's the bomb
And then it's the bomb that will bring us together

So ask me, ask me, ask me
Ask me, ask me, ask me
Oh
Na na na, na na
Na na na, na na
Na na na, na naEmbed
