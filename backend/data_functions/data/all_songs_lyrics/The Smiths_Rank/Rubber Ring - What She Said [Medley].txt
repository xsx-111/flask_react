Rubber Ring / What She Said  LyricsRubber Ring
Yeah
What She Said

What she says
"How come someone hasn't noticed that I'm dead
And decided to bury me? God knows, I'm ready"
La-la-di-da-da-da

What she said was sad
But then, all the rejection she's had
To pretend to be happy could only be idiocy
La-la-di-da-da-da

What she said was not for the job or
Lover that she never had
No, no, no, no, no

What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really, really open her eyes
What she read
All heady books she'd sit and prophesise
It took a tattooed boy from Birkenhead
To really, really open her eyes

What she said
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something"

What she said
"I smoke because I'm hoping for an early death
And I need to cling to something"
No, no, no, no, no
