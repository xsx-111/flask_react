Bigmouth Strikes Again (Rank) Lyrics
Sweetness, sweetness I was only joking when I said
I'd like to smash every tooth in your head
Oh-oh, sweetness, sweetness, I was only joking when I said
By rights you should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to her Roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt
Oh

Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh-oh)
Bigmouth lo-da-da-haha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt
Eh
Oh, Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh)

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt, oh
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Oh, Bigmouth la-da-da-dada, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Bigmouth oh-ho-ho, ha ha, Bigmouth la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Oh, Bigmouth
Goodbye and thank you
GoodbyeEmbed
