The Queen Is Dead (Rank) LyricsHello !
Farewell to these marshes
Hemmed in like a boar between arches
Her very lowness with a head in a sling
I'm truly sorry - it sounds like a wonderful thing
I said charles, don't you ever craze
To appear on the front of the daily mail
Blessed in your mother's bridal veil ?
Oh ...
And so, i checked all the registered historical facts
I was shocked into shame to discover
I am the 18th pale descendant
Of some old queen or other
Oh, has the world changed, or have i changed ?
Oh has the world changed, or have i changed ?
Some 9-year old tough who peddles drugs
I swear to god
I never even knew what drugs were
So, i broke into the palace
With a sponge and a rusty spanner
She said : "i know you, and you cannot sing"
I said : "that's nothing - you should hear me play piano"
We can go for a walk where it's quiet and dry
And talk about precious things
But when you're tied to your mother's apron
No-one talk about ...
Past the pub who breaks your body
And the church who'll snatch your money
The queen is dead, boys
And it's so lonely on a limb
Past the pub who wrecks your body
And the church - all they want is your money
The queen is dead, boys
You can trust me, boys
Life is very long, when you're lonely
Life is very long, when you're lonelyEmbed
