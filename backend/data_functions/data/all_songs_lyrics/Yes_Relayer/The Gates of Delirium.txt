The Gates of Delirium LyricsStand and fight, we do consider
Reminded of an inner pact between us, that's seen as we go
And ride there, in motion
To fields in debts of honour, defending
Stand the marchers soaring talons
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom, fighting we know
Destroy oppression, the point to reaction
As leaders look to you, attacking
Choose and renounce, throwing chains to the floor
Kill or be killing, faster sins correct the flow
Casting giant shadows off fast penetrating force
To alter via the war that's seen, as friction spans the spirits wrath ascending to redeem
Wars that shout in screams of anguish
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver, surely we know
In glory we rise to offer
Create our freedom, a word we utter
A word
Words cause our banner, victorious our day
Will silence be promised as violence displays
The curse increased, we fight the power and live by it by day
Our gods awake in thunderous roars and guide the Leader's hand in paths of glory to the cause
Listen, should we fight forever
Knowing as we do know, fear destroys
Listen, should we leave our children
Listen, our lives stare in silence
Help us now
Listen, your friends have been broken
They tell us of your poison, now we know
Kill them, give them as they give us
Slay them, burn their children's laughter
On to hell
The fist will run, grasp metal to gun
The spirit sings in crashing tones, we gain the battle drum
Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn
The pen won't stay the demon's wings
The hour approaches, pounding out the Devil's sermon
Soon, oh soon the light
Pass within and soothe this endless night
And wait here for you
Our reason to be here
Soon, oh soon the time
All we move to gain will reach and calm
Our heart is open
Our reason to be here
Long ago, set into rhyme
Soon, oh soon the light
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right
The sun will lead us
Our reason to be here
Soon, oh soon the light
Ours to shape for all time, ours the right
The sun will lead us
Our reason to be here5Embed
