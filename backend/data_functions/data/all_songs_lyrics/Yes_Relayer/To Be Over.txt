To Be Over LyricsWe go sailing down the calming streams
Drifting endlessly by the bridge
To be over, we will see, to be over
Do not suffer through the game of chance that plays
Always doors to lock away your dreams
Think it over, time will heal your fear, think it over
Balance the thoughts that release within you
Childlike soul dreamer
One journey, one to seek and see in every light
Do open true pathways away
Carrying closer
Go gently, holding doors will open every way
You wander true pathways away
After all your soul will still surrender
After all don't doubt your part
Be ready to be loved
New som du lay
Sah du rah
Sah du lay
Tu sah rah
Du sah dulay
Sah du rah
Tey tu santeh1Embed
