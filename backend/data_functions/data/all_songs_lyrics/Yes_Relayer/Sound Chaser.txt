Sound Chaser LyricsFaster moments spent spread tales of change within the sound
Counting form through rhythm electric freedom
Moves to counter-balance stars expound our conscience
All to know and see the look in your eyes
Passing time will reach as nature relays to set the scene
New encounters spark a true fruition
Guiding lines we touch them, our bodies balance out the waves
As we accelerate our days to the look in your eyes
From the moment I reached out to hold, I felt a sound
And what touches our soul slowly moves as touch rebounds
And to know that tempo will continue
Lost in the trance of dances as rhythm takes another turn
As is my want, I only reach to look in your eyes
