KV Crimes Lyrics
I should have known
My heart has overgrown
"Do you risk it exploding all over?"
Well you better get a load of this one
With a load on
The time has come
And I believe I've come too
For to tell you
But something's always in the way

All right, what now?
That's fine, I think I'm ready
To claim what's mine
Rightfully, yeah

Crestfallen
Dejected with the East coast crutch
Day dreaming through the dark days
Club mate on holiday
With the Moon Duo
Space partners

All right, what now?
That's fine, I think I'm ready
To claim what's mine
Rightfully, yeah
The time has come
And i think i came too
Bleeding, bleeding
Ever so slightly, yeah

I could have called this
Saw it a mile away
"Baby, stay."Embed
