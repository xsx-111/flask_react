Snowflakes Are Dancing Lyrics
Bought a ticket from a tin man, he was my main man
He told me something, he told me everything
Through my dark day, he led the way
Again I stray away, again I stay

There is but one true love, within my heart
There is but one man, that I am
When I'm away out there, I wanna go home
When I am home, my head stays out there

Snowflakes are dancing, discman is pumping
Headphones are loud, chilling on a pillowy cloud
Comfort of codeine, and Springsteen pristine
You should sing just whatever
Ooh Ooh OohEmbed
