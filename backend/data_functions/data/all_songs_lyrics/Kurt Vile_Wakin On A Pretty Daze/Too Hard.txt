Too Hard LyricsTake your time
So they say and that's probably
The best way to be, but what about
Those who are fathers and
What about their daughters?
I will promise to do my very best
To do my duty
For God and my country
Hey but I'm just human after all
I will promise not to smoke too much and
I will promise not to party
Too hard... too hard... too hard...
(it's too hard)
Did you ever bang on a xylophone
That took you everywhere from home?
Well I did... Well I've tried...
Life is like a ball of beauty that
Makes you wanna just cry, then you die
I will promise to go outta my way
To do the right thing from now on
(Believe me, baby.)
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta take hold of the hand
That ain't his but it is
Take your time, so they say, and that's
Gotta be the best way, but what about
Those who are fathers and
What about the others?
I know that you don't know a stranger
But I'm no stranger than the rest
And I'm no stranger to you
Take your time they say it's all around
And I think I'd say I know
Just where that I am bound
There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta hold tight
To the heart of the matter at hand
So take your time, baby girl
Cause that's, that's the best of all
(One day you'll believe me, baby...)
I will promise to do my very best
To do my very best for you
And that won't be
Too hard... too hard... too hard...
Too hard...Embed
