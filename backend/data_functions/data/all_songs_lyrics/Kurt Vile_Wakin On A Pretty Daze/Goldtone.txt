Goldtone LyricsSometimes when I get in my zone, you'd think I was stoned
But I never as they say, touched the stuff
I might be adrift, but I'm still alert
Concentrate my hurt into a gold tone
Golden tones
In the night when all hibernate, I stay awake
Searching the deep, dark, depths of my soul tone
Golden tones
Gold tones
There's a place in my heart for all of my friends
Some have stepped out but some check back in
Been livin' my life on the run, from day one
Every day is "hey, so are they"
But if I been lookin' back today
Looking back in gold tones
Yeah, yeah
In the night when all hibernate, I stay awake
Searching the deep, dark, depths of my soul tone
Golden tones
Yeah, yeah
I been all around, been up and down
This round world that is always turning
Til some day or so they say
When a-hey, hey, I wanna hear a gold tone
Sometimes as I'm floating away I wish I could stay
Then I arrive among the dropping flies
There's a place in my heart, been trying to locate
It's somewhere within and it's for all them with its gold tones
Yeah, yeah
In the night when all hibernate, I stay awake
Searching the deep, dark depths of my soul tone
Golden tones
Sometimes when I get in my zone, you'd think I was stoned
But I never as they say, touched the stuff
I might be adrift, but I'm still alert
Concentrate my hurt into a gold tone
Yeah, yeah1Embed
