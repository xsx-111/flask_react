Never Run Away Lyrics
You wedded on my day, you wedded on
You wedded on my day
Each morning we marry it's just the most gorgeous of days
I know you'll never run away

You met a young man who was a wild child
Who harmonized his keys in his droning mind
Saxophones sing from inside his head crying

I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away

I'm living all the time thanks cause you're mine
You turn my dying days away
Each day we carry on like believers and lovers
Though there are others who would rather run away

Ay ay ay, ay ay ay now
If you wanna hear me sing press play
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay man
Pay ay ay close attention
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away

I'm holding you all night through to the dawn
You turn my dying days away
My steady diet of high on love
Then taking dope to cope, better come down sometime

Ay ay ay, ay ay ay now
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay man
Pay ay ay close attention
Ay ay ay, ay ay ay now

I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
I know you'll never run away
You wedded on my day, you wedded on
You wedded on my day
Each morning we marry it's just the most gorgeous of days
I know you'll never run away1Embed
