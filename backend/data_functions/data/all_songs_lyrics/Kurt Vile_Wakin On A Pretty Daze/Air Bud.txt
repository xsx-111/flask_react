Air Bud LyricsStrange, strange days inside
My mind is daily changing
And it's charged by
The shifting tones of time flying
Just in case you were wondering where I
Was
Was
Strange
Strange, strange days inside
My mind is daily changing
As result of the black cloud coming down
Just in case you were watching the
Horizon
Horizon
Horizon
(We want out and we want it now)
(We wanna take it outta town)
(We want out and we want it now)
(We wanna take it outta town)
