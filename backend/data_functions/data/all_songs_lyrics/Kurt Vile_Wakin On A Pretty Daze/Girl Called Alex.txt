Girl Called Alex Lyrics
In the dawn's early light
I recall a girl named Alex
She and Mark, they were happily wed
Hey, at least in my head

I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time

I wanna live all the time
In my fantasy infinity
There I will never be abandoned
There I'll ever handle against everything from ever happening to them

And they hate it when I say
I wanna

I wanna walk out into the night
Without it being running away
From a bad day in my brain
For the sake of a strip that I could be cruising
In the comfort of a sportscar illusion
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
They hate it when I say
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the time
I think about them all the timeEmbed
