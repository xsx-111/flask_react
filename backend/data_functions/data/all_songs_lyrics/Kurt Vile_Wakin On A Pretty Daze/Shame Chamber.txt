Shame Chamber Lyrics
Everyone's saying I should probably give up
And hey, I wouldn't wanna waste no time
How can I even look myself in the mirror
Then again, why would I?

It's just another day in the shame chamber
Living life to the lowest power
Feeling bad in the best way a man can

Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
Oh, baby when you cry, it brings a tear to my eye
Oh, shame on us

Chubby in the face in a world of muck and slime
Time for the comedown
How can I even look myself in the mirror?
Then again I guess I think I...

Wouldn't really mind in the shame chamber
Living life to the lowest power
Feeling bad in the best way a man can
Yeah, it's just another day in the shame chamber
Living life to the lowest power
Feeling bad in the best way a man can

Shame on you, shame on you
Shame on you
Oh, baby when you cry, it brings a tear to my eye
Oh, shame on us1Embed
