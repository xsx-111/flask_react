Was All Talk Lyrics
Spirit in the sky
Transparent to the eye
Talking trash on nothing the human eye can see anyway
And that's anarchy for you and me
When all this work is out of mind
There was a time in my life when they thought I was all talk
Now I'm feeling stalked by God walking
I got the upper hand
Walking

Now take a look at my hands
Watch me go
Watch me going, yeah I'm going, yeah I'm gone
Freak in the fog
Through the dew in the dawn
All the words I'm saying are wrong, now won't you watch me?
And yet there was a time in my life when they thought I was all talk
Left-handed smoke shifting
From a right-handed man
Can you sense the snag in my playing?
Spirit in the ether
From a right-wing sister
Safe to say she don't get out that much
There was a time in my life that is gone that I sometimes still go back to
Not to be all stalking myself too much
Well I got the upper hand, here, in present days

Now take a look at my hands
Watch them go
Watch me going, yeah I'm going, yeah I'm gone
Freak in the fog
In the sea of the storm
Making music is easy, watch me
And yet there was a time in my life when they thought I was all1Embed
