Pure Pain Lyrics
Well I want to be with you
(when can I?)
I don't know, well I'm workin
Babe, but I want you, too, there
But I want to be around
And I want you around, deep down
Imbedded in my brain
Inbedded in my-wow
What pure pain

All of the roads that I travel down
Get lost and then found again
All bring me back to my baby
Yeah, that's what you are
Every time that I look out my window
All of my thoughts they go travelin
Out where the coldest of winds blow
Only to drift back to you, girl
Yeah, that's what you are
Yeah, that's what you are

And I want to be with you (when can I?)
I don't know, when I'm working, babe, I want/wish you were here
Cause I want to be around
And I want you around
Deep down I'm breaking down
Wow, it's the purest of pure pain
Every time that I look out my window
All my emotions they are spreading
Zip through winding highways in my head
Pick up momentum then I'm coasting
Only to turn around abrupt
Come back for my love
Yeah, that's what you are
Yeah, that's what you are1Embed
