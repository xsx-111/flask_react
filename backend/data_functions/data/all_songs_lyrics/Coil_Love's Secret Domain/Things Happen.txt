Things Happen Lyrics
Kill the creator! Send them the bomb!
Kill the creator! Send them the bomb!

Daddy, do you have a cigarette for me? I think
Maybe it's getting late, maybe time is running out
You know, I knew somebody once, rifled through his drawers
I wasn't that suspicious but you know, these things they happen
But, muñeca, do you have a towel?
See those people gather round
Baby do you have a light?
What's it like in Ohio... baby?
What d'you want to call me, muñeca?
Honey, do you like my dress?
You know, I think the colour pink suits my complexion
Or is it a reflection of the sky outside, you know
Why are those people crowding around?
You know I think your time is running out
What was your name, anyway?
No lipstick on his collar, but maybe it was blood
I don't know to this day, dear
Do you have another, uh...
Did you light that cigarette for me?
Oh, did you leave that on the side?
Do you have another cigarette for me? You know, uh
Well, I had somebody once, ah
You know, we used to cook a lot
It was a...
Do you like chillis in Ohio?
Muñeca, yo te quiero
Yo te quiero Ohio
Anyway... muy bonito
Where did I leave my matches?
I thought they were on the table there
By the way, did you, uh...?
Do you have some, uh, cash for me
Because you know I have to, uh, get a cab somewhere, after here
You know, I don't want to push you, but, uh
You know, I've got to go some place
There's something burning in the kitchen
Did I put the pepper in?
I don't... uh... oh, dear
You know you have to watch yourself, don't you?
Why are those people crowding round me in the street
It must be like that for you a little bit, huh?
It's a bit of a commotion
Nice meeting you
I have no regrets, but I did feel a little bad, you know?
It's kind of like, you know what it's likeEmbed
