Teenage Lightning 1 LyricsDon't be alarmed
It will not harm you
It's only lightning
Teenage lightning
It's real
Unbelievably real
Teenage lightning
Don't be frightened
This is the way we do it
This is the way we do it
Don't be alarmed
It will not harm you
It's only me pursuing
Something I'm not sure of
It's only lightning
Teenage lightning
Don't be alarmed
You can't be harmed
Teenage lightning
It's real?
Can you steal
Teenage lightning?
It is the lightning's
Deep, dark loveEmbed
