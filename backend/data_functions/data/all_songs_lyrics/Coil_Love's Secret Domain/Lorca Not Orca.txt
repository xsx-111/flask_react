Lorca Not Orca LyricsDon't be alarmed
It will not harm you
It's only lightning
Teenage lightning
Don't be alarmed
It will not harm you
It's only lightning
Teenage lightning
It's real, unbelievably real
Teenage lightning
Don't be frightened
It's only lightning
Teenage lightning
Teenage lightning
Teenage lightning
Don't be frightenedEmbed
