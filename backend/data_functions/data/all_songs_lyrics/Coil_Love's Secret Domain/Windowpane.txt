Windowpane Lyrics
In the sky and in the eye and
In the sky and in the eye and
If you want to touch the sky
Just put a window in your eye

See the sun and see the rain
See the window, see the pain
See the sun and see the rain
See the birds eye, see the brain
Ancient cities rise again

See microscopic, see world view
See the future leaking through
See the person who once was you
See the seashore and see the sand
See the windows in your hand
See the Lie

Gold is the sky in concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power surge, power will rise
Through the windows and through the skies
Misrule is kind
See the sky and see the eye and see the sky and
In your hand in the sky, and in your eye
See the sky in your hand
See the sky and understand

Gold is the sky in concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power will rise, power will fly
Through the window through your eye
Gold is the sky

Riches, treasures, riches
Riches, treasures
Riches, treasures, riches

Gold is the sky in concentrate
Power in its purest state
Power will rise, power will fly
Through the window and through your eye
Gold is the sky1Embed
