The Leaving Song Lyrics
Walked away, heard them say
"Poisoned hearts will never change," walked away again
Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face, cooling from within

Hard to notice gleaming from the sky
When you're staring at the cracks
Hard to notice what is passing by with eyes lowered
You walked away, heard them say
"Poisoned hearts will never change," walked away again

All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me
All the cracks, they lead right to me
And all the cracks will crawl right through me, and I fell apart

As I walked away, heard them say
"Poisoned hearts will never change," walked away again
Turned away in disgrace
Felt the chill upon my face, cooling from within2Embed
