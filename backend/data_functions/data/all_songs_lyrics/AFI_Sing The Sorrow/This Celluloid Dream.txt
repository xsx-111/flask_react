This Celluloid Dream Lyrics
Calling tears from deep inside, oh, you're so exquisite
And in the mirror, all midnight eyes
Oh, if I could remain, but it's just a visit
All midnight eyes, read "vacancy"
Twisted, twisting

To the lovely dancing lights, I begged, "May I cut in?"
But they never stopped playing their song
Of a joyous song they sing, I've heard whispers
On a freezing note, I resonate

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt
In the glitter, in the dark, sunk into velvet
Praying this will never end
In the shadow of a star, in static pallor
I realized I never began

Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Just like a memory, it twists me
Just like romantic verses, just like a joyous end
Twist, twisting me

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt

All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
All the colors, upon leaving, all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey
(All grey) all the colors (all grey) upon leaving
(All grey) all will turn to grey, grey
Twisting me
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
On to the melting boy, and melt away
You light as gently, you're so cinematic
Bathed in your radiance

You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
You land as lightly as the new snow, and melt away
You land as lightly as the new snow, cinematic
Bathed in your radiance, I melt1Embed
