Helium Head (I Got a Love) Lyrics

Oh, I've got a love, I need a body
Got you know I'm gonna get somebody
I got a love, I need a body
I got you know I'm gon' get anybody
I got the love, you got the body
Thanks for serve, I don't need no body, yeah


Ah, I got a love, I need a body
Got you know I'm gonna get somebody
I got a love, I need a body
I got you know I'm gon' get anybody
I got the love, you got the body
Thanks for serve, I don't need no body, yeah
