I Got a Woman Lyrics
I've got a woman, I've got you
You make me feel love, and I do
I got a woman, I got you
Making loving, just like you

You give me your love
You don't try to hide it
A started new love
You know I'm gonna run

I've got a woman, I've got you
You are a being one, I am too

Deep in your eyes, the fever of love
Ooh, you're a woman
Met through the son of the wings of our love
Ooh, you make love real


I've got a woman, I got you
You wake the changes, I go through
I got a woman, I got you
You're like a love swim, I go to
You love is run
And you are ready
I know you could get it to something at me

I got a woman, I've got you
One lives in me, babe, lives in you

Deep in your eyes, the fever of love
Ooh, you're a woman
Met through the son of the wings of our love
Ooh, you make love real


Ooh, I got a woman, I got you
One lives in me, babe, lives in you
I got a woman, I got youEmbed
