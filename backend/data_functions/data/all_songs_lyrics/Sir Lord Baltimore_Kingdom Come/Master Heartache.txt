Master Heartache Lyrics
Woman, you are the master heartache
Woman, you are the master heartache

I know what’s evil in the wake of a wicked wind
Thunder, lightning, caught me in the storm of sin

Woman, you are the master heartache
Woman, you are the master heartache

Lay me the dam of death and every cause of heartache
You leave me to the rain and left me in the sea of heartbreak

Woman, you are the master heartache

Feed me temptation and you put my love to shame
You come on like an angel, but the devil be thy name

Woman, you are the master heartache
Woman, you are the master heartache
Lay me the dam of death and every cause of heartache
You leave me to the rain and left me in the sea of heartbreak

Woman, you are the master heartache

I know what’s evil in the wake of a wicked wind
Thunder, lightning, caught me in the storm of sin

Woman, you are the master heartache
Woman, you are the master heartbreaker
Woman, you are the master heartache

Feed me temptation, you put my love to shame
You come on like an angel, but the devil be thy name

Woman, you are the master heartache
Woman, you are the master heartbreaker
Woman, you are the master heartacheEmbed
