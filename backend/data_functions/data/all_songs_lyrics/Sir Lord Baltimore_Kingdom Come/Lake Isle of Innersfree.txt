Lake Isle of Innersfree Lyrics
She was to me
As time is to eternity
We were so free
By Lake Isle of Innersfree
My wounds have bled
Was it something I left unsaid?
Where do I go?
Seems like aeons of years ago
When she lived for me

I see her face (I see her face)
Then it's gone without a trace
Now it's only me (It's only me)
By Lake Isle of Innersfree
Love spend too fast
I look into my future past
So be my fate
She has gone from me and still I wait
And endlessly

She was only seventeen
You might say in her prime
She said we'd do it all, my friend
We'd do it all in time
But now a stranger to myself
I think about it now and then
She was only seventeen
I but eight and ten
What's become of my, my life?
What's become of my life?
Each day I live, each day I die
What's become of my life?
Each day gone by I learn to live another lie
As time goes by
As time goes by
As time goes by
As time goes byEmbed
