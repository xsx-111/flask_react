Pumped Up Lyrics
You got me so pumped up
You really love me
You got me so pumped up
No feeling, alright
I treat you like a woman
Ooh, you treat me like a man
I caught you, fall in love
Now, baby, get on, I can never bring me on
Oh, never let you down
Got me so pumped up
Oh, look out!

Oh, wake me in the morning
Drive without a warning
"You know what I've got?"
You showed me hot to use that
You never wanna lose it
Never bring me on
Oh, don't you let down
You got me so pumped up
Oh, watch out!

Ah, you got me so pumped up
Woo, I'm feeling love, you got me so pumped up
No feeling, alright
I treat you like a woman
Ooh, you treat me like a man
I caught you, fall in love, baby
Oh, I can, now bring me on
Oh, shit, never got so pumped up
Look out!

Ah, you got me so pumped upEmbed
