Hell Hound Lyrics
I am being at home, calling
My love comes quick in the calling
Black cat at the window, crawling

Woman is a hella hound
You know she get me fever
Woman is a hella hound
You know I got the fever
Hound!
A hella hound

Woman met one man
He got being in dead heat
Now found dead
Leaving on the backstreet
I know she is born through the midnight

Woman is a hella hound
Ah, screaming like a wild child
Woman is a hella hound
Screaming like a wild child
A hella hound, ah, hound
A hella hound
Ah, yeah!


Ah, I am being at home, calling
My love comes quick into the calling
Black cat at the window, crawling
I know she's all about a calling

Hella hound
You know she get me fever
Woman is a hella hound
You know I got the fever
Hella hound!
Hella hound!

Well, look out, mama, she's a hella hound, yeahEmbed
