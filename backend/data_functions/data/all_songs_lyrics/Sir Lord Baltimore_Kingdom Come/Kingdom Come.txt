Kingdom Come Lyrics
I hear sirens calling me
I fell prey unto the wind
Sail on crimson majesty
Turn, turn, wheel of fortune, spin

Oh, come, my kingdom, come
And then I will be done

Tired voyage on the brink
Eyes want only for to sleep
Sinking thoughts I could not link
Fathomed raptures of the deep

Oh, come, my kingdom, come
And then I will be done
Come, my kingdom, come


Wake me, paradise untold
Giant phoenix be my wings
Roll on, chariots of gold
All rise, hail the king of kings
Oh, come, my kingdom, come
And then I will be done

Shining wizards bring the rain
Shooting arrows at the sun
Praise him, for that now he shall reign
Deaf ears, beat your silent drum

Oh, come, my kingdom, come
And then I will be done
Come, my kingdom, come

Virgin burned by midnight flame
I shall never know your name
I've known blinding war and pain
Say I, all that’s left’s been said

Oh, come, my kingdom, come
And then I will be done
Oh, come, my kingdom, come
And then I will be done
