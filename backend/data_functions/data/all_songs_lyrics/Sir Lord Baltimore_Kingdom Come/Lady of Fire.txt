Lady of Fire Lyrics
Fire!

Well, I couldn't sleep
When out on the streets
She asked me to try her
The lady of fire
She said that I should
I said that I would
She called me a liar
The lady of fire
Ah, fire!

She took me in
She taught me to sin
I thank the desire
For the lady of fire
I'll thank you or leave me
She didn't believe me
But I satisfy her
The lady of fire

She took me down
She showed me around
Locked into the wire
The lady of fire
Together we burned
You get what you earn
Now she's not for hire
She's my lady of fire, hahahaha!Embed
