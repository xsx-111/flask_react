Idiot Proverbs LyricsMy teachers at school had us eat from their spoons
And smiled when they said that we could be anything
Our dreams were obscene, we were gonna be astronauts
Gonna be presidents, live on the silver screen
And I didn't sink or swim, I just thrashed around the deep end of the pool that they threw us in
And now we're Gen Z, we're broke and depressed
We're lost in all heck, waiting to shine again
Waiting for our big break
Listening to idiot proverbs
Hoping that it won't change
But things don't work exactly that way
The rich become richer, the poor stay the same
The world is your oyster, the price is much pain
You spend most your time, pretending that you're okay
And if you don't bend, I bet it breaks you
You try with your mind, good luck, you still lose
You know you know better, for others it might be worse
Life is a blessing and sometimes it's a curse
You think you're special 'til your bubbles burst
Do you think that you're special?
There's no use complaining, as a matter of fact
You get what you get and don't get upset
When one door closes, there might not be a next
You might not be so happy, but try to be content
The world doesn't owe you, it's not your own fault
Your parents weren't perfect, your idols were false
And the years fly faster, and soon you lose count
There's never a time you'll ever work it all out
There's never a time you'll ever work it all out
There's never a time you'll ever work it all out
These are just my idiot proverbs
And these are just the things that I say
These are just my idiot proverbs
Sorry to disappoint, you're born and then you die
If you don't get cancer, you work until you're tired
It's the same damn rut, you're running out of time
If you're lucky, you can nap your last twenty years in styleEmbed
