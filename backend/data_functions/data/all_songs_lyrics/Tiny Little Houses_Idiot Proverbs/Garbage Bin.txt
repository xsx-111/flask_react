Garbage Bin Lyrics
I was born so clean
Like a new washing machine
Was flawless from my mother's womb
Wrapped up tight inside a sheet
Loved my days in kindergarten
I was happy in first grade
Okay in high school when it began to change
Fast forward now to college
Where I'm flunking out of class
And the student loans are starting to bite me in the ass
I don't want to go back home
I don't want to see my folks
Just gonna hold my breath
And maybe with some time I'll learn to float

I could keep swimming but I want to give in
I'm a garbage bin
I'm a garbage bin
I could keep swimming but I want to give in
I'm a garbage bin
Life’s a garbage bin

Move on up and down
Do a dance and turn around
If you've got yourself some pockets
You can fill them so you drown
I need a little bit of money and a little bit more time
I keep on losing my friends to suicide
And it don't get much better than this
I hate to break it, but, the longer that you try
The less likely that you will make it
I don't want to be alone
I don't want to die at home
A hippy monk told me there's comfort in being nothing at all
I could keep swimming but I want to give in
I'm a garbage bin
I'm a garbage bin
I could keep swimming but I want to give in
I'm a garbage bin
Life’s a garbage bin

Hey kid, pull up your socks if you’ve worn your bootstraps down
There’s still a lot of opportunity if you look around
But I'm running out of luck
I'm stuck earning 15 bucks
At least the government will feed me if I’m taken by the cops
I think I’m getting depressed
It’s always me against the world
I’m well aware I’m egocentric
And it’s going to hell
I don’t want to be a fake
I just want to catch a break
Don’t want to sell out but I sure would like a piece of that cake

I could keep swimming but I want to give in
I'm a garbage bin
I'm a garbage bin
I keep swimming but I want to give in
I'm a garbage bin
I’m a garbage bin2Embed
