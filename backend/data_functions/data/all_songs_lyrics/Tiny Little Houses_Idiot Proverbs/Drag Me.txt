Drag Me LyricsThe problem with me is:
I was always a big fish in a small, stale pond
Til I moved out to the city where I really got stung
I'm a young, lazy bum who feels 106
Sometimes I wonder on the down low why I even exist
Should I go tell it to a shrink?
I'm startin' to think
That maybe I'm the only sane one in a world on the brink
Can't relax, got my facts
A void before nihilist
It bothers me that I'm not bothered oh I really need...
A new attitude
I need to get out my room
Just want to play my guitar
But it hasn't gotten me far
I know it seems kinda sad
'cause things have gotten so bad
Does someone know who I am?
'cause I don't know who I am
Yeah maybe I'm the hypocrite
Walking contradiction, bursting out like a cyst
I'm reading Tolstoy at the moment craving ascetic bliss
I quit my job and drive my friends to clubs to down one more drink
I try to fit in but the people here are making me sick
Hey surely I can't be alone
Please, someone hold the phone
I see atrocities on T.V but I'm still too scared to go
And put my neck on the line, oh
Where's my spine, oh?
I'm wastin' my time and I'd love it if you gave me a sign
Get outta my room
I've got a bad attitude
Just wanna play my guitar but it hasn't gotten me far
I wish to taste the success
Maybe I'd feel less depressed
Sometimes I'm my biggest fan, sometimes I wanna give in
Could everyone get off my back
Cut me some slack
I took my shirt off in the yard, my shoulders were no longer golden
Had a panic attack
I'm still my worst enemy
It's not as bad as it seems
If you wanna come and stick a boot in, roll up, drag me
Outta my room
I need a good attitude
Don't wanna play my guitar
'Cause it hasn't gotten me far
They say it pays in the end
But I'm still stuck in a spin
Sometimes I wanna grow up, sometimes I wanna give in
Who would have guessed I was a talented kid
Who would have thought Iâ€™d make a mess out of it (x2)6Embed
