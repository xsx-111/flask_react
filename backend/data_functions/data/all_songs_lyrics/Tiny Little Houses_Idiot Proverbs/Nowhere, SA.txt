Nowhere, SA LyricsTime moves slowly
Far too slow to observe it
They should get some scientists down here just to prove it
Ladies in the salons with their magazines
Couple fashion tips from 2003
I dreamed too big, should have been an apprentice
It's not like a life stacking shelves at a Spend-Less
Gotta get out
Gotta get outta this town
Gotta get out
Kicked me in the teeth
Didn't even have a chance
Got into a fight at the homecoming dance
It's the last straw it's always them verse me
All these stupid jerks on the football team
Took a walk back wiped the blood on my shirt sleeve
Tapped upon your window but you told me to leave
Heard your dad screaming as I climbed back down
What the hell do I do now?
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
I was optimistic when I got home to my place
Grabbed a few things shoved them all in my suitcase
Keys in my hand, a big idea in my head
Felt my problems drifting at a hundred and ten
Kicked it up a gear
Crashed my car in a light post
There goes my summer's pay, there goes all my hope
There's moments which define you, and those you forgot
I remember shaking like a leaf from the shock
Spent about an hour in the front of a motel
Filing a police report, cop said to keep still
Had a once over by the medical team
They said I was lucky but I wasn't relieved
Took a ride home in the back of a white van
Watched out the window at the smoke in a daydream
I could almost see the lights from interstate
Couldn't hold the tears as they faded away
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
God I kid myself thinking this could be my year
Maybe I've been fated to spend all of my life here
Maybe I'll just lose it like they all lose the plot
When I kick the bucket bury me here to rot
Should I join the kids, block it out with a bright pill
Standing round drinking from a bottle of NyQuil
I gotta get out
Gotta get out of this town
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta here
I gotta get out
I gotta get out
I gotta get outta hereEmbed
