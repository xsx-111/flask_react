The Void LyricsI have sat in the same shirt for days
Trying to sweat your smell away
But your perfume’s leached into my walls
It's haunting me but I can't let go
Consciousness I'll bear torn back and bare
With the lonely voice in my head
It’s a place where I can hold my love
She can't be taken but it's not enough
Felt it from the start
I slip right through your arms and you pulled me in
I really fell down though your void
I never really had control you pulled me in
But you don’t care
You don’t know that I hardly go outside
I hardly ever sleep at night
I miss your voice
You don’t care
You won't know that I had died
You don’t care
You don’t know that I hardly go outside
I hardly ever sleep at night I’m so alone
You don’t care
You don’t know that the knives upon my skin are clothes
I close my eyes and I begin to enter the voidEmbed
