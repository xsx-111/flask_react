Everyone Is LyricsYour friends all smoke in the park
They lay and stare at the stars
I should start dressing like them
Maybe you'll notice me then
I do whatever she pleads
Visit the cemetery
She's in a skirt but it's cold
It doesn't bother her so
The choker on her neck shows
Walking through the streets
I'll confess I'm obsessed
Yes she thinks that I'm a geek
And I guess for my sake that I better move on quick
I'm depressed
That's the rest
Still thinks I'm full of it
We're off on 
I'm stuck here playing the garage
We'll never work it's a shame
I'll try my luck with Elaine
This is so unfair
And your clique makes me sick
'Cause it feels like I'm not there
And I guess I'll change my style my music
Comb my hair
And it's clear that Sophia's just way too cool again
It appears that Sophia's just way too cool again
It appears that Sophia's just way too cool again
And I don't have the guts yeah
Just let me sit and take it
I don't have the guts yeah
So I'll just sit and take it
I'm fried
Too tired
Can't speak
I'm weak
I'm a joke
I'm a loser
I'm a freak
And although I wish that I had someone
It can't be
It's so dumb
Everyone's just way too good for me
It is dumb
Everyone is just way too good for me
Yeah it's dumb
Everyone is just way too good for me
And I don't have the guts yeah
Just let me sit and take it
I don't have the guts yeah
Just let me sit and take itEmbed
