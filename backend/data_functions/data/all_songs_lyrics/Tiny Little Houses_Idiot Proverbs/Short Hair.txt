Short Hair Lyrics
Hey, look at me at her party
It's getting late and yet I'm still looking neat
Fly on the wall, crushed in the hall
Drink in my hand, invisible
Head starts to swim, she keeps looking again
Walking to her, when I knocked into him
Here comes the shove, now I'm told to buzz off
"Why are you here, kid, looking so lost?"

I like to let my short hair down
I like to wear my glasses round
I'm my own man, please understand
I like to let my short hair down

Do you like books, indie music with hooks?
Posters on walls and poser looks?
Can I assume you'll come see my room
We could take off, go get some food
I'm in a band, Al says we stink and we're bland
If you knew who I was, maybe you'd be a fan
We're just not into football, sports ain't my thing
I'm sorry I said "You could do better than him"
Ah, I like to let my short hair down
I like to wear my shirts tucked in sound
Do I seem lame? Let me explain:
I like to let my short hair down

I don't do drugs, but man, this beer got me tough
Went and changed the cassette, 'cause what they're playing here sucks
The party went dead, your boyfriend screamed as he said
"Pull that again and I'll kick in your head!"

I like to let my short hair down
I like to play my music loud
You think I'm square, but be aware
I like to let my short hair
I like to let my short hair
I'm gonna let my short hair down...4Embed
