Caroline LyricsWe were always in the wrong place
Never found the right time or the words to say
Sitting in your car I never felt so far away
I know we need to get our facts straight
It's been a year too long, I doubt that I can wait
Truth is I'm in far too deep to really walk again
Caroline why don't you make up your mind?
Girl I'm not the one who said I needed some time
Oh should I pull the trigger pull the plug on myself?
Oh tell me do you really think it's good for my health?
When you kissed me the other night
We'd had a little to much to drink you said it felt right
And ever since you could cut the tension with a knife
I can hear it in your sighs now
I can see it in your eyes
The battle is lost
Everyone told me your affection would come at a cost
Caroline why don't you make up your mind?
Girl I'm not the one who said I needed some time
Should I pull the trigger pull the plug on myself?
Oh tell me do you really think it's good for my health?
Caroline why don't you make up your mind?
Girl I never thought you'd ever be so unkind
Caroline why don't you make up your mind?
Girl you've gotta tell me am I wasting my damn timeEmbed
