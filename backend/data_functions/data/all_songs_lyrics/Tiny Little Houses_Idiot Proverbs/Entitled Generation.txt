Entitled Generation Lyrics
I'm 25 and still not living out of home
Got two degrees and I'm stuck working on the phones
Oh, damn our entitled generation
Damn our entitled generation
I hear inflation keeps on going through the roof
But baby boomers got two condos left to spruce
So, damn our entitled generation
Damn our entitled generation

The living wage is slipping, but the budget's spent
I'm firing words; don't worry, there's no ill intent
I can't keep sitting here, but like Mark Twain once said:
'Don't vote for politicians; it only encourages them'

These worried kids you made, you made us who we are
Age of participation trophies and gold stars
Damn our entitled generation
Damn our entitled generation
Dosed up on Ritalin, so we could hardly speak
Our folks would fight over who had us for that week
Oh, damn our entitled generation
Damn our entitled generation
The moral code is slipping, in our own defence
They killed off romance when they birthed the Internet
It feels this legacy is one unholy mess
There's an old saying that goes, 'What you plant is what you get'

Damn our entitled generation
Damn our entitled generation

The telly told us who to be with plastic gloss
Suburban dreams are down the drain, the market's shot
I can't explain how bad it feels to be so lost
At least with medicine, life expectancy has now gone up2Embed
