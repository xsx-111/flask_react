Team Player LyricsI'm a real team player when I wanna score
I'm a real cool guy when I act like I'm bored
I'm an I'm an elegant bum
A loaf-ish gentleman's son
I'm a dropout
Such a copout
Someone tell me 'Am I on?'
It's ironic don't you think?
The more I swim the more I tend to sink
I ran up to take a leap
Tripped up on my shoelace in the street
And everybody around me's going off
They're all married and in love
(When are you going to find someone?)
When I'm good and ready mum
Gee you've got me feeling dumb
But make no mistake I'm not a fool
Just another cynical pseudointellectual
There's not much more than meets the eyes
But having said all that
You know I can still surprise
'Cause I'm a real team player when I wanna score
I'm one real cool guy when I act like I'm bored
I'm a I'm a sucker for fun
The lazy prodigal son
I'm a dropout
Such a copout
Need a kick up the bum
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a real team player
Hey you're hot until you're not
They all remember you until one day they forgot
Call me a prophet
But the iron will stay hot
Boys you really gotta give it a shot ('really? OK')
But don't you know the industry is fake
It's full of sycophantic phonies with less money than brains
They're always on display
I'm feeling better today
I want to eat takeaway
But I still haven't got paid
So I hear I need a record out
There's no more chords I know to play
There's nothing left I have to say
But nothing more I want to say
But I'm a real team player when I wanna score
I'm a real cool guy when I act like I'm bored
I'm a flat foot on the run
A second favourite son
I'm a dropout
Such a copout
Someone lock up the gun
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a real team player ooh
I'm a creme brulee-er ooh
And a blind soothsayer ooh
Mr. Rent re-payer ooh
Ego self-inflater (a successful failure)
I'm a real team player (I'm my own caretaker)
I'm a real team player
I'm a real team player
See ya later alligator oohEmbed
