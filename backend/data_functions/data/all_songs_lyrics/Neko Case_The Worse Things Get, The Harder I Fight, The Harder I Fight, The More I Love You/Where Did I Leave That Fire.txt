Where Did I Leave That Fire LyricsA chill ran through me
And I grabbed on tight
That was when I left my body for good
And I shook off all the strength I'd earned
I wanted so badly not to be me
I wanted so badly not to be me
I saw my shadow looking lost
Checking its pockets for some lost receipt
Where did I leave that fire?
Where did I leave that fire?
Will a stranger find it on a curb, idling?
Cold call from the time zone just short of outer space?
Six o'clock tomorrow, a strange voice says to me
I do believe we have your fire, lady
You can pick it up if you come down with ID
You can pick it up if you come down with IDEmbed
