Man LyricsI'm a man
That's what you raised me to be
I'm not an identity crisis
This was planned
I'm a man
As in a citizen of mankind
It's what kind of animal I am
It's that simple, oh
I'm a man
And not just casually
I pull this barge full-time
The tree house cannot support me
I'm not the runt of the litter
The fat-finger bullies were no match for me
I still taste them in my teeth
I'm a man
I'm a man's man, I've always been
Make no mistake, what I've invested in
A woman's heart is the watermark
Of which I measure everything
I'm a man
That's what you raised me to be
I'm not your identity crisis
This was planned
I'm a man
You'll have to deal with me
My proxy is mine
You'll deal with me directly
And if I'm dipshit drunk on pink perfume
Then I am the man in the fucking moon
'Cause you didn't know what a man was
Until I showed you6Embed
