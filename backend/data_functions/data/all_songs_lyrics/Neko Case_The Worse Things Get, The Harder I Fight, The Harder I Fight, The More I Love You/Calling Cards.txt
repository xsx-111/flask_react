Calling Cards LyricsI used a calling card at the pay phone
From the other coast
Just to tell you how good it was to hear you
In those songs you wrote
They made me think there was something coming
Really something worth waiting for
"Blah, blah, blah. Blah, blah, blah," they talk about
Oh, oh
Every dial tone, every truck stop, every heartbreak
I love you more
Looking like you just woke up from making songs
Shooting satellites that blew up the pay phones
Singing, "We'll all be together
Even when we're not together
With our arms around each other
With our faith still in each other"
I've got calling cards
