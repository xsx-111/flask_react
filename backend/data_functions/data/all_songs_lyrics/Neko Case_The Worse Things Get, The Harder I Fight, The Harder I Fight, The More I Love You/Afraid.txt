Afraid LyricsCease to know or to tell or to see
Or to be your own
Cease to know or to tell or to see
Or to be your own
Have someone else's will as your own
Have someone else's will as your own
You are beautiful and you are alone
You are beautiful and you are alone
Often the adolescent plague
Reward your grace
Often the adolescent plague
Reward your grace
Confuse your hunger
Capture the fake
Confuse your hunger
Capture the fake
Banish the faceless
Reward your grace
Banish the faceless
Reward your graceEmbed
