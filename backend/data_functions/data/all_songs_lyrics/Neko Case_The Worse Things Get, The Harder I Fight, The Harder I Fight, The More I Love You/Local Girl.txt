Local Girl LyricsI pass the light that the young people make
​How joyfully it's wasted
​I feel the weight of the needle's repeat and sigh
​Sang my weight in metric trash
​Trip the light in Saturn's embrace
​You'll give up for some local girl
​While our lights, our lights blot out her face
​
​All of you lie about someday
​(You know you do, all of you, shame on you, all of you lie)
​You're on a first-name basis
​All of you lie about someday
​(You know you do, all of you, shame on you, all of you lie)
​You're on a first-name basis
​
​God damn the time
​God damn the miles
​That take me away from you
​And change your face
​And change the way I love you
​And change the way I love you
​And change the way I loved you
​And change the way I loved youEmbed
