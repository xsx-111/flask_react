City Swans LyricsBaby, come out
I'll meet you in the street
At the place by the old fire station
We'll get something to eat, like we talked about
Baby, come down
It's been a while now
I've got so many things I could tell you
If my stubborn mouth doesn't let me down
And I can't look at you straight-on
You're made from something different than I know
I try to slip the marching clock
But centipedes invade my thoughts
Without free will, I heel and I go
I step onto that metal plate
Where it meets the dazzling sound of trains
And I beg those trains to run
'Cause I can't look at you straight-on
You're made from something different than I know
My eyes are on the sidewalk, it's gum holding your feet
I swear under my breath because I'm starving in your gravity
You're made from something different than I know
You linger just a little long
I see your gun is drawn with the safety on
You can walk me back to my hotel like it was home
And I smell those fools you made cordwood of
In petty dreams that leave me sleeping here in your arms
City swans
Our crook'd necks long
City swans
And I can't look at you straight-on
You're made from something different than I know
And it breaks my heart, just like the day
That I looked down and I realized
I'd been sailing so long, I'd become the shore
City swans
Our crook'd necks long
