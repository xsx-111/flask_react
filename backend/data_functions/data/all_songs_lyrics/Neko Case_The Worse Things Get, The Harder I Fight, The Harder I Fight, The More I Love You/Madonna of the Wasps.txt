Madonna of the Wasps LyricsIs this love?
Is this love?
Is this, is this, is this love?
Lost Madonna of the wasps
I wonder where we crossed
I wonder why she lost me
Lost Madonna of the wasps
She's dying in the frost
I wonder what she cost me
Is this love?
Lost Madonna of the swans
She waves a magic wand
And then she settles on me
Wise Madonna of the flies
I look into her eyes
And then she recognizes me
Is this love?
Is this love?
Lost Madonna of the wasps
I wonder where we crossed
I wonder why she lost me
Lost Madonna of the wasps
She's lying in the frost
I wonder what she cost me
Is this love?
Is this love?
Is this love?Embed
