Wild Creatures LyricsWhen you catch the light
You look like your mother
It crushes me some
Just right from the side
When you catch the light
There's a flash of wild creatures
Before the Stone Age of the preachers
And the husbands, and the wives
When you catch the light
The flood changes direction
And darkens the lens
That projects my disguise
As you fight along-side
You'll discover my weakness
I'm not fighting for your freedom
I am fighting to be wild
"Hey, little girl, would you like to be
The king's pet or the king?"
"I'd choose odorless and invisible
But otherwise I would choose the king
Even though it sounds the loneliest...
And my brother's hands would poison me."
"Hey, little girl, would you like to be
The king's pet or the king?"
"I'd choose odorless and invisible
But otherwise I would choose the king
Even though it sounds melodious...
There's no mother's hands to quiet me."Embed
