Going Down The Road Feeling Bad LyricsGoing down the road feeling bad
Honey babe Lord
Going down the road feeling bad
Honey babe Lord
Going down the road feeling bad
I don't want to be treated this way
Girl I love done turned her back on me
Honey babe Lord
Girl I love done turned her back on me
Honey babe Lord
Girl I love done turned her back on me
I don't want to be treated this way
Thought I heard a whistle blow
Honey babe Lord
Thought I heard a whistle blow
Thought I heard a whistle blow
Lord it blowed like it ain't gonna blow no moreEmbed
