Here old rattler here/sent for my fiddle sent for my bow LyricsHere here old rattler from the barn
Here rattler here here
Here here
Here rattler here here
Here rattler here here

Sent for my fiddle sent for my bow
She would come and i would go
I almost drove me crazy almost drove me crazy
Almost drove me crazy
Almost drovе me crazy

Georgia Buck is dead
Thе last word he said
Didn't want no shortnin’ in his bread
No shortnin' in his bread
Swimmin in his head
OhhhhhEmbed
