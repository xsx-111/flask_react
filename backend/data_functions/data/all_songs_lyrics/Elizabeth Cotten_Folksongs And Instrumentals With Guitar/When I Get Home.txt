When I Get Home LyricsI shall have a crown to wear when I get home
I shall lay my burdens down when I get home
Spar the robes of glory, I shall sing a story
The Lord who brought me when I get home
When I get home, when I get home
My sorrow will be over when I get home
When I get home, when I get home
My sorrow will be over when I get home
When I get home, when I get home
My sorrow will be over when I get home
When I get home, when I get home
My sorrow will be over when I get homeEmbed
