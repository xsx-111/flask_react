Carmen Lyrics
Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly
How charming she can be
Fooling everyone
Telling 'em she's having fun

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age
Lyin', I'm lyin"

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Carmen, Carmen
Staying up 'til morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly
How disarming you can be
Eatin' soft ice cream
Coney Island queen

She says, "You don't want to be like me
Lookin' for fun, gettin' high for free
I'm dyin', I'm dyin'"
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night and a star by day
It's tirin', tirin'"

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favors
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again

Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi

The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies
Bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shinin'
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Like lightning, whoa, whoa
White lightning
Darlin', darlin'
Doesn't have a problem
Lyin' to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf127Embed
