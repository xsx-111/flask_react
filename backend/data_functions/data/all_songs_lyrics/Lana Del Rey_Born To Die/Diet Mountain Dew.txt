Diet Mountain Dew Lyrics
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I been waitin' up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty?
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want you, I want you

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Baby stoppin' at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?

Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City (You're no good for me)
Can we hit it now, low-down and gritty? (Baby, you're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love forever? (You're no good for me)
Do you think we'll be in love? (But, baby, I want you, I want—)
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—
You're no good for me
Baby, you're no good for me
You're no good for me
But, baby, I want you, I want—88Embed
