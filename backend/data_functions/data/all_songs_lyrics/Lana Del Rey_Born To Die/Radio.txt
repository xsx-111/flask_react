Radio Lyrics
Not even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead

No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?

American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A. and it's paradise
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?

Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
I finally found you
(Oh, sing it to me)
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now? (Oh, sing it to me)

Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fuckin' dream I'm livin' in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
How do you like me now?102Embed
