Over the Wall Lyrics
The man at the back has a question
His tongue's involved with solutions
But the monkey on my back
Won't stop laughing

Over the wall
Hand in hand
Over the wall
Watch us fall

There's something to be said for you
And your hopes of higher ruling
But the slug on my neck
Won't stop chewing

Over the wall
Hand in hand
Over the wall
Watch us fall

I'm walking in the rain
To end this misery
I'm walking in the rain
To celebrate this misery
What's that you say?
Speak up, I can't hear you
What do you say?
I couldn't hear you
Over the wall
Hand in hand
Over the wall
Watch us fall

Out on the road
Coast to coast
Out on the road
Coast to coast

I'm over the wall
I'm over the wall
Come over the wall
Come over the wall

I can't sleep at night
How I wish you'd hold me tight
I can't sleep at night
Come on and hold me tight
I can't sleep at night
How I wish you'd hold me tight
Come on and hold me tight
I can't sleep at night
How I wish you'd hold me tight
Come on and hold me tight
Come on and hold me tight
I can't sleep at night
How I wish you'd hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
Hold me tight
To my logical limit
To the logical limit
To my logical limit
To the logical limitEmbed
