It Was a Pleasure Lyrics
Let's get through this shit
I know you'd like that too
The stuff that undermines
The best of me and you

It was a pleasure to meet you
You slapped me right on the back
Just a pleasure to meet you
You got it almost exact

Make no discussion now
Make no bad dreams now
Make no reason now
Make no excuses now

If I knock it all back
Just like you say I do
Would it confirm the suspect
That suspicion will do?

It was a pleasure to meet you
You slapped me right on the back
Just a pleasure to meet you
You got it almost exact
Make no discussion now (No discussion)
Make no illusion now (No illusion)
Make no delusion now (No delusions)
Make no excuses now (No excuses)

Make no discussion now (No discussion)
Make no illusion now (No illusion)
Make no delusion now (No delusions)
Make no excuses now (No excuses)

Let's get rid of this shit
I know you'd like that too
The stuff that undermines
The best of me and you
Failure to do so will result in the failure
Failure to do so will result in the failure1Embed
