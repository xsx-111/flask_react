No Dark Things Lyrics
My life picks
My hands clean
No head shaved
It's quite safe
Compromise discovery
It's just and it's only

I took the pill
All you missed
Construed all
The tactics
You must learn
To distinguish error
From your fate

They don't think it's funny
That he's beginning to accept the facts

To the middle of the floor
You walked over
In the middle of the wall
The picture still hanging
From the corner of my eye
You stick pins in
In the middle of the floor
I fell over
We have no dark things
Nothing to hide of that
Just some heads and a wish
Something to sing about
We have no dark things
Nothing to hide of that
Just some heads and a wish
Something to shout about
We have no dark things
Nothing to hide of that
Just some heads and a wish
Something to sing about

No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark things
No dark thingsEmbed
