All I Want Lyrics
I'd be bad to feel so bad
Waking up laughing, so rare
Up and down and down the stair
Set myself up in the chair

Said, all I love is all I love
All I want is all I want

If we make the same mistake
Who could we blame
When we make the same mistake?
Who will we blame?
Who will we blame?
What will we blame?

We blame all our love, all our love
All we want, all we want

I had a healthy discussion
I had a sleep in the chair
I laid my head on a cushion
Because it was there (So rare)
I had a flame in the dark (Up and down and down the stair)
It was around the stair
Set myself up in the chair
Said, all I love, all I love
All I want is all I want
All I love (You've got the hands)
Is all I love (To hold the key)
All I want (You've got the hands)
Is all I want (To hold the key)

If we make the same mistakes
Who could we blame
When we make the same mistake?
Who could we blame?
Who will we blame?
What could we blame?
When we make
The same mistake
Who will we blame?
Who will we blame?Embed
