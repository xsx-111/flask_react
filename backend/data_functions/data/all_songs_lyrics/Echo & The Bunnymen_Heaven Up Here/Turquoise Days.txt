Turquoise Days Lyrics
Just when the thought occurs, the panic will pass
And the smell of the fields never lasts
Put your faith in those crimson nights
Set sail in those turquoise days
You've got a problem, come on over
We've got a problem, come on over

It's not for glory, it's not for honour
Just something someone said
It's not for love, it's not for war
Just hands clasped together
It's not for living, it's not for hunger
Just lips locked tight
It's not rebellion, it's not suffering
It's just the way it is
And my pistol's packed
And my God goes with me
I feel easy
And I want it, and I need it
And I've got it
It's not for this, it's not for that
It's not any of it
Did you say knowledge?
Did you say prayer?
Did you say anything?
If not for good, if not for better
If not the way it is
Just when the thought occurs, the panic will pass
And the smell of the fields never lasts
We'll put our faith in those crimson nights
Set sail in those turquoise days
Place our faith in those crimson nights
Set sail in those turquoise days
You've got a problem, come on over
We've got a problem, come on over
Now I think I know just what to say
Now I think I know just what to say1Embed
