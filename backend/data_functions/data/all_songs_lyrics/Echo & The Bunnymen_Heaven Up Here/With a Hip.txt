With a Hip LyricsHalt
Nobody's allowed
Strictly verboten
Out, out, out, out
Bounds
Of course we know no bounds
Until, at least, and then
Trespass all the way down
We've got it
And I want some
I can handle it
And I want some
Relax
Feel the pleasure inside
Error in trial
Collide, collide
You won't listen
I don't expect you to
We've lost
And something's all we can do
With a hip, hip, hop and a flip, flap, flop
Gonna steal some bananas from the grocer's shop
With your head in the clouds and your trousers undone
Gonna shit on the carpet just like everyone
This is the one for the money
This is the one for the trees
This is the one called heaven
And this is the one for me
You've yet to discover
Discover the difference
The difference between
The moral and mortal
They've got it
And I have some
I couldn't handle it
But I have some
Hold it in the light and see right through it
For God's sake, make a decision
Take it for a walk and hold it, hold it
Pin it on the wall and fasten onto
Move to the back and oh yes, oh yes
Do what must be done and don't say maybe
This is the one for the money
This is the one for the trees
This is the one called heaven
And this is the one for meEmbed
