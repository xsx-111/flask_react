Heaven Up Here Lyrics
Oh, where are you now? I'm over here
We've got those empty pockets and we can't afford the beer
We're smoking holes and we've got only dreams
And we're so damn drunk, we can't see the stair

The Apple Cart upset my head's little brain
This little moon in the sky upset my head with a brain

I saw it, yippee, I did, I swear
Walking through the hallway, crawling up the stairs
Abebe-bebe-bebe-bebe-bebe Bikila
Given up on whiskey, taken up with tequila

I'm on my own in my blind alley
I turn myself around so it's swallowing me
Watch the guitar, watch the guitar


Groovy, groovy people
We're all groovy, groovy people
Groovy, groovy people
We're all groovy, groovy people
Groovy, groovy people
Groovy, groovy people
I wonder why what you'll say might collide
 ]
Me and the wall, we're okay, we're okay
F-F-Faustus, you've got nothing to fear
It may be Hell down there 'cause it's Heaven up here
I'd have given forever for a few good years
But too much of a muchness is too much, you hear?
The hammer on my chest was an abominable pain
The anvil on my belly was an abdominal strain
We've got the bottle
Go take the bottle
Go take a sipEmbed
