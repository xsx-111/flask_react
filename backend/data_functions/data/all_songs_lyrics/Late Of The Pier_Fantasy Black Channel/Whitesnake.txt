Whitesnake LyricsHey, we caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I feel alright
I said hey, we caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I feel alright
I said hey, hey, hey, I said hey, we caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I feel alright
Psyche
What an abomination
Innocence is such a crime
Hard working sound and vision
To bring you the beats in time
Hoping for stormy weather
Waiting for the proper time
When seven flies swarm together
To stitch eight, and save nine
And I realise full well
That my life ain't living hell
And I wrote the book too well

Hey, we caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I feel alright
I said hey, we caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I feel alright
I said hey, hey, hey, hey, I said hey, we caught another white snake tonight
Say something and I feel alright
Psyche
