The Enemy Are the Future LyricsThe enemy, the enemy, the enemy
The enemy are the future
The future
The enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy are the future
The enemy, the enemy, the enemy, the enemy are the future
The future
Easy life, is it an easy life?
Well, it's a easy life, is it an easy life?
No, it's a hard life
Easy life, is it an easy life?
Well, it's a easy life, no it's an easy life
No it's HARD
Too much hard work, not enough easy life
Never could slow down, I can't sleep at night
Mama used to tell me, got too much on my mind
Too much hard work, not enough easy life
Never could slow down, I can't sleep at night
Mama used to tell me, got too much on my mind
Too much hard work, not enough easy life
Never could slow down, not enough easy life
Sleep at night
Till you die
This life is worth more than you can give
And you only get one chance to live
Easy life, is it an easy life?
Well, it's an easy life, well, it's an easy life
Yes, it's an easy life, well, it's an easy life
Well, it's an easy life, yes, it's an easy life
This life is worth more than you can give
And you only get one chance to live
Well, it's a hard life, hard life
No, it's a hard life, is it a hard life?
No, it's an easy life, well it's an easy life?
Well, it's an easy life, yes it's an easy life
Is it a hard life? It's a hard life
Is it a hard life? It's a hard life
No, it's an easy life, oh, it's an easy life?
Oh shit, easy, oh shit1Embed
