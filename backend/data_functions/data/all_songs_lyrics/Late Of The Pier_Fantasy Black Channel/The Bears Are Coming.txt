The Bears Are Coming Lyrics"Snap away," she said, as she danced towards the moonlight
Run away, he did, as she cast off another night
So in-tuned were we by the thought of what
Could never be
So consumed were we by feelings felt between the sheets
What do they mean?
Seamless dirty dreams
Why must you scream?
Please don't make a scene
She thinks she plays
Is it all a game?
No need to be tame
Sugar melts the acid rain
I saw you wading in the water
I saw you ride along the sea
Shine on a nightmare
Shine through the treesEmbed
