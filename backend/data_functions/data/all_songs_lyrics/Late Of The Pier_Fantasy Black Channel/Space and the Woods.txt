Space and the Woods LyricsSuicide is in my blood
It always was
But it doesn't evaporate in the light anymore
And this world is no place
For a mind or a thought
No it's not
Well, that's been said before
But space and the woods still know who I am
And I know they don't owe me anything
Not after what I've done
Put on my radiation suit and slip away
I'm on the run from what I've become
And this life by suicide
Picks up a whole lot of different speeds
And I know they don't owe me anything
Not after what I've done
Late on a Monday night
I'm on the grapevine
Beating around the bush
Into the bassline
Thinking about the time
When I was dancing slow
And out of control
I'm shit hot so say what you think about me
I'm not gonna cry cos I don't care
I'm shit hot so say what you think about me
I'm not gonna cry cos I don't care
I've done nothing
I've done nothing
But they forgive anything
Like how I don't stop you
Breaking my arms
And chopping, chopping me down
So I fit in your laptop
I've done nothingEmbed
