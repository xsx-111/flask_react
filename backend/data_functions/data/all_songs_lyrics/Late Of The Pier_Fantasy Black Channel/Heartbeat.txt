20th century shine
In and out for the count
Having the shower before the drought

A heartbeat, a flicker, a line
A heartbeat, a flicker, a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a heartbeat, a flicker, a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a line
It's just a...Embed
