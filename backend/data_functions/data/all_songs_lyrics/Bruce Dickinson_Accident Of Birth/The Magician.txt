The Magician LyricsI am the teacher, come to reach ya, take the old ways back to you
You were lost, but I found you, and it's your choice what to do
I've learned a few things as I travelled through the years
Through the door of evermore
I came through fire, came through water, through the oily serpent's kiss
Climbed the mountain, chased the dragons, thrown myself in the abyss
Do I make myself familiar to you now?
'Cause I've been around you, and I'm glad I found you
I am the living flame and I teach the holy games
Teach the secret of the dance, throw the future in the runes
Kick the sand in Satan's face, I'll put Jesus in his place
Shaman or priest, it's all the same
The magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, the magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, the magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, the magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, and magic is my game
Now I know you and you know me, we have secrets we can share
We can build a new tomorrow, from the trash of yesterday
It won't be the last time, and I'm glad I found you
I am the living flame and I teach the holy games
Teach the secret of the dance, throw the future in the runes
Kick the sand in Satan's face, I'll put Jesus in his place
Shaman or priest, it's all the same
The magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, the magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, the magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, the magician is my name
Whoah-oh-oh-oh, and magic is my gameEmbed
