Road to Hell LyricsSlowly bleeding
Watch the vortex feeding
Like a swirling vulture on your face
Every hour, the unseen rays devour
Your screaming eyes cry out
But they are blind
Father, forgive me my sins
Give me the nails
I'll hammer them in
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Down the left hand highway
With no sinister regrets
Brave new world of secret fantasy
That hovers just beyond
Your bloody grasp
Close enough to thrill
The danger of the kill
Price for failure of your will
Father, forgive us our sins
Cause we're all the junkies
Who never can win
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Down the left hand highway
With no sinister regrets
Father, forgive me my sins
Give me the nails
I'll hammer them in
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Parody of hope is the one that I must kill
We all have to live
With our family inventions
Down the left hand highway
With no sinister regrets
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Say farewell, we may never meet again
The road to Hell is full of good intentions
Down the left hand highway
With no sinister regretsEmbed
