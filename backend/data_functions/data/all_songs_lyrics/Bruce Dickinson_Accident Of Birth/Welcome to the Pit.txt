Welcome to the Pit LyricsYou come on down to the pit
Come on down to where the vipers spit
I've been waiting for you down here
Cover your eyes with the velvet hands of darkness
Cover your eyes with the velvet hands of darkness
I don't even know your name, you won't even see my face
But you choose to play my games, welcome to the hard place
I'll bring you back from the brink
Are you surprised in every way that you like it?
Are you surprised that you want it?
Cover your lips with the wicked tongue of silence
Cover your lips with the wicked tongue of silence
I don't even know your name, you won't even see my face
But you choose to play my games, welcome to the hard place
Back to back, you ride the snake
You feel it strike, you feel it bite ya...
Cover your eyes with the velvet hands of darkness
Cover your eyes with the wicked tongue of silence
I don't even know your name, you won't even see my face
But you choose to play my games, welcome to the hard place
I don't even know your name, you won't even see my face
But you choose to play my games, welcome to the hard place
I don't even know your name, you won't even see my face
But you choose to play my games
Now can you feel the hard, the hard... place...Embed
