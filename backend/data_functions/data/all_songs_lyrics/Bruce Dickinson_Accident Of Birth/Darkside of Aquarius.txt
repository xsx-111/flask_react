Darkside of Aquarius LyricsThe first Hellrider came
On wings of plenty in the dark
Poured out his poison
And he blew away his mark
The fascist from the east is coming
Mothers, hide your sons
The second Hellrider came
From flaming seas and molten sands
Pipers playing Hell's commands
Poured out his poison
With his promises of promised lands
Blackened tongues of lying leaders
Here come the riders
As the wheel of dharma's running out of time
Here come the riders
As the wheel of time's running out of time
The third Hellrider came
Teaching brothers to kill brother men
And the fourth Hellrider waits
On an acid trip for an acid world
Wars of old religious fools
And superstitious men
Throw some scary tarot cards and
Here come the riders
As the wheel of dharma's running out of time
Here come the riders
As the revolution's stepping into line
The Darkside of Aquarius
Has robbed us of our souls and minds
Here come the riders
As the wheel of dharma's running out of time
From the starlit sky on the silver sea
A lonely silver surfer
Comes to push the wheel for me
A lonely silver surfer
Comes to push the wheel for me
Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move that wheel right round
Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move that wheel right round
Gotta move, gotta move
Gotta move that wheel around
Gotta push the wheel of dharma round
Push the wheel of dharma round
Push the wheel of dharma round
Push the push right round, right now
I've gotta move the wheel of dharma
Gotta move the wheel of dharma
Gotta move the wheel of dharma
Move that wheel right around
Gotta move the wheel of dharma
Gotta move the wheel of dharma nowEmbed
