Omega LyricsThe ashes drift away
Smoke of our confusion
We turn our frightened faces
To each other, say goodbye
Waited for the sign
Waited for the moment
Waited for the miracle to arrive
I guess they lied
Look at your future
Take a look at your burning sky
Look at your future
Look at your burning sky
The others, they have gone
Who wants to live forever?
With nothing left to hold onto the past
That we once knew
We believed in Heaven
We believed in Angels
With arms of purest white
To hold us, catch us when we fall
Look at your future
Take a look at your burning sky
Look at your future
Now, look at your burning sky
Now, it's Omega Zero day
The red star shines its last rays
The sun that gave us life yesterday
Is now the sun that takes our lives away
Take a look at your future
Look at your burning sky
Look at your future
Look at your burning sky
Now, it's Omega Zero day
The red star shines its last rays
The sun that gave us life yesterday
Is now the sun that takes our lives away
Now, it's Omega Zero day
The red star shines its last rays
The sun that gave us life yesterday
Is now the sun that takes our lives awayEmbed
