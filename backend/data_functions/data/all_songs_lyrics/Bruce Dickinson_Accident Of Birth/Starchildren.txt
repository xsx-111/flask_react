Starchildren LyricsI came for nothing before nothing began
Broke the window of existence
And became a man
No sympathy for fools
My star is black and burnt
I tilt towards the light
I suck your souls into my might
We are starchildren
Coming out of nowhere
And to nowhere return
Starchildren
A hundred million souls
Snuffed out in one breath
I shiver at the threshold
Of your waking hour
The knowledge that you seek is
My source of power
I live apart from you
But I know the things you do
No Angel can save you
How?
You don't need a God
Cause I'm here now
I'm starchildren
Coming out of nowhere
And to nowhere return
Starchildren
A hundred million souls
Snuffed out in one breath
Do I fulfill your deepest need
For prophecy?
I am the ruler that you seek
So come to me
Come to me
We are starchildren
Coming out of nowhere
And to nowhere return
Starchildren
A hundred million souls
Sucked out in one breath
Starchildren
I'm the ruler of existence
In your space and time
Starchildren
To penetrate your future is
My only crime
