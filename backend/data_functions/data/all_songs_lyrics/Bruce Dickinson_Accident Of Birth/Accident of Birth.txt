Accident of Birth LyricsJourney back to the dark side
Back into the womb
Back to where the spirits move
Like vapor from the tomb
The center of the cyclone
Blowing out the sun
Break the shackles of your union
To the light
I might've had a brother
As I was born, they dragged him under
To the other side of twilight
He's waiting for me now
Nativity was lost on me
I didn't ask, I couldn't see
What created me
What and where and how
Welcome home
It's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home
We've opened up the gates
Welcome home
To your brothers and sisters
Welcome home
To an accident of birth
Feel our bodies breathing
As you try to stop believing
There's nothing you can do
About your shadows
You can fight as you are like us
And your body will betray you
Lay down and die like all the others
Where are the Angels and
Their wings of freedom?
Jesus had his day off
When they pulled you through
Welcome home
It's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home
We've opened up the gates
Welcome home
To your brothers and sisters
Welcome home
To an accident of birth
To an accident of birth
Visions growing dim
As the daylight fades away
A spinning, twisting black hole
It's your dying day
Welcome home
It's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home
We've opened up the gates
Welcome home
To your brothers and sisters
Welcome home
To an accident of birth
Welcome home
It's been too long, we've missed you
Welcome home
We've opened up the gates
Welcome home
To your brothers and sisters
Welcome home
To an accident of birthEmbed
