Man of Sorrows Lyrics
Here in a church
A small boy is kneeling
He prays to a God
He does not know, he cannot feel
All of his sins of childhood
He will remember
He will not cry, tears he will not cry

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
His small boy wonders
What was it all about?
Is your journey over?
Has it just begun?

The vision of a new world
From the ashes of the old
Do what thou wilt
He screams from his cursed soul
A tortured seer
A prophet of our emptiness
Wondering why, wondering why
Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
(I won't see your face)
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
His small boy wonders
What was it all about?
Is your journey over?
Has it just begun?


A man of sorrows
Wrecked with thoughts
That dare not speak their name
Trapped inside a body
Made to feel only guilt and shame
His anger all his life
I hate myself, he cried
Do what thou wilt
Do what thou wilt, he cried

Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
(I won't see your face)
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
(Left without a trace)
His small boy wonders
What was it all about?
Is your journey over?
Has it just begun?
Man of sorrows, I won't see your face
(I won't see your face)
Man of sorrows, you left without a trace
(Left without a trace)
His small boy wonders
What was it all about?
Is your journey over?
Has it just begun?

Has it just begun?4Embed
