Freak LyricsHe rides the wave a spiral slave
The prince of darkness plays his games
You're hypnotised under velvet skies
He breathes the red wind across your eyes
(chorus)
Who leads you to the dark secret
Who leads you to the dark secret
Your life is lost your soul is damned
But it feels too good to make a stand
Bad is bad, but this is worse
Let judgement come you love this curse
When you look at man you're like a god
Swimming in the tide of life, somersault into the flood
Washes you away
(chorus)
Who is your mistress, who leads you to the dark secret
Who is your mistress, who leads you to the dark secretEmbed
