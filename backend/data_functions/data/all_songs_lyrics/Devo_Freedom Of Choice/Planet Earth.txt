Planet Earth LyricsI heard a girl in a dress
Say her face was a mess
I heard there's no reason why
I heard that now's the time to buy
On planet Earth
I'll probably stay
On planet Earth
It's a place to live your life
Where pleasure follows pain
People go insane
Fly around in planes
Pray that it won't rain
Drive around in cars
Get drunk in local bars
Dream of being stars
Well I lived all my life on planet Earth
I saw a girl lose all control
When she lost her new mink stole
I saw her try to catch a man
Things I couldn't understand
On planet Earth
I'll probably stay
On planet Earth
It's a place to live your life
Where pleasure follows pain
People go insane
Fly around in planes
Pray that it won't rain
Drive around in cars
Get drunk in local bars
Dream of being stars
Well I lived all my life on planet Earth
I saw a man on a stage
Scream "put me back in my cage"
I saw him hang by his tie
I saw enough to make me cry
On planet Earth
On planet Earth
I lived all my life
I lived all my life
On planet Earth
I lived all my life
I lived all my life
On planet Earth
I lived all my life
I lived all my life
On planet Earth
I lived all my life
I lived all my life
On planet Earth
I livedEmbed
