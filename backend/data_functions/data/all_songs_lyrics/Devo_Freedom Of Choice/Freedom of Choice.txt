Freedom of Choice Lyrics
A victim of collision on the open sea
Nobody ever said, that life was free
Sink, swim, go down with the ship
But use your freedom of choice

I'll say it again, in the land of the free
Use your freedom of choice
Your Freedom of choice

In ancient Rome
There was a poem
About a dog
Who found two bones
He picked at one
He licked the other
He went in circles
Till he dropped dead

Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom of choice!
Then if you got it, you don't want it
Seems to be the rule of thumb
Don't be tricked by what you see
You got two ways to go

I'll say it again, in the land of the free
Use your freedom of choice
Freedom of choice

Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom of choice

In ancient Rome
There was a poem
About a dog
Who found two bones
He picked at one
He licked the other
He went in circles
He dropped dead
Freedom of choice
Is what you got
Freedom from choice
Is what you wantEmbed
