What a Bringdown LyricsDainties in a jam-jar, Parson's colour in the sky
Water in a fountain doesn't get me very high
Moby Dick and Albert making out with Captain Bligh
So you know what you know in your head
Will you, won't you, do you
Don't you know when a head's dead?
What a bringdown
Winter leader Lou is grownin', Hampstead's in the north
Betty B's been wearin' daisies since the twenty-fourth
Wears a gunner when there's one more coming forth
And you know what you know in your head
Will you, won't you, do you
Don't you wanna go to bed?
What a bringdown
There's a tea leaf about in the family
Full of nothin', their fairy tale
There's a tea leaf a-floatin' now for Rosalie
They'll believe in ding-dong bell
Take a butchers at the dodginesses of Old Bill
Aristotle's orchestra are living on the pill
One of them gets very, very prickly when he's ill
And you know what you know in your head
Will you, won't you, do you
Don't you wanna make more bread?
What a bringdown
