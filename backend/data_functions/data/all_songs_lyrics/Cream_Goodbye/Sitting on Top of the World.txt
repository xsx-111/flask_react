Sitting on Top of the World Lyrics
One summer day she went away
Gone and left me, she's gone to stay
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

All the summer working on this farm
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard
Gonna catch me a freight train
Going to leave this town
Work done got too hard
She's gone, but I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world1Embed
