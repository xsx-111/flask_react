Doing That Scrapyard Thing LyricsWhen I was young, they gave me a mongrel piano
Spent all my time inventing the cup of tea
Writing your name in the sea
Banging my fav'rite head
Missing the last bed, waving the cheery herring
Balancing brass bands on the tip of my toe
Phoning your home from a tree
Drinking my fav'rite loch
When I was old, they gave me a model factory
I met three salads on the motorway
Leaving your name at the door
Breaking my fav'rite egg
Missing the walrus, sharing my last banana
Balancing zeppelins on the end of my nose
Calling your name in the zoo
Blowing my fav'rite mindEmbed
