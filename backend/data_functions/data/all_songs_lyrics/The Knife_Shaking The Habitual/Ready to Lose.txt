Ready to Lose Lyrics
Thinking about the mouth that waters
Thinking about losing
Sucking the marrow, feeding the pain
Facing a consequence

The blood
The mine
The yours
Combined
Blood control
A hazy line
Rearranging
Of desires

Ready, ready to lose a privilege
Ready, ready to lose a privilege

Dysfunctional culture
Spin me away
Preserving the bloodline
Fear of suffering, fear of loss
Sucked in your birth rights
The blood
The mine
The yours
Combined
Blood control
A hazy line
Rearranging
Of desires

Ready, ready to lose a privilege
An ongoing habit
A transfer of possessions
Ready, ready to lose a privilege
A final sequence
An end to successionEmbed
