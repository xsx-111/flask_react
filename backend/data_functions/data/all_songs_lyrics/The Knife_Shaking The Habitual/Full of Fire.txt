Full of Fire LyricsSometimes I get problems that are hard to solve
What’s your story?
That’s my opinion
Questions and the answers can take very long
Here’s a story
What’s your opinion?
Sometimes I get problems that are hard to solve
What’s your story?
That’s my opinion
Questions and the answers can take very long
Here’s a story
What’s your opinion?
Of all the guys and the signori
Who will write my story
Get the picture, they get glory
Who looks after my story?
All the guys and the signori
Telling another false story
Liberals giving me a nerve itch
Liberals giving me a nerve itch
Liberals giving me a nerve itch
Liberals giving me a nerve
Now living and always moving
Now living and always moving
Not a vagina
It's an option
The cock
Had it coming
Not a vagina
It's an option
The cock
Had it coming
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Now living and always moving
Now living and always falling
Sometimes I get problems that are hard to solve
Here’s a story
That’s my opinion
Liberals giving me a nerve itch
Liberals giving me a nerve itch
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
When you’re full of fire
What’s the object of your desire?
When you’re full of fire
What’s the object of your desire?
When you’re full of fire
What’s the object of your desire?
Asking questions that are easy to reply
Asking questions that are easy to reply
When you’re full of fire
What’s the object of your desire?
Let’s talk about gender, baby
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about gender, baby
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about gender, baby
Let’s talk about you and me
Let’s talk about gender, baby
Let’s talk about you and me1Embed
