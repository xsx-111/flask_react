Beverly Hills LyricsBeverly Hills, Century City
Everything's so nice and pretty
All the people look the same
Don't they know they're so damn lame
There she goes
Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots
I just don't know what I'm gonna do
I don't know what I'm gonna do
Maybe I'll have to move from
Beverly Hills, Century City
Everything's so nice and pretty
And all the people, they look the same
But don't they know they're so damn lame
Three piece suit
Spandex pants
Cowboy boots
Fiorucci too
Beverly Hills, Century City!Embed
