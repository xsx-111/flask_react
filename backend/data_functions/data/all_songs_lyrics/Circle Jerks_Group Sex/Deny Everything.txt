Deny Everything LyricsInnocent
Until I'm proven guilty
Deny everything, deny everything
I'm being framed
It's all a set-up
Deny everything, deny everything
I'm just a spoke in the wheel
Just a part of the puzzle
A part of the game
I'm being framed
Innocent
Until I'm proven guilty
Deny everything
Deny everything
Deny everything
Deny everythingEmbed
