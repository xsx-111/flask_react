Red Tape LyricsRed tape
I can see can't you see?
Red tape
Doing to you doing to me
Red tape
Bureaucracy & bourgeoisie
Red tape
Killing you killing me
Tax this

No more red tape
I can see can't you see?
Red tape
Doing to you doing to me
Red tape
Bureaucracy & bourgeoisie
Red tape
Killing you killing me
Tax this

Tax that
No more red tape
Red tape
I can see can't you see
Red tape
Doing to you doing to me

Bureaucracy & bourgeoisie
Red tape
Murdering you murdering me

Tax that
There's no red tape!Embed
