Operation LyricsI went to see a rabbi
But despite his advice
I want an operation
I will not father life
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
They send me to a preacher
A really thoughtful guy
He said my idea's crazy
I shouldn't even try
This operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
But I've just seen a surgeon
And with a knife he cut
I cannot bring you children
This world is such a rut
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
I had an operation
A statement of our times
They tied my balls together
What's inside's not alive
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tie
Operation, operation
Snip & tie, snip & tieEmbed
