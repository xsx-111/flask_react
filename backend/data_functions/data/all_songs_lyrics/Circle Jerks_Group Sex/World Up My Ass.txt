World Up My Ass LyricsGot the world up my ass
And I'm gonna jump fast
Be the first
Won't be the last
I've got the world up my ass
Society is burning me up
Take a bite, spit it out
Take their rules
Rip 'em up, tear them down
Twisted mind, withered brain
You know I'm going insane
I just tell them: get back
When they tell me how to act
I've got the world up my ass
You know I've got the world up my ass
Society is burning me up
Take a bite, spit it out
Take their rules
Rip 'em up, tear them down
You know I've got the world up my ass
You know I've got the world up my ass
Society is burning me up
Take a bite, spit it out
Take their rules
Rip 'em up, tear them down1Embed
