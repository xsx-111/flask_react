Paid Vacation Lyrics
I hope you're having fun
Where's your uniform, where's your gun?
Better rub up that suntan lotion
'Cause you'll be fighting in the hot sun

It's not Vietnam
Just another oil company scam
Salute that flag for Uncle Sam
Get your money out, place your bets
It's Afghanistan!

Fix bayonets, check grenades
Got enough bullets, got enough rounds to
Wipe out this place
Where the infantry and the cavalry
Parachutes fill the skies
As bodies burn and people die

It's not Vietnam
It's another oil company scam
You'd better salute that flag for Uncle Sam
Get your money out, place your bets...
It's Afghanistan!
Fix bayonets, check grenades
Got enough bullets, got enough rounds to wipe out this place
Where the infantry and the cavalry
Parachutes fill the skies
And bodies burn and people dieEmbed
