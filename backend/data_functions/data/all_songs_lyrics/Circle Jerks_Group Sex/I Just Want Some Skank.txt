I Just Want Some Skank LyricsEmpty frame on the wall
Cat and mouse when she don't call
All I do is think of her
T.V. screens picture's blurred
So take it away!
Take it away!
Every night the scene is set
I've got to drink to forget
I cannot incur this debt
Where's the gun?
Here's my head!
Let's go to the Hong Kong
Breaking glass at Madame Wong's
Let's go get a pint of booze
Getting drunk, getting loose
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
Passing flyers at the Troub'
Seven nights seven 'ludes
What's the deal with this band?
Let's go roll some fields, man
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
I just want some skank!
Every night would be so great
I'd take you home to meet Mom and Dad
And they'll be so glad
They won't think their boy's a fag
Then they'll go upstairs and go to bedEmbed
