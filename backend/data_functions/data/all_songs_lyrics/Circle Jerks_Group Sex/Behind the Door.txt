Behind the Door LyricsMister, give me the key
Point me to the stairs
I don't know what waits for me in
Room 13
Room 13
Dim lit hallways
Stains on the floor
Looking for 13
What's behind the door?
Room 13
Room 13
Prostitutes, hypes & drugs
Meet me on the way
No cheap paintings, just blank walls
Blank walls, that's okay
Prostitutes, hypes & drugs
Meet me on the way
Empty bottles, spots of blood
That's cool bro, that's cool, 'cause
What waits for me?
A whore, a bullet, a thug?
What waits for me?
A whore, a bullet, a thug?
That's okay, room 13
That's okay, room 13
Turn around
And I'll walk away
Turn around
I didn't want to stay there anywayEmbed
