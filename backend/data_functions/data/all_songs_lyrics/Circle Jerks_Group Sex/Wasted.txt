Wasted LyricsI was so wasted
I was so wasted

I was a hippie
I was a burnout
I was a dropout
You know I was out of my head
And I was a surfer
I had a skateboard
I was so happy, man
You know I lived on the strand

I was so wasted, I was wasted
I was so wasted, I was wasted

I was so fucked up
I was so screwed up
I was so jacked up
Couldn't get any higher than that
And I was so pilled up
I was so nebbed out
I was so jacked up
I was out of my head
I was so wasted, I was wasted
I was so wasted, I was wastedEmbed
