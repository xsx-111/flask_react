So You Wanna Be a Superhero Lyrics
There's banging on the wall
It's 5 am — I've got no sleep at all
Just thoughts of how I might
Struggle through tomorrow
Too much time in one day
Too much time to occupy
With boring thoughts
And boring moods
And boring bedtimes
Won't tell a single soul that my soul's gone
It's hard to write this song
It's all a joke
It's all been wrote down by someone who's probably dead...

I might be leaving soon
I might be leaving soon

There's laughter from below
It's 1 am – how could you have known?
The thoughts of silence that have me
From going back to sleep at night
Wish I could call someone I love
To stop thinking of myself
Long look in the mirror
Just... looks so blankly
You were right, I can't do this
I'm going crazy; it's fine by me
Now you can't see
How much I've become empty
I might be leaving soon
I might be leaving soon
I might be leaving soon

My dreams are full of what's not real
I'll fly away and save the world
I'll make you proud someday
I just won't be around to see your face
My life is full of what's not here
I'll go away and save myself
I'll make you proud today
I just won't be around to see your face2Embed
