(March 19th 1983) It Was Probably Green Lyrics
Green takes the leaves, snow takes the sea
It reminded me how awful things can be
Trying to recall your tiny voice
Until the fever breaks, it's all that I can hear
Counting down the numbers of the days
Was it the same amount of roses on your grave
Finally I brought myself to sing these words
After the snow, you can finally see
If you could be the trees, I would be your leaves

After she died, we decided to believe
That her favorite color was probably green
On the day she died, in our hearts we did believe
That her favorite color was probably greenEmbed
