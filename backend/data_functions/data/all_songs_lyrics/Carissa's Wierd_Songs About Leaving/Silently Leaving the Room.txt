Silently Leaving the Room LyricsSilently leaving the room, gathering your thoughts from the floor
Hopefully no one will hear you silently closing the door
Down the long stairs to the hall, out to the streets where you'll find
Rumored accounts and hearsay, rumored accounts and hearsay
Was it me who acted that way? Is it you who should stay?
I don't recall ever acting that way, was it you who should've stayed?
The truth was deceiving when the hosts of the evening
Found the ghost that was bleeding drops of blood from the ceiling
Everyone was laughing, we all prayed for a favor
That the ghost would entertain us with some songs and some dancing
But by the stains of his blood covered all the wood floors
Opened all of the windows and all of the doors
Broke all of the bottles on streets down below
Some blood was frozen, blessed by wounded love
When the ice skates came on, the girls finally sang songs
To the tunes of the laughter while silently leaving the room1Embed
