Ignorant Piece of Shit Lyrics
Looking right around you
And how will I know
When you'll decide to jump
Jump out of a window
Falling faster
I can imagine
The ways that you'd roll your eyes
Before you hit the ground

Telling everyone you know
Maybe I'll be bad for you
Maybe you're too good for me
Everyone is getting screwed
Well if the shoe fits then put it on
Wear it like a crown
I can't believe you called
Just to say that you were coming down
I like the way you roll your eyes
Right before you fall down
I like the way you rolled your eyes
Right before you fall down

On bended knee
Will you marry me
And on November 16
Everything was buried down
On bended knee
Will you marry me
And on November 16
Everything was buried down2Embed
