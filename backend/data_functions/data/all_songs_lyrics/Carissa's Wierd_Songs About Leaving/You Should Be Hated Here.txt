You Should Be Hated Here Lyrics
They're all surrounding
We're both hoping
Failing slowly
Attempting one thing
To stand up
With dignity
To walk away

Due to the time it took to prove it all
(Never thought that I could do anything right)
The new lines 'round my eyes
(But I don't mean to say that you were wrong)
You'll know the scars upon my head
Were only meant to spell apologies
There's a ten point deer that someone said
(This night is guaranteed to all turn black)
Was impossible to find until
(With memories that haunt the past)
You find it on the freeway standing stupid looking blind

I'm only here to fall apart
You've been angry from the start
But I know these train wrecks happen all the time
And everything that no one knows
You should be hated here by now
This was the prettiest lie that I told tonight
It's been the prettiest lie that I told all year
The unmade bed inside the room
(It could be now)
Where I don't feel comfortable at all
(and I don't feel proud)
Where the blanket stared at me for hours
(I'm so sorry now)
And I stared right back so self-righteously
(I'm sorry now)

And it all comes down to composure that's been lost
When it all comes down to composure that's been lost1Embed
