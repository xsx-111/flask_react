Sofisticated Fuck Princess Please Leave Me Alone Lyrics
I still recall what made me like you
So yes they have said things about you
And yes I see where it's true

Thought you could get all you wanted
By just thinking of yourself
It's not your pretty face that matters
And I think you need some help

So please just leave me the hell alone
Cause now I know this isn't at all right
How much more times will I have to tell you
You try to cry but it's just for show
You know I know you know

Saying sad things that don't make sense
Can just make you look like a liar
Don't convince me that you're right
About some fear I have of heartache
So I'll make you just one promise that I'll never regret this

Take a long look inside
Cause right now I'm leaving you
Take a long look inside
Cause right now I'm leaving
Take a long look inside
Cause right now I'm leaving youEmbed
