Low Budget Slow Motion Soundtrack Song for the Leaving Scene Lyrics
How long will you be gone
How soon till you'll come home
Where is your sweetheart
Who shelters her from the cold now
The cold now

Absence only made
Our hearts grow colder
I will be waiting
I'll just keep waiting for you
For you

Will you remember
The feelings and colors
Bad dreams comforted
By warm arms that held you so close
So close

Will you regret everything that you said
Or will you hold it close to your heart
'Cause I will be waiting
I'll just keep waiting
Hold on, so close, hold on
Absence only made
Our hearts grow colder
I will be waiting
I'll just keep waiting for youEmbed
