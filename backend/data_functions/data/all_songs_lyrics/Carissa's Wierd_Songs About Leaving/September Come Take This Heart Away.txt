September Come Take This Heart Away Lyrics
This room has so many windows, too many windows
I've sat and watched the trees framed to fade outside
I hope the seasons treat you well
I hope the seasons treat you kind
As kind as I never was
As comforting as I never could be

I saw two fake long-stemmed roses on the windshield of a car
September come please take this heart away

All of these windows bring in the cold air
I hope you have a coat to keep you warm
Warmer than those last times we spoke
Warmer than the last words we said
I'm sure the wind blows gently on you now
I hope that nothing will ever remind you of me

Glue that faded photo on a worn-out journal page
It reads: "September come, please take this heart away"1Embed
