A New Holiday (November 16th) Lyrics
You're whole again now
Its an obvious reflection
Can see it in my neck
Taking slow dancing lessons
Nervous laughter filled the voids
When I declared you your own holiday
Your voices sound different though I've heard it before
Remember the winters that we slept in the car
You said your crooked legs don't walk so well
I said my eyes were tired and declared
You your own holiday
You'll be hereEmbed
