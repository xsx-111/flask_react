Nightingale Lyrics
And I will flail under these lights
That seep down from the bitter sky tonight
And I will kick and beat my wrists together
And feel an ocean breathing waves
Feel them licking at my face
Ceilings don't exist
And there are no floors beneath me
If I were king of this night
Would you become my queen?

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go

I'll have to walk a thousand miles
Just to find the ground deserving of your feet
You could throw me down
And walk on me
And I'd just look on through my love
And through the haze
And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I go

The nightingales are singing loud
They're calling out our marriage
To our subjects on their knees
Their jewelry is thrown into the air
They sigh at the release
As their shackles hit the ground
The trumpets call out now
We're home at last

And I hope, your majesty
That you like your position
I'll do everything I can
To keep you by my side
And I'll stare off through the darkness
To find us a kingdom
Just kiss me before I goEmbed
