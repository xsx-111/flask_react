At Your Funeral Lyrics
This song will become the anthem of your underground
You're two floors down getting high in the back room
If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?
Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?
And at your funeral I will sing the requiem

This song will become the anthem of your underground
You're two floors down getting high in the back room
If I flooded out your house, do you think you'd make it out?
Or would you burn up before the water filled your lungs?

And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die

And you can bet that when we mourn the death of you that night
They'll lay me on the dinner table, I will be the pig
With the apple in my mouth, the food that celebrates your end

And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die
And at your funeral I will sing the requiem
I'd offer you my hand
It would hurt too much to watch you die1Embed
