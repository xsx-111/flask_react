Firefly Lyrics
I said I'd walk you home
After our third round
Of pouring whiskey down
The barrel of our guts
Grab hold of your hand
We're up and we're out
And we're yelling through the streets
And I'm out of my fucking mind

And I know you're next to me
But I must confess
What's in my head

Keep pumping now
Legs to beat the ground
And our hearts to beat the band
Sky's on fire again
Run down this alleyway
Lightning bolts again
We become fireflies
Just flashing at the ends
Rattle garbage cans
Prepare to be ravaged
By our lust, burning mad
To find that we've become
And I know you're under me
But I must confess
What's in my head

To me you are the light
From a light bulb  breaks sometimes
And the tender warmth inside
Is released into my life
To me you are the light
From a light bulb  breaks sometimes
And the tender warmth inside
Is released into my life

And it smothers me in flames
That lick and scorch my face
As the smoke reaches the sky
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'm burning tonight
Know I'll burn for you tonightEmbed
