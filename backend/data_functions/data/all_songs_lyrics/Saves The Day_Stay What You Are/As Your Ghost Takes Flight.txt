As Your Ghost Takes Flight Lyrics
The last time that I saw you, August of '99
I should've had my hammer and a few rusty spikes
To nail you on a wall and use bottles to catch your blood
Display you for the neighbors so they'd know your time had come

And I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart

And as your body sags and the stench rises in vain
The people on the street are collecting in dismay
Before their eyes, your head lifts towards the sky
And that's the last thing they'll remember of you

Cause I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heart

You've become a ghost
You're floating somewhere in between
The waking world and a landscape of dreams
Well it is nothing but dying
Got a grenade stuck in your teeth and you're pulling at the pin
You're an illusion, just a shadow flickering underneath the sun
And I'd drink your blood
Feel it dripping down my throat
And heading for my heartEmbed
