This Is Not an Exit Lyrics
Tonight will be the night that we begin to ease the plugs out of the dam
And we will stand knee deep in the flow
The undertow will grab our heels and won't let go
And while we hold, our legs quivering
The water rises now to our teeth when we just let go

And sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have

And all the wasted nights and empty moments in our lives
Are flushed away as we sway with the rhythm of the waves bobbing us up
Crests fall to troughs as we feel our gills open up

And sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping our backs
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that we have

And if the hook sets in the bottom of our lungs
We'll rip it out and lick the blood off with our tongues

Despair can ravage you if you turn your head around
To look down the path that's lead you here, cause what can you change?
You're a vessel now floating down the waterways
You can take your rudder and aim your ship
Just don't bother with the things left in your wake
Just sail belly up to the clouds, the rocks scraping your back
To breathe in the air will be the only thing that you have
And your love will be warm nights with pockets of moonlight
Spotlighting you as you drift, the actor in this play
And you walk across the stage, take a bow, hear the applause
And as the curtain falls, just know you did it all
The best that you knew how and you can hear them cheering now
So let a smile out and show your teeth cause you know you lived it well3Embed
