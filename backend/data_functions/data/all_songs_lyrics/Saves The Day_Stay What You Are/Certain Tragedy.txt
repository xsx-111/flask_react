Certain Tragedy Lyrics
And now I finally see that the further we go
We're only treading ground that we already know
I could write you a song
Send you a note
Or empty out your trash
And buy a bucket full of diamonds
But even the most beautiful of all roses
Must someday crumble to dust and fade away
It's certain tragedy

So, it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left

And I can finally see that the further I go
I'm only treading ground I don't want to know
I'll probably hang upside down
From wooden rafters in my home
And look at old photos of you

So, it's on into the lonely nights and all the rest of it
The empty space between me and the sunken walls
And feeling someone's hand around my neck
Choking away the life that I have left
I miss the warmth of the summer
When we were on our own
But now it's winter and my bones are cold

And now I finally see that the further we go
We're only treading ground that we already know
I could write you a song
Send you a note
Or empty out your trash
And buy a bucket full of diamonds
But even the most beautiful of all roses
Must someday crumble to dust and fade away
It's certain tragedyEmbed
