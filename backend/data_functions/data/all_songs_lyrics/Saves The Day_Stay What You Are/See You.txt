See You Lyrics
My gut is burning
Won't you find me some water?
Hey, just forget it can you bring me gasoline?
Collect a couple forks
Hold them three feet apart
Wait for lightning to strike to burn me up

'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today

My head is swirling
Been carried off in the sky
And where it lands is where it lands
I guess that I will get another head
Then get on with my life
Leave you somewhere beneath the waves of time
And I'll wear glass shoes and plastic wrap
No, I'll just wear my insides, yeah
You want to know who I really am?
Yeah, so do I
Yeah, so do I

'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
And I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
Right now, I am turning off the lights
'Cause I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
And I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you today
I don't think that I have got the stomach
To stomach calling you todayEmbed
