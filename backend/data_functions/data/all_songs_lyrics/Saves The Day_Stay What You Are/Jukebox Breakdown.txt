Jukebox Breakdown Lyrics
If you've got a quarter
You can stick it in my neck
Sing whatever song you want
For whatever mood you're in

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep

Got a mouth full of blood
And I'll carry this casket if it's what I have to do
So, bring on the dark sky
Let it cover me entirely

Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart

And I'll run down to the river
Grab five buckets of water
Wait right where you are
And I will serve you at your table
Hope you like my restaurant
And the lighting is right
The jukebox is in the corner
My mouth is the speaker
And it plays your favorite songs
And you know where the coin slot is
Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart
Isn't that what you expect?
I can sing you to sleep
And all you want from me
Is a broken heart
A broken heartEmbed
