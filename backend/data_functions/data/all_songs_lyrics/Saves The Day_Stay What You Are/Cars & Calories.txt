Cars & Calories Lyrics
Her life was magazines and faithful TV screens
Selling an empty dream of cars and calories
Everything in between the sun and Saturn's ring
The price tag can't be seen

And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell

Grew up in east L.A
Watching celebrities
Living out all her dreams
The plastic canopy of U.S. royalty
Drew her gaze towards the sky
Away from her own mind

And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shell

And at her home her mother cried
'Cause daddy had something on the side
They didn't look up when she sighed
When August came around
Bathing suits on the ground
Replaced by a cotton cloak
To see her own reflection was like squinting in the sun
And when all tomorrow brings is a set of broken wings

Well it takes bites out of your insides
'Til you are just a hollow shell
And it took bites out of her insides
'Til she was just a hollow shellEmbed
