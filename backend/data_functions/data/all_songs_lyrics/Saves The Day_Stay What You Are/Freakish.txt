Freakish Lyrics
As I'm talking
My words slip to the floor
And they crawl through your legs
Slide under the back door
Rendering me freakish and dazed

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

So I'll go walking in the streets
'Til my heels bleed
And I'll sing out my song
In case the birds wish to sing along
And I'll dig a tunnel to the center of the universe

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out
I'll make my way across the frozen sea
Beyond the blank horizon
Where I can forget you and me
And get a decent night's sleep

Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out
Well, here I am
Don't know how to say this
Only thing I know is awkward silence
Your eyelids close when you're around me
To shut me out

To shut me out
(Don't shut me out)
To shut me out
(Don't shut me out)
To shut me out
(Don't count me out)
To shut me out
(Don't shut me out)Embed
