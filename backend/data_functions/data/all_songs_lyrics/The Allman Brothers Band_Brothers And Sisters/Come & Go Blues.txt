Come & Go Blues Lyrics
People say that you're no good
But I wouldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could
Well I seem to stay down on the ground
Baby, I'm too far gone to turn around
Oh if only you would make up your mind
Take me where you go, you're leaving me way behind

Lord, you got those come and go blues
Lord, you got those come and go blues
Yes, you do
Oh and you got me feelin' like a fool


'Round and 'round, 'round we go
Don't ask me why I stay here, I don't know
Well maybe I'm a fool to care
Without your sweet love, baby I would be nowhere
Here I'll stay, locked in your web
Till that day I might find somebody else

And I don't know just when that will be
But I don't know, I can't say 'cause I can't see

People say that you're no good
But I couldn't cut you loose, baby, if I could
Well I seem to stay down on the ground
Baby I'm too far gone to turn around
Oh if only you would make up your mind
Take me where you go, you're leaving me left behind

Woman, you got those come and go blues
You know you do
Lord, you got those come and go blues
Bet you feel bad too
Oh you got me feelin' like a fool
Just like a foolEmbed
