Southbound Lyrics
Girl I'm southbound
Lord, I'm comin' home to you
Well, I'm southbound, baby
Lord, I'm comin' home to you
I got that old lonesome feelin' that's sometimes called the blues

Lord, I've been workin' every night or travelin' every day
Lord, I've been workin' every night or travelin' every day
Oh, you can tell your other man sweet daddy's on the way
Oh, you better believe

Well, I'm southbound
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I said I'm southbound, baby
Oh, you better tell your other man sweet daddy's on his way
Oh, here I come, yeah


Got your hands full now, baby, as soon as I hit that door
Got your hands full now, woman, just as soon as I hit that door
Well, I'm gonna make it on up to you
For all the things you should have had before
So I'm goin' southbound
Oh, southbound, babe
Oh, I'm goin' southbound, yeah, babe
Gonna make it on up to you
For all the things you should have had before1Embed
