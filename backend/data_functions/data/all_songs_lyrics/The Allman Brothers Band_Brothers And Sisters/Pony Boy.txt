Pony Boy Lyrics
Don't worry for me, well I'm all right
Lord knows I'm having a natural good time
Pocket full of money, gonna boogie all night
There ain't nobody tell me that's a crime

When morning comes and it's time to go
Pony boy carry me home, all right
Pony boy carry me home

All right mama
Let me see you do that thing now
Yeah

Band is jumping and so am I
I'm just groovin', can't stop movin'
My ole man's got that ole eagle eye
But he is just waitin', we're celebratin'

Morning comes and it's time to go
Pony boy carry me home
Pony boy carry me home
I feel a change coming on
Come on, mama!
Here it comes now
Papa's with you now

Look out the door there beside that tree
Well, that's my pony, looking after me
Front feet doing the shuffle
Back feet, too
Blow them good old Georgia blues

When morning comes and it's time to go
Pony boy carry me home, yes Lord
Pony boy carry me home

All right pony boy
I think it's time for me and you to get on down the road
Come on now, get them feets moving
Yes, yesEmbed
