Wasted Words Lyrics
Can you tell me, tell me, friend
Just exactly where I've been?
Is that so much to ask?
I'll pay you back no matter what the task
You seem really sure about something I don't know
Take that load off, looks like your chest is about to go
Your wasted words already been heard
Are you really God, yes or no?

Well, all day and half the night
You're walkin' round lookin' such a fright
Is it me or is it you?
I'd make a wager and I'd hope "to" lose
Time gone, looks like Rome is about to fall, sure gon' fall
Next time take the elevator, please don't crawl
Your wasted words so absurd
Are you really Satan, yes or no?
Tell me I will


Well, I ain't no saint and you sure as hell ain't no savior
Every other Christmas I will practice good behavior
That was then, this is now
Don't ask me to be Mister Clean 'cause baby, I don't know how
Ring my phone 'bout ten more times, we will see
Find that broke down line and let it be
Your wasted words will never be heard
Go on home baby and watch it on TV
Weekday soap-box speciality
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout now
By the way, this song's for you, sincerely, me1Embed
