Let Me LyricsLet me
Let me
Let me
Let me.
Let me look back into my own heart
Let me hold myself with my own hand
Let me tell my secrets to myself
Let me kneel and pray for my own grace.
Let me hold on
Let me hold on
Let me hold on
Let me hold on.
Let my lips be the ones to taste the truth
Let it be myself to hear my blues
Let me quiver naked dark and lone
Let my mirrors be close like.
Skin and bone
Skin and bone
And heart.
Skin and bone
Skin and bone
And heart
Let me hold on
Let me
Let me hold on
Let me.
Let me close my eyes and see the view
Let me love my feet in my shoes
Let me lay here naked, breath and tone
Let my songs be sweet like freedom.
Let me dream
Let me hold on.Embed
