Black Enough LyricsAm I black enough for you?
I don't talk the way you do
You call me names and try to hurt me
Spit on the ground, hopin' to curse me
They say blood
Is thicker than water
But you look like my great grandfather
Walk by, suck teeth
I'm not black enough for you.
Am I black enough for you?
You call my God a stranger too
Turnin' your eyes like you don't see me
You only speak if it's a Sunday
Our lines erased
With blood and water
Who's to say I'm not your last daugther
Turn the other cheek
'Til I'm black enough for you.

Am I black enough for you
They could shoot my children too
It don't matter how you see me
We're still running like the old days
Even if I'm not from here
Green cards don't save ya'
I still look just like your mama
Hands up, don't shoot
Blacker than you; Blacker than me
They matter, true; But so do we.Embed
