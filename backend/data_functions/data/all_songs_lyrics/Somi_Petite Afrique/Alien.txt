Alien Lyrics
I don't drink coffee, I take tea my dear
Some extra rice, please, on the side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an African in New York

See me walking down One Sixteen
Dried fish and cowry tableside
There's pride and beauty in my walk
I'm an African in New York

I'm an alien, I'm a legal Alien
I'm an African in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal Alien
I'm an African in New York

I drive my taxi down grand avenues
They always ask me where I'm from
Is it that sad place that's in the news?
And is that the reason why i've come?

I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an African in New York
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an African in New York
Modesty, propriety
I'm not the only one
Gentleness, sobriety
Shines brighter than the sun

"Fais comme chez toi sans oublier...", they said
Even though you're here to stay
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself no matter what they say

I'm an African
I'm an African
I'm an AfricanEmbed
