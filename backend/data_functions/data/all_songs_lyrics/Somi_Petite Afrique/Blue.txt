Blue LyricsMy hand was given long ago
To a gentleman I did not know
Two families made a king and queen
Then commit to love, sight unseen
He gave me silk and amber gold
And prayed my heart might take a hold
But it never could
And it never would
So I wear blue
And think about you
Even though I'm not supposed to
The love I let go
They promised him a boy child
To keep the family name and pride
It's not really for us to say
But I said I would anyway
Our first born was a little girl
So was our second and our third
But a boy child, I never could
And I never would
So I wear blue
And dream for my daughters too
And all that they're supposed to do
The love I hope they find
Blue like the sea that spreads widely between us
Blue like the sky that greets every morning prayer
Blue like the moon that sighs when she's full
Blue like the salt in an ocean of tears.
Blue
Blue
Blue
Blue
The wind still whispers how you are
About your life back in Dakar
They say you heart's still on your sleeve
Broken in two, waiting for me
Beauty and hand are there for you
You even tried to love one or two
But you never could
And you never would
So you wear blue
And think of us two
Even though you're not supposed to
The love we let go
Let go
Let go
Let go
Let goEmbed
