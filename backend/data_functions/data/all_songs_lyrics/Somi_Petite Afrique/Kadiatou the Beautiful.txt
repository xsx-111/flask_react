Kadiatou the Beautiful LyricsKadiatou
Kadiatou was her name
Kadiatou was her name
What a beauty
Kadiatou
She would hide her dreams behind sad eyes
And in the braids she spun
Each one hiding behind the other
Each one stuck on her scalp and happy when the wind blew
So she could dance with them for a while
So she could dance with them for a while
Kadiatou
Kadiatou was her name
What a beauty
Kadiatou
What a beauty
When she dance or when she sang alone
She was free
When she dance or when she sang alone
She was free
Buy Kadiatou did not know
She didnâ€™t know her beauty
So she would braid and whisper dreams though her fingers.
She wold braid and hope the crown she dressed would carry her prayers into the sun
Oh, Kadiatou
Kadiatou
Kadiatou
Braid and pray
Braid and pray
And braid
You will know your beauty
You will know it when the wind the blows.Embed
