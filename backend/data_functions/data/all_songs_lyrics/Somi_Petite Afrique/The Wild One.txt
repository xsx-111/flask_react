The Wild One LyricsShe likes her tea with milk and rum and spices
She wears her hair down and brags about her vices
She only wears gold and calls herself Thunder
So kiss the sky, boys before she rolls the dice, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't bite your tongue, love, she don't care for disguises
She'll bring flat shoes to dance until sun rises
She'll call your name if you look like tomorrow
But don't pull her sleeve of hearts and sacrifices.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I wanna be the wild one
Wanna be the wild one.
She's brave
More than a thousand lives
Her heart
Broken a thousand times.
I like my tea with mil and rum and
I wear my hair down and brag about it
I only wear gold and call myself Thunder
So kiss the sky, boys, before I roll the dice, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...
I wanna be the wold one
Wanna be the wild one
Let me be the wild one.Embed
