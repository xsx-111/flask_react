Holy Room LyricsI can’t hold these burdens anymore
Your love feels like a holy room
Washed my feet, leave them at the door
Your love feels like a holy room
Soothe my sorrows and clean my heart
Holy Room
Our hands like prayer touching through the dark
Your love feels like a holy room.
Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar
I’ll light a candle then let it burn
Your love feels like a holy room
Then let the angels sings until my turn
Your love feels like a holy room
Hold my faith, make me anew
Holy room
On rug and knee, I’ll whisper too
Your love feels like a holy room.
Allahu Akbar
Allahu Akbar
I can’t hold these burdens anymore
Your love feels like a holy room
So take my hand, lay me on the floor
Your love feels like a holy room
Banish my fears and bless me down
Holy room
I kiss your palm, you kiss my crown
Our love feels like a holy, holy, holy…Embed
