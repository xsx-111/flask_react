Like Dakar LyricsI remember Harlem
Like Dakar or Abidjan
Street named after heroes
Blood and stories, overrun.
Counting the days 'tll Ramadhan is over
Elegant women in the sun float closer.
I remember Harlem
Long-forgotten majesty
Bodies brown and kwowing
Spirits watching over me.
Hoping for mercy not a gun
When night falls
Elders and young one come undone
A close call.
I remember Harlem
Like Dakar or Abidjan
It's been so long my memory's blue
Like the ocean that brought me to
These shores
I call home now.
Harlem, remember me, too
Harlem, remember me, too.Embed
