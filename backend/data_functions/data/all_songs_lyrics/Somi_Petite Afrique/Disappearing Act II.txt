Disappearing Act II LyricsIt's almost winter in Harlem
Less time and more chill
The large eyes of street lights
Catch my breath and stare plainly
At my shadow
Metal necks lean in to whisper something
But I can't seem to hear the light
I only see on ebony man in all white garb
Across the avenue
He looks at me looking at him
Looking at me
We know each other
But then I blink
First you see 'em, now you don'tEmbed
