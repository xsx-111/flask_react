The Gentry LyricsThe gentry come, I can’t play drums no more
Said that’s not what their good money’s for
The gentry come
Oh, the gentry come
The gentry come now I might lose my home
And every soul that I’ve ever known
The gentry come
Oh, the gentry come.
Would you like some coffee or some tea?
How about milk or some honey?
Would you like some coffee or some tea?
How about milk or some honey?
I want it Black
I want it black
I want it Black
I want it black.
The gentry come I can’t play drums no more
Said that’s not what their good moneys’ for
The gentry come
Oh, the gentry come
The gentry came now I might lose my home
And every corner that I’ve ever known
The gentry come
Oh, the gentry come.
Would you like some coffee or some tea?
How about milk or some honey?
I want it Black
I want it black
I want it Black
I want it black.
The gentry came I can’t play drums no more
Said that’s not what their good money’s for.
The gentry came
Oh, the gentry came.
The gentry came now I might lose my home
And every store that I’ve ever known
The gentry come
Oh, the gentry come.
Would you like some coffee or some tea?
How about milk or some honey?
I want it Black
I want it black
I want it Black
I want it black.Embed
