Midnight Angels LyricsThey are midnight angels
Darker than the night
Brighter than any star
No need for street light
They swirl and sparkle
And stand still for a while
Their grace and goodness
Make old Frederick Douglass smile
Those midnight angels
I pray they come close enough to touch
So that I might know myself and God
So i might finally be enough
They've got gold and dreams
And magic on their necks
They've got sweat and love
And mirrors in their palms, yes.
Sweet midnight angels
Blue black and mystical
Take me home with you
Take me to the other side
Tell my father that I found you
Please tell him that I triedEmbed
