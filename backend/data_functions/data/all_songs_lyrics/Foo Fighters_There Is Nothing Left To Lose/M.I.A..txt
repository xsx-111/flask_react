M.I.A. Lyrics
Call and I'll answer at home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down

Never mind mannequins drunk in their hollow town
Drinking their spoils down
Cheap imitations
The revelation is now

Yeah, you won't find me I'm going M.I.A
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A
Getting lost in you again is better than being numb

Counting every minute till the feeling comes crashing down
Run when it hits the ground
I'm good at escaping
But better at flaking out
Calling unanswered the center becomes blown out
Stuck in the inside now
It's fear I'm embracing
I never could face you down
Yeah, you won't find me I'm going M.I.A
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A
Getting lost in you again is better than being numb

Red, red, laced around your head
Cold and rescued, cold and rescued
Cold and rescued, cold and rescued
Cold and rescued, cold and rescued now

Call and I'll answer at home in the lost and found
You say that I'm much too proud
Someone who's taking pleasure in breaking down

Yeah, you won't find me I'm going M.I.A
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A
So you don't find me I'm going M.I.A
Tonight I'm leaving going M.I.A
Say goodbyeâ€‹ to me I'm going M.I.A
I can find relief I'm going M.I.A
Getting lost in you again is better than being numb
Better than being numb
Better than playing dumb2Embed
