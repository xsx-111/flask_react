Live-In Skin Lyrics
Take your payroll and your lottery
There's a place I know, there's a robbery

And I swear I'll never tell
If you swear you'll never tell
And we'll all make out so well
We will all make out so well

Head on with my hate
Into the lights ahead
I'm amazed that I'm still standing
And I demand that we all blend in
I'm amounted

Just the same old glitter story
From the sea floor, metamorphosis

And I can't change back for you
I will not change back for you
I must live in skin that's new
I'm a livid skin that's new

Turn your insides out to the outside
Turn the outside in to the inside
Trade your outside in for the inside
Turn it around again
I'm amounted

And I can't change back for you
No, I can't change back for you
I'm amountedEmbed
