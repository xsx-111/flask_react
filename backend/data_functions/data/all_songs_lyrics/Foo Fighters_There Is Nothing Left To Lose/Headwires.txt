Headwires Lyrics
Have you been headwired
Were you satisfied
Did it free the feelings in your spine
Sleeping way inside all this time
Will you meet your mind where the night collides
Will you greet yourself when the sun arrives
I'll just stay behind, I've met mine

Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires now
Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires, headwires now

Help you feed the wires when your head unwinds
And if our headlines become entwined
You can have all mine, I'll be fine
There's a reason why keeping me alive
There's a cure in me that I wish were mine
As long as I can fight, I'll survive

Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires now
Better than a bullet being fired
Tangled in your headwires, headwires
Stationed on the wire (headwires)
One day I'll let go (headwires)
Tell them all hello (headwires)
Tell them all hello (headwires)
Stationed on the wire (headwires)
One day I'll let go (headwires)
Tell them all hello (headwires)
Tell them all hello (headwires)

The sun is on Arlandria
