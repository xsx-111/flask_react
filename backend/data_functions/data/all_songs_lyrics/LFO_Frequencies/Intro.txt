Intro LyricsHouse
What is house?
Technotronic, KLF, or something you just live in?
To me, house is Phuture, Pierre, Fingers, Adonis, et cetera
The pioneers of the hypnotic groove
Brian Eno, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode, and the Yellow Magic Orchestra
This album is dedicated to you
House
In the future
We hope our music will bring everyone a little closer together
Gay, straight, black or white
One nation under a groove1Embed
