Still Holding on to You LyricsYeah
It's been written in stone
You're gone and you're not coming home
But I know that it's true
And there's really not a lot I can do
But baby
I'm still holding on to you
I'm still holding on to you
Wow yeah
You know what people say
They say the man gives a little
And then he takes it away
But I know that it's true
And there's really not a lot I can do
But baby
I'm still holding on to you
I'm still holding on to you
Yeah I'm still holding on
(guitar)
I said last night
I dreamed they came for my soul
Yeah the room was hot
And her skin was cold
Oh no no no
And I heard them called my name
I'll still be waiting for you
Still holding on to you
Oh carry me down that row
Still holding on to you
Down where the angels won't go
Still holding on to you
I'll still be waiting for you
Still holding on to you
Oh carry me down that row
Still holding on to you
Down where the angels won't go
Still holding on to youEmbed
