Bullet With My Name On It LyricsIf you ever saw me
Walking around
Swear I'd try to disappear
I wouldn't make a sound
Then something
Got me on the run
It's gonna be the last time
I let you hold my gun
Your bullet's got my name on
Ah ah
Your bullet's got my name on it
Gotta run away
Run run away
(guitars)
I had a dream
I was all alone
I had a mouth
But I couldn't speak
Then something
Tried to turn my head
It was someone just like you
Had me by the throat again
Your bullet's got my name on
Ah ah
Your bullet's got my name on it
Gotta run away
Your bullet's got my name on it
Gotta run away
Run run away
(guitars)
I thought I knew the answer
It was just a clue
Another trigger I couldn't pull
And then something
Came in my room last night
They aimed
They fired
And I got lucky
Your bullet's got my name on
Ah ah
Your bullet's got my name on it
Gotta run away
Run run awayEmbed
