John Coltrane Stereo Blues LyricsOh keep your hands on the shades baby
No one gonna care
When the moon goes dead
Oh I might have said something sometime
But I don't care what I might have said
We're gonna take it
Move it
Sand it down
We're gonna send it back from where it came
Oh yeah yeah
Gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
I feel it, want it, know it
Yeah I say yeah yeah yeah
It's gonna be all right
(guitar)
I got some John Coltrane on the stereo baby
Make it feel all right
I got some fine wine in the freezer mama
I know what you like
I gonna take it, turn it, set it loose
We gonna learn about love on a three ply rug
Hah
Gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
I feel it
Gonna be all right
(guitars,guitars,guitars)
Don't tell me anymore bout the
Civilized world baby
It's just you and me
Oh what do I gotta do to show you
The way that it's gonna be
Gonna take it, move it,  it down
Gonna send it back to burn in flame
Gonna be all right
It's gonna be all right
Yeah
Shhh it's gonna be all right
Oh yeah yeah yeah all right
I got some John Coltrane on the stereo baby
Make it feel all right
I got some fine wine in the freezer mama
I know what you like
I got some John Coltrane on the stereo baby
Make it feel all right
I got some fine wine in the freezer mama
I know what you like
I got some John Coltrane on the stereo baby
Make it feel all right
I said a man works hard all day
He can do what he wants to
At night
Come on, come on...
(hopefully crowd goes wild here)
She said Hold me tight
I don't think that's what you want
I don't think that's what you want
She said Hold me tight
I don't think that's what you want
Don't think that's what you want
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Hold me tight, hold me tight
Gonna be all rightEmbed
