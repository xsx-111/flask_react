Armed With An Empty Gun LyricsArmed with an empty gun
And no one to call my bluff
The guardsmen at the border
Were afraid to play it rough
I was armed with an empty gun
I was armed with an empty gun
Yeah
I was armed with an empty gun
And nothing to get in my way
My baby aits on the doorstep
Her mother begs her to stay
My head is pounding with fever
And I'm too weary to run
My fingers are limp on the trigger
Cause I'm armed with an empty gun
I was armed with an empty gun
(guitar)
Armed with an empty gun
I was stuck in Santa Fe
This man says What are you holding
Let me put it this way
I said At night I go to sleep
And in the morning I waken
He said I think I know you
I said I think you're mistaken
Gun gun gun gun
Well I was lookin for real persuasion
Then just as I'd begun
He looked in my hand
He walked off away
I was armed with an empty gun
I was armed with an empty gun
I was armed with an empty gun yeah wow
Yeah I couldn't hit it sideways baby
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah
