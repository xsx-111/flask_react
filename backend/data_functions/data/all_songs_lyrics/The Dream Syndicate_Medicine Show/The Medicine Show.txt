The Medicine Show LyricsI've got a Page One story buried in my yard
I've got a troubled mind
I'm going down to the medicine show
If I've got to choose between doing penance
And doing time
I'm going down to the medicine show
I've got a one way ticket on the 8:06
To the outskirts of town
I'm going down to the medicine show
And I'll say, "hey conductor
Now don'tcha stop until you hear that gypsy sound
I'm going down to the medicine show
But I know that it's hard to be a reasonable man
When you stop finding reasons for everything
But tonight I'll get some answers
Down at the medicine show
I'm gonna find me that gypsy girl
That likes to dance and cry
When I go down to the medicine show
And we're gonna lay our burden down
Beneath that lonesome gypsy sky
When I go down to the medicine showEmbed
