Rhinoceros Lyrics
Panda show
Trees and balloons
Ice cream snow
See you in June (June)

Could have known
I would reveal
Should have known
I would conceal your way

She knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
Howâ€™s it
She knows, she knows, she knows
But she knows, she knows

Colors show
After the moon
I should go
See you in June
Your way
She knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's it
She knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows

Open your eyes
To these mustard lies
Open your eyes
To these mustard lies
The way

She knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows
How's it
She knows, she knows, she knows
And she knows, she knows, she knows5Embed
