Suffer LyricsAll that you suffer is all that you are
All that you smother is all that you are
And you're seeing, you're seeing, you're seeing who you are
What takes meaning is cleaning the meaning of who you are
On this seam
I will dream
On this seam
All of you struggles beneath your disguise
You drink from the reasons that hold you alive
To ascend from the wounds of desire and pain
You must rise from the mounds of desire and change
Too late to discover peace of mind
Too late to recover me
All you see and all you breathe and all you cease to be
Taking down your only son and what he means to me
Your dream will be
To dream with me
Will you wait? Yes, I'll wait, I will wait for you
Will you wait? Yes, I'll wait, I will wait for you
To cleanse your life takes more than time
Take what you want, take all of me
Too late to discover peace of mind (I've no peace of mind)
Too late to recover3Embed
