Daydream Lyrics
My daydream seems as one inside of you
Though it seems hard to reach through this life
You're blue and hopeless life
My daydream screams bitter â€™til the end
The love I share, true, selfish to the heart
My heart, my sacred heart

My daydream, dream
My daydream
My daydream, dream
My daydream

I'm going crazy
I'm going crazy
I don't want feelings
Your feelings
I have gone crazy
Motherfucking crazy
I have gone1Embed
