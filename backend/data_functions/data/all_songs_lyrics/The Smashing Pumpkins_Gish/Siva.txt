Siva Lyrics
I spin off and lose my head
Throwing stray, a spark instead
Gather strength down in my heel
And dig it in the world I peel

Way down deep and in my heart
Lies a soul that’s torn apart
Tell me, tell me what you’re after
I just want to get there faster

I don’t live, I inhale
I don’t give, I unveil
Don’t wanna live in your misery
I don’t live, I inhale

Sprinkle all my kisses on your head
Stars full of wishes fill our beds
She said, "I’m dead"


All this pain smothers me
Like a bomb that you can’t see
Tell me, tell me what you’re after
I just want to get there faster
You!
I don’t live, I inhale
I don’t give, I unveil
I don’t live, I inhale
I don’t live1Embed
