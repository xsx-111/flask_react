Bury Me Lyrics
(We're rolling)
(Like an angel)
Bury me in love
Bury me in blood
Shield your kisses
Take your heart
Bury me if it hurts

I love my sister so
Chain, unchain
She don't smother me
Chain, unchain, unchain
I breathe in spades, I know
Unchain
I'm a jack of all trades
Won't you bury me?

Want you to see her born inside
Hide, hide
Some are things you just can't hide
If you see her, tell me why
Hide, hide
Why won't she come outside?
If you see her, tell me why
Hide, hide
Why won't she come outside?
Want you to see her born inside
Hide, hide
Some are things you just can't hide

She waits, bury me
She waits, bury me2Embed
