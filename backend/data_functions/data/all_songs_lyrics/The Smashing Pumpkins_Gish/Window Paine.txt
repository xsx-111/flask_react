Window Paine Lyrics
Window pane
Around my heart
Shadows streak
Around my heart

Do what you're gonna do
And say what you got to say
Do what you're gonna do
Yes, start today
Start today

Wind blow shame
Around my heart
Shadows scream
Around my heart

What are you coming to?
Stripped down to the bone
Laughing, living-ooh!
On your own
All alone
Do what you're gonna do
And say what you got to say
Do what you're gonna do
Yes, start today
Start today1Embed
