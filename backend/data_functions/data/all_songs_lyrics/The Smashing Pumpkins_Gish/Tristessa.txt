Tristessa Lyrics
Pledge your faith, my heart, it breaks
Struggle to renew
Blurry mind, so hypnotized
Fast enough, who?

Wonder
Where you are
Tristessa

Soul takes soul as eye take eye
I will wait for you
What you believe, you’ll wish to receive
Won’t believe you
You-hoo

Hang on
To your life
Tristessa

I love you true
Surely, I do
I love you true
Surely, I do
Surely, I do
Surely, I do (No)
Do you ever wake up and find yourself alone?
Do you ever wake up far from home?
What you believe, you’ll wish to receive
I won’t believe you
Tristessa
