Snail Lyrics
All your seven dreams
Are closer than you believe
As your things come undone
See you are the only one

Flower, seize the hour, the day, away
Waiting, waiting for your way, away

When you wake up your own way
Throwing your life away
Softly, siren coming home
Siren snail
What you wait for

Flower, the pain will wash away, away
When the sun shines
Climbs through your window
Into your bed

When you wake up your own way
Throwing your life away
Softly, siren coming home
Siren snail
Yeah, that's my home
Flower, save the hours
Flower, away

What you wait for-ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Flower, chase the sunshine
Flower, chase the sunshine
