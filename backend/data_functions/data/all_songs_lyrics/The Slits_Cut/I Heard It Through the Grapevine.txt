I Heard It Through the Grapevine Lyrics
I bet, I bet, I bet
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
We're two of a kind, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday

Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
I am just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I know a man ain't supposed to cry, ha
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would mean my life, you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love, love
I heard it through the bass line
How not much longer will you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

People say believe half of what you see
Run and hide from what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For this other guy you knew before?

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be mine
Oh, babe I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other girl you knew before
We're two of a kind, you know I love you more
Do you plan to let me go
For this other guy you knew before?

Just about to lose my mind
I'm just about to lose my mind, honey
I'm just about to lose my mind
And I'm just about to lose my mindEmbed
