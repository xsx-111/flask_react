Barbarism Begins at Home Lyrics
Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand

A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

A crack on the head is what you get for not asking
And a crack on the head is what you get for asking

A crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of who you are!
And a crack on the head is just what you get
Why? Because of what you are!
A crack on the head
Because of the things you said (things you said)
The things you did

Unruly boys who will not grow up
Must be taken in hand
Unruly girls who will not settle down
They must be taken in hand6Embed
