Sweet and Tender Hooligan Lyrics
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he said that he'd never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)
He was a sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
And he swore that he'll never, never do it again
And of course he won't (oh, not until the next time)

Poor old man
He had an accident with a three-bar fire
But that's OK
Because he wasn't very happy anyway
Poor woman
Strangled in her very own bed as she read
But that's OK
Because she was old and she would have died anyway

Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never, never, never, never, never do it again
Not until the next time

Jury, you've heard every word so before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love, you my love, you my love
Jury, you've heard every word but before you decide
Would you look into those "Mother me" eyes?
I love you for you my love, you my love
I love you just for you my love
Don't blame the sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc
Sweet and tender hooligan, hooligan
Because he'll never, never do it again
And in the midst of life we are in death, etc

Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Just will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me, free me?
Jury will you free me?
Will you find me?
Will you free me?
Will you find me?
How will you find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me, find me?
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera... Etcetera!
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera
In the midst of life we are in debt, etc
Oh, oh2Embed
