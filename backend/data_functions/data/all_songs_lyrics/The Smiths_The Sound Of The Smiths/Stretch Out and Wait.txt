Stretch Out and Wait Lyrics
All the lies that you make up
What's at the back of your mind?
Oh, your face I can see and it's desperately kind
But what's at the back of your mind?
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay and general decay
Nature must still find a way
So, ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way, this way, that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down
As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

As we lie, you say
Will the world end in the night time?
I really don't know
Or will the world end in the day time?
I really don't know
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're here and it's now
So, stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you consciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Stretch out and wait
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait, oh2Embed
