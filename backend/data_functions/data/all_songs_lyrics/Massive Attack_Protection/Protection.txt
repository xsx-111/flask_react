Protection Lyrics
This girl I know needs some shelter
But she don't believe anyone can help her
She's doing so much harm, doing so much damage
But you don't wanna get involved
You tell her she can manage
And you can't change the way she feels
But you could put your arms around her
I know you wanna live yourself
But could you forgive yourself
If you left her just the way you found her?

I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection
I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection

You're a boy and I'm a girl
But you know you can lean on me
And I don't have no fear
I'll take on any man here
Who says that's not the way it should be?
I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection
I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection

She's a girl and you're a boy
But sometimes you look so small, you look so small
You've got a baby of your own
When your baby's grown, she'll be the one
To catch you when you fall

I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection
I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection

You're a girl and I'm a boy
You're a girl and I'm a boy, yeah
You're a girl and I'm a boy
You're a girl and I'm a boy, yeah
But sometimes you look so small, you need some shelter
You're just runnin' round and round, helter skelter
And I've leaned on you me for years, now you can lean on me
And that's more than love, that's the way it should be
Now I can't change the way you feel
But I could put my arms around you
That's just part of the deal, that's the way I feel
I'll put my arms around you

I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection
I stand in front of you
I'll take the force of the blow
Protection

You're a boy and I'm a girl
You're a boy and I'm a girl, yeah
You're a boy and I'm a girl
You're a boy and I'm a girl, yeah3Embed
