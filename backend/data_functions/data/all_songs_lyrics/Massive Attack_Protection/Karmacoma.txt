Karmacoma Lyrics
You sure you wanna be with me? I've nothing to give
Won't lie and say this loving's best
Well, leave us in emotional pace
Take a walk, taste the rest, no, take a rest
I've seen you digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy
I need to live and I need to
Your troubles must be seen to see through
Money like it's paper with faces I remember
I drink on a daily basis though it seldom cools my temper
It never cools my temper
Walking through the suburbs though not exactly lovers
You’re a couple, especially when your body's doubled
Duplicate and then you wait for the next Kuwait

You sure you wanna be with me? I’ve nothing to give
Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
You sure you wanna be with me? I’ve nothing to give
Now take a walk, take a rest, taste the rest
Now take a walk, take a rest, a taste of rest
Don't wanna be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
We overcome in sixty seconds
With the strength we have together
But for now, emotional ties, they stay severed
When there's trust there'll be treats
And when we'll funk we'll hear beats

Deflowering my baby, i.e. my baby mate
I must be crazy, see, I'm Swayze
Digging a hole in your neighborhood
You're crazy but you're lazy, must be lazy
Don't wanna be on top of your list
Monopoly and properly kissed
Deflowering my baby, i.e. my baby mate, my baby
Deflowering my baby, i.e. my baby mate
I must be crazy, you must be lazy
