Light My Fire (Live) Lyrics
One more tune, rub it down to the sounds of the Massive
You want more? Hear this now
The sound of Mister Horace Andy

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

Yeah, remix version

The time to hesitate is through
There's no time to wallow in the mire
Try now, we can only lose
And our love become a funeral pyre

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire
 the sounds of Mr. Horace Andy
Original chief rockers the Wild Bunch Crew

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar
If I was to say to you
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

Come on, baby, light my fire
Come on, baby, light my fire
Try to set the night on fire

The sounds of the Massive
Don't forget the man can't sleep Embed
