Better Things Lyrics
Don't drag me down just because you're down
Just cause you're blue don't make me too
And though you've found you need more than me
Don't talk to me about being free

That's freedom without love
And magic without love
And magic without love

Hear me say
Better things will surely come our way
Hear me say
Better things will surely come our way

You say the magic's gone, well, I'm not a magician
You say the spark's gone, well, get an electrician
And save your line about needing to be free
All that's bullshit babe, you just want rid of me

You want freedom without love
And magic without love
And magic without love
Hear me say
Better things will surely come our way
Hear me say
Better things will surely come our way3Embed
