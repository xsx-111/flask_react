Spying Glass Lyrics
You live in the city
You stay by yourself
You avoid all weakness
Still, some people, they brand you, ya
Just because you are rasta

You move to the country
You live in the hills
You avoid all company
When you check it, them a use spying glass
They want to know all your business

You live in the city
You mind your own business
What you see, you don't see
But some people, they always see
They never mind their own business

You move to the country
You live in the hills
You think you're far from the weak
When you check it, them a use spying glass
They want to know rasta business
Spying glass
Spying glass
