Eurochild Lyrics
Sitting in my day care, the art is deco-painted
Blessed by the drink upon the corners where we've seen it
Chased by the plaintiff, haunted by the medium
Too high to flow toward to break the tedium
Glow from my TV set was blue like neon
Activated the remote, I put the BBC on
I've seen this city somewhere, I'm looking out for no one
Pallor in my eyes it get blue like neon
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Isms and schisms, we're living helter-skelter
If you believe I'll deceive then common sense says, "Shall you receive."
Let me take you down the corridors of my life
And when you walk, do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take further evidence
I seem to need a reference to get resident
A reference to your preference to say I'm a good neighbor
I try to say judge me for my labour

I walk in a bar and immediately I sense danger
You look at me, girl, if I was some kind of a, a total stranger
Hysterical, ecstatically no matter, call me stags
Hard to get a drink or a girl to relax
Upon phono, no go zone I go through
Aching awaits just to relocate you
Be careless with your fist
Now baby mix it with me
You see me function better when I get approximately
High by my typical flyby
I function better with the Sun in my eyes, so goodbye
Take a second of me, you beckon I'll be
And when you're sad I'll mourn
And when you tear I'm torn
Take a second of me
Take a second of me
I stand firm for our soil
Lick a rock on foil
Say they juice me, seduce me
Dress me up in Stussy
Show me and I'll stick em
Will you be my vicar?
Take a second of me
Mad over you, mad over me, analogy
Baby tagging up upon my stationary
Sitting in my daycare, me diego painted
Colliding with the jam
Until the drink got dated
Window indigo when they go boom
I run outside my room
No sensing you can trust me
I climb on my sofa
I roll in a daydream
Spliff make daddy go sleep-a-trip dreamEmbed
