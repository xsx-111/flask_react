In Medias Res Lyrics
But let's talk about you for a minute
With the vomit in your gullet
From a half-bottle of vodka
That we'd stolen from the Optic
On the back seat in your car
Because it wasn't safe to start it
You were "far too fucked to drive"
Were the words that you imparted
And the woollen dress that clung so tight
To the contours of your body
And the dead grass stuck to fibres
From us rolling in the lay-by
Were passed to dog-haired blankets
That protected the bench seat covers
And a crucifix was hung
From rear-view mirror by your mother

I'm leaving my body to science
And not medical, but physics
Drag my corpse through the airport
And lay me limp on the left wing
Drop me at the highest point and trace a line around
The dent I leave in the ground
That'll be the initial of the one you will marry
Now I'm not around
I flew for seven hours
The sky didn't once turn black
You know I'd sooner go down in a ball of flames
Than I would lay here and be bored to death
All's well that ends

I wake from sleep, my head and shoulder
Wet against the window
A frost had formed and melted, soaked me
Right through to my collarbone
If you were given the option
Of dying painlessly in peace at forty-five
But with a lover at your side
After a full and happy life
Is this something that would interest you?
Would this interest you at all?1Embed
