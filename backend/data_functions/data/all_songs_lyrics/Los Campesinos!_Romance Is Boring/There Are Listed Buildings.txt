There Are Listed Buildings Lyrics
You glug and you glug
Salt water from sandcastle bucket
You glug and you glug
And the tide turns in your stomach, splash your shoes
You complain the tap water runs solid white
You dangle fishing line for crabs
But they're not interested, I'm your only bite
I watched your face move in a compact mirror
How the powder settles in
Premature crows feet, caused by worry
You say I circle you unwanted
Like a seagull swoops and feeds from bin

(Ah-ooh) There are listed buildings
(Ooh) And woe betide your listed heart
I think I'd do it for love, if it were not for the money
I'll take any scraps that you can give

Come what midnight
You commandeer a fishing boat
Decree to drift further than we could swim
Come what midnight
The neon signs have been unplugged and fade
You danced a jig down at the harbour
Create your own flash show with security lights
I remember being naked to my waist
Though not in which direction
You are a glutton for love
Can you give me some romance? I'm a glutton for sin
We are but two atheists in lust
You know, we gotta make our own luck
(Ah-ooh) There are listed buildings
(Ooh) And woe betide your listed heart
I think I'd do it for love, if it were not for the money
I'll take any scraps that you can give
I think I'd do it for love, if it were not for the money
I'll take any scraps that you can give
I think I'd do it for love, if it were not for the money
I'll take any scraps that you can give1Embed
