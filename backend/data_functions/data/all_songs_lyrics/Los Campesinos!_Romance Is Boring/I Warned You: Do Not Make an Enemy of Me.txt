I Warned You: Do Not Make an Enemy of Me Lyrics
He grows out his stubble just so that he can
Scratch at the sunburn, the colour of my arm
Civilians read bibles behind glass windows
Is this what constitutes normal behaviour?

Got soul, got vision, got mind to leave here
You soon made an enemy of me
I warned you, don't make an enemy of me
I'll take your heart with such little commotion
By crippling disease or with deadly love potion
I'll bind you and gag you and all's well that ends, I suppose

Got a call, are we not interesting?
Fair to say we are not interesting at all
Broke down laughing and screaming for more
But if this changed your life, did you have one before?

And what have we got that is of any use?
Allegiance to team that we cannot pronounce
Image seared, dermis spread across tiled floor
A taste on the tongue that you and me both abhor
Got soul, got vision, got mind to leave here
You soon made an enemy of me
I warned you, don't make an enemy of me
I'll take your heart with such little commotion
By crippling disease or with deadly love potion
I'll bind you and gag you and all's well that ends, I suppose

Got a call, are we not interesting?
Fair to say we are not interesting at all
Broke down laughing and screaming for more
But if this changed your life, did you have one before?Embed
