This Is a Flag. There Is No Wind. Lyrics
Can we all please just calm the fuck down?

In an analogy that makes sense to most
This opportunity, it found me unmarked at the far post
But I blazed it right against the crossbar
Of the pub that you had worked in
Since you moved here from Bath Spa
We agreed we couldn't trust the guy that didn't like a single sport
But those bow-legged suitors hadn't given me much of a thought
They said it smelled delicious, but it smelt of burning flesh
Not meant to be malicious but this is the cross we bear

The story of the winter I forgot how to speak my mind
Was like a nation's flag, but my breeze was too weak
How they dragged me to the hospital saying I had gone deaf
But I heard everything they said, it's just I had no interest


Our friends have put the two of us on suicide watch
And every second spent away we spend watching the clock
There are photos of us holding hands outside of the frame
I was there, but wonder where our fingers were all the same
It's like our self-restraint
It's the size of a fingernail
And then we chew it down
Yeah, we chew it down all the same
Sad eyes for sad goodbyes
It's a crime, it's a crime, it's a crime, it's a crime
The story of the winter I forgot how to speak
My mind was like a nation's flag, but my breeze was too weak
How they dragged me to the hospital saying I had gone deaf
But I heard everything they said, it's just I had no interest1Embed
