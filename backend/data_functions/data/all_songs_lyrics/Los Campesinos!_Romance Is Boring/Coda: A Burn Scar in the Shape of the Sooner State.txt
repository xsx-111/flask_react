Coda: A Burn Scar in the Shape of the Sooner State Lyrics
Run the water 'til it scalds, you know that I'm listening
Pitter-patter runs the shower, hits the bare porcelain
Watch the dirt run down the plughole, hear an echo within
They described you nude in detail, I knew everything
An artist's impression of the Manhattan skyline
And a soon-to-be burn scar
In the perfect shape of the Sooner State
I fall to my knees, my piss-soaked jeans
The first time, the last time, all the times in between
The first time, the last time
All the times I would've liked there to have been

I can't believe I chose the mountains every time you chose the sea
I can't believe I chose the mountains every time you chose the sea
I can't believe I chose the mountains every time you chose the seaEmbed
