Who Fell Asleep In Lyrics
She turned her back on the church
And put all her faith in me
At the back of the chapel
Where I taught her to screw and to blaspheme
We turned our backs to the church
With our trousers around our knees
While screaming the scriptures
She said I was her favourite heresy

In a note, I read, "If you should go blind and deaf
I'll cleanse and I'll bathe you and I'll cook for you daily
I will take a dry ballpoint pen and trace on your chest
All of the same conversations that we have now in bed"
I don't mean to be selfish
But I think I'd sooner just be dead

Behind the tennis court, alongside the river
Not a single live flower to see
This is the one girl who woke up from all that
And now falls asleep next to me
But I swear now
Every time that I kiss her
She feels her god breathe on her shoulder
It pains me, but I'm sure she's still yours
She said she wanted a sea burial
Not grass and hypodermics to her hips
I pruned the ivy from your grandmother's tomb
More tender and careful than the superstitious
Ripped you from your mother's womb

In a note, I wrote, "I think too much about the end
But being around it made me feel like I'm coping
Now when I view the cemetery, I don't see headstones
I see rows of engraved middle teeth, hungry, waiting for me"
And though I am fearful
I think I just crave the relief

Behind the tennis court, alongside the river
A paper flower's still a beautiful thing
This is the one girl who woke up from all that
And now falls asleep next to me
But I swear now
Every time that I kiss her
She feels her god breathe on her shoulder
It pains me, but I'm sure she's still yoursEmbed
