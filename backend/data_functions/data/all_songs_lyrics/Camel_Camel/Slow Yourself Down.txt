Slow Yourself Down LyricsYou tell me you're searching for a new place
You tell me tomorrow will have a true face
You say that I don't understand
When you speak of your summertime land
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along
You tell me your past often hurt you
And even your friends, they would desert you
But now you are beginning to see
The same things have happened to me
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming along
You tell me your dreams have been broken
And not enough words have been spoken
The time has come to see it through
Slow down 'cause I'm coming with you
Just slow yourself down, I'm coming alongEmbed
