Mystic Queen LyricsHave you seen the mystic queen
Riding in her limousine
Over hills and over dales 'til morning
If you like I'll take you there
Find some colours you can wear
Colours that you've only seen while sleeping
Have you seen the mystic queen
Riding in her limousine
Over hills and over dales 'til morning
If you like I'll take you there
Find some colours you can wear
Colours that you've only seen while sleepingEmbed
