Curiosity LyricsSail, sail away
There you go
To a place you know
Why not let me come along
I won't tell no one
Now our bodies have entwined
Touch me with your mind
Your dreams are a mystery
Please share them with me
Curiosity is killing me
I just got to know
Curiosity is killing me
I just got to know
Where, tell me where...
Where are you sailing?
Sail, sail away
There you go
To a place you know
Why not let me come along
I won't tell no one
Sail, sail away
Sail, sail away...Embed
