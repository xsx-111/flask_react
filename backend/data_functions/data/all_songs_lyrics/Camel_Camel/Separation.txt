Separation LyricsYou know we're fighting every day
It's as if somehow we've lost our way
When we'd first begun, yeah, we lived as one
Now as time goes on, we move our own way
It's just no use in going on
When all the feeling now has gone
You know we both have tried, yeah, we both have lied
Now as tears subside, we move our own ways, yeah
Separation's the only way
Separation starts today
You know we're fighting every day
It's as if somehow we've lost our way
When we'd first begun, yeah, we lived as one
Now as time goes on, we move our own ways
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
