Never Let Go (Single Version) LyricsCrazy preachers of our doom
Telling us there is no room
Not enough for all mankind
And the seas of time are running dry
Don't they know it's a lie...
Man is born with the will to survive
He'll not take no for an answer
He will get by, somehow he'll try
He won't take no, never let go, no...
I hear them talk about Kingdom Come
I hear them discuss Armageddon...
They say the hour is getting late
But I can still hear someone say
This is not the way...
