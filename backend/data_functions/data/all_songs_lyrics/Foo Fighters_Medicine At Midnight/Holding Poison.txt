Holding Poison Lyrics
I got this thing and I've been taking it out on you
Taking it out on you, poor you
Like a machine that's always breaking down on you
Breaking down on you, so true

I spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
And then out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
You know what I mean? I meant what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down

I get the feeling that there ain't nothing that I can do
Nothing will get me through, so blue
Sometimes I dream, I can dream, I can dream
And then I bleed, and I bleed, and I bleed
I get the feeling that there ain't nothing that I can do
I spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Spin around, around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I gеt what I get
You know what I mean? I meant what I said
Holding thе poison down
Holding the poison down


Stand around, around, around
Stand around, around, around
Stand around, around, around
Out of the blue

Holding the poison down
Holding the poison down
Something to drown you out
I'm holding the poison down
You know I want what I want, I get what I get
You know what I mean? I meant what I said
Holding the poison down
Holding the poison downEmbed
