Medicine at Midnight Lyrics
Say a prayer and close the light, thumb upon the scale
The pillow is cold, that ship has sailed
Time has run the river dry, dry as a twisted trail
Into the bone, I'm into it

Ever get the feeling nothing else will do?
I can hear you singing, pink turned to blue
Was it your graffiti? Did you write your name?
On the dirty ceiling, I can't explain

I need medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight calling, but it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know I'm yours

I remember dancing hard under the dead moon
Howling with you, howling

Ever get the feeling nothing else will do?
I can hear you singing, I can't explain

I need medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight, howling, but it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know I'm yours
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes

Medicine at midnight, but it ain't no cure
Medicine at midnight, howling, but it ain't no cure
I may be sick, but you know I'm yours

Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes
Rain on the dance floor, back against the ropes1Embed
