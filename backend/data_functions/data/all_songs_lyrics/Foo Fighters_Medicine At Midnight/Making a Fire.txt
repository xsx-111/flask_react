Making a Fire Lyrics
I've been waiting, elevating
Hanging on the line
Hate to say it, your new favorite’s
Going out of style
Threw away those broken heroes
They're just wood and wires
Hallelujah, spread the news, but
Don't believe the hype

Alright
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

But if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I’ve waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm making a fire

I was begging when I said I'd
Never tell a lie
Luck be damned, I took a stand and
Finally hit my stride
Bye, bye
Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

But if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It's time to ignite
I'm making a fire

Are you afraid of the dark?
I know a place we can start

So if this is the last time
Make up your mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It’s down to the wire
This is the last time
I’ve made up my mind
I've waited a lifetime to live
It’s time to ignite
I'm making a fireEmbed
