Chasing Birds Lyrics
Chasing birds to get high
My head is in the clouds
Chasing birds to get by
I'm never coming down
My heart is six feet underground

The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Dark inventions of mine
The road to hell is paved with broken parts
Bleeding hearts like mine

Chasing birds through the sky
And deep into the black
Chasing birds, say goodbye
I'm never coming back
Here comes another heart attack

The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Dark inventions of mine
The road to hell is paved with broken parts
Bleeding hearts like mine
Chasing birds to get high
I'm never coming down
My heart is six feet underground

The road to hell is paved with good intentions
Dark inventions of mine
The road to hell is paved with broken parts
Bleeding hearts like mine

Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds
Chasing birds
