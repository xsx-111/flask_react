Love Dies Young Lyrics
Love dies young and there's no resuscitation
Once it's done, no regeneration
It's a losing game that'll make you play
Your hand against your chest, love dies young

Love dies young and there's no reanimation
Once it's gone, no regeneration
It's a bitter kiss that'll make you wish
You never had a taste

Love dies young, oh
Love dies young, oh
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love's so dumb, so what's the fascination?
Leaves you numb with a nasty reputation
When you lose your head and lights go out
You'll never be the same

Love dies young, oh
Love dies young, oh
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young
Never-ending cemeteries, funeral parades
All your dreams are buried in their place

Love dies young
Love dies young
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young


Love dies young
Love dies young
Please don't take my breath
Don't take my breath away
Love dies young

Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young
Love dies young1Embed
