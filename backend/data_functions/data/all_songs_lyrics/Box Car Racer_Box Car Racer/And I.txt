And I Lyrics

I am lost in the crowd
I'm standing in line, I'm feeling so down
And I am full of doubt
She's not the one, take notice, hear me out

And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through

I'm tired, this game's so dumb
She never played, her race is won
I'm tired, can't smile no more
I'll sure cave in just like before

And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through
And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through

I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through
And I want her, need her
And you always will pull me through

And I want her, need her
And I want her, need her
And I want her, need her
And I, and I, and I1Embed
