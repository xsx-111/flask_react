There Is Lyrics
This vacation's useless, these white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this thirteen hour drive
I missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you, but you swear you loved me more

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
There is

Those notes you wrote me, I've kept them all
I've given a lot of thought of how to write you back this Fall
With every single letter, in every single word
There will be a hidden message about a boy that loves a girl

Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
There is
Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
Do you care if I don't know what to say?
Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?
That there's someone out there who feels just like me?
