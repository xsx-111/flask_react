Sorrow Lyrics
Because I need you more than you need me
Because I want you more, I know

Because we move too fucking fast
I think I really had to wish to make this last, I know

I'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you would

Because I cared way more
Because I really felt that you felt so much more, I know

I'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you would
I'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you could

I'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you would
I'm sorry please forgive me, believe me if you could
Believe me if you could3Embed
