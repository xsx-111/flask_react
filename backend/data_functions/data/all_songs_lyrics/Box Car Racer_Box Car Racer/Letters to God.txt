Letters to God Lyrics
Caught off guard, all worked up
The air is as dark and cold as night
Let me go, I'm not done
I swear I'll take just one lifetime

And I, I won't lie, I won't sin
Maybe I don't wanna go
Can't you wait?
Maybe I don't wanna go

I should have asked, I could have helped
At least a fucking 1.000 times before
Will this offer get me in
Or does this prove that they gave more?

And I, I won't lie, I won't sin
Maybe I don't wanna go
Can't you wait?
Maybe I don't wanna go

And I, I won't lie, I won't sin
Maybe I don't wanna go
Can't you wait?
Maybe I don't wanna go
And I, I won't lie, I won't sin
Maybe I don't wanna go
Can't you wait?
Maybe I don't wanna go6Embed
