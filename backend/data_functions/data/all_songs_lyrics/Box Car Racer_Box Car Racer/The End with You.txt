The End with You Lyrics
Our days are running thin
Our hopes will start to fall
I can feel the world collapse around me
From within
And letters keep coming by
To let us know when time will die
And please God will you forgive us
And give us one more try

If you will then we'll go
As fast as we go far
Maybe we'll be forgotten
When the world is torn apart

I've been up all night long
Counting days that all went wrong
I opened my bedroom window
I wish this pain was gone
There are no useful drugs
To escape from feeling numb
I remember an amazing birthday
I remember when I was young
If you will then we'll go
As fast as we go far
Maybe we'll be forgotten
When the world is torn apart
Cause the sun won't be so blinding
And the rains will finally come
The ashes will slowly pile up
Just to prove we're finally done

If you will then we'll go
As fast as we go far
Maybe we'll be forgotten
When the world is torn apart
Cause the sun won't be so blinding
And the rains will finally come
The ashes will slowly pile up
Just to prove we're finally done3Embed
