My First Punk Song Lyrics
24 to nothing and I'm at the intersection
Waiting for the light that's green
Waiting for a reason
Take them all and stack them up
Not in my collection
Hit them all and watch them fly
Fuck them all and watch them drown

What is with these bands that keep coming with their politics
They never went to school to find out that they were full of shit
Didn't really either
But fuck I guess it really doesn't matter
You took this time to listen to me
So I'll say hey I fucked your brother

There's one problem
I got brownies
From your mother
It gave me syphilis
I got no dick!

There's one problem
I got brownies
From your mother
And it gave me syphilis
I got no dick!
Fuck yeah!Embed
