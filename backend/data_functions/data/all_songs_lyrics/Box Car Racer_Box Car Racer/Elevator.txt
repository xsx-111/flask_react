Elevator Lyrics
The building turned it's back ignored my call
The concrete looks too thin to break my fall
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I counted people as I neared the street below
Whoa-oa-oa, below
Whoa-oa-oa

I saw it all, I saw it all go down
The shadow grew as he approached the ground
The sunset stretched across this nighttime scene
I turned away as he came near the street below
Whoa-oa-oa, below
Whoa-oa-oa, below

Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on
Let's forget this all, move on1Embed
