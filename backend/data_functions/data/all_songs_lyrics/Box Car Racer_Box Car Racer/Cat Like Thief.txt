Cat Like Thief Lyrics
I fell down again
But I can't complain
Another false step
Could drive me insane
I only got myself here to blame
So I shake off defeat and I start again
Oh no I said
I wanna go back
But I can't win the shit
And I'm gonna stay on track
Yeah, make a deal like that
I keep my head up
But I never react

I wrote it down at least a month ago
16 chapters of one thing you've blown
The best thing yet to help you
Through and through that she was
I feel her more than you
Don't leave
Don't leave her

(Yeah!)
I get up, kust to get knocked back down
I sit up, just to get knocked all around
I wanna say something, but you're out of town
I don't wanna have another short down
Say stand up, hey, yo, let's make it clear
Follow you home, no, you were not there
You saw me coming, jump, you disappear
Home alone every night, seems so clear
You think you see me here all alone
Got my crew coming now, one by one
Two by two, three by three
Four by four, let's do some more
Call me back when word is that she's gone
Cat-like thief, she stole air from my lungs
Leave me standing on this lonely grave
I dug it out in case she turns away

Don't leave
(Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her)
Don't leave her
(Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her)
Don't leave
(You think you see me here all alone
Got my crew coming now, one by one)
Don't leave her
(Two by two, three by three
Four by four, let's do some more)
Don't leave
(Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her)
Don't leave her
(Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her
Don't leave, don't leave, don't leave her)
Don't leave
Don't leave her
Don't leave
Don't leave her6Embed
