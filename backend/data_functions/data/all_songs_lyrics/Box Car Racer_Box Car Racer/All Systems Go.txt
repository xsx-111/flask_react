All Systems Go Lyrics
I left my fear behind me
Of those lights out by the station
The government is lying
The youth they won't believe them

We can't go wrong, can't get
Fucked this time
Speak up now, lose or get
Left behind

When will this be over?
This cold and bitter season
The government is lying
The truth is found with reason

We can't go wrong, can't get
Fucked this time
Speak up now, lose or get
Left behind
We can't go wrong, can't get
Fucked this time
Speak up now, lose or get
Left behind

We can't go wrong, can't get
Fucked this time
Speak up now, lose or get
Left behind

We are the underrated
All forgotten kids who made it
Speak up now, lose or get
Left behind1Embed
