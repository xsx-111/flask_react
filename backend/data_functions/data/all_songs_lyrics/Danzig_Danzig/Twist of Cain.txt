Twist of Cain Lyrics
Yea, yea, yea
Ooh
I can feel it move me
Feel it shove me
As I break the law
Said yea
I can feel its jabbing
Cuts the numbness then I
I come alive yea

Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Cause its a
Yea twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive

Said yea
I took it standing
Broke commandments
And he tumbled like a toy
Blood
Like this crimson highway
Spreading out
From his forehead to the ground
Twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Cause its a
Yea twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Wo-oh, yea

Wo-oh God above
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart, well
Whoa-oh
Wanna know
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below, yea

Yea
I know my breeding
Know my father
He was born of light
Said yea
Can't hardly stand it
Cuts me down the middle
Then I
I come alive yea
Twist of Cain
Yea it drives my brain up
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Cause its a
Yea twist of Cain
Yea drives my brain up
Yea twist of Cain
Make me come alive
Come alive
Wo-oh, yea

Wo-oh
God above
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart, yea
Whoa-oh
Wanna know
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Feel a twist of Cain
Inside a beating heart
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Got a little twist of Cain
From the God below, yea1Embed
