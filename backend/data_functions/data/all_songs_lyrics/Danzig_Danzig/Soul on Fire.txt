Soul on Fire Lyrics
Angels fall to earth
World heats down, cool
Now your heart is cold
Waiting on the summer

Of my soul
Of my soul
Of my soul

Devil-girl you must burn
Burn at the touch
Of autumn's breath
Burn that heart of cold
Simmering in the Samhain
Of my soul

Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire

Angels fall to earth
World heats down
Oh, now your heart is cold
Waiting on the summer
Of my soul
Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire
Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire

Come wrap my love in your house of ice
Melt you down more than once or twice
Make you shake till worlds align
See your body tremble with the blood on fire
Cause the season in my veins
Will end your world
To the season of the flames you must pray and learn
Change all the things that you've ever seen
Change all vision
Kill all endings

Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire
Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire
Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fire
Gotta wait
On the Samhain of my soul, yeah!
Gonna bring your world
Down in fireEmbed
