The Hunter Lyrics
Call me The Hunter, that's my name
Pretty young thing like you is my only game
Don't use no love gun, don't need no kissing
When I get a'hold of you honey
Gonna' light you up like Christmas
Ain't no use to run, babe, ain't no use to hide
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my burning

Call me Deliverance, that's what I offer thee
Gonna' do a million little things to you honey
Your life belongs to me
Don't use no love gun, don't need no kissing
When I get a'hold of you honey
Rip you up to pieces, ain't no use to run, babe
Ain't no use to hide, 'cause I've got you in -
The grip of my endless desire

I don't use no love gun, don't need no kissing
When I get a'hold of you honey
Light you up like Christmas
Ain't no use to run, babe ain't no use to hide
'Cause I've got you in the sights of myEmbed
