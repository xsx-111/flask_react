Evil Thing Lyrics
I serve my perdition in this private Hell
A thousand angers have kept me alive
Carve a hole in your distorted soul
I'm here to bang it, yeah

Blessing is a curse
Seduction and thirst
Feeds the hunger that burns inside
Take a little caution when you look my way
See the emptiness in my eyes
And the evil thing
That I bring
Soulless light, yeah

Warning is come upon your heels
Feel your dreams slip away
Take a little caution in the dead of night
Let the darkness rise again

Want the needing, want to feel you near...
Want you, need your, life
Want you, need your, life
Feed it to me
Yeah
Blessing is a curse
Seduction and thirst
Feeds the hunger that burns inside
Take a little caution when you look my way
See the emptiness in my eyes
Yeah, yeah

Want the needing
Want to feel you near - Want your soul
Want you, need your, life
Want you, need your, life
Yeah!1Embed
