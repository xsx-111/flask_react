Am I Demon Lyrics
Hordes of faces, empty eyes, I see nothing new
Seasoned schemes of slimy curs
Offer up their flu

Am I beast or, am I human? Am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling
Reaching out for you...
Am I demon? You need to know!

Faces of a million hells, rage inside these veins
Pounding out deserved pain to anyone in need

Am I beast or, am I human? Am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling
Reaching out for you...
Am I demon? You need to know!

Demon am I?
No way!
Whoa!
Whoa, yeah!
Am I demon? You need to know!
Need to know!
Demon am I?
Oh, well then I like it!
Whoa!
Whoa, yeah!

Every world and every limb, torn asunder base
Everything I need is me - Everything I am

Am I beast or, am I human? Am I just like you?
Power seething, really reeling
Reaching out for you!
Am I demon? You need to know!

Demon am I?
Oh, then I like it!
Whoa!
Whoa, yeah!

Am I demon? Need to know!3Embed
