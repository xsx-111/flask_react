End of Time LyricsThe suffering's here, the wait is gone
The streets are filled with a hollow song
Got a new death, it lurks outside
Follows me home, waiting for me

Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah

A hum in the ear, numbness comes
Feeling like you're almost home
The open arms, tempting embrace
It's always been waiting

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too, yeah

The suffering's here, the wait is gone
The streets are filled with a hollow song
Empty world of listless night
I pray to thee, I suffer blind

Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah
Waiting at the end of time for you
And you'll be too, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeah
Lost your soul, doomed and cold, yeahEmbed
