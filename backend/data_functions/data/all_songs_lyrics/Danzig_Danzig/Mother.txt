Mother Lyrics
Mother
Tell your children not to walk my way
Tell your children not to hear my words
What they mean
What they say
Mother
Mother
Can you keep them in the dark for life?
Can you hide them from the waiting world?
Oh mother
Father
Gonna take your daughter out tonight
Gonna show her my world
Oh father

Not about to see your light
But if you want to find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding

Not about to see your light
And if you want to find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Mother
Tell your children not to hold my hand
Tell your children not to understand
Oh mother
Father
Do you want to bang heads with me
Do you want to feel everything
Oh father

Not about to see your light
But if you want to find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding

Not about to see your light
And if you want to find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Yeah!


Not about to see your light
But if you want to find hell with me
I can show you what it's like
Till you're bleeding
Not about to see your light
And if you want to find hell with me
I can show you what it's
Whoa
Mother
Yeah!20Embed
