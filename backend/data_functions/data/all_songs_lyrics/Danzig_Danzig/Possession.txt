Possession Lyrics
I want to crawl inside your soul
Nestle in your brain
Stand you on your head
Crouch you on all fours
Oh I will walk among your dreams
When you think you are asleep
The invitation of your mind
Beckons me to your sin

All the things that you say and feel

For I will be inside your speech
Say the words you must not say
For I will lurk inside your heart
If you can take it and survive

(Spiritus)
As it must ever be
Oppression
(Incubus)
It's ever been
Through my oppressive black sleeping
(Spiritus)
It has always been
Possession
(Incubus)
As it must always be
All the things that you say and feel
Become
Possession, riding
Possession, riding you hard
Possession, riding you on

And I will worm inside your skull
Make you beg to be my whore
Do my bidding day and night
If you can take it and survive

(Incubus)
As it must ever be
Oppression
(Incubus)
It's ever been
Through my oppressive black sleeping
(Incubus)
It has always been
Possession
(Incubus)
As it must always be
All the things that you say and feel
Become
Possession, riding
Possession, riding you hard
Possession, riding onto you
Possession, riding
Possession, riding you hard
Possession, riding you onEmbed
