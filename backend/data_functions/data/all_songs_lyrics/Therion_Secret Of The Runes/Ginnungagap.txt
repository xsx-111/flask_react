Ginnungagap Lyrics(The Black hole)
(In the beginning there was a void, a big gap of darkness, filled with the primal forces of creation. The heat of Muspel and the ice of Nifel made the essence of life come forth from the void. The first living being, The Giant Ymer, was born out of darkness and he is the ancestor of the creatures of the universe. The world was formed from his slaughtered body. Ginnungagap is the black hole from which everything came out and into which everything will return in the end.)
Fall deep into Void
(in the) black hole of Nothing
(Soprano:)
Hail, Flow of Vergelmar
Hail, Flow of Vergelmar
Hail, Flow of Vergelmar
Hail, Old Void!
(Alto:)
Hail, Flow of Vergelmar
Heat of creation
Hail, Flow of Vergelmar
Hail, Old Void!
(Tenor/bass:)
Spark in the Nothingness
Heat of creation
Make the ice start to melt
Life wake up in the void
Ymer is born, fire and ice
Chaos will form, Megin will rise
Fader Ymer drack från urkon
En ström av mjölk som gav oss liv
Öppna gapet i rymdens mitt
Flöda av blod från Ymers kropp
Världar skapas utav hans kött
Nio (till) antal på Yggdrasil
Ymers gap - Ymers runa
Ymers ond - Ymers urlagEmbed
