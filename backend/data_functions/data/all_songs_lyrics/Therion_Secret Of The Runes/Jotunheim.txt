Jotunheim LyricsSomewhere behind the border of the known world you may hear the drumming and the heavy steps of the giants. They are born out of the primeval forces of nature and descend from the time when not even gods were born. Their brutal power is only surpasses by their wisdom, since the old age of the giants have made them see what neither gods nor men ever will
JOTUNHEIM
- Call of Jotunheim -
Jotunheim, Call the Giants
Of Chaos, all the wolves of
Jarnveden, all the darkness of Utg책rd!
Call the Jotunheim!
Beware the Giants, the Thurizas
Beyond the border of everything
In Utg책rd the ancient live
And they bear old memories
You can hear them cry beyond Eli waves
Angerboda, call her name in the dark
Hail!
Jotunheim, Call the Giants
Of Chaos, all the wolves of
J채rnveden, all the darkness of Utg책rd!
Call the Jotunheim!
Listen to Mimer, come to his well
You watch the water of memory
If you listen to the Old
They will take you to the past
You may hear Manegarm hown again
Angerboda, watch her call on the wolves
Hail!
Thursar! Jotunheimr!
Resar! Jotunheimr!
Jotnar! Jotunheimr!Embed
