Vanaheim LyricsTake the seed of Frej
Put it in the sacred soil
Make it come alive
And fertility will rise
Enter Vanaheim
Where dead will come alive
Magic of Freja
Take you to another world
By the trance of sejd
(The) sibyl see into your soul
Enter Vanaheim
And you will know thy self
Vana-king and queen
Lord and Lady of the gods
If you sacrifice
They'll release your fylgia
Enter Vanaheim
And find your totem-beast
By the seed of Ing
(Your) fylgia will take you high
Find it in your blood
From the days of Vanir war
Enter Vanaheim
And you will fly in the fair fields
With the gods, foreverEmbed
