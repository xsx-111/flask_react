Ljusalfheim LyricsThe shining ones, the elves and fairies, are beings of enchanting beauty. They act as a thought or a fantasy and it could be easy for you to be led astray by their splendid light. You may be lifted on their wings to the highest of skies, but beware... in the next moment they may let you fall
LJUSALFHEIM
- The Shining Ones -
Solar glare from Lord Frej
The Shining One
In Ljusalfheim he's King of elves
High above the rainbow
And in the tarn deep in the wood
You'll find elves
Follow their light
It's brighter than the sun
It makes you fly...
In the realm of Alfheim
You never know what you have seen
A pale mirage?
Beauty makes you sunblind
It fills your mind
You fly away and lose your mind
Fly with their wings
They make you feel so free
But you may fall...
Flee from their light
They'll maybe drag you down
Or make you fly...Embed
