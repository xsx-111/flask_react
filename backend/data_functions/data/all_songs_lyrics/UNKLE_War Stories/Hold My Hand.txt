Hold My Hand Lyrics
Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how
Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how

Are you living the feeling
The hights are they worth seeking
Nothing like believing
Are your drugs healing

Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how
Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how
Are you really living
Or do you seek loving
Are you happy being
Or do you search for meaning
Are you ever asking
Questions they need answering
You're not really hearing
You really need releasing

A million pieces broken
A million secrets unspoken
A million pieces broken
A million secrets unspoken

Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how
Hold my hand
I need you now
Slow me down
I don't know how
Secrets everywhere
Secrets everywhere
Secrets everywhere
Secrets everywhereEmbed
