Persons & Machinery LyricsWe're all getting so tired of you
The things you say
The things you do
Oh please just follow your great plan through
We've all had it
We've had it
We've had it with you
Home sick with some imaginary flu
You wanna get drafted
We wanna get seen
Oh please just follow your great plan through
We've all had it
We've had it
We've had it with you
Trying to feel good
We all lost our hearts
Trying to feel good
We all lost our hearts
Trying to feel good
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa...
We're all getting so tired of you
The things you say
The things you do
Oh please just follow your great plan through
We've all had it
We've had it
We've had it with you
We all lost our hearts
We all lost our hearts
Trying to feel good
We all lost our hearts
We all lost our hearts
Trying to feel good1Embed
