Mistress LyricsMy footsteps echo in early night
I see my shadows secret
It won't belong
My heart beats to a rhythm
I'm come closing in on a designation
I walk through the elevator door
As I'm risen I begin to hear
Feel you a lot alone
A cold wind bites all around me
But I'm warm on the inside
I don't need no drug tonight
This nights gonna change me forever
This room says anything goes
All I need is to be alive tonight
I breathe the smells around me
I'm choking but I want more
You're closing in
Oh mistress come to me
Come to me, come, come to me
A cold wind bites all around me
But I'm warm on the inside
I don't need no drug tonight
This nights gonna change me forever
This room says anything goes
Oh what a pity his alive tonight...Embed
