Twilight Lyrics
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
Look at us
Look at this
Take a look
Person you see
Danny is my name
Painted a train
Once happy planets
Revolving again
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
Look at me
Look at this
Take a look
Person you see
Danny is my name
Painted a train
Once happy planets
Revolving again
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
Look that it's pretty
Picture that if you will
The crossroads
Drunken person you can touch
It's wild idol lifestyle
It's wild idol lifestyle
Look at me
Look at this
Take a look
The person you see
Danny is my name
Painted a train
Once happy planets
Revolving againEmbed
