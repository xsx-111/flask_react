Price You Pay Lyrics
No one can tell me just why it is
That it always has to come to this
Fix it up
Throw it away
I don't get it
The price you pay
Theres no sense no matter what you say
What sticks inside ain't gonna fade away

Fix it up
Throw it away
I don't care
It's the price you pay

I'm fallin' away
I'm fallin' away
I'm fallin' away
I'm fallin' away

You say don't pay
You say don't pay
Too high
Too low

Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away

You say don't pay
You say don't pay
You say don't pay
You say don't pay

Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' away
Fallin' awayEmbed
