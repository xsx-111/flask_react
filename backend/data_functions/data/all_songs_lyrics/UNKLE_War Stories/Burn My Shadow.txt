Burn My Shadow Lyrics
I have burned my tomorrows
And I stand inside today
At the edge of the future
And my dreams all fade away
I have burned my tomorrows
And I stand inside today
At the edge of the future
And my dreams all fade away

And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away

I faced my destroyer
I was ambushed by a lie
And you judge me once for falling
This wounded heart will rise

And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away

(When I see the light, true love forever)
(When I see the light, true love forever)
(When I see the light, true love forever)
(When I see the light, true love forever)
(When I see the light, true love forever)
Burn my shadow
(When I see the light, true love forever)
(When I see the light, true love forever)
Burn my shadow
(When I see the light, true love forever)
Away

And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away

Oh, how I loved you4Embed
