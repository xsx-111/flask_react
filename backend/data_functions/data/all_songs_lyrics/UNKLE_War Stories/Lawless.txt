Lawless LyricsIn the dead of night
I become someone else
Cut all my ties
Blow my mind off the shelf
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, up all night
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, no restraint
Let it rise
Way out of control
You can't disguise
What's inevitable
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, up all night
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, no restraint
In the dead of night
I become someone else
Cut all my ties
Blow my mind off the shelf
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, up all night
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, no restraint
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, up all night
We're a lawless brigade
Up all night, no restraintEmbed
