Mayday Lyrics
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my love
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my nerve
These stars are descending
These scars are discerning
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my nerve

I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my love
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my nerve
These stars are descending
These scars are discerning
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my love


I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my love
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my nerve
These stars are descending
These scars are discerning
I ebb and you flow
It's uh, a bit screwed
But you can't catch my loveEmbed
