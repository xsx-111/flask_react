Keys To The Kingdom Lyrics
I shoot it low
Kill the flow
Ruin myself out on the North shore
I make it one, watch the sun
Sink behind the trees with the keys to the kingdom

I shoot it high, let it fly
Bury myself under a blue sky
I see a scheme, make it clean
Drown in blue rivers under a muffled scream

Call your number wishing I could make amends
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again

I hit it down, kill the sound
Ruin myself out on the Northbound
I make it one, kill the sun
Bury my disease with the keys to the kingdom

Call your number wishing I could make amends
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again
I shoot it low
(Shoot it low)
I kill the flow
(Kill the flow)
Ruin myself out on the North shore

Call your number wishing I could make amends
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face again

Call your number wishing I could make amends
And I'm caught in a space between my head and my face againEmbed
