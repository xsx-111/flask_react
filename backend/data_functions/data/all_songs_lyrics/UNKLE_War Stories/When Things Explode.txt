When Things Explode Lyrics
Your skull froze little lives
In shadows where you hide
A life that was designed
You've been cheated, oh so blind
You laid it on the line
These twisted words of time
And how your spirit shines
I wish that you were mine

Yeah, lately
I know that I've been crawling
I know that I've been falling
Into your dream

Imagine no more tears
Dissolving all your fears
With tooth and claw we fight
Into this endless night

Yeah, lately
I know that I've been crawling
I know that I've been falling
Into your dream
I saw my tears in your eyes
You saw your tears in mine
We watched it burn together
I saw my fears in your eyes
You saw your fear in mine
We watched it burn together

Watched it burn
Burn, yeah, burn
Watched it burn
Burn, yeah, burn
Watched it burn
Burn, watched it burn
Watched it burn
Burn, watched it burn

All is forgivenEmbed
