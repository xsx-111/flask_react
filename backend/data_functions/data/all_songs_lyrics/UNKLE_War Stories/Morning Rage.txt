Morning Rage LyricsSomething burns inside me, man
Can't explain or understand
Anger rage and warcraft
Fear and fate and lullaby
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
Something burns inside me, man
Won't explain or understand
Seeking truth for someone's eyes
Crowed lows and lonely highs
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
What was it all about
Something's tell me inside out
Some put myself around
You should pull me in and turn me out
What was it all about
Something's tell me inside out
Some put myself around
You should pull me in and turn me out
Something burns inside me, man
Don't explain or understand
Come in peace or walk away
.... don't like to say
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
What was it all about
Something's tell me inside out
Some put myself around
You should pull me in and turn me out
What was it all about
Something's tell me inside out
Some put myself around
You should pull me in and turn me out
Nothing lasts forever, man
Nothing lasts forever, man
Nothing lasts forever, man
Nothing lasts forever, man
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake up
I wake up, I wake upEmbed
