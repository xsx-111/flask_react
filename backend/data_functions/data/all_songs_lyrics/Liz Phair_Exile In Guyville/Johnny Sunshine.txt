Johnny Sunshine LyricsYou took the car, it was my favorite one
A little white Dart, and drove it to Idaho
You took the horse, it was a thoroughbred
Saddled it up out on the interstate
You killed the cat, burned it in antifreeze
Dumped in the trunk with the rest of the cattlefeed
You took the house, you went and changed the locks
Now I am stuck living out of a box
I think I've been taken
For everything I own
I've been hurt so badly
I'm alone, baby, I'm alone
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing
You left me nothing
Johnny Sunshine
You left me nothing...
