Soap Star Joe Lyrics
He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for something attractive to save
They say he rode in on the back of a pick-up
And he won't leave town till you remember his name

He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for some lonely billboard to grace
They say he sprung from the skull of Athena
Think about your own head and the headache he gave

He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for action at a price he can pay
They say he's famous, but no one can prove it
Make him an offer just to see what he'll say

Check out the dashboard lights
Glowing all green and white
He feels safe in the dark
He wears his bluejeans tight

He's just a hero in a long line of heroes
Looking for something attractive to save
They say he rode in on the back of a pick-up
And he won't leave town till you remember his name
Check out the thinning hair
Check out the aftershave
Check out America
You're looking at it, babeEmbed
