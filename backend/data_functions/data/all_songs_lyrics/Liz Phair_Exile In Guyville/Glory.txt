Glory Lyrics
He's got a really big tongue
It rolls way out
Snaking around in the club
It slicks you down
Scratching his face like a bum
He pulls you back
Circa nineteen-eighty-one
He pulls you back

You are, you are shining some glory
You are, you are shining some glory
On me, on me
You are, you are shining some glory
You are, you are shining some glory on meEmbed
