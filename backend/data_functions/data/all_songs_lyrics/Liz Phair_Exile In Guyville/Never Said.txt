Never Said Lyrics
Yeah

I never said nothing
I never said nothing
I never said nothing
I never said nothing

I don't know where you heard it
Don't know who's spreadin' it 'round
All I know is I'm clean as a whistle, baby
I didn't utter a sound

I never said nothing
I never said nothing
I never said nothing
I never said nothing

I don't know what they told you
Don't even care what about
All I know is I'm clean as a whistle, baby
I didn't let the cat out
So don't look at me sideways
Don't even look me straight on
And don't look at my hands in my pockets, baby
I ain't done anything wrong

I never said nothing
No, baby, I never said nothing
I never said nothing
I never said nothing
I never said nothing
No, not to anyone
I never said nothing
I never said nothingEmbed
