Explain It to Me Lyrics
Head underwater
Keeps getting harder
Give 'em your medicine
Fame injection

Tell him to jump higher
Tell him to run farther
Make him measure up
Decades longer than you

Piece it together
It's like weather
Watch him travel
Kiss the gravel

Tell him to jump higher
Tell him to run farther
Make him measure up
Ten times longer than you ever should
You never could explain them to me
Explain them to me1Embed
