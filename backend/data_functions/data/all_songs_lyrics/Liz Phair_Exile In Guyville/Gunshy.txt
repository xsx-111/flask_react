Gunshy Lyrics
Rifle in hand and two in the bush
Three count delay, I may need a little push
Take out the garbage on Tuesday nights
Seems like the small things are the only things I'll fight
Seems like the small things are the only things I'll fight

Gunshy, gunshy, gunshy, gunshy

See-monkeys, do-monkeys
Story of my life
Send three bucks to a comic book
Get a house, car and wife
Send three bucks to a comic book
Get a house, car and wife

Gunshy, gunshy, gunshy, gunshy
Gunshy, gunshy, gunshy, gunshyEmbed
