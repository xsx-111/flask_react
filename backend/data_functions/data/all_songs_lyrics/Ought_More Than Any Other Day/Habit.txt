Habit LyricsThere is something, something you believe in
But you can't touch it and you can't hold it
There is something, something you believe in
And you can't wait for it to take a way a bit of time
In a nonspecific party, in a nonspecific city
Or anywhere
Anyway you feel this way like this song or that song
Act like you feel it but it doesn't heal you, it doesn't make you smile

And is there something you were trying to express?
It’s not that you need it, it’s that you need it
Is there something you were trying to express?
And you can't get on without it, and you can't get on without it
Is there a weight that you were trying to unload here?
But you just can't get it, you can't get it off now
And when you get it, get it in your bloodstream
And you feel at home with it but you just can't get relief

And there it comes again
And you give in again
And there it comes again
Your limitation
And there it comes again
And you give in again
And you give in again
Your limitation
And is there something you were trying to express?
Express it with me, express it with me
And is there something you were trying to express?
Something I needed? Is that I need it
Is there a weight that you were trying to unload here?
But you just can't get it, you can't get it off now
And when you get it, get it in your bloodstream
And you just feel whole with it but you just can't get relief

And there it comes again
And I give in again
And there it comes again
My limitation
And now it comes again
And you give in again (Ha!)
And I give in again
My limitation
Why I think I, I see it coming
Because I recognize it when I see it
Well, do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I need to know I'm not alone any—
Well I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
Well I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
Do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I need to know I'm not alone
And cause I need it and I believe in it
And I think that I can't live without it
Well I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
I feel a, a habit, I feel a habit forming
A habit, a habit, a habit, a habit, a habit
Well I feel a, I feel a
A habit, a habit, a habit, a habit
Well I feel a, I feel a
Do you feel it like I feel it?
Cause I need to know I'm not alone
 (x3)
A habit, a habit, a habit, a habit, a habit
Well I feel a, I feel a
A habit, a habit, a habit, a habit, a habit
Well I feel a habit forming3Embed
