Gemini LyricsI retain the right to be disgusted by life
I retain the right to be in love with everything in sight
And when a cold, cold breeze
Picks you up and takes you high above the trees and
When your eyes roll back into your skull, say
It's not that I can see but that I feel you
And when you moaned all night
Said I don't think that I will ever sleep again
'Cause I've found it, I'm waiting
Half of my life
And there's an ease in your eyes
Once you see the lines
And when I moaned all night
I said I think that I have finally lost my mind
But you say keep in mind, you say keep in mind
You say keep in mind, say keep in mind
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
I retain the right to have an end in sight
I retain the right to be absolutely mystified
And when a cold, cold rain
Makes you think that you will never be so clean
When you're caught up in bearing the same weight again
You're moving, you're weightless
You're more than a friend
And when you moaned all night
Keep on saying there is still a place in time
And that place it is saying that you're one of a kind
Yeah you're one of kind, one of a kind
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright, and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Are you a Gemini? Are you the stars that aligned?
Are you my friend tonight?
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
The change, I want it
Well see I know there's something on your mind
Well see I know I'm something in your life
Well see I know I'm something in your mind
Well see I know there's something in your life
Well see I know I'm something on your mind
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Good god, Jesus Christ
Tell me I'm alright and see you'd yell
That you're one of a kind, one of a kind
You'd yell
Want it then come in, your hands and you got
You want it then start it, want it then shout it
Want it then come in your hand and you got it
Want it then shout it, want it then shout it
You're wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
Wanted, wanted, wanted, wanted
