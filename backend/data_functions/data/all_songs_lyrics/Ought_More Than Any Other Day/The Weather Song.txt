The Weather Song LyricsTell me what to do, when to feel alive
Cause what you're pushing is keeping me in time now
Now that we are high with the limit on a lie
And what you're pushing is keeping you in time now
The limit's on the inside and there's no inside at all
There's nothing keeping you from shouting out loud that
You believe in more than keeping time with life
There's nothing keeping you from shouting at the wall over and over

And I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into your—
I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into your—
We got to thinking we won't take it any more
We won't take it any more, take it any more
Yeah I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into—
Tried to deform and then back to the wall
Then everything is down and there's no work at all
Tell me what the weather's like so I don't have to go outside
And I'll shut up and spend a week inside my head
When you cannot find, find yourself at night
Well don't bother mentioning you think it's cold tonight
Or that you believe in more than keeping time with life
And the education's wrapped in medication
Time again until the feeling's gone again
There's nothing keeping you from shouting at the wall over and over
And I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into your—
I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into your—
We got to thinking we won't take it any more
We won't take it any more, take it any more
Yeah I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into—
Tried to deform and then back to the wall
Then everything is down and there's no work at all
Tell me what to do and when to feel alive
And tell me what the weather's like so I don't have to go outside
Then I, yeah I think of something that you missed, way like this
Then I believe in more than keeping time in life
And the education's wrapped in the medication and then
Time again until the feeling's gone again
Nothing keeping me from shouting at the wall
Over and over

I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into your—
I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into your—
We got to thinking we won't take it anymore
We won't take it anymore, take it anymore
Yeah I just want to revel in your lies
Does it any way into—
Does it even matter if we won't say it anymore
We won't take it anymore, take it anymore, yeah oh!
Does it any way into— Oh!
Does it any way into your—
We got to thinking we won't take it anymore
We won't take it anymore, take it anymore, yeah oh!
Does it any way into your— Oh!
Does it any way 'til nowEmbed
