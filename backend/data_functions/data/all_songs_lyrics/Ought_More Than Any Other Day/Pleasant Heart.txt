Pleasant Heart LyricsHa!
Something crawled into your pleasant heart
And cried out for your head
Said, "Who will leave the body now?"
Said, "Who will leave the body now?"
Into the sea
Not I, so we swim
Ha!
When you're living in the shell
When you're living in the shell
When you're living in the shell
Screaming "How do I get out?"
Something crawled into your pleasant heart
And cried out for the head!
Ha!
Something crawled into your pleasant heart
And cried out for the head
Said, "Who will leave the body now?"
Well, who will leave the body now?
Into the sea
Not I, so we swim away
Saying how and how we are
Saying how and how we are
Saying what and how we are
Saying what and how we are
Saying what and how we are
Let's hear it out!

There's something in the shell!
When you're living in the shell
When you're living in the shell
Screaming "How do I get out?"
When you're living in the shell
Saying what and how we are
Saying what and how we are
Saying what and how we are
Saying what and how we are
We areEmbed
