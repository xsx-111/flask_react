Today More Than Any Other Day LyricsWe're sinking deeper
We feel like
We're sinking deeper
We feel like
We're sinking deeper
And sinking deeper
And sinking deeper (Uh!)
And sinking deeper (Uh!)
And sinking deeper (Uh!)
And sinking deeper
And sinking deeper
And sinking deeper
And sinking deeper
And sinking deeper!
The name of this song is "Today More Than Any Other Day"
Parts 4 through 43, so open up your textbooks or a magazine
Or a novel; any kind of reading material will do
Okay, here we go
One, two, three!
Well, today, more than any other day, I am excited to feel the milk of human kindness
And today, more than any other day, I am excited to go grocery shopping
And today, more than any other day, I am prepared to make a decision between 2% and whole milk
And today, more than any other day, I look into the eyes of the old man across from me on the train and say
"Hey, everything's gonna be okay!"
(Yes!)
(What's that?)
Does the radio play but hey, it's okay
Because today, more than any other day, I am the center of everything and it's playing just for me
And everything is gonna be okay, together, today, together, today, together, okay, together
We're all, all, all the fucking—
Well today, together, today, together, today, together, today, together
We're all, all, all the fucking—
Well today, together, today, together, today, together, today, together
We're all, all, all the fucking same1Embed
