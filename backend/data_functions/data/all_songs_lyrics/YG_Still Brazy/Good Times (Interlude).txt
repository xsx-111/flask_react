Good Times (Interlude) Lyrics
Point four, my nigga, point four, point four
Yep, come on hit, hit, hit
Yeah, yeah, motivated, on four
There it go, ah, fuck
Soon as I thought I was having a good time
(Ayy this nigga, this nigga burnt out wanna holla at you)
This nigga think he slick
(YG, what's brackin' jizzle?)
See, everybody try to hit me with the homie convo'
(Look, nigga I been tryna get yo' number from the homies for the longest but niggas tryna act like you the President and shit)
Then the homie convo'
(Tryna tell niggas, man, YG a real nigga)
Turn into the money convo'
(Fuck it, me, I ain't gon' beat around the bush, my nigga
Let a nigga borrow a couple hundred dollars, my nigga
You the homie, I know you got it)
Nigga, what?4Embed
