Bool, Balm & Bollective Lyrics
Woke up this morning feelin' bool and balm
Ain't have to drank no drank, a nigga nerves was calm
Was it 'cause last night I had some bomb?
She got ratchet in the red dress, we had a ball
Then I pulled up at the lights, some niggas banging real hard
I had to tell them little niggas, "I never heard of y'all"
Tried to make a nigga lose his composure
I had to hit the gas on em', I almost spilled my whole soda
Still in motion, can't let 'em get the best of me
My curve skills on deck, they want my recipe
They like how you do it and then keep it movin', 'cause see, me, I usually lose it
When nigga act stupid, like he ain't know my record ruthless
Actin' like he with the business but he ain't worth me doin' detention
Sittin' in prison away from my niggas, asking for money from these bitches
When niggas start trippin', I be wantin' to start trippin'
But I'm just bick it and act like the bigger nigga

'Cause I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm, and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm, and bollective
So I pull up at Pammy house
Pammy stay next to my family house
And Pammy someone I used to dig out
I stopped diggin', she started trippin', I had to dip out
Smashin' out the driveway, she threw a brick at my window
So I stopped and she ran up and keyed my '64
See when a real nigga hit it, needy bitches go schizo'
This dick is not a rental, should of knew from get-go
Get, get-go, get, get, get-go
I'm friendly like Casper but I wait 'til I hit to get ghost
She called her brother on me, Stacy from The Wood but I ain't pussy
Real niggas don't get in-between dick and pussy
Ten minutes later, got a call on my cell
From a nigga sound like he was fresh outta jail
Like, "Ayy, little nigga, don't put your hands on my sister
'Cause I just gotta outta jail for manslaughter with a butcher
And she ain't no hooker, she ain't no bitch
My mama raised her right, my little sister got sense"
I told him, "I ain't touched her I just stopped giving' her dick"
Then I told him, "Fuck you" and hung up like "click"

'Cause I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm, and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm, and bollective
Got a call a little later 'bout this and that
All drama, had to hang up, like, "This is wack"
I shouldn't be talkin' on the phone either, 'cause I'm strapped
If the police pull me over, my Black ass goin' back
And that's right up they alley, but I ain't a alley cat
I'm a red-nosed pit bull, matter of fact
Turned on some Jeezy, that's what street niggas slap
Right on Oleander, left on Spruce, we in the back
Now my older homie hollerin' at me
'Bout some real life shit and how its supposed to be
So he approaches me, get real close to me
Tried to tell me 'bout some niggas that's close to me
So I listen and I listen and I had to put my bid in
Can't keep it real with some niggas that ain't real with me
He said, "To keep it P, you is right
They ain't never bool, they better respect your life"

'Cause I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm, and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm and bollective
I'm bool, balm, and bollective
Girl, I'm tryna go out
Oh yeah, girl, my kids, huh?
I'ma drop they bad asses off at they granny house
See?
Shit, she'll watch they ass for the whole weekend
That's where it all start
They ain't got no morals
Girl, you talkin' bout Derek?
These bitches, who supposed to be our ladies
I fucked him and Eric
They ain't even know, bitch
They'll hit your best friend and feel numb about it
Girl, they fuck who they want
Why we can't fuck who we want?
