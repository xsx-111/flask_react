Blacks & Browns Lyrics
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
We looking bad on the news, black on black homicide
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
I need them dollars, got these problems with this llama on my mind
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
They make it harder by the day, gotta keep this hope alive
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
'Cause if my homies say it's on (Uh), then you know I'm down to ride

We make it hard for us with all this black on black
Crime, in the same state we gotta pay our tax
If we get locked up, that's double rate
We get popped then retaliate
And they sell us these guns
And these fucked up schools where they teach us what they told to
Half the shit I learnt in school, I ain't never used
These fucked up rules, the government trying to control you
That's why we say, "Fuck the law", we act like we the one with the juice
It's fucked up out here
Some niggas luck up out here
The rest end up stuck up out here
So I'm speaking for my peers 'cause I still see they tears
I ain't sugarcoating nothing, nigga, this is what it is
They supply us with the county to make us feel comfortable
Couple years pass, we in the same spot we was before
We was content on that section 8 shit
'Cause every first of the month, we got them groceries for them kids
But, nah, they fucking up our mental
Keeping us slaves so we can't be successful black people
We need to come together, fuck they system
Tired of being a victim, tired of racism
So I'ma spit this ism 'til this shit stop
Cause this that, "Nigga, we all we got"
We need to stop hating on what the next black got
Give him his props, then figure out how he ran shop
So our kid's kid's can be good
On a house in the hills, and rent the house out in the hood (Sound good?)
'Cause them folks, they be wealthy
We never thinking 'bout tomorrow, that's so unhealthy
We killing ourself, they killing us too
They distract us with entertainment while they get they loot
They never gave us what they owed us
Put liquor stores on every corner
Welcome to Los Skanless, California
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Buenos días, motherfuckers
I'm Sadboy Loko
And I'm here to speak for my people, yeah

We need to come together, look around
They made the border for the brown skins, we're not allowed
Gotta get the green card for me and my child
The rascals pay men under the table, that don't last a while
Those jobs get passed around, they dog our people
Why we gotta look for work at Home Depot?
It was us before the natives, why we ain't equal?
But why you give us no perks? Fool, we need those
"And we're trying to make America Great"
Said, "Fuck you, esé"
Somebody bring him to the Treces
And— just for disrespecting
Black, brown, or pale, it don't matter to me
The only color that call shots in this world is green
And at eighteen, they want you to sign up for war
That's why most rather bang and hang around at the store
So to you, it's just another selling corn
To me, we out here hustling for the mortgage
Fuck you think we crossing the border for?
Why you think in a bedroom there's more than four?
You explored my country, but can't accept my people
But who you want to run your business? My people
My flag is green, white, red, in the center's an eagle
Brown Pride, fist high, this is for my illegals
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
A brown cop harassing me, guess we all look alike
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
This happens daily, all the time, I can never ask why
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
They make it harder by the day, trying to keep this hope alive
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
'Cause if my homies say it's on, then you know I'm down to ride

Don't shoot
Don't shoot, officer, don't shoot
My hands up, my hands up—31Embed
