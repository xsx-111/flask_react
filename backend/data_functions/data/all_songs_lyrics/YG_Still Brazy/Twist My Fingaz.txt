Twist My Fingaz Lyrics
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside

I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands

Uh, why all these rap niggas wanna be bloods?
Never see 'em in the hood, only see them in the club (Them niggas be in the club)
Ask me, I snuck in with the snub, and I just left the block, had the homies say I'm dumb (See, I got)
What's up with that? Shit
Nigga I don't fuck with that, shit
I'm 'bout to pull a Suge Knight and press the issue on sight (Uh)
The real bloods either check or we on yo' ass
I went to sleep flamed up but I woke up in my Polos
I rock a low-cut and wear my socks like a cholo
I coulda got a Ghost but I went and got a Lo-Lo
'Cause copying off you rap niggas is a no-no
I can hop out solo (What's happenin'?), tucked is a 44
I probably need three more, 'cause these niggas is emo
They see my altitude and have an attitude
But I'm a solid ass nigga, what you niggas mad at me for?
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside

I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands

Do your dance YG, do your dance (Hey)
Do your dance YG (Haha), do your dance (What up, Slim?)
Do your dance YG, do your dance (Yeah, I'm turnt up)
Do your dance YG, do your dance
Do your dance YG, do your dance (Ayy, pass that shit nigga)
Do your dance YG, do your dance (Pass that shit, hold up)
Do your dance YG, do your dance (Yeah, nigga I got something to say, hold on, let me holler at 'em real quick)
Do your dance YG, do your dance
Hold up, I really got something to say
I'm the only one who made it out the West without Dre (Real though)
I'm the only one that's 'bout what he say
The only one that got hit and was walking the same day
I tried to pop first, got popped back
Got hit in the hip, couldn't pop back
Pass me y'all Buddha strap
You know we pop that, so please
Don't call me no rap nigga (Why?)
'Cause I be in the spot strapped, nigga
All facts nigga, I don't wax nigga
You put Compton, I put Bompton on the map, nigga
I heard they wanna do a background check
I got a mil' in the cut, that's a background check (Damn)
And watch how they count my pockets
And get mad when I hit them with the "I ain't got It"
Gave you the game, now you think you poppin'
Alright fuck y'all, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out

You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled off in the ride
In the ride, in the ride
Got two mothafuckas wanna fight me outside
Fight me outside, fight me outside
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
I just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
Just do my dance and cuff my pants
And twist my fingers with my hands
