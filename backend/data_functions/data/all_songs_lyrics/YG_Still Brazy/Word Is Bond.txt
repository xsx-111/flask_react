Word Is Bond Lyrics
You niggas thought it was over, oh shit
I told you niggas we about gettin' this money
I told them niggas shit was 'bout to get ugly
I told them niggas don't be sleeping on me
I told them niggas (Rat-tat-tat-tat), oh
Uh, look, uh, uh

If I told you I was back, nigga, that's what it is
I run the left side of the map and that's what it is
My homie got that pack and that's what it is
If you ain't tryna spend that hot box then that's what it is
I don't wanna get the money and act like a bitch
I'm the one get the money and pass it out to my clique
'Cause everybody know I'm rich
Everybody, everybody, everybody know I'm rich
Put the squad on my back (Squad)
Google Maps'll tell your ass where it's at
Back seat full of bitches
You can say a nigga riding with that mack
Oh, life still crazy
Newborn baby, niggas I don't know still hate me
Facts, never tripping
Personal message to them niggas, I'ma shit on y'all vicious
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word, my word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word is bond

If I said I got 'em, then I did that
Said we gon' profit and I did that
My career you wanna follow 'cause I did that
Your favorite top model, I done did that
Had to put the black gates where I live at
Shooters on deck, try to pull up, you gon' get jacked
Mind of a maniac
Since I got popped, I purchased about fifty straps
If I mention your name, I probably put you on
So I ain't talkin' 'bout no orders 'til the contract closed
Lookin' in the mirror like, "Am I wrong?"
Nah, it's business, nigga, don't take it personal
They gave 'em game and more money
So when it get ugly, shit ain't funny
Promise I'ma make it, hate me or love me
And I promise I'ma stay the same with this money
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word, my word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word is bond

If I told you I rep Bompton, nigga, then that's what it is
If I felt to push a line nigga, then that's what it is
Bow down in none situation, I been with the shit
I'm the one niggas watch, so y'all know what it is
My blique ain't going nowhere, my niggas started this shit
Saying everything but Bs, now the industry bang
Niggas better get credit or get hit by the gang
And it really is Bompton, fuck who dissing my name
Sounding good on these tracks, they started calling my phone
Go on and get you a hit, and leave a nigga alone
'Cause the shit y'all talk will have you sleeping alone
When I fire, I fire, I'm tryna tip that dome
Really with the shits, fuck who try to play me
Really off of Spruce, nickname from the homies
Posted with the .40, fat-ass Rollie
You ain't from Bompton if you don't know me
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word is bond, my word is bond
My word, my word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word
My word, my word, my word is bond18Embed
