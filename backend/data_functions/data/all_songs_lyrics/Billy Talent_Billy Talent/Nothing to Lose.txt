Nothing to Lose Lyrics
Need more friends with wings
All the angels I know put concrete in my veins
I’d always walk home alone
So I became lifeless just like my telephone

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There’s nothing to gain
But the days don’t seem to change

Never played truth or dare
I’d have to check my mirror to see if I’m still here
My parents had no clue
That I ate all my lunches alone in the bathroom

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There’s nothing to gain
But the days don’t seem to change
There’s nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There’s nothing to gain
And I can’t fight the pain
Teachers said it's just a phase
When I grow up my children will probably do the same
Kids just love to tease
Who'd know it put me underground at seventeen

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name
There’s nothing to gain
But the days don’t seem to change
There’s nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There’s nothing to gain
And I can’t fight the pain

There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name!
There’s nothing to lose
My notebook will explain
There’s nothing to lose
When no one knows your name!
There’s nothing to gain
And I just died today11Embed
