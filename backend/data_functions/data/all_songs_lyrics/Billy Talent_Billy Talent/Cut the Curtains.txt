Cut the Curtains Lyrics
Oh my girl, you're so hot when you walk you melt snow
And now the disco has finally grown old
Lets buy back our souls
So lets see, we got five bucks between you and me
My mental dishes are finally clean
So clean are we

Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home
Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home
Intermission's a mission on it's own
Intermission's a mission on it's own

Now here, seems our wax wings have melted away
Oh, and we've only been here for one day
My faith fades away
So don't be a gray cloud when there's none in the sky
We've found there's no hidden treasure to find
At least we tried

Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home
(Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home)
Intermission's a mission on it's own
(Intermission's a mission on it's own)
So cut the curtains, the actors have gone home
(Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home)
Grab your suitcase, we don't have time to fold
(Grab a suitcase), I think we don't have time to fold
There is no doubt, you throw your inbox out
I said, there is no doubt, you throw your inbox out
I said, there, there is no doubt, you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt, you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt, you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt, you throw your inbox out
There is no doubt, you throw your inbox...

Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home
(Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home)
Intermission's a mission on it's own
(Intermission's a mission on it's own)
So cut the curtains, the actors have gone home
(Cut the curtains, the actors have gone home)
Grab your suitcase, we don't have time to fold
(Grab a suitcase), I think we don't have time to fold

We don't have no time to fold
We don't have no time to fold
We don't have no time to fold
Said, we don't have no time to fold2Embed
