Line & Sinker Lyrics
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

Today I don't feel pretty
And I'm tired of trying to fit right in
Don't think that you're so great
Cause being great must suck
We don't always see the bright side
We all need ego suicide
You hung my id today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So stand up straight and firmly say...
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

My heart is in the right place
So wipe that smirk right off your face
Don't make me feel like that
Cause that's just plain not nice
We don't always see the bright side
And I lied when I said I was fine
You slapped my face today
But I have licked my wounds and carried on

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
Reality is truly scaring me
So stand up straight and firmly say...
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers

Everybody needs some sympathy
Santa seemed to miss my chimney
You stole my luck from me
And now my fortune cookie's empty!
Cause you came and you stole it all from me!
So stand up straight and firmly say

What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers
What you see is what you get! (Don't you know?)
Fishing for the answers with a line and sinker
Look at me and don't forget! (Don't you know?)
Hard to get a grip with all these broken fingers3Embed
