River Below Lyrics
Rejected since day one
My name is bastard son
I've been damned so many times I've lost count
Blue collar working man
Devises master plan
Bipolar with a mental side arm

I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame

Contraption made up of
Nuts and bolts creates the
New monster to burn your family tree down
Tick-tocking, times up now
Split second, the world frowns
Lonely heart, never had nobody
I'm sick and I'm twisted
I'm broken you can't fix it
Don't make me, cause I'll do it
Red button and we'll all go

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame

Into the river below!
Into the river below!
Into the river below!
Into the river below!

Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
They'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
Into the river below
I'm running from the inferno
I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
Yeah, I'll take all the blame
The front page and the fame
But you'll all know my name
And they'll think I'm insane
But you'll all know my name
And you'll think I'm insane4Embed
