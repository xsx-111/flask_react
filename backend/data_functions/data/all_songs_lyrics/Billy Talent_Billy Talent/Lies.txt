Lies Lyrics
Forced conversation (Lies)
Hidden agenda (Lies)
You think we're stupid, how dare you
The rug has not been pulled
Over our eyes, you fool
We can see right through

Tip-toeing villain (Lies)
Eyes in the ceiling (Lies)
Your false intentions have worn thin
But we've been in your room
And in your closet too
We've got one on you

Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed, lies
Inside an office (Lies)
A fallen angel (Lies)
A smiling Buddha with snake eyes
Creates the latest trends
And I just can't pretend
Don't call me your friend

(Well all these)
Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies they make it better
Lies they are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies they make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed, lies!
Lies will come back to hunt you
Bulletproof your limousine
Lies will come back to haunt you
Hit and run, a broken dream

Lies make it better
Lies are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed
Lies they make it better
Lies they are forever
Lies to go home to
Lies to wake up to
Lies from the altar
Lies they make you falter
Lies keep your mouth fed
Lies till your death bed, lies1Embed
