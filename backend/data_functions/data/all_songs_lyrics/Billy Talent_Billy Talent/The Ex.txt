The Ex Lyrics
Well, I looked at her face
And then I know she changed
Yeah, my heart turned black
Then the sky turned gray
Yeah, my heart turned black
Then the sky turned gray
And so I sat in my room
For twenty-seven days
No, she never called
I had something to say
No, she never called
I had something to say

Well, I don't know much
I don't know how

Why would she put me through such torture?
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner

Well, I heard she's great
And her new boyfriend's lame
Well, she can go to hell
I'll never be the same
She can go to hell
I'll never be the same
And these open wounds
Will heal with time they say
Yeah, my heart turned black
Then the sky turned gray
Yeah, my heart turned black
Then the sky turned gray
Well, I don't know much
I don't know how

Why would she put me through such torture?
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner
Why would she put me through such torture?
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner

Well I don't know much
I don't know how

Why would she put me through such torture?
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the corner
Why would she put me through such torture?
I would have given my life for her
She was the one that knocked me over
Now I'm alone sitting on the cornerEmbed
