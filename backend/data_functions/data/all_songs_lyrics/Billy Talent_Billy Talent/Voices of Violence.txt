Voices of Violence Lyrics
Don't wait for a knight in shining armor
Your savior's reflected in the mirror
These flowers have grown from bloodstains on the ground
Go rake them leaves off your grass and my grave
The fact is, everyone bleeds when they shave
There's no use, so don't deny we're just the same

We'll take it back
Broken dagger! Southern swagger!
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back
Broken dagger! Southern swagger!
Voices of violence, voices of violence

These cowboys will ride off in the sunset
Once their toys have turned another profit
Backfire, these smoking guns will never rest
Unleash the skeletons from the closet
These strangers are friends that you've never met
They'll send them sympathies with a Hallmark card

We'll take it back
Broken dagger! Southern swagger!
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back
Broken dagger! Southern swagger!
Voices of violence, voices of violence
Even after I'm dead and buried
I'll still remember, I'll still remember
Even after I'm dead and buried
I'll still remember, I'll still remember
Even after I'm dead and buried
I'll come back fighting, I'll come back fighting!

We'll take it back
Broken dagger! Southern swagger!
Voices of violence, voices of violence
We'll take it back
Broken dagger! Southern swagger!
Voices of violence, voices of violence

Voices of violence will always be heard
Voices of violence, voices of violence
Voices of violence will always be heard
Voices of violence, voices of violenceEmbed
