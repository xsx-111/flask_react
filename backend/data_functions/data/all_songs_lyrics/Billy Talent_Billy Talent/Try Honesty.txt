Try Honesty Lyrics
Well, I tripped, I fell down, naked
Well, I scratched my knees, they bled
Sew up my eyes, need no more
In our game there is no score

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty! Try honesty!
Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me! Ride over me!
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy! Die tragedy!
Call me a cheapskate, come on for Pete's sake
Cry agony! Cry agony!

I'm insane, it's your fault, so sly
Your well of lies ran dry
And I cut the cord, free fall
From so high we seem so small

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty! Try honesty!
Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me! Ride over me!
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy! Die tragedy!
Call me a cheapskate, come on for Pete's sake
Cry agony! Cry agony!
I talk to you!
I'm insane, it's your fault! (Cry)
I'm insane, it's your fault! (Cry)
I'm insane, it's your fault! (Cry)

Forgive me father, why should you bother now?
Forgive me father, why should you bother now?

Forgive me father, why should you bother?
Try honesty! Try honesty!
Hop in your dump truck, reverse for good luck
Ride over me! Ride over me!
Take on the whole world, fight with the young girls
Die tragedy! Die tragedy!
Call me a cheapskate, come on for Pete's sake
Cry agony! Cry agony!

Cry agony! Cry agony!
Try honesty! Try honesty!
Cry agony! Cry agony!5Embed
