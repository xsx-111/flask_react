Living in the Shadows Lyrics
Constant quick fixes
They don't make no sense
Hop on bandwagons
You make me sick

Don't you tell me what you think is right!
When you're living in the shadows
I can tell that you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows
Don't you tell me what you think is right!
When you're living in the shadows
I can tell that you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows

Distant loud chuckles
They keep me awake
Awkward instances
Won't make you hip

Don't you tell me what you think is right!
When you're living in the shadows
I can tell that you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows
Don't you tell me what you think is right!
When you're living in the shadows
I can tell that you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows
We've said this all before
Your shadow's at the door
We've said this all before
Your shadow's at the door
There's darkness in the hall
And we won't take the fall
And we won't take the fall!
 2x
Don't you tell me what you think is right!
When you're living in the shadows
I can tell that you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadows
Don't you tell me what you think is right!
When you're living in the shadows
I can tell that you have lost your sight!
When you're living in the shadowsEmbed
