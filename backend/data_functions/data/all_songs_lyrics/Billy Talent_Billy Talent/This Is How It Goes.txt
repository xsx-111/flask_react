This Is How It Goes Lyrics
Everybody is tired
And poor and sick of trying
If you see me on a corner
Will you stop or will you splash me?

Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it!

So I hold my breath till my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes

Shitty weather, bad timing
Lucky penny glued to the ground
Dirty look from total stranger
Hope you get lost and you're not found

Take a look at what we've become
Nothing more than silhouettes of
A pretty family on a postcard
Picture perfect, I don't want it!
So I hold my breath till my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it

This is! How it! It goes!
This is! How it! It goes!
This is! How it! It goes!
This is! How it! It goes!

So unscrew my head and rinse it out
Polish my thoughts, turn into doubts
Unscrew my head and rinse it out
Polish my thoughts, turn into doubts
(Turn 'em into! Turn 'em into doubts!)

So I hold my breath till my heart explodes
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes
You can steal my body but you can't steal my soul
Cause this is how it is and this is how it goes2Embed
