She Comes in Colors Lyrics
A thought in my head, I think
Of something to do
Expressions tell everything
I see one on you

Whoa-oh-oh-oh, my love she comes in colors
You can tell her from the clothes she wears

When I was invisible
I needed no light
You saw right through me, you said
Was I out of sight?
(x3)

When I was in England town
The rain fell right down
I looked for you everywhere
'Til I'm not around
