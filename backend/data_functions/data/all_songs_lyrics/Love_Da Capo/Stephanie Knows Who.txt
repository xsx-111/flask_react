Stephanie Knows Who Lyrics
What's in your life, dear Stephanie
What's in your life for me
Aches and pains they clawed your sigh
A tiger did you said he did

What can I say, dear Stephanie
Who shall I next inform
Of love and poetry that you bring
Your eyes, your hair, your everything
Yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on

What am I now, dear Stephanie
Am I you in disguise
Your words they come so naturally
I save them all for Stephanie, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Hey, all right
Talk to me all the time
From A to Z and in between
Say it sweet all the time
All the time, yeah...Embed
