Free Lyrics
Yeah I know, I know, I know I've been bad
I know I lied and I cheated in the past
But I ain't capable of doing such wrong
That justifies me being locked up this long

I ain't guilty of no crime
Get these chains off me
Can't risk doing no more time
Please just set me free
Everyday I go older
I feel my heart getting colder
I'm beggin' you please Yeah, yeah

You got me wrong
I don't deserve this fate
I'm not where I belong
Not the kind of place
Once he's mad at your fear
I ain't meant to be here I'm meant to be free
Yeah I know, I know, I know I've been a fool
I had everything and went and lost it all
But I don't deserve this sentence on my head
Especially when I never did what she said

You got me wrong
I don't deserve this fate
I'm not where I belong
Not the kind of place
Once he's mad at your fear
I ain't meant to be here I'm meant to be free
Time's such a precious thing
We shouldn't waste it on little things
Effect me won't get in the way
Of what we need cause it just don't pay


You got me wrong
I don't deserve this fate
I'm not where I belong
Not the kind of place
Once he's mad at your fear
I ain't meant to be here I'm meant to be free
Yeah, yeah

I'm meant to be free Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm meant to be free Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm meant to be freeEmbed
