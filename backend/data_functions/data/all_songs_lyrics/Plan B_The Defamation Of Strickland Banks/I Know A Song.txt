I Know A Song LyricsWe used to get on fine
Once upon a time
Yea we were alright, but you were mean
Now we don't talk and it's a shame
I guess I only have myself to blame
Cos girl you meant so much to me
And if I ever see yoooou again
I know a song
I can sing
If I ever see you again
I know a song, I know a song
I can sing
All those things that people used to say
That only, got in the way
The way of you and me
Oh they were nothing more than words
And even if they were
It don't matter to meeee yea ohh
And if I ever see yoooou again
I know a song
I can sing
Girl if I ever see you again
I know a song, I know a song
I can sing
Next time I'm playing out
If i see you in the crowd
There's only one song
I'm a' sing out loud
Cos girl I did you bad
And yes I made you sad
I just want you to know
If I ever see yoooou again
I know a song
I can sing
Yea yeah' ea'
If I ever see you again
I know a song, I know a song
I can sing
Yea ye' yeah'
If I ever see you again
I know a song
I can sing
Girl If I ever see you again
I know a song, I know a song
I can singEmbed
