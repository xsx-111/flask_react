Hard Times Lyrics
Through the hard times, people say that you gotta be strong
Through these hard times, people say you gotta keep going on
Through the hard times, people try and kick you when you're down
Through these hard times, don't it always seem like there's never anyone around to help you when you're strung out?

(Through these hard times)
When you're falling out, no one seems to care
(Through these hard times)
They just run you down, tell you that life isn't fair, no

(Through these hard times)
So through the hard times, let me know
(Through these hard times)
That I'm not alone
(Through these hard times)
Cause right now I need you more
(I need you more)
Than I've ever thought

Through these hard times people see what it's like for the poor
Through these hard times people really find out what it's like to be ignored
Through these hard times people just don't seem to give a damn, oh oh no
Through these hard times it really feels like no one understands, mm mm yeah yeah
(Through these hard times)
So through the hard times, let me know
(Through these hard times)
That I'm not alone
(Through these hard times)
Cause right now I need you more
(I need you more)
Than I ever did before

(Through these hard times)
Ain't it funny how no one seems to care?
(Through these hard times)
They just run you down, tell you that life isn't fair, oh oh oh yeah

Through the hard times, please let me know
Through the hard times, I'm not alone
Through the hard times
Through the hard times, let me know
(Through these hard times)
That I'm not alone
(Through these hard times)
Cause right now I need you more
(I need you more)
Than I ever did before
Oh than I ever did before, oo oo
Right now I need you more than I ever did before1Embed
