Stay Too Long Lyrics
I know what's to come
Am I feeling happy now?
I know when I'm drunk
In ways I know it always lets me down

Cause I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong

I'm in a brawl
Cause I won't take shit lying down
Right into the wall
The police are on their way right now

Cos I always stay too long
Long enough for something to go wrong
Yeah I always stay too long
Fair ladies they're singin' my s-so-song, s-s-s-s-so-song, s-s-s-s-so-song, s-s-s-song

I got my peeps standing with me shouting pull up your socks
Cos we just broke the law and now we're running from cops
I got my lip bust fighting now there's blood on my top
And I'm still out looking for a party, somewhere to stop
I got my peeps them telling me they know where its at
So I pull out twenty notes and jump straight into a cab
I'm on my way to where I'm going thinking I need more Jack
But that probably ain't the brightest idea I've ever had


On the run from the law
I'm looking worse for wear
I go through a door
And suddenly I find myself somewhere
Somethings bound to go wrong
If I stay too long
I know we're going to get to dawn
If only staying in singing my s-so-song, s-so-song
S-s-s-s-so-song, s-s-s-s-so-song, s-s-s-s-so-song
S-so-song, s-s-s-s-so-song song song
Ah c'mon
Ah c'mon
Ah c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I got my peeps standing with me
At the bar doing shots
Cos now we're so fucking plastered
We don't know when to stop
I got my girlfriend ringing me,belling me up
I know I should probably answer but I just can't be fucked
I got my peeps standing with me and I'm having a blast
Im feeling so fucking good right now I want it to last
So I put my phone on silent and I refill my glass
The music so fucking banging feel like I wanna dance
I'm at the bar and I see this chick checking me out
From afar yes she wants my dick, there ain't a doubt
She's got a skirt so short make you drool from the mouth
Looking my way as if to say I'm in with a shout
So I pull a chair up and near and buy her a drink
She says cheers I says yeah our glasses go clink
Now I'm being bad, in a cab, groping this girl
Once the cab is paid we make our way up to the hotel
Now I'm in a lift, getting lips, Standards is low
But do I care? do I fuck!
I'm on a roll! Yo!Embed
