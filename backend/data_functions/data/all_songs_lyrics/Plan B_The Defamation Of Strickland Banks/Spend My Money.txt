Spend My Money Lyrics
I'll wine and dine you, yes I'll make you feel cool
But the whole time you just take me for a fool
And you know it, girl
Don't you, don't you know it, girl, yeah
You spend my money, it's just spending my change
But the whole time you're just sending me insane
And you know it, girl
Don't you, don't you know it, girl, hey

Because I love you, honey
That's why you got me running, running, spending my money
I'm spending it on you, you, honey
Yes, you got me running, running, spending my money
You spend my money
You spend my money
You spend my money
You spend my money, girl, every day, yeah

You think you're clever, yeah, you think you're real smart
Buying and planning out ways to break my heart
And you know it, girl
Don't you, don't you know it, girl, yeah
You say you love me and you'll always be there
But darling, deep, deep down you don't really care
And you know it, girl
Don't you, don't you know it, girl, hey

This river runs so deep
Cause you only want me for what's here
But because I'm real
Knowing that changes nothing
