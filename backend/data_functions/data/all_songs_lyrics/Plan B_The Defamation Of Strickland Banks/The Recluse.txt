The Recluse Lyrics
Oh yeah, they call me the recluse
Cause I don't go outside for nothing
No one is gonna make me leave this room
Oh no, they can't tell me nothing, no way

You see I'm being a fool
It gets so I don't care about being cool
What's it to you?
If I just stay here in this hole that I'm boarded into


You see, I ain't thinking clear
It gets so I don't know I'm feeling sorry for myself
Who asked you to interfere?
How would you really know what is or isn't good for my health?
Why don't you leave me alone?
I ain't hurting nobody, why you up in my face?
Get up out my soul
Why can't you just let me get through my time this way?

Sitting here by myself, looking mad at myself
Thinking I don't wanna go out there
I don't need no help, looking after myself
I got everything I need right here
I ain't trying to impress anyone
In this cesspit jail, I just don't care
I ain't gotta smell fresh for no woman
So I'm blessed not washing my skin or my hair
They can call me a recluse they ain't gonna remove
Or cut me loose from this place, I'm locked in hiding
Like a rock, I won't move cause you know
I've gotten used to the space that I'm occupying
There really ain't anything out there but the wind
They'd enjoy more than see me crying
So I do it in my room where none of these goons can see me
Though I know they've been trying
I ain't cut out for this shit, I'm a coward I admit
I've never been no big ting
The thought of killing makes me sick
But I don't wanna be no victim, no way, not Strickland
So I just stay in my cell like I'm bricked in
And hope that stops me from getting kicked in
Even if it earns me this nickname in prison
