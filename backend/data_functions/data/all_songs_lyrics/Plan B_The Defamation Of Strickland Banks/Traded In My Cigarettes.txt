Traded In My Cigarettes Lyrics
There's people inside
Telling me to watch my back
If I wanna survive
I gotta stop them in their tracks

They've been making life hard
They've been taking me for a fool
So I saved up all my cigarettes
And I traded them in for a tool

Because now you know I've gotta get tough now baby
I gotta do what I gotta do
Because yeah you know things are getting rough now baby
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
Woo
Doing my time
In a cage that ain't fit for a rat
Waiting to die
What kind of bad existence is that?

Oh I don't wanna hurt nobody no no
But what choice do I have?
If I don't do something crazy
They're gunna keep coming back
Because now you know I've gotta get tough now baby
I gotta do what I gotta do
Because yeah you know things are getting rough now baby
Ain't got nothing left to lose no no no no no no

They've been making things hard
Oh they've been making my life hell
So I've traded in my cigarettes
So when they come I can protect myself 
Ohh ohh
So when they come I can protect myself
From those demons
Haunting me like ghosts
Someone tell me I'm dreaming
This all up in my head
Someone wake me up from my bed
Tell me this ain't really happening

Gotta get tough now baby
I gotta do what I gotta do
Because yeah you know things are getting rough now baby
Ain't got nothing left to lose no no no no
Things are getting tough now baby
I gotta do what I gotta do
Because yeah you know things are getting rough now baby
Ain't got nothing left to lose no no no no
Things are getting tough now
I gotta do what I gotta do
Because yeah you know things are getting rough now baby
Ain't got nothing left to lose no no no noEmbed
