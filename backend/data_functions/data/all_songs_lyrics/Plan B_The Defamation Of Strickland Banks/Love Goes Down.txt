Love Goes Down LyricsI remember when I was young and so were you
All of the things we both said we would never do
But look at how times have changed, baby. You know why
I can never say no, baby. I can only show you how
My love goes down
My love goes down, down, down, yeah baby
Sweep your feet right off the ground, and yeah Mama
I got that real love for you now, yeah baby
Know I got that real love for you now
I remember when I did you wrong, made you cry (I made you cry)
Made you feel so sad, I knew I had to apologise (apologise)
So I pulled you close, baby, and I laid you down on the bed
Took off your clothes, baby. Girl, you know the rest
My love goes down
My love goes down, down, down, yeah baby
Sweep your feet right off the ground, yeah Mama
I got that real love for you now, yeah baby
Know I got that real love for you now
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Baby can't you see? You're the only one for me, woah, oo
Girl you know it's true, I'm the only one for you too, yeah yeah
Love goes down, woah girl
My love goes down, down, down, yeah baby
Sweep your feet right off the ground, and yeah Mama
I got that real love for you now, yeah baby
Know I got that real love for you now
Yeah-eh-eh oo-oo woah
Woah-oah-oah oo-oo yeah-eah
Yeah-eh-eh oo-oo woah
Woah-oah-oah oo-oo yeah2Embed
