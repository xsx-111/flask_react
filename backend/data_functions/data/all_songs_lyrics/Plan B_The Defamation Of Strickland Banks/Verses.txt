Verses Lyrics
I really wish that I could change what's going on
I really wish that I could explain to you in a song
That I'm sorry for causing all of this hurt
Oh if only I could put it into words

The chorus is easy
The middle ain't too
And I struggle with the verses
Just like I struggle with you
I went all sleazy
Made friends with a drug 
It just wasn't worth it
Cheating on you

Up in this jail they call me the recluse
I won't leave my cell cause it reminds me of you, it's true
Our relationship was effed like this prison
After time I felt stuck like I was put in a position
Cause you smothered me too much when I just needed you to listen
It was hard to adjust from the life that I'd been living
Previously, I know I went on deviously
But that's only cause I was used to being single and free
Before you came along and made yourself a part
Of my life, like a wife, girl you stole my heart
But a leopard can't change his spots
At least, not until he dies and rots
And I'm sure that's probably why I'm up in the spot
With more than enough time to think about what I've lost
Once you say it ain't been easy, like words I can't pronounce
To write this letter while I still miss weather, waiting for a drought
Cause just like the chorus to this song that came about
Quicker than the verse, I know it hurts when you can't work out
What's going wrong cause it started so good
Hopefully this song will sum it up the way I hoped it would

I struggle with these lines just like I struggled something bad
To stop you finding out that I'd been messing with slags
Behind your back, when I was out on tour
I pursued them shamelessly, I acted like a whore
The way these lifeless tarts leave reminded me of something sore 
Of how I used to go out every night looking to score
I tried to keep my head down but still they'd give me hell
The screws are bent, they won't prevent them entering my cell
Only time will tell if my stretch here is borrowed
I guess I'll find out soon, maybe it's tomorrow
My head ain't right, the thoughts I'm having are of murder
Cause man in here are threatening sexual acts I've never heard of
I wish the ground would swallow me, can't suffer this no further
I'd rather be six feet deep beneath the terra firma
Than become somebody's bitch, just like you were to me
It's a shame I have to go through all this to make you see
How I treated you was wrong and I betrayed you in this song
This might be my only chance cause man here want me gone
I'm gonna stand strong until I think of something
When I do, I'll let you know but right now I've got nothing
