What You Gonna Do Lyrics x2
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturing and tell me what
You're gonna do
What you're gonna do

So, here we are again
It's like déjà vu
Everyone looking at me
Trying to work out if I've been telling the truth
The court room's the same
But, the jury's changed
And, the judge she's not here
So, they all look the same to me, yeah
It's just like it was
When I was here before
Except, my ex ain't here
In the gallery showin' me support
And, that breaks my heart
Cause, I love her no doubt
And, still, I  know her song
I could sing forever, get up, it's choice
We just need evidence
Come to light, don't change the fact
An innocent man went down, first time
I'm gonna need to be a fool to put my faith in them
Only to be in this place again
I remember how my heart felt, breaking then
I don't wanna feel that hate again
Steal it once cause I gotta break again
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturing and tell me what
You're gonna do
What you're gonna do

Yeah I've been through the wars
Up in that jail
All you gotta do is look at the scars
On my face to know that I've been through hell
But I'm still breathin', yeah, that's right, I'm still here
I survived through the darkest days
In the darkest place
From my darkest fears
There ain't nothing you can do to me
Ain't already been done, 'cept shootin' me
And, people having a pop and that ain't new to me
That's what used to go on, usually
When I stay too long in one place
I'm gettin' screw-faced by many more fights
How different things been now
But I just made it home that night
Ain't even worth thinking bout
What's done is done, you can't change the past
So, please stop torturing me
And, make a decision; that's all I ask
'Cause, I'm ready to accept my fate
Whatever the outcome of this case
When I feel I can't stand this weight
So, hurry up already and decide the pain
 x2

So, what you gonna do?
When you gonna make up your mind?
I've been here for hours now
And, I still ain't got a clue what you got in line
Are you gonna send me back?
Through the prison gates, like, you did before ?
Or, are you gonna set me free, and let me live my life?
You can know the score
I'm still sitting here listening through
This girl with the lies when I know the truth
And, I always have, she has, too
Not many people left to convince it to
The jury's out on me, but still has you
And, now I'm past caring what fate they choose for me
Just do what it is you gotta do
And, do it soon so I can get up out this room

You can let me go
You can let me rot
Wait for parole
Gonna do the rest of the years that I got
You can cut me loose
Or, you can bind me up
Cause to tell the truth
I don't really give a fuck
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturing me and tell me what
You're gonna do
What you're gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturing and tell me what
You're gonna do
What you're gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just stop torturing and tell me what
You're gonna do
What you're gonna do
You can set me free or bang me up
Just don't leave me on a cliff-hangerEmbed
