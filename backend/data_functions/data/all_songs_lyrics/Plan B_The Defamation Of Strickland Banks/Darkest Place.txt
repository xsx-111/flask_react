Darkest Place Lyrics
I'm in the darkest place
I think I've ever been
You can see from the scars on my face
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
All alone
Why have you forsaken me?
All alone
You make it hard to believe

I'm in the darkest place
And I don't just mean this jail
In my mind there's a darkest space
Trapped in an even darker cell
You got to see it to believe it's true
That's why it's so hard to believe in you
Stay real, but you got to have faith
But I wondered where you were when I needed you
When that girl was telling lies in the court
With her hand on the Bible, where was the lightning?
The great vengeance, furious anger that Samuel
L.J. made sound so frightening
She attempted to poison a brother
And I mean it in a Biblical sense, not a black way
She succeeded to destroy that brother
It's deep; you can make a fool battle out of laughing
She just did it for the money for the cash, eh?
I bet she's rolling in it now she's famous
You must think that's fair considering
I got to deal with man who want to feel a new anus
So you save up a months worth of fags
And trade them for a shank along with your trainers
And you take a man's life with your make-shift
Knife cause this isn't you, messed up your
Brain is

Are you real or a myth?
Is there a heaven or just an abyss?
Sometimes I wonder if you even exist
Cause if you do then you're taking the piss
I don't deserve this why are you torturing me God?
We both know something ain't right here
It's been two whole months
Since I killed that man and I'm still having nightmares
It was just self-defence
But try telling that to my conscience
My head's in a real bad way
But even when I tell you, you ignore me like its nonsense
I was being attacked on a daily basis
I had to do something
And it weren't like you were going to intervene at any
Point cause you never do nothing
Just I thought you'd sent me an angel
When the second man tried put the first cut in
And got stabbed instead, but now I know
That was just in my head, not the hole that I'm stuck in
Cause if he really was an angel you sent
He wouldn't be trapped in this jail with me
Spread out his wings and fly
Get out of this hell-hole quickly
That's how I know you're a fake
That's how I know you're a lie
That's how I know you're a made-up fictional character that
Lives in the sky
Yeah it's all just a con
It's all just a scam
God ain't real
It's just a sham
I'm in the darkest place
You can see from the scars on my face
Ooh yeah
I'm in the darkest place
I think I've ever been
You can see from the scars on my face
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
All alone
Why have you forsaken me?
All alone
You make it hard to believe
I'm in the darkest place
I think I've ever been
You can see from the scars on my face
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
All alone
Why have you forsaken me?
All alone1Embed
