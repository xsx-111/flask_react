She Said (Shy FX Remix) LyricsShe said, "But I love you, boy, I love you so"
She said, "I love you, baby, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said, "I love you more than words can say"
She said, "I love you ba-a-a-a-aby"
I said, "Stop this crazy talk
Leave right now and close the door"
She said, "But I love you, boy, I love you so"
She said, "I love you, baby, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said, "I love you more than words can say"
She said, "I love you ba-a-a-a-aby"
I said, "Stop this crazy talk
Leave right now and close the door"
She said, "But I love you, boy, I love you so"
She said, "I love you, baby, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"
She said, "I love you more than words can say"
She said, "I love you ba-a-a-a-aby"Embed
