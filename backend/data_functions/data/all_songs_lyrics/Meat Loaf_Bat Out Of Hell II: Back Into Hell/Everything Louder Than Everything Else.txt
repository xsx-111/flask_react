Everything Louder Than Everything Else Lyrics
Wasted youth!
Wasted youth!

I know that I will never be politically correct
And I don't give a damn about my lack of etiquette
As far as I'm concerned, the world could still be flat
And if the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back
If the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back

Who am I? Why am I here?
Forget the questions, someone gimme another beer
What's the meaning of life
What's the meaning of it all?
You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl!
You gotta learn to dance before you learn to crawl!

So sign up all you raw recruits
Throw away those designer suits
You got your weapons cocked, your targets in your sights
There's a party raging somewhere in the world
You gotta serve your country, gotta service your girl
You're all enlisted in the armies of the night
And I ain't in it for the power, and I ain't in it for the health
I ain't in it for the glory of anything at all
And I sure ain't in it for the wealth
But I'm in it till it's over and I just can't stop
If you wanna get it done
You gotta do it yourself
And I like my music like I like my life
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else

Wasted youth!
Wasted youth!
Wasted youth!
Wasted youth!
They got a file on me and it's a mile long
And they say that they got all of the proof
That I'm just another case of arrested development
And just another wasted youth
They say that I'm in need of some radical discipline
They say I gotta face the truth
That I'm just another case of arrested development
And just another wasted youth

They say I'm wild and I'm reckless
I should be acting my age
I'm an impressionable child in a tumultuous world
And they say I'm at a difficult stage
But it seems to me to the contrary
Of all the crap they're going to put on the page
That a wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age!
A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age!
A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age!
A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age!
A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age!
A wasted youth is better by far than a wise and productive old age!

If you want my views of history then there's something you should know
The three men I admire most are Curly, Larry and Moe!
If you don't worry 'bout the future, sooner or later it's the past
And if they say the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back
If the thrill is gone, then it's time to take it back
So sign up all you raw recruits
Throw away all those two-bit suits
You got your weapons cocked, your targets in your sights
There's a party raging somewhere in the world
You gotta serve your country, gotta service your girl
You're all inducted in the armies of the night

And I ain't in it for the power, and I ain't in it for the health
I ain't in it for the glory of anything at all
And I sure ain't in it for the wealth
But I'm in it till it's over and I just can't stop
If you wanna get it done
You gotta fight for yourself
And I like my music like I like my life
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else

Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else
Everything louder than everything else...Embed
