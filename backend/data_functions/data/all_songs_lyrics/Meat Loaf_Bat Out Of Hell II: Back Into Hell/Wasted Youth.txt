Wasted Youth Lyrics
Wasted Youth
Wasted Youth

I remember everything!
I remember every little thing
As if it only happened yesterday
I was barely seventeen
And I once killed a boy with a fender guitar
I don't remember if it
Was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
But I do remember that it had a heart
Of chrome, and a voice like a horny angel
I don't remember if it
Was a Telecaster or a Stratocaster
But I do remember that it wasn't at all easy

It required the perfect combination
Of the right power chords
And the precise angle from which to strike!
The guitar bled for about a week afterwards
And the blood was zoot
Dark and rich, like wild berries
The blood of the guitar was Chuck Berry red
The guitar bled for about a week afterwards
But it rung out beautifully
And I was able to play notes
That I had never even heard before
So I took my guitar
And I smashed it against the wall
I smashed it against the floor
I smashed it against
The body of a varsity cheerleader
Smashed it against the hood of a car
Smashed it against a 1981 Harley-Davidson
The Harley howled in pain
The guitar howled in heat

And I ran upstairs to my parents bedroom
Mummy and Daddy were sleeping
Quietly in the moonlight
Slowly I opened the door
Creeping into the shadows
Right up to the foot of their bed
I raised the guitar high above my head
And just as I was about to bring the guitar
Crashing down upon the center of the bed
My father woke up, screaming "stop!"
"Wait a minute, stop it boy!
What do you think you're doing?"
"That's no way to treat
An expensive musical instrument!"
And I said "God damn it, Daddy!"
"You know I love you
But you've got a hell of a lot to learn
About Rock 'n' Roll!"Embed
