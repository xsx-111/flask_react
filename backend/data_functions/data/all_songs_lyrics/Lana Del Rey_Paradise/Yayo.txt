Yayo Lyrics
I like the snake on your tattoo
I like the ivy and the ink blue
Yayo, yes, you, yayo
You have to take me right now
From this dark trailer park life now
Yayo, how now, yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show

I need you like a baby when I hold you
Like a druggie, like I told you
Yayo, yeah you, yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show
Hello, heaven, you are a tunnel lined with yellow lights
On a dark night
Yayo, yes you, yayo

Put me onto your black motorcycle
'50s baby doll dress for my "I do"
It only takes two hours to Nevada
I wear your sparkle
You call me your mama
Let me put on a show for you, daddy
Let me put on a show
Let me put on a show for you, tiger
Ahh-ah-ah, let me put on a show58Embed
