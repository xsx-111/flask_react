American Lyrics
Play house, put my favorite record on
Get down, get your crystal method on
You were like tall, tan, driving 'round the city
Flirtin' with the girls like you're so pretty
"Springsteen is the King, don't ya think?"
I was like, "Hell yeah, that guy can sing"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
L.A., I don't even have to fake it now
You were like so sick, everybody said it
You were way ahead of the trend, get, get it
"Elvis is the best, hell yes"
"Honey, put on that party dress"
Like ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Everybody wants to go fast
But they can't compare
I don't really want the rest
Only you can take me there
I don't even know what I'm saying
But I'm praying for you

You make me crazy, you make me wild
Just like a baby, spin me 'round like a child
Your skin so golden brown
Be young, be dope, be proud
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Like an American
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
