Tonight the Sky LyricsHer head lay back in blankets, soft white down
Her hair warm autumn colors, floating
Our days were classroom poems, true young love
Some nights we roar like lions, some we coo like doves
I left her long ago one summer, chasing dreams
I hum good sweet explosions, sweet nothings
I broke her heart not knowing she'd return
And graven scars deep in me forever
I hear my sleeping sister
In the early morning hours
I hear her though it's silent
Standing over me now
Tonight the skies
Will open for you
Mountains and big clouds
Divide us in two
She fell into his arms, his sweet, strong kiss
She made her perfect gardens in this
World that turned its back, shook things 'round
In time it took our loving sister down
I met my fallen angel one last time
I promised always through me she would shine
I held her hands, I sunk into her heart
'Til powers unrelenting pulled us apart
I saw my sleeping sister
Rising toward a light
A mist above the skyline
On that never ending night
Tonight bright stars
Are shining for you
Oceans and full moons
Deep midnight blue
I woke up every morning
Not believing her to be gone
Outside the doves and sparrows
Carried on
Building now so sweetly
Settled into spring
Outside the kids in their yards
Laughing and playing
I loved you like no other
Your eyes I can't erase
Your voice it wakes me always
Pouring down from space
Like warm sun rays
You're turning into
Wild sails on cool bays
I'm watching for you
Tonight the skies
Are open for you
Mountains and big clouds
Dividing in twoEmbed
