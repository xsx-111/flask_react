Unlit Hallway LyricsWalking down the unlit hallway of life, there's hope I know
There's an angel, she follows me, follows me close, she touches my shoulder
Sings words so clear they bring comfort to my ear
She guided me home
Breathe, my love
Wake, my love
Hold me, my love
Looking out into the skyline today, how will we ever stay?
Composed, her smile, her soul rising for miles, soul's rising for miles
Looking out into this morning she left, how will we ever rest?
Staring at the ground, we spread her around, they spread her around
Breathe, my love
Wake, my love
Hold me, my love
Coming in the haunted city at last, my heart beat fast
Down Kearny, down Pine, down Stockton, down Hyde, she followed me home
And I found you there asleep in my chair, I found you there
And I feel you near like you are still here, I feel you near
Breathe, my love
Wake, my love
Hold me, my love
Breathe, my love
Wake, my love
Hold me, my loveEmbed
