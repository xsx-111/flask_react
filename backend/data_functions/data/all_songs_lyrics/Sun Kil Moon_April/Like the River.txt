Like the River LyricsThey floated downstream with swans in the sun
Surrounded by friends and lovers
We watched on with smiles beaming so bright
The river behind them, the fading daylight
I knew her back from when she was young
Those days poured out faster than rounds from a gun
Scattered like shells and lost to the sea
Like the river, the days move rapidly
I have all these memories, I don't know what for
I have them and I can't help it
Some overflow and spill out like waves
Some I will harbor for all of my days
I burned like oil, you grew like a flower
Rising toward your magical hour
I was not yours and you were not mine
Our true love finds us when it is time
We drove back downtown, wasted and spent
Down highways that I remember
Happy for her and happy for me
The old times and the new to uncover
I laid down my head, in love with the night
With my new love beside me, her radiant light
I faded away along with my thoughts
Like a dream and I trail off mysticallyEmbed
