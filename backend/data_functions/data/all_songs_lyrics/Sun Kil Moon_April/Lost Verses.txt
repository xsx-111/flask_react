Lost Verses LyricsI came out from under her warm sheets
Into the brisk late October
If only for one last hope
Not wanting my time with you to be over
I'm staring up into the sky
While all the rain is pouring downward
I'm reaching out for your help
While evil beings hold me backward
All shapes and shadows move in and out
And hover 'round my bed
Voices arrive and disappear
I want to talk to them
Darkness disintegrates, I'm rising
I'm rising toward a light
A light leading over hills and meadows
I've risen up from the dead
With the burning leaves of autumn
If only for one last chance
At all of whom I've been defeated
To put on my father's wool coat
To smell my mother's fragrances and perfumes
To find my young brothers and sisters
To never leave or let them go
Houses adorned so beautifully
The Marin headland sun
Lost verses well up my eyes and ears
A lone mandola strums
On Tamalpais, warm springs
The many places we
Laid down in sleepy, hidden shadows
I see you well and clear
Deep in the moonlight dear
Your radiant August eyes
They are the suns that rise
They are the light that lies in these lost verses
I came up from under the ocean
Evaporated sea salt water
A mist above the skyline
I haunt the streets of San Francisco
Watch over loved ones and old friends
I see them through their living room windows
Shaken by fear and worries
I want them to know how I love them so
Fog horns will sound and wake you
Is it my voice you hear?
Footsteps are moving across the floor
And you know I'm near
Laughter carries up from the hills
And you are well and clear
To fall into the light I followed
I feel you oh so near
When morning doves appear
And gusts of April rain
Echo and refrain
Soon finding their place in these lost verses
They fill the foggy days
That hide the hills away
That steal our time
They are the picturesque night
The casting city lights
On the bay flowing into the ocean glowing1Embed
