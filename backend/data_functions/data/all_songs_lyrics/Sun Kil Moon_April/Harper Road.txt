Harper Road LyricsBlackberries ripe on the branches
Her skin is burning, she bends to pick them
For a deep, delicious pie
For our aching stomach's sweet delight
Sorrow came in floods this April
Without reasons, flashes, warnings
Now in May, June and July
Don't leave my love, don't leave my side
Brighter than moonlight glows
My love does for you
In dreams of Harper Road
I'll always find you
Stretched out like an orange tabby
On the porch with ferns surrounding her
There a breath she'll take not often
There her hard troubles subtly soften
Live oaks bear the deadliest drought
Like a mother's will it snuffs out
Any flame come 'round it breezin'
She'll endure the driest season
My blood runs through my only daughter
Her eyes are mine, wide with wonder
Be my voice, my light, my power
Be with me in my leaving hour
Brighter than moonlight glows
My love does for you
In dreams of Harper Road
I'll always find you1Embed
