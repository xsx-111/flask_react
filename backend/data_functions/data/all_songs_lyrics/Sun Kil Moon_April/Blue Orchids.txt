Blue Orchids LyricsThe ancient streets, so crowded and narrow
Winding stairs climb up, up high
The air tonight hangs sour and heavy
I'm dying up here, love, lie with me, lie
The view electrical and sprawling
The city lights move out and on and on
Out there in the halo of the skyline
My guardian angel looks down upon me
Fall tonight, sweet Paris rain
Shower me in her warm kisses
A burning star over long lost highway
My fallen lover died so young
And all the gifts you gave, I have them
And all your love I'm still holding onto
She rides the halo of the skyline
My fallen sister died so young
Our last goodbye, I wanted to be there
To bathe the loss from your fading eyes
Close these sweeping, long, gray curtains
Dizzying, spiraling heights
Soft light pours into the room
Fingers glide over my face, a voice speaks, a figure moves
How could I walk these old dim halls again?
How could I leave this room all alone?
When she comes by every morning
Brings back pink and pale blue orchids
When she comes by every afternoon
Piano music weeps quietly as May melts into June
When she comes by every evening
Lays down beside me softly breathingEmbed
