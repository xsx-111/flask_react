Guggenheim Wax Museum LyricsWhat I found in Harrow's Field, (Oh oh oh)
Were furrows, dark, that would not yield, (Oh oh oh)
The Vigilant Digger will dig my grave
Of an earth made of things I cannot say
And build a cenotaph that stands
Where we once kneeled
Saying, "Oh"
Saying, "Oh"
"I wish I was alive, I wish I was alive"
Saying, "Oh"
Saying, "Oh"
"I wish I was alive, I wish I was alive"
But no one really is3Embed
