Defenestration Song Lyrics
I never thought I’d lead this restless life
I thought I’d wither down, a sacrifice
There’s nothing I can do to make it stop
It’s in my nature. It gives me chills

I never thought that life could last this long
I thought I’d be found out so long ago
There’s nothing I can do to make it stop
It’s in my nature. It gives me chills. (Hey!)

Get off my back! (Hey!)
Get off my back! (Hey!)
Get off my back! (Hey!)

I never thought I’d lead this restless life
I thought I’d wither down, a sacrifice
There’s nothing I can do to make it stop
It’s in my nature. It gives me chills

Get off my back! (Hey!)
Get off my back! (Hey!)
Get off my back! (Hey!)
Get off my back! (Hey!)
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?
Is this what it’s like?
Is this what it’s going to be like?7Embed
