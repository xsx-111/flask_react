Dan and Tim, Reunited by Fate LyricsI feel so designed, so made to know
That there is no place in time in backwards-flow
And this is all there is
And I close my eyes, and I’m not depressed, or anything
I just close my eyes; this is all there is
I feel so designed, so made to know
I’m calling, and I’m calling, but not no one is
Standing at the river bank calling out my name
And I can feel the soil and silt
I’m calling and I’m calling like no one ever did
And I can feel my influence
Spreading out around me and living on my guilt
And I can feel how real it is
Saying, “We don’t know anything.” 2Embed
