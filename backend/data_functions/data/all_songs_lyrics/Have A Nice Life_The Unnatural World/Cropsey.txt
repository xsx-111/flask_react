Cropsey Lyrics


A sign
That I’ve been praying for
A solemn augur, pure and true
To tell me what to do
A true
God that I can settle for
And spin my body in a long, slow arc
Like how my problems are

And I’ve been waiting on everyone
And I’ve been waiting on
Cause I’ve been waiting on anyone
To show up and throw me out of here
Yeah, I’ve been waiting on anyone (Because I don’t belong!)
And I’m not even sure I even know those words
Cause I’ve been waiting on anyone
And I’ve been waiting on
Cause I’ve been waiting on
A song
That I can sing along
Well, I’ll just wait and track the soot-tracks
Home so I can be alone
And I’ve been waiting on everyone
I’ve been waiting on
Cause I’ve been waiting on anyone
To show up and throw me out of here
