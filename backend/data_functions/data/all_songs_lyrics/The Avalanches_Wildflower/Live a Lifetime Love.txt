Live a Lifetime Love Lyrics
When I was a child and out runnin' wild

All you kids are the same today
All you wanna do is play
You never want to work or take any responsibility
(True!)
Live a lifetime love
We live a lifetime day
A.Dd+ we at it again
Just doing some hoodratted shit with my friends
We smoke out in public, sip beer out the can
That's just how we function
We don't give a fuck, I'm not sure if I can
I grew up a screw up
Put in a little too much, they call me advanced
And now they just call the police
Since I'm 23 and black and won't pull up my pants
They say I'm a thief (they say I'm a thief)
They callin' me thug (they callin' me thug)
They say I'm a killer (they say I'm a killer)
I just say "wassup?" (I just say "wassup?")
They say I'm a thief (they say I'm a thief)
They callin' me thug (they callin' me thug)
They call me a killer (they say I'm a killer)
I just say "wassup?"
We be drivin’ drunk, smokin’ blunts, runnin’ red lights
We be drivin’...  WHY?!

Shit
Put your hands off the steering wheel, please
Put it on the seat
License and registration, please
Hide the beers, hide the beers
Put that weed out
You know why I pulled you over, right?
Yeah, yeah
We got a couple, you know
Wild ones. Wild ones!
Yeah, you know
I mean, I'm sittin' in my treehouse with a cup of coffee
And the Avalanches
We havin' a ball up here
Wildthing
I think I love youEmbed
