If I Was a Folkstar Lyrics
Hey, alright
Kip Kasper, KLON Radio
How we feelin' out there?
How's your drive-time commute?
I remember when she took me to a world in my mind
"Who wants time when there's nothing?" she said to the sky
And I'd like to see her every day
I know I can't be gone every weekend
Let's wake up side by side
Let's stay here 'til we die
Don't make me close my eyes
Why won't they leave?
Why won't they leave?
(Oooh)
(Why won't they leave?)
Let's wake up side by side (Side by side)
Let's stay here 'til we die ('Til we die)
Don't make me close my eyes
Why won't they leave?
(Why won't they leave?
Why won't they leave?)

Isn't he great?
Far out
Come on, I know a spot where we can go6Embed
