Colours Lyrics
Colours, colours
Wonderful, wonderful colours
See, all the colours!
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
Hey mermaids, I'm only here in the sun to play
I wanna join you in the urban surf
And learn to love you in a neon way
Hey mermaids, I'm only here in the sun to play
I wanna join you in the urban surf
Hey mermaids, I'm only here in the sun to play (Wonderful, wonderful)
I wanna join you in the urban surf (Colours)
And learn to love you in a neon way

Over sea, under stone
No-one wants to be alone
Everybody's going somewhere
After dark and the bars are slow
Where do all the mermaids go?
Everybody's got there somewhere
Everybody knows it's somewhere
(Everybody's got there somewhere)
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart (Yo, colours)
After the tears, true love can start (Everybody's got there somewhere)
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart (Wonderful, wonderful, colours)
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart (Colours, colours, colours)
After the tears, true love can start
Where there's a heartache, there must be a heart (Colours)

Everybody knows it's somewhere
Everybody's got there somewhere
Everybody's got there somewhere
