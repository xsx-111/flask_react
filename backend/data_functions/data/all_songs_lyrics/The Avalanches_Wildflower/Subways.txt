Subways Lyrics

(Moves around, moves around, moves around, moves around)

You walk on the subway, subway
You walk on the subway (it moves around)
You walk on the subway, it moves around
So you go to see what you found
(Subway, subway, it moves around)

I ain’t in no hurry
I ain’t in no hurry
I ain’t in no hurry
I ain’t in no hurry

All around, all moves around
All moves all around, all around, all around, all

Moves all around, all around (Na na na, na nana na)
I ain’t in no hurry
All around, all moves around
All moves all around, all around
You walk on the subway, it moves around
You walk on the subway, it moves around
You hear someone scream, so you go to see what you found
You walk on the subway, it moves around

I ain’t in no hurry
Hey, yo girl (Yeah?)
I ain’t in no hurry

All around, all moves around
All moves all around, all around, all around

You walk on the subway, it moves around
You hear someone scream so you go to see what you found
You walk on the subway

I ain’t in no hurry
Hey, yo girl (Yeah?)
I ain’t in no hurry

All around, all moves around
All moves all around, all
You walk on the subway, it moves around
You hear someone scream so you go to see what you found
You walk on the subway

I ain’t in no hurry3Embed
