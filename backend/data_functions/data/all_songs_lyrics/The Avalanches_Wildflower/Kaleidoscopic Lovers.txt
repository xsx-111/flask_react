Kaleidoscopic Lovers Lyrics
At night, when I dream...

At night, when I dream
Leaving my body like a bird from a nest I fly
Every chimney and tree
I thought I knew but now I see what all birds see
Inside of their homes
Clear as glass, friends making love like there's no tomorrow
What a wonderful end to my night's worth of sorrow

Everywhere you look
Children running like crayon colours into the sun
And in the wind, I can see
One by one, wildflowers dance with weeds
Oh it's a real swinging scene
Kaleidoscopic lovers melting into one another
From a sister to a brother
(Oh, oh, oh see how they turn)
Daughter grows into a mother
And softly turns into the otherEmbed
