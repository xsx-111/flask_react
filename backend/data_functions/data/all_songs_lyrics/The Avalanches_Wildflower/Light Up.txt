Light Up Lyrics
What a wonderful sight
It just seems to be right
That there's something to do
For the rich people too
So light up the hall
There's dancing for all
Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy
Doo doo doo doo doo
It's a world of fantasy
Doo doo doo doo doo
Ba ba ba ba ba (Doo doo doo doo doo)
It's a world of fantasy
It's, It's a world of fantasyEmbed
