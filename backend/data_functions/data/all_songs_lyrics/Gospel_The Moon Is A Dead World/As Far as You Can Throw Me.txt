As Far as You Can Throw Me LyricsYou may not think so man
But that boy he's just like me
He likes dogs and he likes bicycles
And like everyone else in this town
He chasing his dream
When my front end fell out
It flashed out cross the b.q.e
The only thing I could care about
Were my cds and my weed
So I ditched the plates
Ran my ass towards the l.i.e
And I caught a pair of headlights:
My buddy messina flaggin down on me
And I'm not the biggest scumbag you'll ever meet
And yeah man all my bridges are hangin' from a string:
Thin like a fishing line, like the type of string
That keeps this whole damn city together
And I'm a live wire
And I can't fight this feeling any longer
Yeah someday I'll go back to school
And oneday I'll pay you your money back
And oneday man
You gotta realize
That all these ideas
We bought 'em all
And then calm down
Your just growin' old
So let's hold this close
And we'll fall back to what's ours
I've got enough pills
To last us both a couple of hours
And we'll count our stars it won't come to soon
I'm on fire now I feel all right
Like I've been wanting to write home
Wanted to tell mom
"Everybodies fine"
Soul singers got me singin'
Man this shit gets to me
Same way it got to you
And so onEmbed
