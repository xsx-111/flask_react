Yr Electric Surge Is Sweet Lyrics(Our circutry, it's a funny thing. and to think we're all just coils and springs)
"You look so good you make me not want to kill myself"
That boy pulled out most all your wiskers
The way I saw you running out
Well a cat like you
You don't need a home
And I can keep you clean
(Sigh)Embed
