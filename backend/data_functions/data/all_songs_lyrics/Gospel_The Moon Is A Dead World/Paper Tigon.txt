Paper Tigon Lyrics"Get the fuck up"
Well they came and they saw
They got fucked so hard they nearly shit
I suppose someone shoulda told those boys
Apostacy would be such a bitch
And now if things couldn't get much better
These men they got fingers like knives
And they hold all your money man
You'll be lucky to get outta this war alive
Just comb your hair its in your eyes!
And so I push y'all away
And I wish you a fast recovery
All the time wishing clots upon your heartEmbed
