Golden Dawn LyricsAw man you should have seen it
They came from all over the world
All just trying to say something
But then those clippers came
And those people drowned
And the scaffold...
It came falling down
Then the conquests came
And the noise died down
And I never heard another single thing about it
"Hey you. you got a ciggarette man?
You know I know you got one on ya
I usually keep mine in the backseat
But its buried behind all the rubble
You know after a few months
I figured all this shit would be easier
No wife, no kids, nothin' man
But my monkey sure is breathin."
And around the corner tonight ...
My man, he's sleepin' out on the street
"Someone should go tell him its cold outside"
I don't think he's listening
And its only just a matter of time
Before we all gotta go underground
And for what's its worth
They ain't got no drugs down there
And don't even think for a second
That just cause you been co-opted
You've been cancelled out
Cause for a minute there we tasted it
And now we know what it's all aboutEmbed
