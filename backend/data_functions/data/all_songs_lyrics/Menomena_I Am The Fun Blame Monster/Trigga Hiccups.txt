Trigga Hiccups LyricsThis is only a moderate mistake
But it gains speed as it gains the weight
We pull our own and make it home always for dinner
Chatrooms full of broken bones
From lush estates to mobile homes
Eyes turn to glaze
And horses fade, always in winter
Always run day in day
Outside of the box is cold
But it’s okay, I’ll run on glass to please you
To please you
(This is only a moderate mistake)
