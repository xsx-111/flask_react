Oahu LyricsIt fills my nostrils and reminds me of a foreign plan
To rule October through December with an iron hand
I was once a maiden on a voyage through a shipless sea
When the hull struck a deal with an iceberg lurking in the deep
(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oahu)
(Oahu)
Lurking in the deep
Lurking in the deepEmbed
