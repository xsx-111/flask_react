Rose Lyrics
My beds are always empty
If you don't count the ghosts
'Cause I have those a plenty
I think ones name is Rose
Its name is Rose

So dear Rose
Is home this sack of skin?
Or is home somewhere
I've been?
'Cause I can trace back my tracks
I can trace back my tracks

Romance in me is dwindling
Should I be wanting it back?

I can trace back my tracks
I can trace back
I need some of that wonder bread
My blood
Dark red
Some things
Not said
