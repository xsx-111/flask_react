Strongest Man in the World LyricsI am fused out of iron, iron
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am flawless, I will keep this under my control, control
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am fused out of iron, iron
I am flawless, I will keep this under my control
I am flawless, I promise to keep this under control
