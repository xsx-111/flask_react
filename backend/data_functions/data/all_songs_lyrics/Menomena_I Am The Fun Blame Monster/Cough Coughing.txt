Cough Coughing LyricsForce yourself to breathe
My hand is only there
To stop the cough
Redirect your sneeze
The spittle leaves a smear
I can't wash off
Kiss me kiss me please
I washed behind my ears
The lights are off
Be careful who you tease
There's an easy chair
On the chopping block
(?)
Be careful who you tease (I will!)Embed
