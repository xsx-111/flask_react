E. Is Stable LyricsColdness sets in like fingernails
Raked across the door
This room used to inspire me
Arouse me, now it's cold
There's a man 10 feet down the hall
Bound to me by law
26 years of alibis
All mutual, of course
This old frame once was beautiful
The proof is on the shelf
This old frame once was beautiful
Close your eyes if it helps
Your hands used to work miracles
Skin on skin, I blush
Your hands used to work miracles
For me alone
(Of course)Embed
