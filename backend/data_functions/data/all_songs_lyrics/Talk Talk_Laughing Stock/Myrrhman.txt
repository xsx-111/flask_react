Myrrhman Lyrics
Place my chair at the backroom door
Help me up
I can't wait anymore
Blessed love
The love I've seen
Stair by idle stair
Faith one path and the second in fear
Star down, a half wit am I read
Star down

Stair by idle stair

And tread dependence beneath my feet
Step right up something's happening here
Something's happening here
