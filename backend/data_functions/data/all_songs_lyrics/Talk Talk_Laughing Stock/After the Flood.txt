After the Flood Lyrics
Sang soulless loud
Herding step on flesh
And nothing else
To well
To drown and drown
Sleight of reason
How they come
Cain in number

Shake my head
Turn my face to the floor
Dead to respect
To respect to be born
Lest we forget who lay


Alone, the crowd
Spurning step by state
Blame something else
Thirsting
Within and without
Sighted, weeded
How they run
Slain in number
Shake my head
Turn my face to the floor
Dead to respect
To respect to be born
Lest we forget who layEmbed
