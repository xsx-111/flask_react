Taphead Lyrics
When do you know
You know, you know
You know you learn
Do you die in sin, born again
With will to wind and wander climb
Through needle neck to consent

When do you know
You know, you know
You know you learn
Arrive at spring once again
And still to rise beyond the tide

On the mortal track
Fretful or fair
By straw, by strap
Toughening tear
Dust to dust to dust to dust consume
For what is worth upon me
Nascent, naissant1Embed
