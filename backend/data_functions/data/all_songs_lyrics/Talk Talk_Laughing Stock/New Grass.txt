New Grass Lyrics
Lifted up
Reflective in returning love you sing
Errant days filled me
Fed me illusion's gate in temperate stream
Welled up within me
A hunger uncurbed by nature's calling
Seven sacraments to song
Versed in Christ
Should strength desert me
They'll come, they come
They'll come
They come, they'll

Lifted up
Reflected in returning love you sing
Heaven waits, Heaven waits
Someday Christendom may come
Westward evening
Sun recedent
Set my resting vow
Hold in open heart
Open heart3Embed
