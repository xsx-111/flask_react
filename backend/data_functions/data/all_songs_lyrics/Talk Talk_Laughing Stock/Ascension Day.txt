Ascension Day Lyrics
Bet I'll be damned
Built the debt, I turned twos up today
Bet I'll be damned
Gets harder to sense the sail

Farewell
Mother numb to and devout to
Reckon luck sees us the same

Weighted my hand
Kill the bet, I'll burn on judgement day
Weighted my hand
Get hard hit to sense the sail

Farewell
Mother numb to and devout to
Double deal a season
Wrapt too lax to lapse so soon
Reckon luck sees us the same
(Instrumental)
Bed on my back
Dealt my hell, I've dealt my months of May
Bed on my back
Get parted ascension day

Farewell
Mother numb to and devout to
Reckon luck sees us the same
Reckon love deals us the same2Embed
