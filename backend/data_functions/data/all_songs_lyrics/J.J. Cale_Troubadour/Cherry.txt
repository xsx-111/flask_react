Cherry LyricsCherry, I'd like to love you
Cherry, will you love me too
Someday I will take you away
That's all I want to do
I'll love you forever, Cherry
Will you love me too
Sweet as a morning sunrise
Fresh as a mountain dew
Someday I will love you
Cherry, will you love me too
I need you forever
Cherry, will you need me too
I'll love you forever
Cherry, will you love me too
Cherry, will you love me tooEmbed
