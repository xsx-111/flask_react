Super Blue LyricsDays are longer
By yourself
You sold your soul to someone else
Now you're paying, can't you see
You want to pass it back to me
Told you once, told you twice
When you're gone don't expect to come back
Things don't work out like I planned
'Cause you've got yourself another man
Danger signal, danger ahead
I know you'd be better if you thought
If you thought I was dead
I won't tell you, I won't tell you no lie
I'll come back and haunt you as another guy
Things don't work out like I planned them
'Cause you've got yourself another manEmbed
