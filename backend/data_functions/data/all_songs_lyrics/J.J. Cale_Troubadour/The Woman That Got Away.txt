The Woman That Got Away Lyrics(J.J. Cale)
Well, I've been out on the street since yesterday
Been looking for the woman that got away
A long-legged thing with a red dress on
The kind of woman you can't leave alone
Listen, if you see her, send her my way
Looking for the woman that got away
The last time I seen her she was looking good
I had a feeling that she understood
She slipped through my fingers in the middle of the night
I've gotta find my woman and treat her right
Listen, if you see her, send her my way
Looking for the woman that got away
If I ever get my hands on that woman again
I'm gonna lock my door and keep her in
She won't do no travelling, won't follow me 'round
I'm gonna keep my woman and leave townEmbed
