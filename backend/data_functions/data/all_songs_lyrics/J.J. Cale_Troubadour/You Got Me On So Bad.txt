You Got Me On So Bad LyricsOh Baby, you got me on so bad
I think that you're the wickedless woman that I ever had
Sometimes you make me feel so complete
You take away my troubles, put my mind at ease
Oooh baby, you're up to your old tricks
I've got something wrong right here and I know that you can fix
Sometimes you treat me like I was your natural man
I come down here to you, babe, every chance I can
Baby, you feel so good to me
I do believe that you take away my misery
Sometimes I wonder if you understand
The way you handle yourself, woman, has got me on againEmbed
