Hold On LyricsFirst time I seen you, I knew
You had come undone for someone mistreated you
The ringing in your ears, the salt in your tears
Yes, I know I would feel sick at a dirty deal, yes I do
Some bright morning, the sun will shine again
Some bright morning, start all over again
Hold on, you've got to hold on
If nothing is real, I know how it feels, yes I do
Hold on, when everything is gone
I know how it feels to get a dirty deal, I doEmbed
