Hey Baby LyricsHey baby, it's your time now
Hey baby, you made it somehow
Don't let nobody come and bring you down
Hey baby, you've got 'em on the run
You know, you've got 'em on the run
I know you, you have just begun
When you came into my life
My love, I thought I would die
There's never been nobody like you
You take away these blues
Hey baby, you're looking real good
You know, you're looking real good
You make the day a song like I knew you would
When you came into my life Lord, I thought I would die
I never met nobody like you
For telling my troubles toEmbed
