You Make Me Real LyricsI really want you
Really do
Really need you baby, God knows I do
'Cause I'm not real enough without you
Oh, what can I do?
You make me real
You make me feel like lovers feel
You make me throw away mistaken misery
Make me free love
Make me free
I really want you
Really do
Really need you baby
Really do
Well I'm not real enough without you
Oh, what can I do?
You make me real
Only you baby have that appeal
So let me slide into your tender sunken sea
Make me free love
Make me free
Well rock and rock and roll
Yah roll and baby roll
Roll and honey roll
And roll and baby roll
You make me real, all right
You make me feel like lovers feel
You make me throw away mistaken misery
Make me free love
Make me free
Make me free
You make me free!Embed
