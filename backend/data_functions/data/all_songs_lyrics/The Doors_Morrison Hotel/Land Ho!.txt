Land Ho! Lyrics
Grandma loved a sailor
Who sailed the frozen sea
Grandpa was that whaler
And he took me on his knee
He said: "Son, I'm going crazy
From living on the land
Got to find my shipmates
And walk on foreign sands"

This old man was graceful
With silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and
He walked four country miles
Singing songs of shady sisters
And old time liberty
Songs of love and songs of death
And songs to set men free
Oh! Eh!

I've got three ships and sixty men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow
Till half of us are dead
Land Ho!
Well if I get my hands on a dollar bill
Gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five
Gonna skin that little girl alive
If I get my hands on a number two
Come back home and marry you
Marry you
Marry you alright

Eh, Land Ho!
Eh, Land Ho!

Well if I get back home and I feel all right
You know babe I'm gonna love you tonight
Love you 'night, love you 'night

Eh, Land Ho!
Eh, Land Ho!
Eh, Land Ho!4Embed
