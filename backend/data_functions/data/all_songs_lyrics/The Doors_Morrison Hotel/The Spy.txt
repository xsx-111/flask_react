The Spy Lyrics
I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' of
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' of
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear

I know everything
Everything you do
Everywhere you go
Everyone you know

I'm a spy
In the house of love
I know the dream
That you're dreamin' of
I know the word
That you long to hear
I know your deepest secret fear
I know your deepest secret fear
I know your deepest
Secret
Fear

I'm a spy
I can see you
What you do
And I know4Embed
