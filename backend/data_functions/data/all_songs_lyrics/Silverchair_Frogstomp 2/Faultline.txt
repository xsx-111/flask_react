Faultline Lyrics
Unsuspecting brother doesn't know what to do
When everything just falls to the ground, oh
He runs to find some cover, he doesn't have a clue
That his friend will never be found
When he's informed, that he

Will never see the boy
Will never see the boy
Never see him open his eyes
Will never see the boy
Never see the boy
You'll only hear his heavenly cries
Oh, yeah
Uh, huh

Thinking of the past, it's all over now
Mother nature strikes once again
It happened all so fast, my only question's how
How could they let that building descend
Oh, yeah
Uh, huh

Will never see the boy
Will never see the boy
Never see him open his eyes
Will never see the boy
Never see the boy
You'll only hear his heavenly cries
Oh, yeah
Uh, huh
Off to the new life, I live on death
You're leaving me all through the night
If he's born again, I need you to find
Need you to find where he is2Embed
