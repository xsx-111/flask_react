Age of Innocence Lyrics
We dismiss
The backroads
And ride these streets
Unafraid
Resigned to
Scraping paint
From our bones
Unashamed
No more the eye upon you
No more the simple man

Desolation yes, hesitation no
Desolation yes, hesitation no
As you might have guessed all is never shown
Desolation yes hesitation no

And in my prayers
I dream alone
A silent speech
To deaf ear
If you want love
You must be love
But if you bleed love
You will die love
No more the lie upon you
Cast in stone and autumn shade

Desolation yes, hesitation no
Desolation yes, hesitation no
As you might have sensed we won't make it home
Desolation yes, hesitation no

Before the rites of spring
Come to mean all things
A little taste of what may come
A mere glimpse of what has gone
Cause for the moment we are free
We seek to bind our release
Too young to die, too rich to care
Too fucked to swear that I was there

Desolation yes, hesitation no
Desolation yes, hesitation no
As you might have guessed we won't make it home
Desolation yes, Hesitation noEmbed
