Raindrops + Sunshowers Lyrics
Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops

I send my echo out
To get your love without
Obscured reflections of
My love

Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops

I’ll save a prayer for you
So lost and longing to
Be dragged through dirty streets
Wrapped up in clean white sheets
And if you think they’ll watch you now
You should know they won’t
Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops

I send my echo out
To get your love without
Obscured reflections of
Of my secret love
Force down the words about
To get your love without
Obscured reflections of my love
And I’m just trying to talk to you
Between the raindrops

Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
Rain falls on everyone
The same old rain
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindrops
And I’m just trying to walk with you
Between the raindropsEmbed
