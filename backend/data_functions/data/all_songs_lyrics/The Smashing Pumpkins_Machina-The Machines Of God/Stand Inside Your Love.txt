Stand Inside Your Love Lyrics
You and me
Meant to be
Immutable
Impossible
It’s destiny
Pure lunacy
Incalculable
Inseparable

But for the last time
You’re everything
That I want and asked for
You’re all that I dream

Who wouldn’t be the one you love?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love?
Protected and the lover of

A pure soul
And beautiful
You
Don’t understand
Don’t feel me now
I will breathe
For the both of us
Travel the world
Traverse the skies
Your home is here
Within my heart
And for the first time
I feel as though I am reborn
In my mind
Recast as child and mystic sage

Who wouldn’t be the one you love?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love?


And for the first time
I’m telling you how much I need
And bleed for
Your every move and waking sound
In my time
I’ll wrap my wire around your heart
And you’re mine
You’re mine forever now

Who wouldn’t be the one you love and live for?
Who wouldn’t stand inside your love and die for?
Who wouldn’t be the one you love?2Embed
