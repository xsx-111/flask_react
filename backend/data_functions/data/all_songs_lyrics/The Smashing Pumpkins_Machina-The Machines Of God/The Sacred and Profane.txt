The Sacred and Profane Lyrics
Give me tears
Give me love
Let me rest
Lord above
Send the bored
Your restless
The feedback scarred
Devotion-less

You’re all a part of me now
And if I fall
You’re all a part of me now
In the sun
You’re all a part of me now
You’re all a part of me now

Will love ever be enough?
Just in time to prove
Will our words ever be enough?
Just in time to lose

Give me sight
Barren breast
Pure snow
And happiness
Give me time
Give me peace
And I will prove
My release
You’re all a part of me now
And if I fall
You’re all a part of me now
Trapped in the sun
You’re all a part of me now
You’re all a part of me now

Will love ever be enough?
Just in time to prove
Will our time ever be enough?
Will love ever be enough?

You’re all a part of me now
And if I fall
You’re all a part of me now
In the sun
You’re all a part of me now
You’re all a part of me now
You’re all a part of me now
And if I fall
You’re all a part of me now
In the sun
You’re all a part of me now
Will our love ever be enough?
Will our love ever be enough?
Will our love ever be enough?
Just in time to proveEmbed
