I of the Mourning Lyrics
Radio, play my favorite song
Radio, radio
Radio, I’m alone
Radio
Radio, please don't go
Radio

I peer through curtains on empty streets
Behind a wall of caller ID
No one’s out there
To hear if I care
About the troubles in the air

‘Cause I of the mourning now go
Pick up where my thoughts left off
‘Cause I’m home to die on my own

As my radio plays my favorite song
Radio, radio
Radio, don’t you know
Radio, radio
Radio, I’m alone

I’ve blown the dust off my guitar
In the attic with the stars
I read your letters to feel better
My tears upon the faded ink

‘Cause I of the mourning now go
Pick up where my thoughts left off
‘Cause I’m home to die on my own

As my radio plays my favorite song
Radio, radio
Radio, I'm alone
Radio, radio
Radio, please don't go

I sit in the dark light
To wait for ghost night
To bring the past to life
To make a toast to life
‘Cause I have survived
What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want to change?

Radio, radio, radio, radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio
Radio, radio, radio, radio


What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want?
What is it you want to change?
What is it you want to change?3Embed
