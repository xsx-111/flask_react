The Imploding Voice Lyrics
Everywhere you are
Is everywhere you’ve been
Just lost to the beat
Punching through your skin
You don’t know what to do
But still you want to crawl
All through the broken glass
That’s everywhere you are

Your love must always be true
Your love must always be you

Everywhere you are
Anywhere you go
Even if you’re starved
It matters what you do
But even if you’ve gone too far
You can follow you
Everywhere you are

And in your mind
You were alone
All this time
With everything you were
And every smile you wore
Still locked in your heart
Everywhere you are
Everywhere you are
Every single shard

Everywhere you are
You’re never too far
‘Cause anywhere you’d go
Even to the stars
All you have to do
Is play the part of who you are
The rest is up to you

Phase unwound
By yourself
Atom bomb
On the shelf (unsung)
Pause of light
Pulse of life
New face dawns

Everywhere you are
And everywhere you go
Even if you’re down
Even if you’re low
It's in the thought of you
It’s in the eyes of all
Astride a storied past
That’s everywhere you are
Your love must always be true
Your love must always be you

Everywhere you are
Anywhere you go
Even if you’re scarred
It’s all a part of you
But ever should you put it down
You can never lose me

Everywhere you are
Everywhere you are (everywhere you are)
Everywhere you are (everywhere you are)
Everywhere you are (everywhere you are)
Everywhere you are (everywhere you are)
Everywhere you are (everywhere you are)
Everywhere you are (everywhere you are)Embed
