The Crying Tree of Mercury Lyrics
This is the song I’ve been singing my whole life
I’ve been waiting like a knife
To cut open your heart
And bleed my soul into you
I did it all for you
You and you, and you, and you

This is the sound I’ve been making my whole life
I’ve been waiting for this night
To clear up all the talk
Although, I’m selfish to a fault
Is it selfish, it’s you I want?
You, I did it all for you


This love will stand as long as you
There’s really no excuse
I did it all for you

These are the tears I’ve been crying my whole life
Like an ocean of desire
I’m reaching through the noise
Across the dusk of time
Within the lilting lies
I am singing out to you3Embed
