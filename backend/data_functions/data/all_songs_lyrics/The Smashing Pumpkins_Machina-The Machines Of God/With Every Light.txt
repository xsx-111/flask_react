With Every Light Lyrics
Taking over, we’re taking over
Throw the weight up off your shoulders now
That we can show our love
It’s almost over, it’s almost over
No more war and no more soldiers
To stand against his love

Away with all the troubles that you’ve made
Away with waiting for another day
Away

Look ma, the sun is shining on me
Impatient in love and aching to be
Could you believe in heaven
If heaven was all you had?

We’re taking over, we’re taking over
Throw away your four-leafed clovers
And stand beside this love

Away with everything you’ve grown to hate
Away with everything that holds you safe
Away
And every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
Every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
Every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
I’m never alone

Look ma, the sun is shining on me
Taking my time to do as I please
Could you believe in heaven
If heaven was all you had?

The sun is beaming, radiating
All the love we are creating
We are creating

And every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
Every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
Every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
Every light I've found (every light I've found)
Is every light that’s shining down on me
I’m never alone1Embed
