This Time Lyrics
This time I need to know
I really must be told
If it’s over
It’s up to you, you know
The things you want to hold
Are in pieces

Crashing down
Crashing down again
Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends

I’ve got to move it on
I’ve got to sing my song
While I still can
Dispatch the last alarms
Hand out the last few charms
There’s no surprises

Only love
Only love can win
Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends
Only love
Only love will win
Crashing down
Crashing down again
This time I need to know
I really must be told
That it’s over
I’ve lived my life alone
My every step foretold
To never linger
And yet it haunts me so
What we are letting go
Our spell is broken

Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends
Crashing down
Crashing down again
Only love, yeah
Only love will be enough
Yeah, only love will win

For every chemical
You trade a piece of your soul
With no return
And who you think you know
Doesn’t know you at all
Their drain is needless
Someday we’ll wave hello
And wish we’d never waved goodbye
To this romance
We’ll drink up every line
And shoot up every word
Till there’s no more
Crashing down
Crashing down, my friends
Only love
Only love can win

So cry these tears
We’ll cry as all
We’ve held so long
To fall apart
As the curtain falls
We bid you all goodnightEmbed
