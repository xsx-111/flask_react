Blue Skies Bring Tears Lyrics
Unleash the Armageddon
So all the children go to heaven
I sit by quiet still
With their pictures on my eyes
You’ll draw the guns you’re given
Write down the words as written
And never disturb the presence
Of resurrection crutch

And it’s about time
It’s about drawing near
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears

Descend the darkened stairways
Make hate with plastic playmates
And fire out remaining traces
Of your self-esteem
Mainline the deepest secrets
Lick clean the dirty fingers
I am a stranger to you
As you are to yourself
And it’s about time
It’s about fear
Blue skies bring tears

Don’t you want me
As I awake the city sigh
We’ll watch the seasons die
Blue skies bring tears

Take me inside your body (blue skies bring tears)
Cover me with your soul (blue skies bring tears)
To the darkest recess (blue skies bring tears)
Is where I wish to go (blue skies bring tears)
You are the greatest flower (blue skies bring tears)
That I have ever devoured (blue skies bring tears)
I ask for nothing given (blue skies bring tears)
For nothing in return

Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tears
Blue skies bring tearsEmbed
