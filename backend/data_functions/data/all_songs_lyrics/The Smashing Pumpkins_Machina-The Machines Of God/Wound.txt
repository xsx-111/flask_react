Wound Lyrics
There you are, as you always were
In bathing light, and naked blur
You’re a part of me, eternal one
By grand desire and setting sun

If you wait, I will wait
Taste, I will taste
If you love, I will love
Run, I will run
To my last breath

Last night I turned around and thought I saw myself turning
Inside the strangest dream of life, unloved and cities burning

Awake in my arms you cry unharmed
Our age of the hours while they still devour all
So take it all, I doubt if we will know it’s gone
‘Cause we’ve been here since time began
Begged God awake and make these plans

Wound opens, reveal this broken man
And soon there’s notions of blood on his hands
If you wait, I will wait
Taste, I will taste
If you love, I will love
Run, I will run
To my last breath

Last night I turned around and thought I saw myself turning
Last night I turned around and thought I watched the world ending
Inside the crushing down I felt a pang, the tide was turning

Destroyed in the wake
The jealous ingrates
Who’ll tear this world down
To spite God above
With his own love
With his own love

If you wait, if you wait
If you wait, I will wait
Taste, I will taste
If you love, I will love
Run, I will run
To my last breath1Embed
