Heavy Metal Machine Lyrics
If I were alive
If I were real
Would you survive?
What would you feel?

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
As sentimental as our broken dreams

Let me die for rock and roll
Let me die to save my soul
Let me die, let me die, rock and roll
Let the world forgive the past
Let all the girls kiss the boys at last
Let me go, let me go, rock and roll

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, a heavy metal machine
We’re the metal in their metal machines
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine

If I were dead
Would my records sell?
Could you even tell?
Is it just as well?
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
It’s elemental to all the rust it brings
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine

Let me die for rock and roll
Let me die to save my soul
Let me die, let me die, rock and roll
Let the world forgive the past
Let all the girls kiss the boys at last
Let me go, let me go, rock and roll

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, a heavy metal machine
We’re the metal in their droning schemes
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine

Will I survive?
Is it up to me?
Could you understand
That it’s not yours to keep?

Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machine
Heavy metal, heavy metal machineEmbed
