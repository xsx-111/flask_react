King and Caroline Lyrics
The scenario is bright for the King and Carolâ€”
What we must tell her
And seasons are slow, so wait we must
And hide from ourselves

Overrun by the rank
Roll over like an egg
And a man-child will kill them
And a quick procession will follow

Oh, so now you know
We're all standing in line
For the King and Caroline
And the wisdom they will sell us
And the wisdom they will sell
Sell
Sell
Sell
Sell, oh, oh
Oh, ohEmbed
