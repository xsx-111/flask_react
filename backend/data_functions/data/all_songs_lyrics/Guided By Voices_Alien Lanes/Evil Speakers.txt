Evil Speakers LyricsI am breathing, yet I see no sky
Things without wings have begun to fly
Unhitched trailers, I see trailers trail
From the well, I pull an empty pail
Little man bleeding, little heart beating so
Evil speaker, blow my circuits, oh no
Brothers, sisters, all transistors, you know
Father logic sometimes gets cosmic, you knowEmbed
