A Salty Salute LyricsDisarm the settlers
The new drunk drivers
Have hoisted the flag
We are with you in your anger
Proud brothers
Who do not fret
The bus will get you there yet
To carry us to the lake
The club is open
Yeah, the club is open
Hey hey, the club is open
A-come on, come on, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, the club is open
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, the club is open...Embed
