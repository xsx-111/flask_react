Ex-Supermodel LyricsShe's slender
Oh, she's cream
Oh, she's face
I took her from place to place
I moved her from room to room
I exploited her, became the groom
So I write music for soundtracks now
I write music for soundtracks now
That's what I wanted to do anyhow
I took her from place to place (room to room)
I exploited her, became the groom (I took her from room to room)
So I know, yeah...Embed
