Big Chief Chinese Restaurant LyricsIntroducing the amazing Rockethead
You know what the deal is, dude
Excuse me, Napoleon
But I gotta know
Why I gotta stand
In a highway, in a highway
Where nothing goes my way
Well, I'm going out
And I'm going in to the Big Chief's place
Gonna slap his factory downEmbed
