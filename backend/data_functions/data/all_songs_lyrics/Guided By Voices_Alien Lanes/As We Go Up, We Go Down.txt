As We Go Up, We Go Down LyricsI can't terrorize, I see terror in your eyes
As we go up, we go down
I can't socialize, I'll be institutionalized
As we go up, we go down
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh
And see the truth, yeah, is just a lie, oh
I speak in monotone: "Leave my fucking life alone."
As we go up, we go down
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)
As we go up, we go down (is just a lie)
As we go up, we go down (and see the truth, yeah)1Embed
