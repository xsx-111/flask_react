Chicken Blows Lyrics
Chicken blows, I suppose
We could have a girl or a boy (oh-ah)
And I see what you mean
I'm not here to drink all the beer

In the fridge (oh-ah, la la la)
In the room (oh), in the house
In the place (oh-ah, la la la) that we both (oh) so love

Can you sink to the depths?
I don't know, I don't even care
And our lives slip away
In the end, we will probably reach

All the way (oh-ah, la la la)
To the walls (oh) over there
Have you flown? (oh-ah, la la la, oh), our courage is only a taste
And I'll get paid (ooh, ooh)
If you'll get laid (ooh, ooh)
It's our parade (ooh, ooh)Embed
