Little Whirl Lyrics
Hey, little girl, what you said when you know that
It's so hard to believe that it's so sad
And I'm never believing in something
But it's just so hard to believe in a nomad

I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care

Hey, little girl, would you stop and just lay back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad
And I don't wanna talk about it
In a swirl bunch of nothing turned inside out

I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't care

Hey, little girl, I reach for you and you jump back
It's so hard to believe that you're so sad
I know that we've talked all around it
But it's just so hard to believe in a nomad
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care what you do anymore
I don't care, I don't careEmbed
