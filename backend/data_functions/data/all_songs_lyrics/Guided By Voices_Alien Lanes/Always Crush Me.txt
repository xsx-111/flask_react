Always Crush Me Lyrics
Full head of nothing
Fail to see the difference
Fail to feel the mercy
Off to join the flagstaff

Always crush me
Picture my amazement
When it doesn't always pain me
And I will reproduce faster

Commitment trailblazer
Your trail is quite a puzzle
And you are such a daredevil
And you are such a collector

Always crush me
Picture my amazement
When it doesn't always pain me
And I will reproduce faster1Embed
