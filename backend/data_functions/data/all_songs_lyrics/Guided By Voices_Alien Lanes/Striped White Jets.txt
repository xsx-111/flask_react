Striped White Jets Lyrics
Send in striped white jets
In through stained glass ceilings, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Color them white or red
Don't let anyone find out
Or expose your feelings, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Cover your head instead
And penetrate this dark heart
And as the wound is healing, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Crawl to the other side
Where things are new in brilliant blue
And striped white jets come speeding through
Ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
And we must not forget

The sudden pain of birth and greed
And what's expected of this super breed
For those who dream to touch the sun
And those who run, who always run


Perfect striped white jets
In their hangars, bleeding, ah-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh
Cover them all in blackEmbed
