Blimps Go 90 Lyrics
Blimps go 90, on with the show
Couldn't you see that, now, didn't you know?
Aerosol halos, films of the flag
Rifle games for seven year-olds, what a drag
Yeah, now, that's a drag

This is not a vacation
There is no place to go
Weep, sad freaks of the nation
Where blimps go 90 and you can't (won't) find me

Senators sipping on Gentleman Jack
"Go, boy," they told me, "so don't you look back"
But don't you worry, I promise to not
I'll join your canary court, and fit into the slot
Say now, what have you got?

Oftentimes, I'm reminded
Of the sweet young days
When I poured punch for the franchise
And thus was knighted, got so excited
Blimps go 90, on with the show
Couldn't you see that, now, didn't you know?
Hey now, didn't you know?Embed
