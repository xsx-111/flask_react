My Son Cool Lyrics
Decide now!

Decide now before you continue
The list is complete without your permission
I finally know how, I finally can't quit
And ancient ideas are on fire, my love

Completely, the rope has been severed
The night screams for contact and clue
I must keep a journal, I must boast a victory
And the hellfire is dying around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my love
Around you, my loveEmbed
