Strawdogs Lyrics
We've been burned out
Concerned out, discerned out
We've been sought out
'Cause we can't believe our eyes

We are the willing supporters
And we'd like to know
Why everything is so unkind

We've been sent in
Defending the one thing
'Cause it's our duty
We've got to find out why

We are the willing supporters
And we'd like to know
Why everything is so unkind
It really should be fine, yeahEmbed
