My Valuable Hunting Knife Lyrics
I want to start a new life
With my valuable hunting knife
She will shine like a new girl
And I want to shout out our love to the world, hit it!

Everything I think about, I think about
Everything I talk about, I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know

Days, they will turn into nights
But my valuable hunting knife
It will not rust through the tears
And it will not lose its appeal over years, come on!

Everything I think about, I think about
Everything I talk about, I talk about with you
But you don't know what I go through
You don't know

I'll never know
I'll never know
I'll never know
And then I will run, and then I will
And then I will hide, and then I will
And then I will run, and then I will
And then I will hide
I'll never know
I'll never knowEmbed
