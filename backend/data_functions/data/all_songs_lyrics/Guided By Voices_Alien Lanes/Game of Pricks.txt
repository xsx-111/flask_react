Game of Pricks Lyrics
I've waited too long to have you hide in the back of me
I've cheated so long, I wonder how you keep track of me

You could never be strong, you can only be free
And I'll never ask for the truth, but you owe that to me

I've entered the game of pricks with knives in the back of me
Can't call you or on you no more when they're attacking me

I'll climb up on the house, weep to water the trees
And when you come calling me down, I'll put on my disease


You could never be strong, you can only be free
And I'll never ask for the truth, but you owe that to me
And I'll never ask for the truth, but you owe that to me
And I'll never ask for the truth, but you owe that to me4Embed
