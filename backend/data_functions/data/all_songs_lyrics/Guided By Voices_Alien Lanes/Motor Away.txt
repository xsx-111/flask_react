Motor Away Lyrics
When you motor away
Beyond the once-red lips
When you free yourself
From the chance of a lifetime

You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And then the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come
When you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?

When you motor away
Down the icy streets
You can't lie to yourself
That it's the chance of a lifetime

You can be anyone they told you to
You can belittle every little voice that told you so
And the time will come when you add up the numbers
And then the time will come
When you motor away
Oh, why don't you just drive away?
Come on
