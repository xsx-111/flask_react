Watch Me Jumpstart Lyrics
Watch me jumpstart as the old skin is peeled
See an opening and bust into the field
Hidden longings no longer concealed
Watch me bulldoze every bulldozer away
Each new obstacle from each old new day
Where it's going, it's hard for me to say

And shoot me down
And bring me down
But I won't be around
As you run through the places you love
I'll remember the faces that cry
And they're pulling me back so I have to die

And watch me jumpstart at the first light of day
Each new sensation just blows me away
Don't look now, don't look now, I'm a phase
Straight from ground zero, X marks the spot
I can't pretend to be something I'm not
'Cause I'm a supernova, erect and white hot

And shoot me down
And bring me down
But I won't be around
As you run from the places you love
I'll remember the faces that cry
And they're pulling me back so I have to die
And watch me jumpstart, I'm Maximum Jack
Shot through the cosmos like an alien attack
Film finished, fade into blackEmbed
