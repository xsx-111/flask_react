Closer You Are Lyrics
Chain smoke rings like a vapor snake kiss
She says she don't know why

The closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
Closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming

You play the heavy, it's a real slick movie move
Stoned at the Alamo tonight

The closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
Try to be nice and look what it gets ya
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming

I get up at seven o'clock
And drive myself up to the lookout rock

The closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
The closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
Now you can see the boys dreaming, scheming
The closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
The closer you are, the quicker it hits ya
The closer you are, the quicker it hits yaEmbed
