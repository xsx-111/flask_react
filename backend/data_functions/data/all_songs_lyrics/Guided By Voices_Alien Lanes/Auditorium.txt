Auditorium LyricsPost-punk X-Man parked his fork-lift
Like a billion stars flickering from the grinder's wheel
Lower hybrid, clad in metal
In subgroup tools, excused from schools
To fathom hell, see you now (see you now)
Echo and his brother (Echo and his brother)
Fish and Peter the Pig
Will meet where he's big
Auditorium
Auditorium
Auditorium (-torium)
