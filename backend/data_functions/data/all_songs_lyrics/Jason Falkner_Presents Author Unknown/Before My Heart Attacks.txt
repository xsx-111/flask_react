Before My Heart Attacks LyricsThe flowers I bought when you took off are wilted in the vase
There's something here beneath the hair that kind of looks like my face
Garbage man, oh garbage man, why won't you leave my street
How can this street possibly excrete this much trash seven days a week
I am here and you are there and it don't make me feel any better
My baby blue, my you know who
Bring your sugar back before my heart attacks
I feel I should abandon all and travel down to the south
I swear I would, if only I could get last night's party out of my mouth
I am here and you are there, and it don't make me feel any better
My baby blue, my beautiful darlin' sweetheart, honey pooh
Bring your sugar back before my heart attacks
I'm drinking more and more and more, can't hold onto myself
There ain't no use when you're not here, appreciating my good health
I know I'm here and I know you're there but it don't make me feel any better
About eating more and sleeping less, I'm just waiting on your letterEmbed
