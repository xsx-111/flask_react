Untitled LyricsWhen a dog chases its tail
You just know the poor thing is ganna fail
Ah, it seems you finally caught yours
Last seen with a friend and a family member
Pitch black outside, bright white indoors
Come back inside
Pictured here with a throat that would deliver
A fist of nails and a harrowing tale
And what a tale you told
You ran outside and caught the moon
I knew then and there I'd never catch up to you
When you ran outside and caught the moon
I knew then and there I'd never catch up to you
You may not have been able to change the world
But at least you changed my world
You may not have been able to change the world
But at least you changed my world...Embed
