...Nobody Knows LyricsWarm and true from me to you
The words we use could never do
You're in the cast that's in my dreams
My everywhere, my in between, but
Have you seen my baby
Where she goes nobody knows
Have you seen my baby
Where she goes nobody knows
Wake up dear, I'm walking out the door
I'm still in love with you, I still come home to you
So hot and cold, we're not exactly old
I'm picturing your face, your understanding face
Have you seen my baby
Where she goes nobody knows
Have you seen my baby
Where she goes nobody knows
Have you seen my baby
Where she goes nobody knows
Have you seen my baby
Where she goes nobody knows
Have you seen my baby...Embed
