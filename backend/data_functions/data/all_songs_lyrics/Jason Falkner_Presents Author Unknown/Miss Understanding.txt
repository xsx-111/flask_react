Miss Understanding LyricsIf I were a fighter I'd probably kick your ass
But since I'm such a lover I'll just have to let these things pass
Because as time goes by
I can no longer deny
That a part of me died
When I met miss understanding
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know me
Baby, baby, baby, can't control me
I was born a butterfly
With a twinkle in my eye
And as time goes by
I can no longer deny
That a part of me died
When I met miss understandings
I've held so long
Just to find I took you wrong
It's you that's been here all along
In truth together we belong
So I left Mr. demanding, I did (that's me)
Baby, baby, baby, don't you know me
Believe me baby, no one can console me
I have lived a thousand lives
With a penchant for disguise
What I tried to hide
Is that I knew you lied
And it cranked up my pride
So incredibly high
And as time goes by
I can no longer deny
That a part of me died
When I met miss understanding
When I met miss understanding
I don't need miss understandings
Bye bye...Embed
