I Go Astray LyricsDon't lock the door
I just might be back at four
And don't fret your pretty face
Or tidy up the place
Cause I'm no the one who promised you
Anything but this truth
That's if there will be storms you haven't seen
And you're not here nor there but in between
We might have to start again
Only this time as better friends
He was your prince in white
With a curious lust for the night
But you never seemed to mind
Even as you were left behind
There hardly seemed a thing to say
She saw blue but the sky was gray
And even though he's out a lot
Ya still got him
He's what you got
But he falls asleep again
"I'm going out with my girlfriends"
And It seems I've finally found a way by which to say
How I'm sorry everyday I go astray
Yes, it seems I've finally found a way by which to say
How I'm sorry everyday I go astray
Astray, astray, astray...I go
She wakes up late and she sees before her newspapers spinning 'round
Takes just a second to grab her senses as her love comes tumblin' down
But she knows inside this is worth each heartache as she hears a familiar sound
In the form of an apology
Finally found a way by which to say
How I'm sorry everyday I go astray
Yes, it seems I've finally found a way by which to say
How I'm sorry everyday I go astray
I've finally found a way by which to say...Embed
