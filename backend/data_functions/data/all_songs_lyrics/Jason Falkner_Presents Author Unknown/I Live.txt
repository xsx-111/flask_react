I Live LyricsSwear to God, cross my heart, stick a needle right through my eye
She's the one that I seen, smiles at me when she's driving by
But I turn away
As if it's enough just to say to myself
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
Now and then, ask a friend to make it happen, we're introduced
She says we've met, I don't think so, I'd remember a day like that
She's just standing there
Better show her what fate looks like
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
I live
Oh, I live
(I live)
I live
I live
I live
(Brace myself and tell her how it is)
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I live
If I had you, I could never, ever ask for anything again as long as I liveEmbed
