Miracle Medicine Lyrics"It's like I'm dizzy all the time," he said as he got in the line
"I've been to three or more like him who all said I should do just fine
I've spent more money than I'm worth, I've got some more for what that's worth"
If I were ever to confuse these things, I would most certainly abuse my thing
Now that you all can read my mind, I think it's safe to say you'll mind my mind
My head's full of nothing but lead, at least that's how it feels in bed
I try to get up but I'm held upside down, give me something to calm me down
It's like the doctors used to say, "All work and no play, make Jason run away"
Dexmanol, Demerol, codeine with the dream team
I'd trade anything to feel as good as I used to
Hey doc, whatever faith I had in your miracle medicine
Is out the window with the air, been replaced by the Indian
I've been to ten or more like you, I'm sure they'll all agree it's true
If I were ever to confuse these things, I would most certainly abuse my thing
Now that you all can read my mind, I think it's safe to say you'd mind
You would then subsequently lose, you'd lose your mind...Embed
