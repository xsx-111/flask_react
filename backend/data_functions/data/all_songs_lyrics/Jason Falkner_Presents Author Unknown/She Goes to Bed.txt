She Goes to Bed LyricsShe goes to bed, but it's always alone
With a handful of friends and trouble at home
She wants to be good, she knows that she should
But with the knowledge of this, there's no way she could...oh, no
We're no more than friends and that's where it ends
But funny enough we're both wearing grins
And I'll spend half the day just running around
With a pocket of change and you on my mind
I play with some words you might not have heard
But I'm never afraid of sounding absurd
And it's not hard to see the way this could be
And if it's alright with you, then, it's OK with me...
Some things are better unsaid...
Oh, she goes to bed, but it's always alone
With a handful of friends and trouble at home
Oh, she wants to be real, to learn how to feel
What can a poor girl do, but take your heart from you
She'll take your heart from you...Embed
