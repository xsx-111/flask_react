Follow Me LyricsI don't want to believe
All the ugly things about you I read
Seems to me we could move right along
Without singing the same old song
Everyday I see your picture
And it makes me smile, that's for sure
But are you proud of all that you've done
After all, it has been so much fun
Can't they see you're not like the fakes
Who have careers off of others mistakes
Well, I can see and I understand
Follow me, you'll like what you see
Pull yourself out of your own history
I'm someone that you've come to believe
Follow me, now I've got just what you need
Everybody's talkin' so loud
Of how they knew you before you became proud
Well, I can dream of a day
When we'll never have to go our own ways
Go your own way
Can't they see you're not like the fakes
Who have careers off of public mistakes
Well, I can see and I understand, so
Follow me, you'll like what you see
Pull yourself out of your own history
I'm someone that you've come to believe
Follow me, now I've got just what you need
Follow me, you'll like what you see
Pull yourself out of your own misery
I'm someone that you've come to believe
Follow me, now I've got just what you needEmbed
