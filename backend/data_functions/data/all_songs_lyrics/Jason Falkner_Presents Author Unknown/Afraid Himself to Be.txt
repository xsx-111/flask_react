Afraid Himself to Be LyricsAnything you want, anything you need from me
Don't be afraid to ask cause I am here for you
Embrace my every charm, hold me in your arms tonight
Don't take me for a ride, I've nowhere to reside, yeah...
I approached you that way only to find no peace of mind
Yes, I'm guilty of love - if that is a crime
One thing I know is true
What once was me everyone now believes is you
Originality was never big on your list of things to be
Take me home to keep, picture me inside your sleep
I'm here inside your dreams, I'll wake you with a scream
A crime it seems to me, like a bird without a tree
To sleep and rest his weary wings
Just listen to him sing, yeah...
I approached you that way only to find no peace of mind
Yes, I'm guilty of love - if that is a crime
One thing I know is true
What once was me everyone now believes is you
Originality was never big on your list of things
Your list of things to be
Drop your gun and your guard put your hands up in the air
Give me back what you stole and get out
Get the hell outta here
One thing I know is true
What once was me everyone now believes is you
Originality was never big on your list of things to be
A closer look only to find you standing without reason or rhyme
And when the lights go up we'll see a man who's afraid of himself
Afraid of himself
Afraid himself to beEmbed
