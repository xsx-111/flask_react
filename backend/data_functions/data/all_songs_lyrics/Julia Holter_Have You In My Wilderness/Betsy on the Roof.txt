Betsy on the Roof LyricsBetsy on the roof
I can't send the rain down, baby
I can't send the rain down anymore
Oh oh, she said
Oh oh, she said oh oh ooh
Oh oh, she said
Oh oh, she said oh oh ooh
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
What of this cloud?
Moon and emotion
Elsewhere is my name now
We don't dim the lights down anymore
Oh oh, she said
Oh oh, she said oh oh ooh
Oh oh, she said
Oh oh, she said oh oh ooh
I can't remember the words to say
I don't remember the words to say to you
I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy, my arms stretched out
Looking up, won't you please tell me the answer
You know the answer, Betsy
I'm standing here on the ground, Betsy, my arms stretched out
Looking up, won't you please tell me the answer
You know the answer, Betsy3Embed
