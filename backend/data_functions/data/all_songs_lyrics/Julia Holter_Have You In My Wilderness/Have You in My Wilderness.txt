Have You in My Wilderness LyricsShake me awake!
Am I the man you see
Through your mystery eyes?
Oh yea, I second that emotion
You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love
Lady of gold, you would fit beautiful in my wilderness
Oh, in your waters I've dropped anchor
You'll see lightning cascading
Pronouncements of our love
Of our love
Our love
Our love
Tell me, why do I feel you running away?
Tell me, why do I feel you running away?
Tell me, why do I feel you running away?
Tell me, why do I feel you running away?Embed
