Night Song Lyrics
Late night in lake park
I wait for you to see me
My eyes open
Standing watch for hours
Wearing your favorite thing

I awoke
Pleasing you so slowly
I'm giving you time
And the soft light
On your mad brow
I'm asking you to show me how
How

Show me now
Show me your second face
Show me
How you make your second face

Fingers situate themselves
In dark
Moving the way that is so easy
And in summer bright
Your shout on the surface, warm
I throw a box-full
Of oranges
Syrup seeping out
Searching for a season smell
I run from you
Then walk back to
You, who I don't know
I'm sniffing for a light

Show me now
Show me your second face
Show me
How you make your second face

What did I do to make you feel so bad?
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?
What did I do to make you feel so bad?
Feel so bad
What did I do that you would make me feel so bad?
Feel so bad, baby

So badEmbed
