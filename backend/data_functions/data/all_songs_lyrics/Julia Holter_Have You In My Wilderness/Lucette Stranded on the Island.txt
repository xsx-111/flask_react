Lucette Stranded on the Island Lyrics
I call my name
Aloud
Looking for what I remember
My name I know
I love going to the movies

I turn and see my childhood home
On this new beach
Where strange birds fly
These birds swoop right over
Looking out for me

“Who is she?”
“Where does she come from?”
The building disappears

“Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?”
“Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?”
“Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?”
The sun comes up
Slower than I remember
A man I know
He lights his cigarette with nothing
Not a smile or memory
His shadow still wet as my gash against the rock
Sharp and high on the Balearic promontory

I see his ship go
What stings me?
These birds can't stop the waves

“Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?”
“Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?”

The birds can sing a song
He covered me in cactus
The birds can sing a song
I don't remember much but
The birds can sing a song
Good riddance he is gone
The birds can sing a song
He put me ashore
The birds can sing a song
At 4 am
The birds can sing a song
The man is gone
The birds can sing a song
The man is gone
The birds can sing a song
Good riddance he is gone
The birds can sing a song
His billhook caught their eyes
The birds can sing a song
Blood is on his billhook
The birds can sing a song
His billhook caught my neck
The birds can sing a song
How unnaturally I gaze
The birds can sing a song
How unnaturally I gaze
The birds can sing a song
I don't remember much but
The birds can sing a song
He turned me around
The birds can sing a song
My mouth quivered
The birds can sing a song
Perpetually alarmed
The birds can sing a song
I gaze at nothing
The birds can sing a song
I gaze at nothing
The birds can sing a song
My emerald is gone
The birds can sing a song
He lifts my hand
The birds can sing a song
He lifts my hand
The birds can sing a song
I hear him
The birds can sing a song
I hear him
I don't remember much but
“Oh she's been marooned
Can anybody help her?”4Embed
