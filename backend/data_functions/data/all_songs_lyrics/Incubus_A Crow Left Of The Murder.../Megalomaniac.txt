Megalomaniac Lyrics
I hear you on the radio
You permeate my screen, it's unkind
But if I met you in a scissor fight
I'd cut off both your wings on principle, alone
Principle, alone

Hey, megalomaniac
You're no Jesus, yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby
And step down, step down
Step down

If I were your appendages
I'd hold open your eyes so you would see
That all of us are heaven sent
And there was never meant to be only one
To be only one

Hey, megalomaniac
You're no Jesus, yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby
And step down, step down
Step down
Step down
Step down
Oh, step down
You're, you're
You're
You're no Jesus
You're no Elvis
You're no Jesus
You're no Jesus
You're no Elvis
You're no answer
Step down, step down
Step down, step down
Hey, hey

Hey, megalomaniac
You're no Jesus, yeah, you're no fucking Elvis
Wash your hands clean of yourself, baby
And step down, step...
Step down

Step down
Oh, step down
Oh, step down
Step down6Embed
