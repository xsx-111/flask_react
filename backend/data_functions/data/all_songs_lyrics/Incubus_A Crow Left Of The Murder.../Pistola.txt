Pistola Lyrics
On the tip of my tongue
An offensive is poised and rearing
My intention a bullet
My body a trigger finger
Trigger, trigger finger

Yeah, my pen is a Pistola, ooh
I don't need to fear, fear you
Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
Ooh, ooh, ooh

My secret arsenal
Is an infinite ageless inkwell
It's a fountain of youth
And a patriot's weapon of choice

Yeah, my pen is a Pistola, ooh
I don't need to fear, fear you
Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
On the tip of my tongue
An offensive is poised and rearing
My intention a bullet
My body a trigger fi...

Yeah, my pen is a Pistola, ooh
I don't need to fear...
Yeah, my pen is a Pistola
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oooh
