Smile Lines Lyrics
Met my match today
Felt the blood rushing and mingling
A curious and enigmatic thing
Now spiders in my dreams
Synchronicity weaves like a web
When you were meant to be a meal

I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say high school never ends

Never act my age
But you can tell by the lines in my smile
That I have been around for awhile
So, insecurities
Are about as useful as trying
To put the pin back in the grenade

I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say high school never ends
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say high school never stops
This isn't coincidence
There's no such thing
This isn't coincidence
No
This isn't coincidence
There's no such thing
This isn't...
No
 x2
I want you bad
I want you bad
I understand why they say high school never ends
