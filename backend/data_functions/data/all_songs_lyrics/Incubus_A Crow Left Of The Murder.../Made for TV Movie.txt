Made for TV Movie Lyrics
I heard a word from on high
Glare like a light in the sky
It said, quit blowing each other up
A voicing so crystalline clear
Something's unclean in your ear
When only blood fills your cup

Hello, I'm trying to focus
But my eyes deceive me
Focus, I'm witnessing
History repeating

It fell like a tear from my eye
Flying machines, so up high
Well, there goes the neighborhood
A scene set to singe innocence
Up-heave, unhinge, and pit against
Like every made for TV movie should

Hello, I'm trying to focus
But my eyes deceive me
Focus, I'm witnessing
History repeating
Focus, focus
Focus
Focus, focus
Focus

We are, we know
We see, we think
For you
The who, the what
The when, the where
The why
We build your young
We build you too
We see you all

Hello, I'm trying to focus
But my eyes deceive me
Focus, I'm witnessing
History repeatingEmbed
