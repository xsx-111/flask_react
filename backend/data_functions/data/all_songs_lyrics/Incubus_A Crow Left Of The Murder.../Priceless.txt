Priceless Lyrics
The fact that you, you think you can
Speak to me the way you do
It leads me to believe that you
Have never stepped out of the skin you lived within
When, and if this day occurs
Your tongue, the taste will imitate
A battery, the anti-equilibrium
Your stomach becomes the floor

The look on your face was priceless
The look on your face was priceless
Yes, the look on your face was priceless
That look, it was so...

A light goes on upstairs
The attic is ablaze
This island isn't big enough for both of us
So who will swim in eel infested oceans?
Kiss the sand good-bye
Because the tide is coming up and in
Yeah, water, water, water everywhere
And every chance to sink!
The look on your face was priceless
The look on your face was priceless
Yes, the look on your face was priceless
That look, it was so...
Priceless
Priceless
Priceless

It's, it's, it's, it's an amalgamation of the things
You aren't the ways you wish you were
A split second perceiving of
The way you really look to everyone of them
I wish that you could see because
I wish that you could...

The look on your face was priceless
The look on your face was priceless
Yes, the look on your face was priceless
That look, it was so...
Priceless
So priceless
