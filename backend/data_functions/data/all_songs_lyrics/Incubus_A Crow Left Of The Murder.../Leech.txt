Leech Lyrics
Now does it make you indie? Does it make you proud?
To talk the world into a paper bag
Spotty stain of I'm okay, you're not okay
Yes, men too could be on the rag

I'm over my head, I need a pick-me-up, whoa
It's easy to get high when you're standing on our backs, man
Will anything ever be good enough for you? Whoa
Stand on your own, hold your water if you can

The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?
The ride's over, faring well?
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?
The ride's over, faring well?
Not on my time

It isn't fair to mention, but it awes the crowd
Your fictional, plastic alibi
So take another hit, steal another line
Did you ever meet a leech who was good at goodbyes?

When you were down, I always picked you up
Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you
So fuck yourself and fuck this bleeding heart of mine
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?
The ride's over, faring well?
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?
The ride's over, faring well?

When you were down, I always picked you up
Why didn't I recognize that everything was never fine?
I'm kicking myself that I shared spit with you
So fuck yourself and fuck this bleeding heart of mine

The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?
The ride's over, faring well?
The ride's over, did you enjoy yourself?
The ride's over, faring well?

The ride's over
The ride's over
The ride's over
The ride's over
The ride's over
The ride's over
The ride's over
The ride's overEmbed
