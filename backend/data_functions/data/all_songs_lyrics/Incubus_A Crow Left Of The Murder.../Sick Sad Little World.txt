Sick Sad Little World Lyrics
No, you're not the first to fall apart
But always the first one to complain
You better get careful or
You'll compromise everything you are

The world is a drought when out of love
Please, come back to us, you're all of the above
I'm making a choice to be out of touch
"Leave me be," he said

Leave me here in my
Stark raving, sick, sad, little world
Leave me here in my
Stark raving, sick, sad, little world

I've never had unpaid confidantes
It's more than I would care to explain
But I have an open door
Policy when it comes to blame

The world is a joke when out of love
Please, come back to us, you're all of the above
I'm making a choice to be out of touch
"Leave me be," he said
Leave me here in my
Stark raving, sick, sad, little world
Leave me here in my
Stark raving, sick, sad, little world


Leave me here in my
Stark raving, sick, sad, little world
Leave me here in my
Stark raving, sick, sad, little world3Embed
