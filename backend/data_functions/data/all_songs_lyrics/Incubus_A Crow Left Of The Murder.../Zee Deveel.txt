Zee Deveel Lyrics
Nice car, where'd you get your ride?
A trophy? Badge of honor? Overcompensation?
Price tags advertise your pride
Since when did what we pay for colored cloth gauge our gravity?

Yeah, you got your little world
Picture perfect, it's a pearl
Now go and try and sleep in the bed you made

You should be careful what you wish for
'Cause every one of us has the devil inside
You should be careful what you wish for
'Cause all of what amounts becomes you

Nice watch, man, you got the time?
There's never enough and it always goes too slow, too slow

Yeah, you got your little world
Picture perfect, it's a pearl
Now go and try and sleep in the bed you made
You should be careful what you wish for
'Cause every one of us has the devil inside
You should be careful what you wish for
'Cause all of what amounts becomes you

Nice watch, man, you got the time?
There's never enough and it always goes too slow
Price tags advertise your pride
Since when did what we pay for colored cloth gauge our gravity?

You should be careful what you wish for
'Cause every one of us... Ooh
You should be careful what you wish for
'Cause all of what amounts becomes you

YouEmbed
