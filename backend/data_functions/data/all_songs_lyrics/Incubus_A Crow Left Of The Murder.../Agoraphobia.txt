Agoraphobia Lyrics
Two people touching lips, hands on each other's hips
Nothing else in the world but one another
The 42nd floor on a distant shore
I wonder how we strayed so far from this
Remember when we were just flesh and bone, you sir
May have forgotten how good your world could be
So, put down your hollow tips and kiss your lover's lips
And know that fate is what you make of it

Please end this, please end this
Before this ends us, ends us
Ends

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside
For good, for good, for good, for good
For good, for good, for good, for good

I read the news today and everything they say
Just makes me want to stay inside and wait
But a part of me knows that waiting in the throes
Is on a par with reading with my eyes closed
"What can I do?" You say, it's just another day
In the life of apes with ego trips
Put down your hollow tips and kiss your lover's lips
And know that fate is what you make of it
Please end this, please end this
Before this ends us, ends us
Ends us

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside for good
For good

I'm gonna stay inside
I'm gonna stay inside for good
I'm gonna stay inside for good
For good

I wanna stay inside
I wanna stay inside for good
I wanna stay inside

Don't wanna stay inside for good
I don't wanna stay inside
For good, for good, for good, for good
For good, for good, fuck off, for good
For good, for good, for good, for good1Embed
