Southern Girl Lyrics
Is everything a baited hook?
And are there locks on all doors?
If you're looking for an open book
Look no further, I am yours

We'll behave like animals
Swing from tree to tree
We could do anything
That turns you up and sets you free

You're an exception to the rule
You're a bonafide rarity
You're all I ever wanted
Southern girl, could you want me?

So come outside and walk with me
We'll try each other on to see if we fit
And with our roots, become a tree
To shade what we make under it

We'll behave like animals
Swing from tree to tree
We could do anything
That turns you up and sets you free, yeah
You're an exception to the rule
You're a bonafide rarity
You're all I ever wanted
Southern girl, could you want me?
You're an exception to the rule
You're a bonafide rarity
You're all I ever wanted
Southern girl, could you want me?

Southern girl, could you want me?
Southern girl, could you want me?
Southern girl, could you want me?
Southern girl, could you want me?
Southern girl, could you want me?
Southern girl, could you want me?
