A Crow Left Of The Murder Lyrics
Unlearn me
Ditch what I read behind what I heard

Look, find, free
Yet? Do you get it yet? Do you get it?

From here on it's instinctual
Even straight roads meander
Every piece contains a map of
It all! It all!

Evidence
In the march of the ant, pulse of the sea

Look, find, free
Yet? Do you get it yet? Do you get it?

From here on it's instinctual
Even straight roads meander
Every piece contains a map of
It all! It all!
Out of line and indivisible
A crow left of the murder
Every piece contains a map of
It all! It all!
Everything I wanted
Wanted to know
Everything I wanted
Wanted to see
To see, yeah
Oh, oh

Unlearn me
Unlearn me
Do you get it yet?
Look, find, free
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?
Do you get it yet?Embed
