Beware! Criminal Lyrics
You crawl in bed, it's 3am
You smell of wine and cigarettes
A butterfly under the glass
You are beautiful, but you're not going anywhere
We do the same thing every night
I swear I've heard this song before
A swimmer who has seen a shark
I should really be more wary of the water

You came, you saw, you conquered
Everyone
I'm left here guessing
Oh, what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down, but not out
And far from done
Hey all, beware
Criminal
Criminal, oh no

A prism with an intellect
You show your light selectively
You stole my glow, a seasoned thief
The blacks of my eyes are turning into opals
Today, I'll walk
There's nothing here left for me
But empty promises and the thought of
All the things I'm never getting back
You came, you saw, you conquered
Everyone
And I'm left here bleeding
Oh, what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down, but not out
And far from done
Hey all, beware, ooh
Beware, criminal

Criminal
Criminal
Did you think, did you think I wouldn't notice?
Did you think, did you think, did you really think I wouldn't care?
Did you think, did you think I wouldn't notice?
Did you think, did you think, did you really think...
Yeah

You came, you saw, you conquered
Ooh
And I'm left here bleeding
Oh, what went wrong?
Yeah, I'm down, but not out
And far from done
Hey all, beware
