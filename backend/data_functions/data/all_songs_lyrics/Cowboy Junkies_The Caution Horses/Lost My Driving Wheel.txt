Lost My Driving Wheel LyricsJust came up on the midnight special
Hey, how 'bout that
My car broke down in Texas
She stopped dead in her tracks
Just called to tell you that I need you
Just called to tell you how I feel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
They took my money on the night train north
What a terrible thing
I gave my promise that I will be there with you
By Saturday night
I want to tell you that I need you
I need to tell you how I feel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
You can't say much in a phone call, babe
You know how it is
I have to tell you one sure thing
Oh, won't you listen to this
I want to tell you that I love you, babe
I want to tell you just how I feel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
Some old engine that's lost my driving wheel
I feel like some old engine that's lost my driving wheelEmbed
