You Will Be Loved Again Lyrics(Mary Margaret O'Hara)
Yet Courier/BMG Songs Inc ASCAP
How could he take you in his arms
And help you to be free
Then leave you forgotten
And is it enough to cry?
When you're so broken...
Her cold eyes tell you you're not welcome
She tells lies but you'll take her back again
And is it enough to die?
When you're so taken
You will be loved again
You will be loved again
But will she sing and will she dance
And will she forever
And will he sing and will he dance
And will he forever
Someday you will feel a love so deep
And you'll find someone not lost in sleep
And you will be loved again
You will be loved again
You will be loved againEmbed
