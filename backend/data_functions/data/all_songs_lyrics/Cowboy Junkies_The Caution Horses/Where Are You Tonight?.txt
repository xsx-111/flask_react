Where Are You Tonight? LyricsThere's a young man in the corner playing 'Crazy' all night long
Quarters piled high upon the table
He orders Wild Turkey and with a quick wit and a smile
He says, 'My darling, you're the one I'll drape in sable'
But his baseball cap and this bar-room rap
Tell me a different story
That this is not my prince to grant all my wishes
Just another lonely country-boy grown weary of the night
Just another boy with a sink full of dirty dishes
Where are you tonight?
When I left you in my dreams last night
You promised me that we would be breaking free
Where are you tonight?
He tells me of the back roads
And how we'll drive them all night long
How the days will fade and the moon will hang forever
And how the cloud of dust we'll kick up will linger like a song
And the myth will grow about the two who refused to surrender
Then I catch us in the bar-room mirror
With his arm around my shoulder
This girl I see has grown so unfamiliar
And as she stands to leave with a stranger by her side
She can't help but laugh at a life grown so peculiar
Where are you tonight?
I don't think I can face tomorrow's light
Not knowing if you'll be there to guide me
Where are you tonight?
Where are you tonight?
I think that I'll make it through all right
But I'd love to have you just one more time beside meEmbed
