Escape Is So Simple Lyrics(Michael Timmins)
The way you kissed me this morning
It told me that you soon would be going
You didn't even look in my eyes
When you said goodbye
And last night in your sleep you broke all the promises
That I knew you would never keep
Now I'm reading the letter which you placed on the dresser
And you're five hundred miles down the road
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be traced
Yeah, I remember when we said 'forever'
Was the craziest word that we knew
But I think that I like it much better than I do 'goodbye'
And I could sit here all evening and think of the reasons
Why you are not by my side
Instead I'll go to the kitchen, find a strong chair to sit in
And drink myself far, far away
Escape is so simple
In a world where sunsets can be raced
But distance only looses the knife
The pattern of its scar
Can always be tracedEmbed
