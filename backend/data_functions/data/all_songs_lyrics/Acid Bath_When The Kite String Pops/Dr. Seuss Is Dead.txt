Dr. Seuss Is Dead LyricsDr. Seuss is dead
We await... life
Dr. Seuss is dead
A cloud of flies obscure the sun
A stone is dropped
A dream undone
Ripples grow and ride the tide
The dead things crawl from deep inside
With it's dying
Sour breath
The burning smell of insect flesh
Hungry things in circles crowd
Around t.v.'s turned up too loud
We are the dead next door
Turned up to loud
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor
It's too fucking loud
Taste the light, inject the lord
It's too fucking loud
I cut my self again because I'm so fucking bored
It's too fucking loud
We are the dead next door
It's too fucking loud
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor
It's too fucking loud
Taste the light, inject the lord
It's too fucking loud
I cut my self again because I'm so fucking bored
Motherfuck yeah!
We await...life
Dr. Seuss is dead
The dream is swirling
I'm alone
Where the streets are paved with bone
Buildings with a hundred eyes
Watch me through the swarming flies
Behind shade pulled down tight
Things are growing without light
Hungry things in circles crowd
Around t.v.'s turned up too loud
We are the dead next door
Turned up to loud
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor
It's too fucking loud
Taste the light, inject the lord
It's too fucking loud
I cut my self again because I'm so fucking bored
It's too fucking loud
We are the dead next door
It's too fucking loud
Where the dirty needles shine and litter the floor
It's too fucking loud
Taste the light, inject the lord
It's too fucking loud
I cut my self again because I'm so fucking bored
Motherfuck yeah!
The dream sea has been poisoned
Stoplight flashes me red
Innocence sufficated in it's sleep
Dr. Seuss is dead
The dream sea has been poisoned
Stoplight flashes me red
Innocence sufficated in it's sleep
Dr. Seuss is dead
Dead
Dead
Dead
He's fucking dead2Embed
