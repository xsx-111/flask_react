Cheap Vodka LyricsI blew my last five on a cheap fifth of vodka
Gonna kill somethin'
There ain't nothing gonna stop us tonight
I know about confusion
Let's start a riot
Let's start a war
Everybody that you know is a whore
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, I don't care
If there's gonna be blood, we'll be there
I know about confusion
Turn on all the lights
So I can watch it die
I'm gonna taste some blood
Before they close my eyes
Because I got the answer
One bullet
Check out the answer
One bullet
I know
How you feel
Cut out my eyes so I can't see
The cold thing that's swallowing me
We're meat and that's it
So let's fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
We're meat and that's it
So let's fuck it, fuck it, fuck it
Fuck it, vodkaEmbed
