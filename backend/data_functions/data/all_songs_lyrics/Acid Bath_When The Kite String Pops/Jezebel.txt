Jezebel Lyrics"If I took this cigarette and put it out on you...
Would you love me?"
Her throat is soft
Her lips are red
Her thighs are white
Her heart is dead
Jezebel
Jezebel
Red rope burns around her wrists
Her blood is cold.. from heroines kiss
Do you love your whore?
I like to hear you beg
She crouched down in the corner with her head between her legs
Jezebel
Jezebel
Broken glass and dirty needles
Soul erosion truth
Electric god
Our superman found dead in a telephone booth
Shards of teeth
Ice pick abortions
Orgasmic death so warm
Let's die screamin'
Black goat semen
I can't hear you whisper "conform"
Hearts will stop and brain cells pop
Apocalyptic high
She screams bloody murder as they chop off her fingers
So this is how it feels to die
But it's okay
Yeah, everything's okay
She was talking bout' conspiracy
Talkin' about taking sides
I was masturbating, just contemplating
The cold love of suicide
Hearts will stop and brain cells pop
Apocalyptic high
She screams bloody murder as they chop off her fingers...
So this is how it feels to die
But it's okay
Yeah, everythings okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay
It's okay...
Jezebel
My light
Bitch, fuck
Bitch, fuck
Bitch, fuck
Bitch, fuck
