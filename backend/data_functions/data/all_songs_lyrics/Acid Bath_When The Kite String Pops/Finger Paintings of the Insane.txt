Finger Paintings of the Insane LyricsTurning the knife buried in your stomach
I woke up alive, black with stain
Glistening and new, the sunset's coming
Finger paintings of the insane
Come on and sterilize me
Kneel down and idolize me
Suck me, fuck me, resurrect me
Rut me, cut me and infect me
Slice me, dice me, I wanna die screamin'
Thoughts of dead babies wiped away with my semen
Bleed me, feed me and inject me
Feel me, kill me, then dissect me
The pigs will squeal, their blood will drain
Finger paintings of the insane
Slice the throat of authority
Look deep past the skin and you will see
I am the messiah!
I am the messiah!
I am the messiah!
Greasy smoke billows into the sky
Cockroach dreams, the human dust of pain
Twitching, screaming, hide your razor face
Finger paintings of the insane
Come on and sterilize me
Kneel down and idolize me
Suck me, fuck me, resurrect me
Rut me, cut me and infect me
Slice me, dice me, I wanna die screamin'
Thoughts of dead babies wiped away with my semen
Bleed me, feed me and inject me
Feel me, kill me, then dissect me
Bloody mountain momma, rockabilly machine
Kiddy porn lover with a mouth for disease
Giddy 'up, honey, my rubber fuck doll
When your candle's snuffed out, I'll burn brighter than before
Bloody mountain momma, rockabilly machine
Kiddy porn lover with a mouth for disease
Giddy 'up, honey, my rubber fuck doll
When your candle's snuffed out, I'll burn brighter than before
Pink poinsettias for emotion that died
A chilling war-gasm that feels like cyanide
Her pussy bleeds sunshine, rabid for flesh
As each raindrop plunges to its death
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the mother
Kill the father, rape the motherEmbed
