The Blue LyricsAcross your face
I see what you are
You wanna kill the sun
Blot out the stars
I know you, you're nothing
You're so small
You're fucking nothing
Nothing at all
The sun burns on
It reminds me of you
The slit wrists of the sky
Bleeding into the blue
We twist beneath forever
Do you know what you've done?
Ants in the afterbirth
Slugs under the sun
I could not wake the dead man dreaming
Acid party, murder at the late show
Mutate me and breed yourselves a savior
I could not kill the dead man screaming
Eat my dead cock
Eat my dead cock
I have fallen deep in love with the sky
Fragments of a sunbeam, glaring on a kitchen knife
Leaves will fall as everything must follow
Kill your idol, come on, jump into the void
Eat my cold shit
Everybody whispers where birds fall dead
I smell the yellow sickness churning inside your head
Wiping flecks of foam, twisting with rabies
Bloody, we run through fields of dead daisies
How could I ever make you know what you've done?
Ants in the afterbirth
Slugs under the sun
I have fallen in love with the sky
Fragments of sunbeam glaring on a kitchen knife3Embed
