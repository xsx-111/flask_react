The Bones of Baby Dolls LyricsFlower girls play lover
Grave games in the courtyard
I heard her screaming like a radio
Flower girls play lover
Grave games in the courtyard
I heard her screaming like a radio
Mary Lou left marks on you
She just screams at the walls
The kite string pops
I'm swallowed whole by the sky
We smoke the bones of baby dolls
Techno-liquid screaming meat
Heaven's cold beneath my feet
Cyber love the anti-man
We make love, ahh
Because we can
Virgins play where the bayou's blue
Barefoot (and bloody), eatin' mushroom stew
Work for pay and pay for freedom
Fuck 'em all, we don't need 'em
We smoke the bones of baby dolls
Everything's gone dry
Like bottle glass scraping cross the pavement
Everything's gone dry
Like bottle glass scraping cross the pavement
Everything's gone dry
Like bottle glass scraping cross the pavement
Everything's gone dry
Like bottle glass scraping cross the pavementEmbed
