Dope Fiend LyricsWhy do you love to lick my wounds?
Why do you love to feel my pain?
Why do you love to suck my life?
Why do you look so motherfucking dead? Dead? Dead?
Why do I feel so dead?
Why do I feel so high? High? High?
Kill me...I'm a dope fiend
Do not touch me for I am unclean
Kill (your television/kill your time) Kill me
Kill (the cold embryo/kill my mind) Kill me
Screaming insects hail the Queen
Welcome the killer home
Hold me close to your dead heart
And let the rapist roam
Put your bloody hands on me
And whisper in my ear
Burning bodies keep us warm
And have for many years
Yeah!
Why do you love to lick my wounds?
Why do you love to feel my pain? Pain? Pain? Pain? Yeah!
Why do you love to suck my life?
Why do you love to lick my wounds?
Why!?
Yeah motherfucker, I'm high
And I'm thankful just to be alive
Yeah motherfucker, I'm high
And I'm thankful just to be alive
Yeah motherfucker, I'm high
And I'm thankful just to be alive
Yeah motherfucker, I'm high
And I'm thankful just to be aliveEmbed
