Toubabo Koomi LyricsWe wanna see some blood
We need a new whore
We don't give a fuck
We just want more
Blood, we want blood
I'm gonna fuck the hole in Kennedy's head
Revolt, deface, resist
Push the button
Legalize freedom
Let's shoot the president
Rape the queen
And feel the flowers breathe again
Inside this dead machine
Gotta teach you, gotta teach you
Gotta teach you, gotta teach you
Swimming into nowhere
Thrill kill avenue
Cutting her slowly
Liberty, she crawls to me
I slept the last mile on our way to endsville
Shove it inside her, spectro-trippin on
I slept the last mile on our way to endsville
Spread your legs, don't look at me
Cut me, rape me, make me free
Breeders screaming, dreaming bloodless
For the loveless
White sound, oceans of dreams
I won't be another number on the screen
Shhh, I wanna hear you scream
I won't be another number
White sound, jet black scream
Vomiting this cold mass of hate
I'm gonna push my love
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her skull
Through her-
I have heard abortion stories from the leather nun
Holding hands with dead girls, hiding from the sun
I did a line
I did a line
I did a line
I did a line
The lines that define begin to gray and fade now
We shoot out the lights and swallow razor blades
I feel nothing for the meat that came before
Liberty, she crawled to me playing the whoreEmbed
