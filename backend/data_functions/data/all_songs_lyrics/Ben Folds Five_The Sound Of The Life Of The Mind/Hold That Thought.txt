Hold That Thought LyricsShe broke down and cried
At the strip mall acupuncturist
While the world went on outside
The Chinese doctor took her arm
Gazed at the floor and read her wrist
For the secrets in her life
"Here's your medicine," she said
"If you not smile at him, then someone else will."
You hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought, too
Ah ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I was shown the thirty-six
Ways I'm not available
On a simple, easy chart
Later on that evening
On the beach in Santa Monica
It was a very risky start
Suppose the stupid chart is right
In a year will you still feel the same way?
Ah, well, you hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought, too
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ahh, ahh
Did you ever see the film
Where a man is given spectacles
That make the world look upside-down?
He falls about the place
But in time he somehow readjusts
And when they take the glasses off
The eyes he's always had see sky below him
And he falls again
Ah, but you hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought
You hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought
You hold that thought
And I'll hold that thought
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
OooohEmbed
