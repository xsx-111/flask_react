Do It Anyway Lyrics
You might put your love and trust on the line
It's risky, people love to tear that down, let 'em try
Do it anyway
Risk it anyway

And if you're paralyzed by a voice in your head
It's the standing still that should be scaring you instead
Go on and do it anyway
Do it anyway

There'll be times you might leap before you look
There'll be times you'll like the cover and that's precisely why you'll love the book
Do it anyway
Do it anyway

Tell me what I said I'd never do
Tell me what I said I'd never say
Read me off a list of the things
I used to not like, but now I think are okay

(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Sometimes it's not subjective wrong and right
(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Deep down you know it's downright wrong but you're invincible tonight
So you do it anyway
It's done, you did it
(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
Despite your grand attempts the chips are set to fall
(Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah)
And all the stories you might weave cannot negotiate them all
Do it anyway
Be honest anyway

(Ah ah ah)
So tell me what I said I'd never do
Tell me what I said I'd never say
(Ah ah ah)
Read me off a list of the things
I used to not like but now I think are o-

Kay!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah woah woah

It's gonna be so very hard to say
And watch the trust and joy all drain from her innocent face
But you must do it anyway
It sucks but do it anyway
(Ah, ah)
Call it surrender but you know that that's a joke
(Ah, ah)
And the punchline is you were actually never in control, but still
Surrender anyway

(Ah)
Tell me what you said you'd never do
(What you said you'd never)
Tell me what you said you'd never say
(Do, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Read me off that list of things 'cause I used to not like you
Now I think you're o-

Kay!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Woah woah woah woah
Everybody knows that you just gotta do it anyway

Do it anyway, do it anyway
Do it anyway, do it anyway
Do it anyway, do it anyway
Do it anyway, do it anyway
'Cause you don't do nothing to avoid self punishment
(Do it anyway, do it anyway)
You won't do nothing, you won't feel nothing gotta
(Do it anyway, do it anyway)
Do it, do it, do it anyway
(Do it anyway, do it anyway)
Ah, do it anyway
(Do it anyway, do it anyway)1Embed
