Thank You for Breaking My Heart LyricsYeah, I want a different answer
So, I ask you once again
But the truths and the silence
And this time I got it
It's over
Thank you for breaking my heart
Now I know that it's in there
I left it wide open and asked you to stay
But you know better
Guess I thought it wouldn't happen
And I could care until it hurt
Damn the ironic timing, the clouds and their linings
That open up and pour
And thank you for breaking my heart
Now I know that it's in there
What a fool to imagine that you'd feel the same
But you know better
Rain has washed the leaves away
Skeletons and stars
I'm pulling the door too
And closing the blinds
So thank you for breaking my heart
Now I know what it feels like
And it hurts so badly
Tell me this will pass
Soon and I know betterEmbed
