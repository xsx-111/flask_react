On Being Frank Lyrics
I had it all
Or should I say, "I saw it all?"
And it's a long way from the dustbin of New Jersey to the top
Who would have known?
Who would have known?

I had a dream
But dreams had other plans for me
For thirty years, I set the thermostat where Frank Sinatra liked it
Pulled his girls and hung his hats—I never knew which ones were mine
Now, he's gone
I'm alone

And I don't know where I might be going
I rode the wind; the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside coming home
But home—
For me, was always someone else, you know?
That shadows always fall when the sun goes down

I shook the hands
Of Mafia dons and presidents
And though they always smiled politely with a measure of decorum
Still, their eyes would scan beyond me for a glimpse of something more
But now, he's gone
Now, they're gone
And I don't know where I might be going
I rode the wind; the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside coming home
But home—
For me, was always someone else, you know?
That shadows always fall when the sun goes down


Alone
A shadow of a star
Don't you know?
That shadows always fall
Yeah, shadows always fall
When the sun goes down

And I don't know where I might be going
I rode the wind; the wind stopped blowing
Set me on the roadside coming home
And home— (Home)
For me, was always someone else, you know?
