Draw a Crowd Lyrics
Ah-ah-ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Damn

I ordered something, it took a while
This morning something was on my doorstep
What's this I'm holding? Time capsule order
'Cause I'm a brand new man, and I don't think I want it
I don't think I want it
A row of flags hangin' behind me
A garden of mics and questions, and photo-flashes blind me
And I'm so high, I can't recall my statements
I only know I made 'em because my face vibrated

Is it all in my mind? I could've sworn I saw it
I thought I was fine, just fine is what I call it

Oh-oh, if you're feeling small
And you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
Oh-oh, if you're feeling small
And you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
I was gruntled when it was just feet on gravel
To have come apart, I must have once been raveled
Now when pretty phrases don't mean nothing
And I wanna sell 'em, I sing the line again
So smooth you can hear the beard
So smooth you can hear the beard
Three times is poetry
So smooth you can hear the beard

Oh-oh, if you're feeling small
And you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
Oh-oh, if you're feeling small
And you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
If you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall

And if you can't draw a crowd, settle for what you can draw

I'm just saying
I-I-I-I'm just saying
Why does saying, that "I'm just saying"
Lend any weight to what I'm saying?
Oh, it's come back again, I can't ignore it
I'm a brand new man, but I'm still payin' for it
Oh-oh, if you're feeling small
And you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
Oh-oh, if you're feeling small
And you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
If you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall
If you can't draw a crowd, draw dicks on the wall

And if you can't draw a crowd, settle for what you can draw

I only wanted to be Stevie Wonder
But I got to settle for this vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd) Oh, this vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd) Oh, this vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd) Taste my vanilla thunder
(If you can't draw a crowd, if you're feeling small)2Embed
