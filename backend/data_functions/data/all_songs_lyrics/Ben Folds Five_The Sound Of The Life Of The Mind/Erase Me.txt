Erase Me Lyrics
What was our home?
Paper, not stone
A lean-to, at most
And when you pulled
Your half away
Gravity won
Like it always does
Did I weigh a ton?
Would it be easier
To just delete
Our pages and the plans we made?

Erase me, so you don't have to face me
Put me in the ground and mow the daisies
Ah, the memory
See how it goes when you—

Erase me
Erase me

So what will you do
With no me for you?
I know what we said
What if I left
A thing or two?
We know that you don't seem
To think about what you need
'Til you reach to find that you've—
Erased me—what the fuck is this? You're crazy
Turned around, in two weeks'e time, replaced me
Ah, the memory
Everybody knows how it goes
You just erase me, do me like a bro and tase me
Fireworks, poof! It's gone, amazing
New bio, you've gone solo
Drawing mustaches on our wedding photo

Erase me
Erase me
Erase me


(Erase me) This is not shouting, baby
(Erase me) Go and call the cops now, baby
Ah, the memory
Everybody knows 'bout the brand-new ho
Erase me, and you'll never have to face me
Erase me, Option-Command-Escape me
And if you feel nothing, guess what I wanna be?
