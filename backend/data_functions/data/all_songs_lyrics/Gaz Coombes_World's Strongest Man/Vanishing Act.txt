Vanishing Act Lyrics
Too many heartbeats
No energy
Like a slow climb
Then you can't breath
Love is a reflex
Safe in your footsteps
But I can't get
The balance in check
Just another vanishing act

I'm gonna get my fucking head straight!
I'm gonna put on my happy face!

I lost the weekend
Walking the street
When it buried me
I followed the straight lines
To the war cry
Of the people outside
Love is a reflex
Safe in your footsteps
But I can't get
The balance in check
Just another vanishing act
I'm gonna get my fucking head straight!
I'm gonna put on my happy face!

Too many heartbeats
No energy
Like a slow climb
Then you can't breath
Love is a reflex
Safe in your footsteps
But I can't get
The balance in check
Just another vanishing act

I'm gonna get my fucking head straight!
I'm gonna put on my happy face!
I'm gonna get my fucking head straight!
I'm gonna put on my happy face!Embed
