In Waves Lyrics
I went for a strange dive
Walked to the beat all night
I couldn't buy a space ride
So I bought an old guitar
I don't fear strangers
There's just no space in my head
I can't feel my mind
I guess my body knows it

I've been seeing strange lights
What could it mean fr√§ulein
I couldn't bend space time
Maybe I should crawl in bed
But I don't hear voices
They've got no place in my head
Your touch fill my heart
It makes my body lose it

My blood's in waves
For your taste
For the whole night
My blood's in waves
For your taste
For the whole nightEmbed
