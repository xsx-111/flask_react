Walk the Walk Lyrics
Weird times
It's a fantasy
All you read in the magazines
Mother Nature in a top hat
(Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk)
But they don't realize
Sitting tight
In the compound
Sweatpants, sipping on a cocktail
(Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk)

He's got a finger on the button
Ready to delete

I'm through looking out at the darkness
But don't get hypnotised by the lies
It's all gonna crumble under you
Like when the wall came down
And there were no sides

But I'm in a time of separation
Paralysed by our own nation
Blurred lines, another war game
(Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk)
Hook, line and sinker
Back at the compound
All the lions start circling
The next man playing out his fantasy
(Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk)

I'm through looking out at the darkness
Don't get hypnotised by the lies
And I don't see them wonder
'Cause when it comes around
It's gonna be too late, too late
We're stuck looking out at the darkness
But don't get hypnotised by the lies
It's all gonna crumble under you
Like when the wall came down
And there were no sides
(Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk
Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk
Baby, you're the one, you can walk the walk)
