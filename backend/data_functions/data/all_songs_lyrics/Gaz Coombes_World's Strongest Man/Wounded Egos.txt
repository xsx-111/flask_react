Wounded Egos Lyrics
Wounded egos, right wing psychos
All the madness outside
Too much Lambsbread, out in Tenderloin
By the ocean I found...

I know how it ends
Chairs flying in the street
But we can do this another way
Look for something new
I know what it is
Yeah feels like I'm the one she's got
But she don't need no serious type man in the corner
But there's a feeling I'm fighting
And it's killing inside

Wounded egos, right wing psychos
All the madness outside
Too much Lambsbread, out in Tenderloin
By the ocean I found the Sun

I couldn't feel anything
Now I'm wanting for it all to end
But I'm waiting like an idiot
Yeah I'm waiting right here for you
Wounded egos, right wing psychos
All the madness outside
Too much Lambsbread, out in Tenderloin
By the ocean I found the sun
When it feels like it's all lost
It's just the madness outside
Too much Lambsbread, out in Hollywood
By the ocean I found the sunEmbed
