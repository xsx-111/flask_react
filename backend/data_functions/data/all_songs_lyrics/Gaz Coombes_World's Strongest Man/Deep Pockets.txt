Deep Pockets Lyrics
I'm out late, there's a half naked crowd of people
Let them in with their blank cheques & deep pockets
Hard living, the paint peeling, all the dark days (deep pockets)
Little rays of light moving, I couldn't let go

In the bar her name is Jonny, the boys love her ()
Time waits, it's the light revealing all the dark ways (deep figure)
Bad feeling, it's you I need, I'm tired of the phone calls
Do I give myself to the outside? ()

It's no fun
When I spend my time in cars
Like the stars
But it's okay ()
I'm okay ()
In a smaller orbit
Let's run like horses

A lot of ways I could start making little changes ()
But I'm too stoned in the back seat again, I couldn't stop it (couldn't stop it)
Then the panic soon surrounds me like deep water
So I give myself to the outside ()
It's no fun
When I spend my time in cars
Like the stars
But it's okay ()
Yeah, I'm okay ()
In a smaller orbit
Let's run like horses

There's a black star
Right in my line of vision
Oh, I miss her
But nobody ()
Nobody ()
Gets forgotten
Run like horses
