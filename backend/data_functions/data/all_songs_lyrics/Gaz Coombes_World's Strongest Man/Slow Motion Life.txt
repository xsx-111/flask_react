Slow Motion Life Lyrics
From the greatest heights
Slow motion life
You know I'd pay to leave these tears behind
But it's fine
I know we're all the same
Slow motion pain
Now it's all blood in the open
But we're not scared
Oh no
We're not scared

I took my hands off the wheel
I couldn't find the way back
You know I'd pay to leave this road behind
And get my heels on
Oh, that's all
That's all, that's all

We're all the locusts fly
Oh I don't want to see them
From their watchtowers
From their watchtowers
Slow motion life
Slow motion life
From the greatest heights
Slow motion lifeEmbed
