Oxygen Mask Lyrics
What lies out in front of you
I know you'll work it out
But if the panic takes hold
Secure your oxygen mask before others
It's alright, you're on course

We're primed like a slingshot
Aiming for the hearts
Of my young bright stars, in the cold
So place your oxygen masks on
If you want to find something more
What are you waiting for
If you wind up on the outside
Secure your oxygen mask before others

They got driverless cars in Florida
And drones to your door
Well it's like science fiction
And it's all right here
Place your oxygen mask on
They're talking about other life
40 light years out
To the young bright stars in the cold
It's just our bad dream
You're the young bright stars in the cold
We're the outsiders in the storm
Place your oxygen mask on
It's like science fiction
With love, from AquariusEmbed
