Weird Dreams Lyrics
Hang on to the dark
Don't wake me yet
I think I'm still in a dream
I couldn't think straight
How many days and nights in the same heat?
I know it's there
I know it's light
But I'm tired, it's gonna be a while
Touching skin, closer in
Love is all, let's go do it again
But it's all over with the new sun
It started thirteen hours ago
But it feels good this close to you
This time it's gonna burn me out

Then it's all gone
It's all gone

The North Atlantic wind
Shakes my walls
There's a world beyond the sheets
Where no one goes
I can read her thoughts
I know the rain is gonna stop
But I'm hounded by the horsemen
And dreams of metal dogs
It's all gone

Hang on to the dark
Don't wake me yet
I think I'm still in a dream
I couldn't think straight
How many days and nights in the same heat?
I know it's light
But I'm tired, it's gonna be a while
Touching skin, closer in
Love is all, let's go do it againEmbed
