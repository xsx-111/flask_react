Glass Jar LyricsI can hear everything
It's everything time
Yes
Nights
You
Nights
Dream
All time
It's everything time
It's a colourful time
Thanks for a day
It's a colourful story
Put your favourite night
Put your favourite night
Put your favourite night
Don't worry
It's been a dream time
It's been a dream time, don't worry
It's been a favourite love, ah yeah
Is that you in the glass jar
Or are you sitting on the grass
Is that you in the 
Where I place my hands, ah
See, I cared for you
I cared for you
I cared for you like a brother
I was there for you
I  for you
 for you like a mother

You sleep where I dream
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you, I surrender
You see, I cared for you
I was there for you
I cared for you like a brother
Is that you in the glass jar
Or are you sitting in the grass
Is that you in the 
Where I place my hands, ah
Where were you?
Where were you?
Where were you, I surrender
You see, I cared for you
I was there for you
I cared for you like a brother2Embed
