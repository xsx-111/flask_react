Romance Layers Lyrics(Lizzi Bougatsos)
It's gonna be alright
Turn  the lights
Oh (come on, come on)
I love you
Turn on the lights
(Alexis Taylor)
It's so hard to find the way
We worked so hard for fantasy
So hard for fantasy
Didn't have to be that way (x2)
We worked so hard to find the way
(You know you want to)
Worked so hard for fantasy (oh)
(You know you want to, you know you ---)
Hey oh yea (ooh)
Didn't need to be that way
Over and over again we start
To pick up the pieces that time clipped off
I'm just sitting here watching time change fast
Worked so hard for fantasy
Over and over you see
Over and over you see
Over and over you see6Embed
