MindKilla LyricsIt's ok to lay your head down sometimes I say (2)
Oh na na babeeeee
Only the strongest travel so deep
If you fear the mind killa you will weep
You have to make the equation work
If you come ova here come on here let's work
Don't fear the mind killa
Don't be the mind killa I would say
Killa
Don't be the mind killa I would say
Aye aye aye
We we love you
Hush lil baby don't say a word
Mamma's gonna buy you a mockingbird
And if that mockingbird don't sing
Then I'm gonna buy you a diamond ring
And if that diamond ring don't shine
Then I'm gonna move you from behind so...
Go get that ring
Go get that
Oh oh oh oh oh oh wat
It's ok...
Ah AhEmbed
