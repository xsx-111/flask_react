Sacer LyricsPeople trying to claim you
In the movies, they got characters that play you
Like a holy ghost that noone knew
You so huge you swallowed a few
Couldn't you have stayed
You have stayed just a little longer
Each night I pray... Please ignite me stronger
Oh can I hold
Each night I pray... Please ignite me stronger
A oh
Each ignite I pray
Please ignite me stronger
Beggin sounds
CHORUS:
They paint you on walls and touch your skin
Steal your style, try to package your being
You're like a blanket to protect our truths
Couldn't you have stayed
You have stayed just a little longer
Each night I pray... Please ignite me stronger
Each and everyday
Ohh a ohh. Calling sounds
They paint you on walls and touch your skin
Steal your style, try to package your being
You're like a blanket to protect our truths
Couldn't you have stayed just a little longer...
Each night I pray
Ohh oh cries...
I'm so high
Can't seem to find my way
Through the maze are you in the sky?
I'm so high
Can't seem to to find my way
Through the trees, are you in the sky?
I'm so high
Can't seem to find my way
Through the maze...
Cries, pleads
I'm not ready to go under
Need to stay above the water
I'm not read to go under
Can you ahhh ah lead us unto...
See your smile
To where your body moves...
Water sounds...
I'm so high I can't seem to
Find my way... are you in the sky...
I'm so highEmbed
