Thru and Thru LyricsNo my eyes ain't silver
No, no my eyes ain't blue
When your well it ain't got no water
I don't hate you I pity you
On a saigon night in God's sky
There's a butterfly on your wrist
The flies are stuck to your neck!
You see the... Search planes are out for you!
Better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go
I said you better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go
Watch me go
Watch me go
Here I go...
A newborn is coming!
Watch me go...
When I'm at war with the world I turn to you
When I am searching thru the downpour, you melt me
Thru and thru
When I'm at war with the world I turn to you
When I am searching thru the downpour, you melt me
Thru and thru, thru and thru, thru and thru...
Better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go
I said you better call the neurosurgeon
Our dreaming space it is open
Into the hospital I go...
Watch me go
Watch me go
Here I go...
A newborn is coming!
Watch me go...Embed
