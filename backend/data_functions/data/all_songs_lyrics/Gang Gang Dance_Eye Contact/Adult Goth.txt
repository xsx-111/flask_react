Adult Goth LyricsOh, it's a message in crumbles, oh, it's surrender, oh, it numbers our fear
Oh, it's a message in crumbles, oh, it's surrender, oh, it numbers our fear
Are we too croon to swallow hurt or choose, please say no
Are we to croon to swallow hurt or choose?
Oohh-oooh-aaa-uh, can you stay, ooh, it's lucky I know
Auh, see the deity in me, auh, you serve by a plate
At the same time chase your heartburns away
You like gold and tumbleweeds
You like gold with (?) your (?)
Without you I'm undone, without you they have me, without you
Oh, it's a message in crumbles, oh, it's surrender, oh, it numbers our fear
Oh, it's a message in crumbles, oh, it's surrender, oh, it numbers our fear
Are we too croon to swallow hurt or choose, please say no
Are we to croon to swallow hurt or choose?
Oohh-oooh-aaa-uh, can you stay, ooh, it's lucky I know
Anytime you walk away, hell it's the price I pay
Only to love you all the way
Anytime you walk away, it was the price we paid
Anytime you walk away
Only can you stay, it's lucky I knowEmbed
