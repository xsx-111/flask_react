God Bless You Kid LyricsI drive all over town
To the bars without a name
And it feels like Memphis after Elvis
There's nothing going on
When you get to the top
Does it all work out
You wanna start again
With hope in your heart
God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did
Yeah
The boys all dressed in blue
And the girls get dressed in white
The fire engines, the TV stations
Still tumble through the night
Go to bed, go to sleep
With our ordinary lives, yeah
It's the same old same old scene
God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did, yeah
God bless you kid
And everything you did
I never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
I never grew up, I never grew down
I never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
I never grew up, I never grew down
God bless you kid
God bless me too
It feels like Memphis after Elvis
The kiss, the promise
Kiss
I never grew up, I never grew down, yeah
God bless you kid
God bless you kid (to end)Embed
