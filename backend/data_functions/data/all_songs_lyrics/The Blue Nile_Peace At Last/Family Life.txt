Family Life LyricsStarlight do you know me
Please, don't look at me now
I'm falling apart
Silver on the window
Like the bike I once had
At home in the yard
Jesus love let me down and I know where you are
It might lead somewhere
Gather me in snowfall
And the cars going by the north and the south
Flowers on the table
And the coffee gets cold
Like the milk in my mouth
Sailing on no honeymoon
Just separate chairs in separate rooms
Jesus, please
Make us happy sometimes
No more shout
No more fight
Family life
Tomorrow will be Christmas
We'll be singing old songs
And light up the tree
God and all the mercy
And say all your prayers
For little old me
Jesus, you
Wipe the tears from her face
And the sound of his voice
Family life
Yeah, yeah
Mystery
Jesus, I go to sleep and I pray
For my kids
For my wife
Family life
YeahEmbed
