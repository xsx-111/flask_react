Happiness LyricsNow that I found peace at last
Tell me, Jesus, will it last?
Now that I found peace at last
Tell me, Jesus, will it last?
The birds are laughing in the trees
It's only make believe
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
I Swear
I wanna hold you, and treat you right
The cigarettes, and the morning light
I can do wrong, but I will do right
I see you later
It'll be alright, yeah
Now that I found peace of mind
Tell me, Jesus, is it mine?
Now that I found peace of mind
Tell me, Jesus, is it mine?
Birds are laughing in the trees
And in the empty breeze
It's only love
It's only love
It's only love
I Swear
I wanna hold you, and treat you right
The cigarettes, morning light
I can do wrong, I can do right
I see you later
Be alright, yeah
Happiness, happiness
Happiness, happiness
I wanted more, but live with less
Live again
Happiness
Now that I found peace at last
Tell me, Jesus, will it last?
Now that I found peace at last
Tell me, Jesus, will it last?
