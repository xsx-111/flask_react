Tomorrow Morning LyricsThis may not last until tomorrow
So look at all the love you borrow
And time will tell us all
We could be laughing
We could be married
Tomorrow morning
And love alone won't be your saviour
And pretty soon you'll find it's over
And time has left you there
We could be singing
Could be together
Tomorrow morning
Show me only sunrise
Say you'll love me and then
Say you'll love me, oooh
Sugar rain
Tomorrow morning
And love alone won't be your saviour
And pretty soon you'll find it's over
And time has left you there
If it's not easy
It must be summer
If it's not love
Then I don't know
Tomorrow morning
Come on, girl
Hey, hey
Blue skies, water, desert, yeah
Ooh, tomorrow morningEmbed
