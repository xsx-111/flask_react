War Is Love LyricsOn through the light
I'm crying for her
Come on get it right, yeah
And answer my prayers
War is love, when love, when love breaks down
War is love, when love, when love weighs down
All the years alone
Did I confess, no
It's only your say so
I've got a long way to go, saying
War is love, when love, when love weighs down
War is love, when love, when love weighs down, yeah
Listen baby, ah
War is love, war is love is love, saying
When love weighs down
Let me help you out
War is love, you know
When love weighs downEmbed
