Slave Lyrics
Love, barely alive in your arms
Slave
Dreams, taken too far every night
Slave

Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

'Cause I can't change, no

When you're on your own, you can see
Things
Clear, clear as a bell and you're free
Slave

Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

'Cause I can't change, no
And my girl, we'll say goodbye
To the things we'll never try


Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?
Who put on your heart?

'Cause I can't change, no

Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
Love, barely alive
