Burndt Jamb Lyrics
Gothic flavor
How I miss you
If I only
Once could kiss you

I'd be happy
For one moment
Of my lifetime
I'd be there

And the water
Running over
Me is growing
Ever colder

Make me happy
For one moment
Of my lifetime
I'd be there

Make me happy
For one moment
Of my lifetime
I'd be there


Oooh
Oooh
