Take Control Lyrics
Leave me now
Show me how
And I won't be ashamed of the things we once made
And I won't be comin' back 'round here no more, no

Leave and try
Tell me why

And I won't let you down
Drag your name all over town
And I won't be comin' back 'round here no more

Yo, everyone, everyone
Everyone I know (everyone I know)
Take control


And I won't let you down, drag your name all over town
And I won't be comin' back 'round here no more
Yo, everyone, everyone
Everyone I know (everyone I know)
Take control
Whoa hoooo
Whoa hoooo
Whoa hooooEmbed
