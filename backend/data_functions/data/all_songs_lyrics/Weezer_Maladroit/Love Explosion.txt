Love Explosion Lyrics
Take a listen around you
All the people that crowd around in your house
They've been wanting to kill you in your sleep

Take a load off and bow down
To the others, they love to call you their names
They've been wanting to kill you in your sleep

And all the bull that people sling
(Love is an ocean)
It doesn't matter what they sing
(Love explosion)

So jump out, jump out and get your groove on
This one is for you, so come on
Get out your house, girl
And give me a kiss


And all the bull that people sling
(Love is an ocean)
It doesn't matter what they sing
(Love explosion)
So jump out, jump out, get your groove on
This one is for you, so come on
Get out your house, girl
And give me a kiss

Take a load off and bow down
To the others, they love to call you their names
They love to call you their names
They love to call you their names1Embed
