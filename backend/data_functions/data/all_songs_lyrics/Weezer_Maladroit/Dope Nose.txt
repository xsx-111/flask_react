Dope Nose Lyrics
Hohhh, aah-ah ohhh
Aah-ah ohhh, ohh ohh ohh

Debt on my head
Wasting time, on my own (Oh yeah)
Sleep, rescue me
Take me back to my home (Lord, take me home)

For the times that you wanna go
And bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face
And enjoy the show

Hohhh, aah-ah ohhh
Aah-ah ohhh, ohh ohh ohh

Cheese smells so good
On a burnt piece of lamb (Piece of what?)
Fag of the year
Who could beat up your man
For the times that you wanna go
And bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face
And enjoy the show

Ohhhhhh, this dope nose, aah-ah ohhh
Aah-ah ohhh, ohh ohh ohh

(Give it back)
(Hang on, baby)

For the times that you wanna go
And bust rhymes real slow
I'll appear, slap you on the face
And enjoy the show

Ohhhhhh, this dope nose, aah-ah ohhh
Aah-ah ohhh, ohh ohh ohh3Embed
