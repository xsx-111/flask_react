Fall Together Lyrics
We go together, baby
And if you do, yeah
I'll be your weakness, baby
And get to you

Streamline
Mainline
Fall together
Get up

Anytime you want me, baby
I'll be around, yeah
And that's what they'll teach you, baby
To dig my sound

Streamline
Mainline
Fall together
Get up

Get up
Get up, yeah

Streamline
Mainline
Fall together
Get up

Get up
Get up
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
