Living Without You LyricsI wanna go
To see your house
To see how you're living
(Living without you)
And if you care
I'm wanting you
From such a distance
(Living without you)
And if you want to try
To speak to me again
I'll be your best of friends
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh
And I want you
Ohhh, ohhh, oohh
The things you wrote
To cut me off
When I was trying
(Living without you)
To get with you
To be your friend
Made me feel so bad
(Living without you)
And if you want to try
To speak to me again
I'll be your best of friends
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh
And I want you
Ohhh, ohhh, oohh
Yeah, sweet girl
I need you
Yeah, I think it could be so good
(Instrumental interlude)
(Living without you)
(Living without you)
And if you want to try
To speak to me again
I'll be your best of friends
Whoa, ohhh, ohhh
And I want you
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Yeah, sweet girl
I need you
Yeah, I think it could be so goodEmbed
