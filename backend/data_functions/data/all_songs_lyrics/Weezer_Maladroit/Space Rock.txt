Space Rock Lyrics
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

You wanna cry
When you're dealing with the kids

Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo

They know it all
And they're pinning you to the boards

It's a game
And you'll play
But you can't have fun
When all they do is say
Lies


They know it all
And they're pinning you to the boards
It's a game
And you'll play
But you can't have fun
When all they do is say
Lies
LiesEmbed
