Slob Lyrics
Leave me alone
I won't pick up the phone
And I won't listen to messages
Sent by someone who calls up and says

"I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream
Don't you be a slob!"

Leave me again
Don't hang out in my den
Waiting for little clues to appear
That I drank some of Granddaddy's beer

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream
Don't you be a slob
Slob
Slob

Waiting for little clues to appear
That I drank some of Granddaddy's beer

I don't like how you're living my life
Get yourself a wife
Get yourself a job
You're living a dream
Don't you be a slob
Slob
