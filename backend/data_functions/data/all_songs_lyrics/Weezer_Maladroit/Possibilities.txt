Possibilities Lyrics
Give it all away
Give it all away

Oh, oh
Possibilities (possibilities)
Take you home with me in your arms

I never thought
I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, oh
Take me by the hand (take me by the hand)
Let me be the man in your arms

I never thought
I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay
Oh, you're gone (give it all away)
Oh, you're gone (give it all away)
You're gone (give it all away)
You're gone to stay


I never thought
I'd do that
Take me all the way
And let your body stay

Oh, you're gone (Give it all away)
Oh, you're gone (Give it all away)
You're gone (Give it all away)
You're gone to stay

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
I need you
I'll bleed you nowEmbed
