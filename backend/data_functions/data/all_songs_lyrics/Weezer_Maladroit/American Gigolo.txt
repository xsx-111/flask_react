American Gigolo Lyrics
Sit down, quiet everybody
Got a long way to go
I told you once before
That you better not start the show

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah

If you want me
You can't have me
Because you've got to
Understand me

Back off, baby I'm a loner
Got a lotta things to see
I told you once before
That you better not take it from me

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keep on, keep on, yeah
If you hate this
No, I can't blame you
Because I'm hurtin'
So I'll flame you
I've seen this game before
My love walks right to your door
There ain't no hope for me anymore
Ah ha ha ha
Yeah


If you hate this
No, I can't blame you
Because I'm hurtin'
So I'll flame you
I've seen this game before
My love walks right to your door
There ain't no hope for me anymore
Ah ha ha ha
Yeah
Yeah
YeahEmbed
