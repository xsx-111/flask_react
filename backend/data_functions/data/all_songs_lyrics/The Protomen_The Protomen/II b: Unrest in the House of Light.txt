II b: Unrest in the House of Light Lyrics
You have heard me tell this story
Many times before you sleep
This time, listen carefully
And I will tell you once again
But this time understand that what I'm telling you
Every single word is true

You need to know

There was another who came before you
He was a hero, and your brother and my son
He fought the darkness, the darkness won
And he fought bravely, and he died briefly
But he was forsaken by the ones he wished to save
And when he died he died in vain

You need to know
You are not him

A time is coming, and I must warn you
Though it's something that you may not understand
They can't be saved by just one man
And I am sorry, because I was wrong
And I'd take away the weight his shoulders had to bear
Because when he fell I was the only one that cared
You need to know
You are not him
His fight's not yours

Megaman broke away from his father's hold, ran to the window and looked out over the city. His eyes filled with tears. His heart hurt under the weight of what he'd just been told. How could his father do nothing? How could Dr. Light not avenge the death of Protoman?

That story's finished. That story's ended
Understand there's nothing more that we can do
And I will not risk losing you
For if you leave now, you will be fighting
For a people that refuse to comprehend
They have chosen their own end
So you will stay here. You will obey me
And I will keep grieving for the son I sent to death
You are all that I have left

You need to know
You are not him
This fight's not yours

Megaman tore past Dr. Light. He threw the doors open at the end of the hallway and disappeared into the stairway. Light called after him:
You cannot win!Embed
