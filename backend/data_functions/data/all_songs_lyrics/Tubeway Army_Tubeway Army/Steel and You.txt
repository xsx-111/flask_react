Steel and You LyricsIt's so quiet and dark
And I shouldn't be here
This machine won't last
For always
Just my steel friend and me
I stand brave by his side
This machine is all
I live for
I can see in your eyes
You're not so sure about me
This machine is my voice
Please listen
It's so noisy and bright
And I just love being here
This machine will last
For my lifeEmbed
