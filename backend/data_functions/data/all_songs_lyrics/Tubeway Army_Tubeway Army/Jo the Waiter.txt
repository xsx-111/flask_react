Jo the Waiter LyricsJo the waiter worked for me
Serving wine in basement bars
Only mad men ever stay. "Got no time."
If you're mindless please take mine
Jo the waiter held me close
Behind the door marked "gentlemen"
Just for now that's all I need
Won't someone call me friend?
Long gone. I recall good times
I must confess I cried
We burned out and the line went dead
At six o'clock I felt so alone
I crawled inside. "Where else to go?"
Could be dead for all you know
Every day I died for you
Valium boys with painted eyes
Young man need love special
I don't think I want it at all
Long gone. I recall good times
I must confess I cried
Me I've retired to a back street flat
Picture "eyes in a cold steel frame"
The freaks arrive
Broken needles and blood
"What you on man to get those eyes?"
It's very touching I'm so close to me
False smiles I've rehearsed for days
Come inside you won't know I'm wrong
Give me your heart I'm so quickly goneEmbed
