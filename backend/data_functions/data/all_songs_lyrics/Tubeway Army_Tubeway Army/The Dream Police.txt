The Dream Police LyricsThe dream police
Slogan: "What is on your mind?"
The airwave boys
Junies won't get radio time
The purist league
White trenchcoats in pre-war style
The ageing queens
Mister won't you stay a while?
In death row with Harlow
And others like you
I point my finger of
Hate at your picture and love you
And love you
The radio is talking
Is it you or me?
I must admit
It's far too late to dial police
What is your name?
We are the end of the line
Her eyes went out
Dreaming "overdose on time"
Hey you old grey eyes
Don't practise dying for real
The only one
September she knows I can feelEmbed
