Listen to the Sirens Lyrics"flow my tears" the new police song
The slogan of peace is "you must live"
They've got me and i'm one of them
Cancel: "silence" they screamed for days
"we've been here before we won't stay"
They can die they can just turn off
Some vehicle moves in circles
Some people need the heroes
But i don't mind
I don't mind
Please listen to the sirens
We don't wish to be your friends
Please listen to the sirens
We won't ever call again
Mister Webb there is no way out
Love this room please don't fight your walls
Can you see i'm wasting your time
A streetcar's rusting unseen
Music hall's empty like me
But i don't care
I don't care
Please listen to the sirens
We don't wish to be your friends
Please listen to the sirens
We won't ever call again
If i could stay here for now
With someone just a bit like you
"oh, no"
Maybe i would dream again
Of someone just a bit like you
"s'pose so"
Station boys keep their hands on steel
Tubeway days now seem quite unreal
It's always so close but never quite arrives
My vision's like an old film shaky
There's nothing through my window okay
No photo by my bedside black/white
No image in my mirror bye byeEmbed
