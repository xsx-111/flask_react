Everyday I Die LyricsProblems of need I need you
Obscene dreams in rusty beds
No one came here tonight
I pulled on me I need to
I unstick pages and read
I look at pictures of you
I smell the lust in my hands
Everyday I die
Her favorite trick was to suck me inside
Oh so very art nouveau
Completely false feelings of love I don't
No one knows but that died years ago
I unstick pages and read
I look at pictures of you
I smell the lust in my hands
Everyday I die
Die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die die dieEmbed
