Everywhere I Go Lyrics
I'll take you with me everywhere I go
I'll put you in my pocket who will know?
Right next to my heart at every show
I'll take you with me everywhere I go


No matter where our trails will finally wind
Our paths will just keep crossing yours and mine
Until then and in my pocket you must go
I'll take you with me everywhere I go


No matter where our trails will finally wind
Our paths will just keep crossing yours and mine
Until then and in my pocket you must go
And I'll take you with me everywhere I go

Until then and in my pocket you must go
And I'll take you with me everywhere i go1Embed
