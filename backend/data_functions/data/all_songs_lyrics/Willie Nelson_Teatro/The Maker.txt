The Maker Lyrics

Oh, oh deep water, black and cold like the night
I stand with arms wide open, I've run a twisted mile
I'm a stranger in the eyes of the maker

I could not see for fog in my eyes
I could not feel for the fear in my life
And across the great divide in the distance I saw a light
Saw Jean Baptiste walking to me with the maker

My body is bent and broken by long and dangerous leaps
I can't work the fields of Abraham and turn my head away
I'm not a stranger in the hands of the maker

Brother John have you seen the homeless daughters
Standing there with broken wings
I have seen the flaming swords there over east of Eden
Burning in the eyes of the maker

Burning in the eyes of the maker
Burning in the eyes of the maker
Oh river (Oh river) rise from your sleepEmbed
