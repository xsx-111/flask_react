Without You Lyrics
Well, I can't forget this evenin'
And your face when you were leavin'
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

Well, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
I had you there, then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know

I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

Well, I can't forget this evenin'
And your face when you were leavin'
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows

I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

I can't live if livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore
I can't live (Oh no) livin' is without you
I can't live, I can't give anymore

I can't live (Oh, no, oh)1Embed
