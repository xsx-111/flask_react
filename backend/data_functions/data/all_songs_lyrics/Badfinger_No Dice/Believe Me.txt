Believe Me LyricsBelieve me, if I wanted
Spend the rest of my time with a mean, mean, woman like you
Would I, if I needed? But I don't
Will I, if you want me
Give you all the love in the world that a man could
Still I, if I needed, I could
Then I could cry your name and you would come
There'd be no need for need anymore, anymore
Believe me, if I wanted
Spend the rest of my time with a mean, mean, woman like you
Would I, if I needed? But I don't
Then I could cry your name and you would come
There'd be no need for need anymore, anymore
Will I, if you want me
Give you all the love in the world that a man could
Still I-I-I, if I needed, I couldEmbed
