Midnight Caller LyricsBeneath the midnight caller
She thinks of paper green
You never hear them callin' her name
They just know where they've been
You never hear her holler
The tears no longer come
She reads a daily book of the past
That shows of everyone
Grey years that show in her hair
Can't be but don't seem to care
She locks the door
And there's no one there
She sees a daytime stroller
Walk from the night before
And though she paints a smile on her face
He won't be back no more
She's got no saint to follow
She's got no place to go
Too proud to ask an old friend for help
Too proud to let him know
Grey years that show in her hair
Can't be but don't seem to care
She locks the door
And there's no one there
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody (Nobody)
Nobody's gonna help you nowEmbed
