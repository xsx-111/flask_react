Better Days LyricsI'm just a good boy, workin' hard to get my pay
A little time, a little trouble, yeah, better day
I, I see no reason as for why it cannot be
A little time, a little trouble, a better day
You bury your head in the things you said, that's fine
But the days go by and you know it's gettin' dark at nine
You give all you want, but you take away what's mine
We can make it better, baby, so much better all the time
Just a good boy lookin' hard to see my way
A little time, a little trouble, a better day
I, I see no reason as for why it cannot be
A little time, a little trouble, yeah, better day
Well, you bury your head in the things you said, that's fine
But the days go by and you know it's gettin' dark at nine
You give all you want, but you take away what's mine
We can make it better, baby, so much better all the time
Just a good boy lookin' hard to see my way
A little time, a little trouble, yeah, better days
