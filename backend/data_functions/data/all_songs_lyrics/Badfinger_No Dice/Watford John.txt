Watford John LyricsYou show me all your loving
Then you turn and tell me "No"
Open up your arms and let it go
You give me all your kissing
Then you freeze and stop the flow
Open up your knees and let it go
I don't want a Cinderella
I just want my teddy bear
I don't want a backstage Bella
I just want to take you there
Baby, won't you think it over?
Try and see my point of view
Let it go
You show me all your loving
Then you turn and tell me "No"
Open up your arms and let it go
Let it go, let it go
I don't want a Cinderella
I just want my teddy bear
I don't want a backstage Bella
I just want to take you there
Baby, won't you think it over?
Try and see my point of view
Come on, baby, won't you tell me 'No"
Bop-bop-a-lop, a-too-bop
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, ooh-hoo
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go, ooh-hoo
Let it go
Let it go, ooh-hoo
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
Let it goEmbed
