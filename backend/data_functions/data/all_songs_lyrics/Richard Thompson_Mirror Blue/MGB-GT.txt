MGB-GT Lyrics
Oh I've got a little car and she might go far
She's the mistress of my heart now
She's a '65 with an overdrive
And I cured her in every part now
Two in the front and two in the back
A hundred and ten on the old Hog's Back

My MGB-GT she's a runner now
MGB-GT
Oh my MGB-GT she's a runner now

Oh I welded the sills and the old floor pan
Cut the rust with the torch and the hacksaw
Took the Rostyles off, put the spoke wheels on
Got a brand new Salisbury axle
When I come to town the girls all smile
They say, here's a man with the retro-style

My MGB-GT she's a runner now
MGB-GT
Oh my MGB-GT she's a runner now
Lockheed discs and twin SUs
Original chrome on the grill now
Looks like a dream in racing green
Competition's standing still now
I sprayed up her body, I strengthened her frame
I stripped her right down and built her up again

Now an Alpine's fine if you've got the time
And a Healey'll set you back some
And a TR4 costs a little bit more
But it don't have the same attraction
Hard top handy in case of the weather
I don't care if it rains forever

In my MGB-GT she's a runner now
MGB-GT
In my MGB-GT she's a runner now
MGB-GT
In my MGB-GT she's a runner nowEmbed
