Easy There, Steady Now Lyrics
Jackknife with a precious load
Spills its guts all over the road
Excuse me, I had to smile
Lost my grip too for a while—
Said easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now

She didn't have the decency
To sweep away what's left of me
I don't have the presence of mind
To walk along in a straight line
Easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now

I call your name
I call it loud
I see your face
In every crowd

Nosebleed down the bathroom wall
Leaves a pool down in the stall
I wonder where you are tonight
Red dress, skin so white
Easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now
3 AM an empty town
Doctor Martens echo down
Old man heartbreak follows you
Corruption's shadow swallows you
Said easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now

I call your name
I call it loud
I see your face
In every crowd

Jackknife with a precious load
Spills its guts all over the road
Excuse me, I had to smile
Lost my grip too for awhile—
Easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady now
Easy there, steady nowEmbed
