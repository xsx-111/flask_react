Louise McGee LyricsYou see a little girl they call
Louise McGhee
Please do me a favor and shake
Her little hand for me
I said if you see a little girl
Her name, Louise McGhee
You know, please do me a favor, shake her little hand for me
I know a little girl
Like a cow like to chew cud
Her little low down ways I wish you
Had quit as she would
You know I love that little thing
Just like a cow like to chew her cud
Little always, I sure wish you'd quit if she would
Mmm, Lookie here
If I don't go crazy
Lookie here
If I don't go crazy
Yeah lookie here
I'm gonna lose my mind
You know cause I stayed bothered, worried all the time
You know it's a shame
A dirty shame
I so sorry the day I ever
Know Louise's name
Yeah it's a shame
I said it's a low down dirty shame
You know I'm so sorry the day
That I ever known Louise's name
I say, now come here little girl
Throwing up your dog gone hand
Cause I been your dog ever since that I knowed your name
Don't come here little girl
I say, throwing on up your dog gone hand
You know I been your dog honey, ever since that I knowed your name
You know when I leave honey
I don't want you to cry no more
I say, when I leave
I don't want you to cry no more
I say, but when I leave this time honey
I'm gonna hang crepe on your door
I gets up in the morning with the blues
3 different ways
I have two mind to leave here
I didn't have but one say stay
I say I gets up in the morning
I say with the blues 3 different ways
Yeah I have two mind to leave here
I didn't have but one say stay
Honey if I don't ever no more see you
You forever be on my mind
If I don't never no more see you
I say, you forever be on my mind
You know every time I think about you girl
I just can't keep from cryingEmbed
