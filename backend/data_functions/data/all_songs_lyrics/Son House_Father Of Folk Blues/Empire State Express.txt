Empire State Express LyricsI went down to the station
I leaned against the door
I went down to the station
I leaned against the door
You know I know the Empire State
Any time I hear her blow
Then I ask the depot agent
Let me ride, let me ride the blind
Oh depot agent
Please let me ride the blinds
He said I wouldn't mind it son
But this empire state ain't mine
You know he said I have an Empire State
She rides on eastern
She rides on eastern
Eastern time
She runs on ester time
She is the rollingest baby that runs on New York central line
Engineers
I said wasn't me an old farmer
And I trust all engineers
You know they took my women away
Yes the engineers blow the whistle
The farmer only rung the bell
You know my women is on board
And she is waving back farewell
Im going to tell you all
You on the train
You on the train
The train will do
And Im gonna tell you all what I know the train will do
It will take your women away
And chop back smoke as youEmbed
