Sundown Lyrics
You know, late one evening, I went out on the outskirts of town
Oh, late one evening, I went out on the outskirts of town
You know, I choose me a seat and watch the evening sun go down

So, little girl, don't you know you done broke my heart
Oh, little girl, yeah, you done broke my heart
You know, it's so sad to say, that the best friends they have to part

You know, I gets up soon in the morning, I be feeling so sick and bad
Oh, I wakes up soon in the morning, I be feeling so sick and bad
You know, I thinking about the good time, that I once have had

But, I say, little girl, your little trouble is coming home some day
Hmmm, Hoo, Your little trouble is coming home someday
I say you going to be sorry, that you treated poor old me this way

You know, look like people don't like you, when you're trying to be loving and kind
Ohhh, Hooo, When you trying to be loving and kind
Yeah, but someday they going like you and you be done changed your mind

You know, the blues is a worried old hard disease
Yeah, the blues, is a worried old hard disease
Look like if anyone you be loving is so confound hard to please
You know, the sun is going down, behind that old western hill
Oh, the sun a going down, behind that old western hill
You know, I did never fracture nothing, little girl, not against my baby's willEmbed
