John The Revelator LyricsTell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Well who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
You know God walked down in the cool of the day
Called Adam by his name
And he refused to answer
Because he's naked and ashamed
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
You know Christ had 12 apostles
And three he led away
Said "Watch with me one hour
Till I go yon and pray"
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
Christ came on the Easter morning
Mary 'n Martha were there to see
"Go tell my disciples
To meet me in Galilee"
Tell me who's writin', John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven seals
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator
Wrote the book of the seven sealsEmbed
