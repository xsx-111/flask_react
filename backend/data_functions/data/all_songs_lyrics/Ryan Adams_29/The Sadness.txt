The Sadness Lyrics
The stars they sink
In the oceans of ink
Long black ribbons of cars
And in the taxi
You ask me how I'm doing
But you already know
Beyond, beyond is not through
It's only a reflection of you
And somethings at the window
It motions with its fingers
Calling me beyond

The sadness is mine
The sadness is mine

It's why you're not helping me
Whatever has come for me
Oh, I can give you whatever you're wanting
Just take it and spare me, spare me
Please, oh tell me this is only a warning, no
Please have mercy let me go
If only a day to let her know
Without her I'm nothing at all
The change is happening and I'm almost gone
In her heart is my faith
And it wins against the sadness
The train it moves through the desert
The horses they will challenge its stride
And into the boxcar she leaps
And is my hero
And penetrates the demons inside
The clouds they pass
But they're moving so fast
I watch them collide
Collide and collapse in her arms like a newborn child
And I am at once reborn

The sadness is mine
The sadness is mine

It's why you're not helping me
Whatever has come for me
Oh, I can give you whatever you're wanting
Just take it and spare me, spare me
Please tell me this is only a warning, no
Please have mercy let me go
If only a day to let her know
Without her I was nothing at all
The change is happening and I'm almost gone
In her heart is my faith
And it wins against the sadness
The fog in the mote
As he grabs my throat
It lifts as she comes
She opens her cloak and it's the color of the blood
And is the sign of what now must come
Deny, deny me my destiny
I am not ready to go
I am the horror that brings us to the morning
Where I will have to stand and fight God!

The sadness is mine
The sadness is mine

It's why you're not helping me
Whatever has come for me
Oh, I can give you whatever you're wanting
Just take it and spare me spare me
Please, oh tell me this is only a warning, no
Please have mercy let me go
If only a day to let her know
Without her I was nothing at all
The change is happening and I'm almost gone
In her heart is my faith
And it wins against the sadnessEmbed
