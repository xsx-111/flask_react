Nightbirds Lyrics
Out under the stars
Dodging them night cars baby
'Cause when you gotta move, you gotta move
Whatever that it was
You were thinking of lady
You're certainly not thinking
Of that now

And night birds sing you
An empty tune
In an empty house
In an empty room
In an empty moment
All the night birds sing
We were supposed to rise above
But we sink
Into the ocean

I feel like a body stuffed into a trunk
From a million years
Of lying and getting drunk
The people here inside me
They are loud and in the night
They scream and smash the windows
When they fight
Night birds sing you
An empty tune
In an empty house
In an empty room
Empty feelings
When it comes too soon
We were supposed to rise above
We were supposed to rise above
But we sink
Into the ocean
Into the ocean
Into the ocean
Into the oceanEmbed
