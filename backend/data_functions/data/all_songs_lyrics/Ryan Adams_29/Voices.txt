Voices Lyrics
You come through the door like a bag of rocks
Wounded all the time
I'm inside the room with the t.v. on mute
Screamin' Elijah
Elijah don't you come
Oh God don't you come

I steal out the window like I'm using the door
Whispering willows outside
Turn into statues of you, fangs exposed
Breathing fire
Elijah don't you come
Oh God don't you come

Locate the coffin, procure the ring
I'll distract Gabriel
It's your destiny after all
Just go
And don't you ever look back
Kiss me again
And don't you listen to the voices in the past
They lied, oh they lied
They lied
When you see the light don't you dare go in
Find your way back to the house
And the wind upon gate
When the gate swings
Back and forth
That's the sign
That we are never coming back
Once the signal's been fired

When you're in the room I'm under the bed
I am inside your soul
I cover your mouth
And my hands are just as ice
Scream Elijah
Oh Elijah come down
Come and take your reward

Locate the coffin, procure the ring
I'll distract Gabriel
It's your destiny after all
Just go
And don't you never look back
Kiss me again
And don't you listen to the voices in the past
They lied, run away from the light, run away from the light
Little ones
Little ones
Run away from the light, if you can, if you canEmbed
