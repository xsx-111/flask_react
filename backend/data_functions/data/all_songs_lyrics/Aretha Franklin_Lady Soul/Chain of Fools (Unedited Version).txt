Chain of Fools (Unedited Version) Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, that's the sound
Of a worried, a worried man
Ha ha, ha ha ha ha ha
That's the sound of having a good time
Mhm, that's the sound of pain

Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

Lord, for five years
See a worried man
Chain of love
Oh, hardly passed
For five long years
I thought you were my man
But I found out
I'm just a link in your chain

Oh, chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools
You got me where you want me
I ain't nothin' but your fool
You treated me mean
Oh, you treated me cruel
Every chain
Has got a weak link
I might be weak, child
But I'll give you strength, oh yeah

Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (Chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools

You told me to leave you alone
My father said, "Come on home"
My doctor said, "Take it easy"
Oh, but your lovin' is much too strong
I'm added to your...

Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Your chain of fools, oh
One of these mornings
The chain is gonna break
But up until then, yeah
I'm gonna take all I can take, oh hey

Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain, chain, chain (chain, chain, chain)
Chain of fools, oh
Chain, chain, chain
Chain, chain, chain, oh
Chain, chain, chain
Your chain of fools, oh yeahEmbed
