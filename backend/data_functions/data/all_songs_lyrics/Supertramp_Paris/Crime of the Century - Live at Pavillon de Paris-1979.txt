Crime of the Century - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsNow they're planning the crime of the century
Well what will it be?
Read all about their schemes and adventuring
Yes it's well worth the fee
So roll up and see
How they rape the universe
How they've gone from bad to worse
Who are these men of lust, greed, and glory?
Rip off the masks and let's see
But that's not right â€“ oh no, what's the story?
There's you and there's me
That can't be right!Embed
