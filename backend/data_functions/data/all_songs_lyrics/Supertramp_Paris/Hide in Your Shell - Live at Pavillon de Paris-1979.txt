Hide in Your Shell - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsHide in your shell cause the world is out to bleed you for a ride
What will you gain making your life a little longer?
Heaven or Hell, was the journey cold that gave you eyes of steel?
Shelter behind painting your mind and playing joker
Too Frightening to listen to a stranger
Too Beautiful to put your pride in danger
You're waiting for someone to understand you
But you've got demons in your closet
And you're screaming out to stop it
Saying life's begun to cheat you
Friends are out to beat you
Grab on to what you can scramble for
Don't let the tears linger on inside now
Cos it's sure time you gained control
If I can help you, if I can help you
If I can help you, just let me know
Well, let me show you the nearest signpost
To get your heart back and on the road
If I can help you, if I can help you
If I can help you, just let me know
All through the night as you lie awake and hold yourself so tight
What do you need, a second-hand movie-star to tend you?
I as a boy, I believed the saying the cure for pain was love
How would it be if you could see the world through my eyes?
Too Frightening – the fire's becoming colder
Too Beautiful – to think you're getting older
You're looking for someone to give an answer
But what you see is just illusion
You're surrounded by confusion
Saying life's begun to cheat you
Friends are out to beat you
Grab on to what you can scramble for
Don't let the tears linger on inside now
Cos it's sure time you gained control
If I can help you, if I can help you
If I can help you, just let me know
Well, let me show you the nearest signpost
To get your heart back and on the road
If I can help you, if I can help you
If I can help you, just let me know
I wanna know…
I wanna know you…
Well let me know you
I wanna feel you
I wanna touch you
Please let me near you
Can you hear what I'm sayin'?
Well I'm hopin', I'm dreamin', I'm prayin'
I know what you're thinkin'
See what you're seein'
Never ever let yourself go
Hold yourself down, hold yourself down
Why d'ya hold yourself down?
Why don't you listen, you can
Trust me
There's a place I know the way to
A place there is no need to feel you
Feel that you're alone
Hear me
I know exactly what you're feelin'
Cos all your troubles are within you
Please begin to see that I'm just bleeding to
Love me, love you
Loving is the way to
Help me, help you
– Why must we be so cool, oh so cool?
Oh, we're such damn fools...Embed
