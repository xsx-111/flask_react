You Started Laughing - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsWhen you're in heaven
What you gonna do?
You're gonna sit around a cloud and say
"Hey what a lovely view"
Is there a reason
Why you're like you are?
Is there a reason you'll be leaving?
Is my love out of season?
I wouldn't mind but to me that is treason
You started laughing
When I held you in my arms
You started leaving
When I told you of my charms
I was in love with you
And then you said we're through
And then I said boo hoo
Was my tie not on straight?
Was it something I ate?Embed
