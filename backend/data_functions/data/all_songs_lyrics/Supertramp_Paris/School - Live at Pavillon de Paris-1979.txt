School - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsI can see you in the morning when you go to school
Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule
Teacher tells you stop your play and get on with your work
And be like Johnnie – too-good, well don't you know he never shirks
– he's coming along!
After School is over you're playing in the park
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them – won't let you work it out
– and you're full of doubt
Don't do this and don't do that
What are they trying to do?
– Make a good boy of you
Do they know where it's at?
Don't criticise, they're old and wise
Do as they tell you to
Don't want the devil to
Come and put out your eyes
Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you want to be that
Want to see that
Want to see it that way
– you're coming along!Embed
