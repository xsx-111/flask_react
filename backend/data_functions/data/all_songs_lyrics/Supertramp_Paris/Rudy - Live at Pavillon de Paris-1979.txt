Rudy - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsRudy's on a train to nowhere, halfway down the line
He don't wanna get there, but he needs time
He ain't sophisticated, nor well-educated
After all the hours he's wasted, still he needs time
He needs time – he needs time for livin'
He needs time – for someone just to see him
He ain't had no lovin'
For no reason nor rhyme
And the whole world's above him
Well it's not as though he's fat –
No there's more to it than that –
See he tries to play it cool –
Wouldn't be nobody's fool
Rudy thought that all good things comes to those that wait
But recently he could see that it may come too late
Too late, too late…
All through your life, all through the years
Nobody loved, nobody cared
So dim the light, dark are your fears
Try as I might, I can't hold back the tears
How can you live without love, it's not fair?
Someone said give but I just didn't dare, I didn't dare, I didn't dare
What good advice are you waiting to hear?
Hearing's alright for them that's all there, hearing's alright
You'd better, you'd better gain control now
You'd better show 'em all now
You'd better make or break now
You'd better give and take now
You'll have to push and shove now
You'll have to find some love now
You'd better gain control now
Now he's just come out the movie
Numb of all the pain
Sad but in a while he'll soon be
Back on his train…Embed
