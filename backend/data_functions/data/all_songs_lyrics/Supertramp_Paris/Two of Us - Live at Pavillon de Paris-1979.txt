Two of Us - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsLook at me, I'm a speck of sand
And I'm building dreams in a strangers land
Tell me why do I care
Tell me why do I care
Every time that I'm feeling down
Oh, they pick me up and they spin me 'round
Tell me where do we go
Tell me where do we go from here
When is man gonna find out
(Find out)
When are we gonna find out
(Find out)
What the universe is just waiting to hear
Just as long as there's two of us
Just as long as there's two of us
Just as long as there's two of us
We'll carry onEmbed
