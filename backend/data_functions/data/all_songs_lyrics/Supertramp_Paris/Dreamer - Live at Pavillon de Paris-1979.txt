Dreamer - Live at Pavillon de Paris/1979 LyricsDreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
I said, "Far out! What a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well, you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do
Dreamer, you stupid little dreamer
So now you put your head in your hands, oh no! Woo!
I said, "Far out! What a day, a year, a life it is!"
You know, well, you know you had it comin' to you
Now there's not a lot I can do
Work it out someday
(If I could see something)
You can see anything you want, boy
(If I could be someone)
You can be anyone, celebrate, boy
(Well, if I could do something)
Well, you can do something
(If I could do anything)
Well, can you do something out of this world?
Take a dream on a Sunday
Take a life, take a holiday
Take a lie, take a dreamer
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream along
Dreamer (Dream, dream along)
(Come on and dream, dream along) On and on
(Come on and dream, dream along)
(Come on and dream, dream along)
Dreamer, you know you are a dreamer
Can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
I said dreamer, you're nothing but a dreamer
Well, can you put your hands in your head? Oh no!
Oh no!Embed
