Cherry Lyrics
Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger (Hey)
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch (Yeah) from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil (Hey)
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah (Fuck)

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined

Love (Yeah), is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against ya (Hey)
And you just stay lined up, yeah (Fuck)

Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
I fall to pieces (Bitch)
My cherries (Hey) and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Bitch) (Lookin' at me like a magazine)
My rose garden dreams (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Set on fire by fiends (Sippin' on ya like a Coca-Cola)
And all my black beaches (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are ruined (Lookin' at me like a magazine)
My celluloid scenes (Can I get a fuckin' hallelujah?)
Are torn at the seams (Sippin' on ya like a Coca-Cola, yeah)
And I fall to pieces (Bitch)
(Yeah) I fall to pieces when I'm with you

(Why?) 'Cause I love you so much (Hey)
I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme (Yeah)
And all of my peaches are ruined (Bitch)
Are ruined (Bitch), are ruined (Fuck)108Embed
