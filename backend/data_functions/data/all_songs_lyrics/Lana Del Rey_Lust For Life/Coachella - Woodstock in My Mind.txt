Coachella - Woodstock in My Mind Lyrics
I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin' they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I was at Coachella leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children and all their children's children?
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven (A stairway, stairway to heaven)
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it (A stairway)
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend (A stairway)
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question

A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
