Finally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For… and for… (Shut up, shut up)
And all my birds of paradise (Shut up, shut up)
Who never got to fly at night (Shut up, shut up)
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind

There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them (Touch, touch)
There's nothing to hold on to (Hold, hold)
The colors used to lure you in (Shut up, shut up)
And put you in a trance (Ah, ah, ah, yeah)

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)
Out of the black (Out of the black)
Into the blue (Into the blue)66Embed
