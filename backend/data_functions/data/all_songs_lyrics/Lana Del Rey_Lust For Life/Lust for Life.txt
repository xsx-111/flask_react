Lust for Life Lyrics
Climb up the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
In these stolen moments, the world is mine (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
There's nobody here, just us together (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
Keepin' me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause, boy, we're gold, boy, we're gold
And I was like...

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
(Then) We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign (Yeah)
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die (Doo-wop, doo-wop)
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever (Sha-doop, sha-doop)
There's no more night, blue skies forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like…

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're havin' too much fun
Too much fun tonight (Yeah)

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
I told you twice in our love letter
There's no stopping now, green lights forever
And I was like…

Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all your clothes
Take off, take off, take off all of your clothes

And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive (Oh)152Embed
