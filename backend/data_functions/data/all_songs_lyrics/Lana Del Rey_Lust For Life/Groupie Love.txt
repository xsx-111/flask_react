Groupie Love Lyrics
You're in the bar playin' guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club livin' it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Time after time, writing my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watchin' my bae
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a-
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die

Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
(You are my babe)
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
