When the World Was at War We Kept Dancing Lyrics
Girls, don't forget your pearls and all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls and all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song

Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
(Told by the fake news)

Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
No, it's only the beginnin'
If we hold on to hope, we'll have our happy endin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from lovin' you
And we'll do it again
Oh my God, dizzy from lovin' you
We'll do it again
Did it from, did it from lovin' you
We'll do it again
In a world at war
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'

And we'll do it again
And we'll do it again25Embed
