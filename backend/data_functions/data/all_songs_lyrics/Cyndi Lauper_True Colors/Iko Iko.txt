Iko Iko Lyrics
My grandma and your grandma were sittin' by the fire
My grandma told your grandma, "I'm gonna set your flag on fire"

Talk-in' 'bout
Hey now, hey now
Iko-iko, un-day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-ne

Look at my king all dressed in red
Iko, iko, un-day
Bet-cha five dollars he'll kill you dead
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne

Talk-in' 'bout
Hey now, hey now
Iko-iko, un day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-ne
Yeah

See that man all dressed in green
Iko-iko, un-day
He ain't a man, he's a lovin' machine
Jock-a-mo fee na-ne
Talk-in' 'bout
Hey now, hey now
Iko-iko, un day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-ne
Yeah

My flag boy and your flag boy were sittin' by the fire
With your flag boy told and my flag boy
I'm gonna set their flags on fire

Talkin' 'bout
Hey now, hey now
Iko-iko, un day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-ne

Talkin' 'bout
Hey now
Talkin' 'bout
Hey now, hey now
Iko-iko, un day
Jock-a-mo fee-no ai na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-ne
Jock-a-mo fee-na-neEmbed
