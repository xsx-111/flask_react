Calm Inside the Storm Lyrics
I can get up on the right side of the bed
But that don't stop the rain from coming down on my head
I can live my life playing hide and seek
But when I look inside, it's hard to make believe
Ah-ha
Ooh-ha

'n lately
You seem so far away
I wish I could say something, but I don't know what to say
I can feel your eyes, I don't have to look at you
Boy, discontentment is a sneakin'-through
Ah-ha

You never really want anything
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long
Ooh-woah, woah-yeah
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long
Ah-ah
Don't you know you should be holding me?
But you're all locked inside
Why don't you throw me your keys?
I'm like a rockin' ship on your rollin' sea
You know crash and lightnin' never frightens me, nah-nah

You never really want anything
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long
Oh-woah, woah-yeah
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long

You never really want it
But when you really need it
I wanna give you something
Hmm-hmm
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You never really want anything
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long
Oh-woah, woah-yeah
But what you really need is everything
I'll give you something only life can bring
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long
Oh-woah, woah-yeah
The calm inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-oh
The calm inside inside the storm
Love me a little, love me long!Embed
