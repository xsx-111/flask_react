One Track Mind Lyrics
Got a one track mind

Something's happening, I want everything
What does the moment bring? I want it now
(Got a one track mind)
I want it, I need it
I really think so
(Got a one track mind)

Got a one track mind
Got a one track mind

People say to me, mind my Q's and P's
Why do they bother me?
Something inside comes over me
I want it, I need it
(Got a one track mind)
I really think so

Got a one track mind
Got a one track mind
I climb up the stairs, I sit up and stare
But nobody's there, I walk ahead
(Got a one track mind)
You fall behind, another victim
(Got a one track mind)

I want everything
And I want it nowEmbed
