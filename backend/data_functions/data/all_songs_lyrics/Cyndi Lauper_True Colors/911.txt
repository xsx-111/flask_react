911 Lyrics
There's a riot in the kitchen and the bed's on fire
There's a locket in my pocket that I can't find

Oh, I'm at the window whistling in the wind
I'm at my own front door and I can't get in

I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
Then everything else would be fine, fine, fine

Tell me do you have a home-made remedy
The only time we talk is in our sleep

Oh, he likes mornings, I like the moon
It's a typical case of too little, too soon

I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
Then everything else would be fine, fine, fine
My back is in the corner
My boat is taking on water
You can't wrap fire up in paper
And you can't rap your way out of here

Oh I like mornings, he likes the moon
It's a typical case of too late, too soon

I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
Then everything else would be fine, fine, fine
Oh, I'm dialing up 911
I'm on the brink of trouble again
If you could change the time a little
Then everything else would be fine, fine, fine

I'm dialing up the 911
I'm dialing up the 911
I'm dialing up the 911
I'm dialing up the 911
The 911 emergency number
Is not in effect in the area where you are
Please hang up and dial "0" for operator
This is a recording, ha-ha!Embed
