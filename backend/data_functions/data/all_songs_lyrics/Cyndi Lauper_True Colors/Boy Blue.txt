Boy Blue Lyrics
Where are you?

You never knew yourself well enough, ah
But she never knew you at all

And when she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence
But not, no-not your soul

Tell me, where is little boy blue?
You'll find him standing always one step ahead, oh
Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue, woah!
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walking
Just a kid walking, just a kid

You send a letter with photographs, ah
I'll tuck them under my dreams

And if we wake up old beyond our years
Not quite as brave as we seem
It's just the pain that never disappears
Tell me, where is little boy blue?
You'll find him standing always one step ahead, oh
Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue, woah!
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walking
Just a kid walking, just a kid

Ooh
Where are you?
Where are you?

And when she put you out on your own
It may have stolen your innocence
But not, no-not your soul

Tell me, where is little boy blue?
You'll find him standing always one step ahead, oh
Dance a little, cry a little, boy blue, woah-woah!
Wise blood runs warms and deep
On the street, kids walking
Just a kid walking, just a kid walking
Just a kid
Where are you?
Where are you? Where are you, boy blue? Oh
Where are you?
You're always walking one step ahead
You're always walking one step ahead
Ooh
Where are you?
Where are you, boy blue?1Embed
