Too Darn Hot LyricsIt's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Refill the cup with my baby tonight
I'd like to sup with my baby tonight
Refill the cup with my baby tonight
But I ain't up to my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot

I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
But brother you'll fight my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
According to the Kinsey report
Ev'ry average man you know
Much prefers his lovey-dovey to court
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot
Mister pants
For romance
Is not
'Cause it's too, too
Too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too
Too
Darn hot..

I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
I'd like to coo with my baby tonight
And pitch the woo with my baby tonight
But brother you'll fight my baby tonight
'Cause it's too darn hot
According to the latest report
Ev'ry average man you know
Much prefers his lovely doggie to court
When the temperature is low
But when the thermometer goes 'way up
And the weather is sizzling hot
Mister gob, for his squab
A marine, for his queen
A G.I, for his cutie-pie
Is not
'Cause it's too, too
Too darn hot
It's too darn hot
It's too
Darn
Hot..
It's too darn hot!Embed
