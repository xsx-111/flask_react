Lonely Is LyricsIf you wanna know what lonely is
The dictionary's not the place to go
If you really wanna know what lonely is
Ask an expert, I know
Lonely is a telephone you use for a paperweight
Lonely is a mailbox with nothing inside
Lonely is a quart of rye you've had for a year or more
Lonely is the laundry you don't have to hide
Lonely is a Christmas tree that no-one else will see
A three room apartment with only one key
Lonely is so many things when all's said and done
But all together, they add up to one
I guess you'd say
That, in a way
What lonely is, is me
Lonely is a welcome mat that's waiting on the floor
To welcome the paper that's left at the door
Lonely is so many things when all's said and done
But all together, they add up to one
I guess you'd say
That, in a way
What lonely is, is meEmbed
