From This Moment On LyricsFrom this moment on, you for me dear
Only two for tea dear, from this moment on
From this happy day, no more blue songs
Only whoop dee doo songs
From this moment on
For you've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
From this moment on, you and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone, from this moment on
From this happy day, no more blue songs
Only whoop dee doo songs
From this moment on
For you've got the love I need so much
Got the skin I love to touch
Got the arms to hold me tight
Got the sweet lips to kiss me goodnight
From this moment on, you and I, babe
We'll be ridin' high, babe
Every care is gone, from this moment onEmbed
