Anything Goes LyricsTimes have changed
And we've often rewound the clock
Since the Puritans got the shock
When they landed on Plymouth Rock
If today
Any shock they might try to stem
'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock
Plymouth Rock would land on them
In olden days a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything Goes
Good authors too
Who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything Goes
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
And though I'm
Not a great romancer
I know what I'm bound to answer
When you propose, anything goes
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today
And black's white today
And day's night today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
So though I'm
Not a great romancer
I know what I'm bound to answer
When you propose, anything goes
Anything goesEmbed
