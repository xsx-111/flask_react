Hold Me Now Lyrics
Don't stop shaking it's my head
That makes me want to second guess at a distance
Hoping there's a method to your madness baby
I might just understand if you obey me

Hold me now, I need assistance
I'd take somebody else if I could

Walking down tree-lined place so pensive in the country
I can't take the voodoo that you do
Just lust easier sussed real love makes me untrue
It's hard to make a stew when the meat keeps looking up at you

And hold me now, I need assistance
Follow down the path of least resistance
Hold me now, don't keep your distance
I'd take somebody else if I could
Hold me now, I need assistance
Why don't you take the path of least resistance
Hold me now, do I need a license to hold you?
Hold me now, I need assistance
Follow down the path of least resistance
Hold me now, will it take a lifetime to hold you?Embed
