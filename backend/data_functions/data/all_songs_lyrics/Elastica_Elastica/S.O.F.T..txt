S.O.F.T. Lyrics
And now we find
Looking back at your state of mind
Was it all just a cover up?
Woke your mother up
You were on TV
Did the Devil say to you
You can make it through?
I'll take you to the top
And now that you're heaven bent
And it pays the rent
Is it hard to stop?

S.O.F.T. Thought you knew the score
S.O.F.T. Always wanted more
S.O.F.T. Are you sure you're sure
S.O.F.T

And now we find
Looking back at your state of mind
Was it all just a cover up?
Broke your mother up
On my TV
Did the Devil say to you
You can make it through?
I'll take you up the shop
And in a dress too small
To be a dress at all
Is it hard to stop?
S.O.F.T. Thought you knew the score
S.O.F.T. Always wanted more
S.O.F.T. Are you sure you're sure
S.O.F.TEmbed
