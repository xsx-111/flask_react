Smile Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 4

Peaches and cream, where have you been?
Did you know I've been waiting all night
Who's bed where you in? Who's head were you turning?
Don't you know I've been out of my mind

Cause I know what you fear you will find
Oh why...

Sweetness and light
I don't wanna fight you
But I don't wanna listen to lies
Your face is a mess
You know you should drink less
And I don't wanna hear how the time flies
And I know by the look in your eyes

You were talking to some girl who's seen you
I heard what she said
She said she thought that she knew you
Although you had only just met
Oh yeah
Don't stop talking sharp
I'll see you down the time swap
I've been tested and tried
Lost on the tide
So cold inside
Do you know I've been out of my mind?
Cause you know what you fear that you'll find

I was talking to some girl that
You said you'd seen her before
Oh my head's such a mess
'Till I hear your key in the door
Oh yeah... oh yeah!Embed
