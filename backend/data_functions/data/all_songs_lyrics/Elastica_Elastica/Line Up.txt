Line Up Lyrics
Drivel head wears her glad rags
She's got her keys, money and fags
I know that her mind is made up
To get rocked

Drivel head needs a new man
As only a drivel head can
He's a hormonal nightmare
So beware

Another victim of line up in line, line up in line is all I remember
Oh, how the favour has changed, you could've been kinder
Yes, yes, line up in line, line up in line, is all I remember
Oh, how their favours change, you could have been mine

Drivel head knows all the stars
Loves to suck their shining guitars
They've all been right up her stairs
Do you care? No

Drivel head knows all the bands
Knows them like the back of her hands
You can't see the wood for the trees
On your knees
Another victim of line up in line, line up in line is all I remember
Oh, how the favour has changed, you could have been kinder
Yes, yes, line up in line, line up in line is all I remember
Oh, how the favour has changed, you could have been mineEmbed
