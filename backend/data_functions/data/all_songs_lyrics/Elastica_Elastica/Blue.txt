Blue Lyrics
John's gone his senses loaded over by your house
You know, it's so basic
One, two, three, four

John's gone his senses loaded
Over by your house
It's so basic
I think you're faking
Have a good time
But don't get into my head
Do you recommend I wait a while
Direct and live or keep it
Constant
And selective blue

I can read your mind
If you want to
I will let you
Blue!
I can read your mind
If you want to
I will let you
John's gone he needs attention
Do you understand
His inclination?
I've seen you shaking
Come down here
And I'll show you the wrong way
Try to rearrange this tired old line
Connect this smile and keep it
Standard
And reflective blue

I can read your mind
If you want to
I will let you
Blue!
I can read your mind
I will let you
If you want to1Embed
