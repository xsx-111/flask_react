Vaseline Lyrics
When you're stuck like glue, Vaseline
When you need some goo
When you're stuck like glue, Vaseline
When you're black and blue, Vaseline

La La La La La La La La La La
When you're stuck like glue
Give me some

When you're stuck like glue
If you'd like to woo, Vaseline

La La La La La La La La La La
If it's hot like you
Give me some
Do you need a clue
I want some Vaseline, Vaseline, Vaseline, Vaseline, Vaseline, VaselineEmbed
