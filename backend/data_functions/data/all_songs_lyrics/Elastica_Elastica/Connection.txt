Connection Lyrics
Riding on any wave
That is the luck you crave
They don't believe it now
They just think it's stupid
So got anything?
Anyone could have done
Who would've cared at all
Not you

Another heart has made the trade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how a heart is a spade
But somehow the vital connection is made

Riding on anything
Anything's good enough
Who would've thought it of
Someone like you
Just as they brought me round
Now that they brought you down
Roundabout and roundabout
Who wants a life anyway?
Another heart has made the grade
Forget it, forget it, forget it
I don't understand how the last card is played
But somehow the vital connection is made1Embed
