Waking Up Lyrics
I'd work very hard, but I'm lazy
I can't take the pressure and it's starting to show
In my heart, you know how it pains me
A life of leisure is no life, you know

Waking up and getting up has never been easy
Oh woah ah, I think you should know
Waking up and getting up has never been easy
Oh woah ah, I think you should know
Oh woah ah, I think you should go
Make a cup of tea, put a record on

I'd work very hard, but I'm lazy
I've got a lot of songs but they're all in my head
I'll get a guitar and a lover who pays me
If I can't be a star, I won't get out of bed

Waking up and getting up has never been easy
Oh woah ah, I think you should know
Waking up and getting up has never been easy
Oh woah ah, I think you should know
Oh woah ah, I think you should go
Make a cup of tea, put a record on

Waking up and getting up has never been easy
Oh woah ah, I think you should know
Waking up and getting up has never been easy
Oh woah ah, I think you should know
Oh woah ah, I think you should go
Make a cup of tea, put a record on1Embed
