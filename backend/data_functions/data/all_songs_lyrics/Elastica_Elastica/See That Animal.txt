See That Animal LyricsSee that animal get some heavy metal
Watch the world go singing sha-la-la-la
White stick happiness
Will we ever know how it feels
How it feels?
I feel your tattoo on mine ,but
I can't wash it off this time
Oh it's time
Oh it's time
Oh it's time
Oh it's time
See that drug act
That AC/DC drag act
On the wires in the sky tonight
Fifteen new cities, but
Will we ever know how it feels
How it feels
I feel my tattoo on you
It's a sweet thing Terry
But it's not true
It's not true
It's not true
It's not true
It's not trueEmbed
