Around the World Lyrics
Oh oooh, yeah

I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm just tryin' to get my money right
So unless I'm done we could take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)

She likes black Bentley coupes, black Daytons
Black interior, black ridin' shotgun
Black four-five, black Air Ones
Bangin' the Black Album, track number one
She like that Jay shit, that's her favorite
If it's gon' get me the pussy, I'ma play that shit
If she bite too hard I'ma say that shit
But don't bite me bitch, I don't play that shit
Marcus Houston, I don't play that shit
By the time we got half way through watchin' Ray, I hit
I laid her down, beat it up, let her go clean it up
Take a five minute nap, wake up and eat it, what?
Then it's part two in the sauna
Feel like I'm fuckin' Mary J. 'cause she don't want no drama
I'd rather take your ass to the Bahamas
Than give you thirty thousand a month like Diddy, baby momma
I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm just tryin' to get my money right
So unless I'm done we could take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)

Picture me thuggin'
Picture me lovin' you like Bobby love Whitney
Now picture me fuckin'
Pullin' your ponytail, smackin' you on the ass
Tellin' you how (I can take you all around the world)
That nigga can't do it like this
Even Beyonc√© couldn't move it like this
She only fuck with soldiers, that's her shit
I hate to admit it but I love my bitch so much
I'm sittin' outside in the Benz
Thinkin' back to Dre's house when I fucked her best friend
The pussy wasn't nothin'
Now I'm dealin' with the diary of a mad black woman with Louis Vuitton luggage
She told me she was tired of the Game and rap
Quit like Ma$e then she came right back
I told you the bitch sex was whack
And you're all I need, even Jamie know that
I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm just tryin' to get my money right
So unless I'm done we could take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)

You know what they say, "more money, more problems, more drama"
Means more marijuana and less baby momma
You know I love you like I love my shoes
But even white Air Force ones come in two's
Yeah, I like her and I like you too
What's wrong? She my bitch and you my boo
She got a Range Rover Sport, you got a Bentley coupe
She take my clothes to the cleaners, you take Harlem to school
I gave you the Birkin bags so I made a mistake
And Oprah don't fuck with them no more anyway
I'm sorry for the bullshit I put you through
But I ain't goin' nowhere, I got a kid wit'chu
Why we always gotta argue about Superhead's book
She sucked my dick with a condom on, after that I shook
And when she start talking about buying a ring
I just turn the volume up and let Jamie Foxx sing
I know you're sick and tired of waitin' on me girl
But I'm just tryin' to get my money right
So unless I'm done we could take a flight
So I can take you all around the world
Planes, trains, automobiles
Bentley or a Range, chromed out wheels
First class ticket, G-4, you that deal
For real (I can take you all around the world)2Embed
