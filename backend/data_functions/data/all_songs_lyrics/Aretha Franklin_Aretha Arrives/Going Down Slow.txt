Going Down Slow Lyrics
I have had my fun if I never get well no more

All of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow

Please write my father and tell him the shape I'm in
Tell her to pray for me
Forgive me for my sin
For all of my sin
On the next train south, look for my clothes back home
Cause all of my health is failing
Lord, I'm going down slow
I'm going down slow


Feel like I'm going, like I'm going down slowEmbed
