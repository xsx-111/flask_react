Never Let Me Go Lyrics
Just let me love you tonight
Forget about tomorrow
My darling won't you hold me tight

And never let
Never let me go

Dry your eyes
No tears, no sorrow
Cling to me with all your might

And never let me go

A million times or more
We said we'd never never never never part
Ah but lately
Lately I find
That you're a stranger
A stranger in my heart
Give me give me give me
Give me the night
In summer or in springtime
To tell the world
That you're every bit of mine

And you'll never
Oh, never let me go
No, you'll never let me goEmbed
