Night Life Lyrics
In the evening, when the sun goes down
You’re gonna find me, doing
What I’m doing right now, and next just sitting around

The night life, it ain’t no good life
But it’s my life, yes it is

And all good people, good people, just like you and me
They’re sitting around dreaming
Sitting around dreaming about that used to be


Oh, listen to the blues, to the blues and what they’re playing
I wonder tonight, are you really listening to the blues
To the blues and what they’re saying
What they seem to be playing to me that’s, that many people have loved
And they seem to be saying to me that many people have lost
Well, listen, they might not to have loved at all
If they had know that they couldn’t pay the cost
Oh, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me, yeah, they tell me
They tell me that life is just an empty scene
They say that is older than the oldest broken hearts
And they tell me that is newer than the newest stood dreams
