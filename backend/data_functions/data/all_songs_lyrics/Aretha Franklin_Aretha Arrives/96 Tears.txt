96 Tears Lyrics
Too many teardrops for one heart to be crying (I just can’t stand it
Too many teardrops for one heart to carry on, yest it is (I just can’t stand it
You’re way on top now, baby, since you left me, yeah
And you’re always laughing down at me, yes sir
But, o-o-o-oh, watch out baby, I’m gonna get there, yeah
And we’ll be together in just a little while, yes we will
And we’ll be gathering tears from way up here, oh yeah

I want to see you cry, yeah, 96 tears, yes I do (96, it just won’t do

I’ll be on top, and you’ll be there just looking up
I can always get up here, and I might not be waving down


Ooh, try to get a hundred baby (96, it just won’t do
96 teardrops from you (96, it just won’t do
Oh oh, can you get a hundred, baby? yeah (can you make your tears one hundred?
96 teardrops from you, ooo, ah, ooo, ah, ooo (can you get a million, baby?
Get a million, yeah, yeah (96, it just won’t do
Can you get a million tears together? (can you make your tears one hundred?
From 96 tears, oh baby (can you get a million, baby?
‘Cause baby there ain’t just won’t do (96, it just won’t do
Ooo, just won’t, ooo, do, baby (can you make your tears one hundred?Embed
