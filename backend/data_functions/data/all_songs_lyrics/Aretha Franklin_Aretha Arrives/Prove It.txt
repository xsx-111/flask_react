Prove It Lyrics
Prove it, Prove it, Prove it, Prove it to me

Prove
That it won't bother me
To become your used to be
Prove
That I can just Ignore
All the love we shared before
Prove it to my starving Heart
Prove it to my starving Heart
Prove it now before we part
Prove it now before we part


Prove
The loneliness I'll find
Will be only in my mind
Prove
That all these tears that fall
Aren't really tears at all
Prove that I don't want to die
Prove that I don't want to die
Now that you say, "It's goodbye
Now that you say, "It's goodbye


Before you walk out that door
Prove, I won't love you no more
Prove that i'll forget your kiss
In your arms, I'll never miss
Never Miss
Now let me see you
Prove it
Just let me see you
Prove it

Prove,that I don't want to die
Now, That you say, "It's Goodbye


Let me see you
Prove it
Just let me see you
Prove it
