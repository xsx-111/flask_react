I Wonder LyricsI wonder
My darling
Where are you again tonight?
Are you holding someone else real tight?
Baby, I wonder
My heart...
My heart is aching
I believe that I'm a fool
To let it go on breaking
Maybe I wake up and find now that I'm mistaken
Oh but right now, I wonder
I've been through
Lover's Lane
And I'm living life
Just the same
I've been travelling
Nowhere faced
And what I wanna know
What I want to know is will it last?
Oh oh I wonder
I wonder
My darling
Will you think of me?
Will you think of me again tonight?
Or are you holding someone else real tight?
Ouh yeah-he-he baby I wonder
I've been through...
I've been through Lover's Lane
And I'm living life...
Living in just the same
I've been travelling...
Been travelling but nowhere faced
And what I wanna know right now
What I want to know is will it last?
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
My my my my my my my darling
Will you think of me?
Will you think of me every day?
Although I may be a million miles away
Right now I wonder
Although I...
Although I may be a million miles away
Baby, baby, I wonderEmbed
