Katie Dear Lyrics
Oh Katie dear go ask your mother
If you can be a bride of mine
If she says yes come back and tell me
If she says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking
She's in her room a takin’ rest
And by her side is a silver dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Oh Katie dear go ask your father
If you can be a bride of mine
If he says yes come back and tell me
If he says no we'll run away
Oh Willie dear, there's no use in asking
He’s in his room a takin’ rest
And by his side there's a golden dagger
To slay the one that I love best

Then he picked up this golden dagger
And stove it through his troubled heart
Saying goodbye Katie goodbye darlin'
At last the time has come to part
Then she picked up that bloody dagger
And stove it through her lily-white breast
Saying goodbye papa goodbye mama
I'll die with the one that I love bestEmbed
