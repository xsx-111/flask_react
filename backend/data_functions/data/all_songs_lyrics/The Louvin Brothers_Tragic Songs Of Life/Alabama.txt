Alabama LyricsAlabama your beautiful sunlight your fields are so recent potatoes and corn
Alabama your crimson red clover all mingle around the old place I was born
Alabama your hills and your valleys your creeks sing with laughter as onward they flow
Alabama so sweet in the springtime sweet ferns and wild flowers and winter with snow
Alabama so sweet to my mem'ry you shine like a light on a beautiful hill
Alabama in days of my childhood I played there and toiled at the old sawmill
Alabama your beautiful highways carved through the mountains where loved ones do wait
Alabama your golden rock flowers and the welcome home sign hanging over your gate
Alabama to me you are calling my footsteps are hauling no longer to stray
Alabama you hold all I long for you hold what I love so I'm coming todayEmbed
