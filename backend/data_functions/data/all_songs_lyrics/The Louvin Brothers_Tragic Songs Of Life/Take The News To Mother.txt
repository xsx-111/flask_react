Take The News To Mother LyricsWhile the shot and shells were scattering
All o'er the battlefield
While the boys in France were fighting
To save their noble flag
Save their flag or give their lives
All for their country and home
They brought him back and heard him say
I can no longer stay
Go take the news to Mother
For she knows how well I love her
Kiss her dear sweet lips for me
Tell her I'm not coming home
Oh tell my darling sweetheart
That her lips I'll kiss no more
For this battlefield is awful
I'm sure I'll see her no more
Now, I'd love to see my mother
Kneeling by the old hearth stone
But I'm in this hell right here on earth
And her prayer I'll hear no more
Go take the news to Mother
For she knows how well I love her
Kiss her dear sweet lips for me
Mmmm, Mmmm, Mmmmmm
Tell her I'm not coming homeEmbed
