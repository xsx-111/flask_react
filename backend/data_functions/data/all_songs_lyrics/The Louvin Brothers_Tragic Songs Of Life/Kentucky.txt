Kentucky Lyrics
Kentucky, you are the dearest land outside of Heaven to me
Kentucky, your laurels and your redbud trees
When I die, I want to rest upon your graceful mountain so high
Kentucky, that is where God will look for me


Kentucky, I miss the voices singing in the silvery moonlight
Kentucky, I miss the hound dog chasing coon
I know that my mother, dad and sweetheart all are waiting for me
Kentucky, I will be coming soon

Kentucky, I will be coming soonEmbed
