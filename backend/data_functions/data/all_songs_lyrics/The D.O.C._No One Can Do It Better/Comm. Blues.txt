Comm. Blues Lyrics
Hold on, hold on before you start the next record Dre man I gotta take one of them long ass 8-ball pisses, you know how that shit is, wait, take me to a commercial

Alright, you got it

Yo, this is Michel'le chillin' with The D.O.C. and we're gonna kick a little soul on this commercial break so check this out!
 (Guys talking)
They said he couldn't make it
Said he wouldn't succeed (I knew he wouldn't succeed)
(Good golly Miss Molly)  (Sing it baby, sing it!)
But now that he some money and a Benz babe
(Some money and a Benz babe)
He's no longer in need  (I always did like that)
Do you hear what I'm sayin'? (I hear you)
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?
D.O.C. is in effect
Gettin' much respect, and a
Make me wanna say owww!
Owwww! Owwwww! Owwww!
I think I need a little horn, can you hit me one time 
(I think I got the holy ghost) (Lord have mercy) 
(I feel so good I wanna jump back and kiss myself)
(I feel so good I wanna jump back and kiss Michel'le!)
(I feel so good I wanna jump back and kiss you!)
(Hey baby turn around one more time!) (I be damned if she can't sing)
(Look at that backend on her! That's a gluteus maximus!)
(This is baby-making music, lemme tell you) 
(You'll never make a baby off that!)
 
(Granddaddy caddy coming straight to you baby)
(Hey y'all, what about that D.O.C. fool?)
(Oh, don't worry about him) 
(I worry about the girl!)
(Pass me my beans and rice)
(I want the girl, that's who I want)
(Shut up fool!)
(Aight)Embed
