Comm. 2 Lyrics
Hey, I gotta get these lyrics together for the next song, Dre,
Take me to commercial.

Alright, bet

Yo! This is MC Ren, kicking it in a place with my homeboy D.O.C.,
And we gonna take a commercial break
So, we gonna kick it a little something like this...
Here we go, here we go!

D.O.C.!
N.W.A. in the place!
Come on, yeah!
Much peace to the Dr. Dre
Peace to my homie Donovan,
Yes, kids
Come on!
Get busy!
Get busy!
Get busy!
Get busy!2Embed
