Box Set Lyrics
I never thought that you would love me the way that you do
I never thought that you would love me half as much as I do
You say you wanna know everything about me - well here you go
You say you couldn't live your life without me, I don't know
But if you want it girl, you've got it
It's all right here, in my box set

I never thought that words like product could ever leave my lips
But something happened to me somewhere that made me lose my grip
Or maybe it's a lack of inspiration that makes me stoop
Or maybe it's a lack of remuneration; I can't recoup
But if you want it folks, you got it
It's all right here in my box set

Disc One:
It's where we've begun, it's all my greatest hits
And if you are a fan then you know that you've already got 'em
Disc Two:
It was all brand new, an album's worth of songs
But we had to leave the whole disc blank cause
Some other label bought 'em
Disc Three:
This is really me in a grade school play
I had about a hundred thousand lines but of course I forgot 'em
I never thought there'd be days like this, there was always someone at my door
I never thought I would ever miss, and the crowd would always holler for more
But now it seems all that people want is what I used to be
And every time I try to do something new
All they want is 1973

I never thought I'd be regretful of all my past success
But some stupid number one hit single has got me in this mess
You can put it on every compilation, that's alright
You can hear it on the oldies radio station every night
And if you want it again, you got it
It's right here in my box set

Disc Four:
Never released before, and you can tell why
It's just some demos I recorded in my basement
Disc Five:
I was barely alive, I was hacking up a lung
So they had to use a special computer as my replacement
Disc Six:
A dance remix, so I can catch the latest trend
And it'll make you scratch your head and wonder
Where my taste went
So now my fans are crying sellout, they say that I've lost my touch
They say I should just get the hell out before I do too much
Hear my songs in an ad for a bathroom cleanser, they say it's greed
And now I'm wondering where my friends are in this time of need
But if you change your mind and buy it
I hope you enjoy my new box

I hope you enjoy my new box
I hope you enjoy my new box setEmbed
