Wrap Your Arms Around Me Lyrics
I concede you were right about this place
I can make a perfect likeness of your body if I trace
I can hold you 'til you turn out the light
And I can't see

Do you believe we are all innately good?
Do you think that you would love me
'Til tomorrow if you could?
Would you please turn down the radio
So we can speak?

I put my hands around your neck
You wrap your arms around me
Put my hands around your neck
You wrap your arms around me
I put my hands around your neck
You wrap your arms around me

I regret every time I raised my voice
And it wouldn't be that bright of me to say I had no choice
I can kiss your eyes, your hair, your neck
Until we forget
I concede you were right about this place
I can make a perfect likeness of your body if I trace
I can hold you 'til you turn out the light
And I can't see
I can't seeEmbed
