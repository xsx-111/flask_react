Hello City Lyrics
Hello city!
Hey

Another night at the palace
'Cause there is nothing else to do
Oh-oh, ah-ha
The same people, the same drinks and
The same music, the same quicksand
I think this harbor town is waist-deep and sinking fast

Hello city
You've found an enemy in me
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (ba-do-do-dobie-oh-oh)
Hello city (hello city)
Hello city, hey

Second night at the warehouse
And my mock turtleneck just reeks
From the liquor room to the change room
To the doom and gloom of the hotel room
I think this seaside beer hall should sink into the bay
Hello city
You've found an enemy in me
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (ba-do-do-dobie-oh-oh)
Hello city (hello city)
Hello city, hey

Maybe I caught you at a bad time
Maybe I should call you back next week
Maybe half the fault is mine that the sun didn't shine on Barrington Street

It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm hungry so lets eat
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Climb down three flights to the streetlights
And the bar fights, we're just taking in the sights
I hope tomorrow that I wake up in my own bed

Hello city
You've found an enemy in me
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh (ba-do-do-dobie-oh-oh)
Hello city (hello city)
Hello city, hey
"What a good place to be"
Don't believe them
'Cause they speak a different language and it's never been happy for me
(It's Happy Hour again)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
It's Happy Hour again
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Hello city, hey
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Hello city, heyEmbed
