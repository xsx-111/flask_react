Be My Yoko Ono Lyrics
And if there's someone you can live without
Then do so
And if there's someone you can just shove out
Well, do so

You can be my Yoko Ono
You can follow me wherever I go
Be my, be my, be my
Be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oh

Isn't it beautiful to see two people
So much in love?
Barenaked as two virgins hand in hand
And hand and hand in glove
Now that I'm far away it doesn't seem
To me to be such a pain
To have you hanging off my ankle
Like some kind of ball and chain
(If you like)

You can be my Yoko Ono
You can follow me wherever I go
Be my, be my, be my
Be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oh
Be my Yoko--
Oh no, here we go
Our life is one big pun
Oh no, here we go
As Yoko sings: "OLOLOLOLOLOLOLO"

I know that when I say this
I may be stepping on pins and needles
But I don't like all these people
Slagging her for breaking up The Beatles
Don't blame it on Yokey!
I mean, if I was John and you were Yoko
I would gladly give up musical genius
Just to have you as my very own personal Venus
(Doo-doo-doo-doo)
(Hit it!)

You can be my Yoko Ono
You can follow me wherever I go
Be my, be my, be my
Be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oh

Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my Yoko Ono, oh
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my Yoko Ono, oh
Be my, be my, be my, be my
Be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oh2Embed
