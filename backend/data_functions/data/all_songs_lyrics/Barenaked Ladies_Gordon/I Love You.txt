I Love You Lyrics
I love you
And you love me
I love you
So let's make a family tree
I love you
And you love me
I love you
So let's make a family tree

I like soup, and I like ice cream, sandwiches too
I like fish sticks, but I love you
You don't believe me, you say all I think about's myself
Let me explain, don't walk away

I love me
You love you
I love me
So what are we to do?

How would you know that I love you so?
I don't say too much
Why are you blue whenever I'm in town?
I guess life was fine till I came 'round
You've given me a start
I ain't no doctor but just take a look at the chart
For my heart like a dart from the start
I'm coming down with something good
It ain't no fever or flu, doctor says it had to be someone
With brown hair and blue eyes
I'm lovesick for you I realize

I's loves you
And you's loves me
I's loves you
So let's make a family tree

How did you know that I loved you so?
I don't say too much
Why are you blue whenever I'm in town?
I guess life was fine till I came 'round

I love you
And you love me
I love you
So let's make a family tree
I love you
And you love me (You love me)
I love you
So let's make a family tree (Let's make it baby!)
I love you (Hey, hey, hey)
And you love me
I love you
So let's make a family treeEmbed
