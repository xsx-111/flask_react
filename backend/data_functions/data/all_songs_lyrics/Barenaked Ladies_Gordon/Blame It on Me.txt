Blame It on Me Lyrics
Here we are again
And we're looking at each other as if each other were to blame
You think you're so smart, but I've seen you naked
And I'll probably see you naked again
Milli Vanilli told you to blame it on the rain
But if you blame it on the rain tell me
What can be gained so
If all else fails you can blame it on me

If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails, blame it on me
Oh, if all else fails you can blame it on me

Then you smile again
But you're looking at me like there's something I'm supposed to say
Forgive me Father
But I'm falling in love and that's all I have for confession today
Maybe if you'd ask me on any other given day
I wouldn't have time for you or anything that you say
But it's alright now, you can blame it on me

If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails, blame it on me
Oh, if all else fails you can blame it on me
Yes, dear, I love you
But sometimes I think that love's not enough for you
So you want to play mind games?
Well that's fine, go ahead, la la la I can't hear you

Well here you are
And you're a hundred thousand miles away, yeah
They say that absence makes the heart grow fungus
I wax poetic as you're waxing your legs
You say you think there's a traitor among us, woah

If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails you can blame it on me
If all else fails, blame it on me
Oh, if all else fails you can blame it on me1Embed
