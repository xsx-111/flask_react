Brian Wilson Lyrics
Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, call it insane
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop

It's a matter of instinct, it's a matter of conditioning
A matter of fact
You can call me Pavlov's dog
Ring a bell and I'll salivate
How'd you like that?
Dr. Landy tell me you're not just a pedagogue
Because right now I'm

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

So I'm lying here just staring at the ceiling tiles
And I'm thinking about
Oh, what to think about
Just listening and re-listening to Smiley Smile
And I'm wondering if this is some kind of creative drought
Because I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

And if you want to find me I'll be out in the sandbox
Just wondering where the hell all the love has gone
I'm playing my guitar and building castles in the sun (whoa-oh)
And singing "Fun, Fun, Fun"

Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

I had a dream that I was three hundred pounds
And though I was very heavy
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground
I floated 'til I couldn't see the ground (whoa-oh)
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
I couldn't see the ground
Somebody help me
Because I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did
Well I'm
Lying in bed just like Brian Wilson did

Drove downtown in the rain
Nine-thirty on a Tuesday night
Just to check out the late-night record shop
Call it impulsive, call it compulsive, you can call it insane
But when I'm surrounded I just can't stop1Embed
