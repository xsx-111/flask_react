Grade 9 Lyrics
I found my locker and I found my classes
I lost my lunch and I broke my glasses
That guy is huge! That girl is wailin'!
First day of school and I'm already failing

This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

I've got a blue-and-red Adidas bag and a humongous binder
I'm trying my best not to look like a minor niner
I went out for the football team to prove that I'm a man
I guess I shouldn't tell them that I like Duran Duran

This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

Well, half my friends are crazy and the others are depressed
And none of them can help me study for my math test
I got into the classroom and my knowledge was gone
Guess I should've studied instead of watching Wrath of Khan
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

They called me chicken legs!
They called me four-eyes!
They called me fatso!
They called me Buckwheat!
They called me Eddie

This is me in grade nine, baby
Yeah, this is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

I've got a red leather tie and a pair of rugger pants
I put them on and I went to the high school dance
But Dad said I have to be home by eleven
Aw man, I'm gonna miss "Stairway to Heaven"!

This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine (Well, this is me)
This is me in grade nine, baby
Yeah, this is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nine

This is me in grade nine, baby
Yeah, this is me in grade nine (This is me in grade nine)
This is me in grade nine, baby
This is me in grade nineEmbed
