The Flag Lyrics
The phone rings, it's early, it's seven o'clock
He says, "Sorry I woke you, but I just had to talk
You know last night, remember when I tried to choke you?
I didn't mean it, I was drunk, it was only a joke
You should know that by now
When the checkered flag comes down
No one, no one, no one has won the race"

The next night he's over and over and under
And after he's finished she lies there and wonders
Just why does she need him and why does she stay here
And then in the darkness she'll quietly say, "Dear
You've never really known that when the white flag is flown
No one, no one, no one has won the war"

They're complicated people leading complicated lives
And he complicates their problems by telling complicated lies
He tells her he's sorry, she tells him it's over
He tells her he's sorry, she says over and over
"You've never really known that when the white flag is flown
No one no one no one has won the war"

There goes a forest and there goes a bluebird
There goes a partridge and there goes a GO train
There goes an angel and there goes a steeple
There goes a cop car and there goes an eagle
There goes a raven and there go the ribbons
There goes a raven and there go the ribbons
There goes a raven and there go
The ribbons, the ribbons, the ribbons, the ribbons of the flag
Of the flag
Of the flag
Of the flag (There goes the flag)
Of the flag (There goes the flag)
Of the flag
Of the flagEmbed
