Samsonite Man Lyrics
I don't wanna do this
Over and over, yeah

He's a man so full of style and grace
Any woman'd be impressed
Takes a smile and paints it on your face
Makes you feel like you've been blessed
Promises things so special
Seems to come right from a song
Soon as you begin to feel secure, yeah
You turn around and he is gone, oh

Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

Maybe he is just a rollin' stone
Wandering from here to there
Searchin' for a place to call his own
You wonder if he even cares
So many years of heartache and pain
Is all you seem to know him for
Is it you or is it he to blame?
Whenever he walks out your door, oh
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man

Where ya always runnin' to?
Away from me

If the wind blows you in my direction
You come through to rendezvous
Forget about your good intentions
To leave me lonely and confused
Mr. Samsonite man, pack a bag, that is my suggestion
From here on out, you will be leavin'
At my discretion (Yeah)
Said, I know the game, baby
And it'll never be the same, no, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause now, I got him

Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go, gotta go
Packin' his bags, gotta go
He's a Samsonite man
Why don't you just go?
You can't hurt me no more, baby
You can't touch me
You can't hurt me no more, baby
Gotta go, gotta go
Pack your bags
Pack it up, got to go
Hit the road, JackEmbed
