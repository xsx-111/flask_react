Heartburn Lyrics
Uh, yeah, come on
Timbo, A. Keys, let's go!

Let me tell you something
Tell you how I feel
When he comes around
I get to feelin' ill
It's an achy feeling
Inside my chest
It's like I'm goin' into cardiac arrest, uh

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power, I just can't fight it
No matter how I keep on tryin'
I can't deny I got this

Heartburn
Burnin' in my soul
Heartburn
Call the fire department
Heartburn
It's out of control
Heartburn
You got me trippin', slippin', gettin' beside myself
I tried some medication, but don't nothin' help
So I say, "Doctor, doctor, tell me, will I die?"
And he said, "Count to five, Alicia"
And I'm gonna be alright
Let's go, one, two, three, four!

Adrenaline rushin' in my body
All my power, I just can't fight it
No matter how I keep on tryin'
I can't deny I got this

Heartburn
Burnin' in my soul
Heartburn
Call the fire department
Heartburn
It's out of control
Heartburn

Tastes so good, I can't resist
Getting harder to digest
Can't take no more, oughta shake it off
Now break it down and take it to the ground with me now
Everybody say, oh, oh...
Don't you know I got this...
Heartburn
Burnin' in my soul
Heartburn
Call the fire department
Heartburn
It's out of control
Heartburn
What you tryin' to do?
Heartburn
Burnin' in my soul
Heartburn
Call the fire department, uh
Heartburn
It's out of control
Heartburn!
Ooh

Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Go 'head, girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Ooh
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Go 'head, girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it off
Ooh
Go 'head, girl
OohEmbed
