Hospital Lyrics
When you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes
And when you get out of the dating bar
I'll be here to get back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes

Oh, I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes

I go to bakeries all day long
There's a lack of sweetness in my life
And there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes

Oh there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes
Makes me think about me
That I've lost my pride
But I'm in love with this power that resides in your eyes
You live in modern apartments
Well I even got scared once or twice
Last time I walked down your street
There were tears in my eyes
Well now these streets
We all know
They help us cry when we're alone late at night
Don't you love them too?
That where you got your eyes?

Oh I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
How I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes

Now... your world
It is beautiful
I'll take the subway to your suburb sometime
I'll seek out the places that must have been magic
To your little girl mind
Now as a little girl
You must have been magic
I still get jealous of your old boyfriends
In the suburbs sometimes
And when I walk down your street
Probably be tears in my eyes
I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes

So... when you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
But I'm in love with your eyes4Embed
