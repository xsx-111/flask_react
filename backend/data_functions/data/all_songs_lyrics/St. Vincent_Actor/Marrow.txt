Marrow Lyrics
Muscle connects to the bone
And bone to the ire and the marrow
I wish I had a gentle mind and a spine made up of iron

Mouth connects to the teeth
And teeth to the loves and the curses
Honey, can you reach the spots that need oiling and fixing?

H-E-L-P
Help me, help me
H-E-L-P
Help me, help me

Muscle connects to the bone
And bone to the ire and the marrow
So I pretend there aren't ten strings tied to all ten of my fingers

H-E-L-P
Help me, help me

If you want, we could go somewhere else
H-E-L-P
H-E-L-P
