Just the Same but Brand New Lyrics
The people in the street had overtaken you
By the time you rounded Second Avenue

So I walked away, all perfumed
Felt just the same but brand new

And anything you wrote, I checked for codes and clues
The letters stopped unceremoniously in June

So I changed my I's and A's to yours
I'm just the same but brand new

And I do my best impression of weightlessness now, too
And I might be wrong, I might be wrong, I might be wrong
But honey, I believed I could

Float away, dangling
I'm just the same but brand new to you7Embed
