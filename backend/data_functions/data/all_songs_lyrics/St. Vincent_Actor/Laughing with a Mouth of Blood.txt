Laughing with a Mouth of Blood Lyrics
Just like an amnesiac trying to get my senses back
(Oh, where did they go?)
Laughing with a mouth of blood from a little spill I took
(What are you laughing at?)
See, I'll trade in my plot of land for a plane to anywhere
(Oh, where do you go?)
And I can't see the future but I know it's got big plans for me
(Oh, what does it see?)

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
All of my old haunts are now haunting me

Holed up at the Motel Ritz with a televangelist
(Oh, what did he say?)
At the bottom of a swimming pool with all the water out of it
(How'd you get in there?)
I'm sending consolation prizes to my next of kin, allies
(Oh, they'll be so thrilled)
And I can't see the future but I know it's watching me
(Wonder what it sees?)

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
All of my old haunts are now haunting me
Tell my sister that I miss her
Tell my brother that it gets much easier
Tell my sister that I miss her
Tell my brother that it gets much easier

All of my old friends aren't so friendly
And all of my old haunts are now haunting me
All of my old friends aren't so friendly
And all of my old haunts are now haunting me7Embed
