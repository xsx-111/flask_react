The Strangers Lyrics
Lover, I don't play to win but for the thrill until I'm spent
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
And I threw flowers in your face on my sister's wedding day
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)

You showed up with a black eye, looking to go start a fight
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
Playboys under the mattress, like I wouldn't notice
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)

What do I share?
What do I keep from all the strangers who sleep where I sleep?

Desperate don't look good on you, neither does your virtue
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
Good souls have born better sons, better souls born worse ones
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)
What do I share?
What do I keep from all the strangers who sleep where I sleep?

You showed up with a black eye, looking to finish a fight
And lover, I don't play to win but for the thrill until I'm spent
(Paint the black hole blacker)
(Paint the black hole blacker)3Embed
