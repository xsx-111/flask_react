Save Me from What I Want Lyrics
Keys are in my pocket and they
Watch your step
Rattle you away
Watch your step
Seventh floor apartment and a
Watch your step
Fiery escape, but
Watch your step
I'm a wife in watercolors
Watch your step
I can wash away what
Watch your step
Seventeen cold showers couldn't
Watch your step
Wash away

Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want

Honey, what reveals you is what you
Watch your step
Try and hide away
Watch your step
You could tell the planets or your
Watch your step
Pillowcase, but
Watch your step
I'm a wife in watercolors
Watch your step
I can wash away what
Watch your step
Seventeen cold showers couldn't
Watch your step
Wash away
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want
Save me, save me
Save me from what I want2Embed
