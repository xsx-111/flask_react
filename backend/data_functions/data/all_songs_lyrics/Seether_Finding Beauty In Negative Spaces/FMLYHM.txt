FMLYHM Lyrics
You could have been the real one
You could have been the one enough for me
You could have been the free one
The broken down and sick one
The remnant of a vacant life

You come around when you find me faithless
You come around when you find me faceless

Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
Dig it up and whore me out
Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
I love the sound when you come undone

You could have been the next one, God only knows
You could have been the one to comprehend me
You could have been the only one
The broken down and sick one
You could have been the one who I lie with
You come around when you find me faithless
You come around when you find me faceless

Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
Dig it up and whore me out
Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
Don't make a sound until I come undone

You'll never break me
You'll never break me
You'll never break me

You could have been the real one
You could have been the last one I lie with
You could have been the only one
I should have been the one who died

You'll come around when you finally face this
You'll come around when you find me faceless
Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
Dig it up and whore me out
Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
I love the sound when you come undone
Fuck me like you hate me, fuck me like you hate me
Fuck me like you hate me, you'll never break me
Fuck me like you hate me
Dig it up and tear it down
You'll come around when you find me faceless1Embed
