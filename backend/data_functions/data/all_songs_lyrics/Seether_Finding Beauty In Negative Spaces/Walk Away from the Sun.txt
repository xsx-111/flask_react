Walk Away from the Sun Lyrics
Walk away from the sun, come slowly undone
I can see in your eyes I've already won
I could bleed for a smile, I could cry for some fun
Walk away from the sun and tell everyone

There's so much left in the air
So much to tell from a stare
There's so much left to defend
But I am no fun

So turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
I can tell by your smile you're coming undone
I could bleed for a smile, could die for a gun
Walk away from the sun and kill everyone

So tiny dancer beware
We're medicated and scared
This smile is so hard to wear
But I have no gun

So turn away from the ones who hurt everyone
I can tell by your smile you're coming undone
I could bleed for a smile; could die for a gun
Walk away from the sun and kill everyone
And you're fading with every day
You could've been the next one, should've been enough for me
And you're fading with every day
You could've been the next one, should've been enough for me
And you're fading with every day
You could've been the next one, should've been enough for me
And you're fading with every day

There's so much left in the air
So much to tell from a stare
There's so much left to defend
But I am no fun

Fading with every day
You could've been the next one, should've been enough for me
And you're fading with every day
You could've been the next one, should've been enough for me
And you're fading with every day
You could've been the next one, should've been enough for me
And you're fading with every day

(Walk away from the sun) And you're fading with every day
(Walk away from the sun) And you're fading with every day
(Walk away from the sun) And you're fading with every day
(Walk away from the sun) And you're fading with every dayEmbed
