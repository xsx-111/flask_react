Fallen Lyrics
She's wearing dresses on the borderline, looking again
Awaking senses that were lost in time, make amends
This liberation is the one they'll love for ages
Hey man, I seen it coming again
Just cut those dresses make you look so fine, you're a ten
Put on that shirt and you'll look so divine, I'm impressed
This generation won't forgive those signs of aging
Hey man, I seen it coming again

I got my ticket for the next makeover
I got my ticket for a stolen ride

I believe, I believe, I believe in the fallen
I believe, I believe, I believe in the calling

They got injections for the facial lines, make amends
Break out the scalpel keep the nose defined, look again
A crucifixion of the love we've known for ages
Hey man, I seen it coming again
You're much too pretty, you don't need your mind, just pretend
Just bat them eyelids get your heart's desires, make amends
A resurrection of the shallow and the vapid
Hey man, I seen it coming
I got my ticket for the next makeover
I lost my taste for this I'll keep my pride

I believe, I believe, I believe in the fallen
I believe, I believe, I believe in the calling
Reject!

I got my ticket for the next makeover
I lost my taste for this, I'll keep my pride

I believe, I believe, I believe in the fallen
I believe, I believe, I believe in the calling
I believe, I believe, I believe in the fallen
I believe, I believe, I believe in the callingEmbed
