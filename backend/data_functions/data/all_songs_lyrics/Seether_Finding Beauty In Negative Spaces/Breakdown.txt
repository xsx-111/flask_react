Breakdown Lyrics
The sun is gone and the flowers rot
Words are spaces between us
And I should have been drowned
In the rivers I found of token lost
And I should have been down
When you made me insecure

So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Oh, you can break me down if it takes all your might
Because I'm so much more
Than meets the eye

And I'm the one you can never trust
Because wounds are ways to reveal us
And yeah, I could have tried
And devoted my life to both of us
But what a waste of my time
When the world we have is yours

So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Oh, you can break me down if it takes all your might
Because I'm so much more
Than all your lies
Hate me, break me down
So break me down, down
So break me down

So break me down if it makes you feel right
And hate me now if it keeps you all right
Oh, you can't break me down if it takes all your might
Because I'm so much more
Than meets the eye9Embed
