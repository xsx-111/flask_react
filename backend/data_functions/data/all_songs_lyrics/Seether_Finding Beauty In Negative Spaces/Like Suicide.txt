Like Suicide Lyrics
Premeditation will kill the trust
They'll never know if you fear me
With every second collecting dust
I feel so bloated and weary
Because she belongs to heaven

She's coming over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Burn

She'll cut you down with a single thrust
She's taken over too quickly
No medication can cure the lust
So say a prayer for the sickly
Because she belongs to heaven

She's coming over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
As before
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time
You set me up to fucking fail this time

She's coming over like a suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another overbearing suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip

She's coming over wearing genocide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
Another complicating suicide
And it's the same old trip
The same old trip as before
As before5Embed
