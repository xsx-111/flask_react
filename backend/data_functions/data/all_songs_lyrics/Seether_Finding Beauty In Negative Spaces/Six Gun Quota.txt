Six Gun Quota Lyrics
I find it hard to live with all my choices
It's time to turn a deaf ear to those voices
Did you ever think to ask my opinion?
Did you ever think to ask if I'm okay?

I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a six gun quota
I've played down every feeling I've felt
And I bottled them up until the well ran over

Give every indication that you're mended
Take every rule you come across and bend it
And did you ever think to ask my opinion?
And did you ever think to ask if I'm okay?

I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a six gun quota
I've played down every feeling I've felt
And I bottled them up until the well ran over

It feels so good to be numb
I hate what I have become
It feels so good to be numb
I've burned down every bridge that I've found
Now I limit myself to a six gun quota
I've played down every feeling I've felt
And I bottled them up until the well ran over2Embed
