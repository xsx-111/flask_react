Rise Above This Lyrics
Take the light
And darken everything around me
Call the clouds
And listen closely, I'm lost without you

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

Hate the mind
Regrets are better left unspoken
For all we know
This void will grow and everything's
In vain
Distressing you though it leaves me open
Feels so right
But I'll end this all before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this doubt

I'll mend myself before it gets me
I'll mend myself before it gets me
I'll mend myself before it gets me
I'll mend myself before it gets me

Call your name every day
When I feel so helpless
I've fallen down
And I'll rise above this, rise above this
Forty eight ways to say
That I'm feeling helpless
I've fallen down, fallen down
But I'll rise above this, rise above this
Rise above this, rise above this doubt3Embed
