Fake It Lyrics
Who's to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way, yeah

Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
And good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

You should know that the lies won't hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way, yeah

Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
And good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just
Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

Whoa

I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake with the best of them all
I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake it all

Whoâ€™s to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self esteem along the way, yeah!

Good God, you're coming up with reasons
Good God, you're dragging it out
And good God, it's the changing of the seasons
I feel so raped, man, follow me down and just
Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite

Fake it if you're out of direction
Fake it if you don't belong here
Fake it if you feel like infection
Whoa, you're such a fucking hypocrite14Embed
