You Know More Than I Know Lyrics
But us, like other angry whores
Discuss what threats were made before
You don't need them anymore

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

Instead, I read the morning news in bed
What endlessness ahead
And there's no more to be said

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

The blind may see, but stay behind relief
Of all liability and greed
And there's nothing more you need

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know
No one listens to it
They don't believe it
But it's the only way for me

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

What crap, old chap, fills up the gap
We set like traps, like traps for us, the rats
And there's nothing more to catch

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know

Then bury me deep down among the weeds
That creep into the hearts of all the weak
And there's nothing more so weak

You know more than I know
You know more than I know
You know more than I know1Embed
