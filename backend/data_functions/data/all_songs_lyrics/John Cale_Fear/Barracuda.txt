Barracuda Lyrics
Dark woman in the water drowning
Sinking in a funny way
Black footing for a face exploding
Mimicking our final days
The ocean will have us all
The ocean will have us all

Dark woman in a cupboard burning
Woman, what have they done
Dark woman like a panther breathing
Woman, what can be done
The ocean will have us all
The ocean will have us all

Cold cost of the death of nothing
Slipping just like nothing did
Burnt scarecrow in the wind was choking
Smoking in the summer heat

Barracuda, barracuda
Won't you lay down your life for me
Won't you love me barracuda
If you always need to bring out the worst in me
Ten morons with their whistles blowing
Howling like a winter gale
Dark woman like a crow a-crowing
Crowing for the carrion meat
And the ocean will have us all
The ocean will have us all

Dark forest with the moon arising
Smiling at you out of reach
Cracked window in a chapel dreaming
Hoping for the twain to meet

Barracuda, barracuda
Won't you lay down your life for me
Won't you love me barracuda
If you always need to bring out the worst in meEmbed
