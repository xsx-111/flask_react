Emily Lyrics
Oh Emily, I'd love to be
Down by the sea with you
Having tea with you
Walking hand in hand
On the shifting sands
Maybe we'll love again
Maybe we'll love again

Soon the time will come
When we must say
Goodbye my dear dear friend
Till we meet again
Though I'm far away
I'll still hear you say
Maybe we'll love again
Maybe we'll love again

Hold my hand
On the sand
Say once more
Like before

Maybe we'll love again
Maybe we'll love again
Maybe we'll love again1Embed
