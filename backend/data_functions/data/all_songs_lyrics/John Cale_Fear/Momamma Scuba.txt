Momamma Scuba Lyrics
Scuba woman done me slow
Scuba woman done me low
Love you
Skin turn to slime

Hold me slow and done me down
Take me with you, done me down
Love you
Skin done me down

Scuba mama sink me down
Love your sinking, hold me down
Love you so much
Skin will drown and drown

Soul in deep, deep ocean water
We hide in the cool, cool shade
Seeking, reaping
Make it only, baby, only
Sleeping the pain away

Well, hug me close and stuff me tight
Quick is quick and knife is knife
In my crumbled shape a chance momamma scuba dance
Dance, dance
Love me brave, my love's on fire
Crack the magnet of desire
Push me further, straight along
I'll still be here when mama's gone
Don't you love me, my skin woman
Love you, my skin can dry1Embed
