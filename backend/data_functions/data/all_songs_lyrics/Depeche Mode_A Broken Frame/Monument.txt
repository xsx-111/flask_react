Monument Lyrics
When the site was found we laid the foundations down
It didn't take long before they came back tumbling down
Don't build at night, you need a little light
How else are you going to see what it's gonna be like?

So we picked up our tools and we worked in the morning light
With the last stone placed wasn't it a wonderful sight?
But it fell back down and scattered all around
Anything passes when you need glasses

My monument, it fell down
My monument, it fell down
My monument, it fell down
My monument, it fell down

Work all of my days for this kind of praise
Work all of my days for this kind of praise
It fell down
Work all of my days
It fell down
Work all of my days
It fell down
Work all of my days
It fell down2Embed
