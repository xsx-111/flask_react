See You Lyrics
(All I wanna do is...)
(All I wanna do is...)
(All I wanna do is...)
(All I wanna do is...)

All I want to do is see you again
Is that too much to ask for?
I just want to see your sweet smile
Smiled the way it was before
Well, I'll try not to hold you and I'll try not to kiss you
And I won't even touch you

All I wanna do is see you
Don't you know that it's true?

I remember the days when we walked through the woods
We'd sit on a bench for a while
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play
And look in each other's eyes
You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance
But I swear I won't touch you
All I wanna do is see you
Don't you know that it's true?

Well I know five years is a long time
And that times change (That times change)
But I think that you'll find
People are basically the same (Basically the same)

If the water's still flowing, we can go for a swim
And do the things we used to do
And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in
And we can relive our youth
Ah, but we'll just stay friendly like sister and brother
Though I think I still love you

All I wanna do is see you
Don't you know that it's true?
All I wanna do is see you
Don't you know that it's true?

All I wanna do is... (See you)
All I wanna do is... (See you)
All I wanna do is... (See you)
All I wanna do is... (See you)
All I wanna do is... (See you)
All I wanna do is... (See you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)
All I wanna do is... (See you, see you, see you)2Embed
