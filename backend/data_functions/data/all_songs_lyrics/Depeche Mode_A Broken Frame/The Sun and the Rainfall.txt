The Sun and the Rainfall Lyrics
Someone will call, something will fall
And smash on the floor
Without reading the text know what comes next
Seen it before and it's painful

Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them
All that I'm saying
A game's not worth playing
Over and over again

You're the one I like best, you retain my interest
You're the only one
If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do
Unpredictable like the sun and the rainfall

Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them
All that I'm saying
The game's not worth playing
Over and over again
Things must change
Things must change
Things must change
Things must change
(If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do)
(Unpredictable like the sun and the rainfall)
Things must change
(Someone will call, something will fall)
(And smash on the floor)
Things must change
(Without reading the text know what comes next)
(Seen it before and it's painful)
Things must change
(You're the one I like best, you retain my interest)
(You're the only one)
Things must change
(If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do)
(Unpredictable like the sun and the rainfall)
Things must change
(Someone will call, something will fall)
(And smash on the floor)
Things must change
(Without reading the text know what comes next)
(Seen it before and it's painful)
Things must change
(You're the one I like best, you retain my interest)
(You're the only one)
Things must change
(If it wasn't for you, don't know what I'd do)
(Unpredictable like the sun and the rainfall)
Things must change
(Someone will call, something will fall)
(And smash on the floor)
Things must change
(Without reading the text know what comes next...)3Embed
