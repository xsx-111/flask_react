The Stall Lyrics
"Cool, let's try!"

Want to calm you down
Like I could once in your life
Want to settle all your worries
How to make you feel alright?
And you think it's getting helpless
Like there's just no getting through
But I won't give up on you
But I won't give up on you
But I won't give up on you
But I won't give up on you
Though I think you want me to

And when you wake up so afraid
That the only way to be brave
Is to give 'em a strong face
Don't you know who you're letting down?
Play it soft, trust your time
Shake it off
Everybody's got the same
Got the same shedding skin
Letting go's not giving in
Letting go's not giving in
Letting go's not giving in
So break down
You know, you need, you want to
Break out
Follow your lead, you got you, no doubt
You know, you need, you want to
Break out
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it

Want to calm you down
Like I could once in your life
Want to settle all your worries
Gonna make you feel alright
Settle all your worries
Gonna make you feel alright
Settle all your worries
I get high when I'm low
I get wrong when I know

So break down
You know, you need, you want to
Break out
Follow your lead, you got you, no doubt
You know, you need, you want to
Break out
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it
(Break down)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(You know you want to break out)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(You know you want to break down)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(To break out)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(Break down)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(You know you want to break out)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(You know you want to break down)
Love is a, love is a place for it
(To break down)
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it
Love is a, love is a place for it2Embed
