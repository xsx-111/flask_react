So Good LyricsYou're too much, I can't take it
You always seem to make my heart stop and
I can tell that there's something in your eyes
Calling me
I want you now
I want you all over me
Can't you tell me all your secrets?
I'll tell you all mine
I'll tell you all mine
Saw you all alone
On the outside
I knew your move
Do you remember me?
The same way I do you?
I want you, open wide
Can't you tell me all your secrets?
I'll tell you all mine
I'll tell you all mine
So good
Soo good
So good
Soo good
So good
Soo good
So good
Soo good
Goin' out of my mind
I'm handlin' it
Goin' out of my mind
I'm handlin' it
You're good, you're good, you're good
I'm handlin' it
So good, so good, so good
I'm handlin' it
You're good, you're good, you're good
I'm handlin' it
So good, so good, so good
I'm handlin' it2Embed
