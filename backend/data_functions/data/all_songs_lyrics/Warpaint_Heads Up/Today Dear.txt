Today Dear LyricsToday, dear
Today
I saw my blood drawn out
Saw my flood run dry
I have no fear, my dear
Today
No moment will pass me by
Why would you want this right now
When you can see them giving up?
Why would you give up right now
When you can stay and fight?
I've wandered these places
And often I found not
Anyone in front of me
Or anyone around
Always giving up
Always giving up
Stay and fight
Why would you want this right now?
When you're the one, the one, the one who
Opens my eyes just in time
To read exactly what yours are saying
I'll never fit this body just right
There's no use in lacing up
What'll just be untied
Holding on was ever alright
Tonight we'll break the ice
Tonight would be the night
I'm not saving my face I'm not lying
I'm not saving my face I'm not lyingEmbed
