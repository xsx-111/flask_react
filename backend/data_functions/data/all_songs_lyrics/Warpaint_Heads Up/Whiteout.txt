Whiteout Lyrics
You wouldn't know it but you're really in your prime
Is there a question not answered in your mind?
Before you know the answer, you're running out of time
There is an anchor, I'll put it in my heart
You gotta do what's right for you, and do it from the start
Even when they wonder, they wonder where you are
You know what I want
To know the secrets in your heart
And now I keep it low
There's just some things I don't need to know

Don't go tonight
Don't go tonight

You oughta know it, but it happens all the time
Is there a question? You treat it like a crime
And in the walls you weaken, and out the walls you climb
Oh, why is it not all that it seems?
You lock it up so easily
I wanna believe all that you say to me
Ooooh
You know what I want
To rip it open and pull it out
And we'll take it low
There's just some things I don't need to know
Don't go tonight
Don't go tonight

White out
You want it, you want it out
White out
You want it, you want it all out
White out
You want it, you wanted it out
White out

Tonight
Don't go tonight

You don't console me, though I'm transparent for you
Feel like I'm asking, always asking if your feelings are true
I'm focused on the wrong
I'm focused on the wrong
But I feel like you wanted me to5Embed
