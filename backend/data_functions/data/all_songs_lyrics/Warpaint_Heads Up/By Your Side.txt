By Your Side LyricsYou know
You know
You know just what you're doing
Admit it
A wildcard with years to talk?
You know
She'll think she knew it all along
She'll lie, she's a liar
Who didn't want to face your front
But doesn't need to be some price
You're vulnerable, don't compromise
For anyone
The only speaking words
Maybe someone
Who dares not to know
Did you come undone?
Did you become someone I know?
Did you come undone?
Did you become someone I know?
Now I know I'm not alone
Got my girls, I'm not alone
Now I know I'm not alone
Got my girls, I'm not alone
Love you for days, I'm not alone
You're the place that I belong
Got my girls, I'm not alone
Not alone
You know
You know
You know just what you're doing
Admit it
A wildcard with  years to talk?
You know
She'll think she knew it all alone
She'll lie, she's a liar
Who didn't want to face your front
But doesn't need to be some price
You're vulnerable, don't compromise
Love (love)
For anyone
Now I know I'm not alone
Got my girls, I'm not alone
Now I know I'm not alone
Got my girls, I'm not alone
Love you for days, I'm not alone
You're the place that I belong
Got my girls, I'm not alone
Not alone1Embed
