New Song Lyrics
You come along, you come along
And wash away the rain
You are the sun, you are the sun
That leads me back to where I belong
Where I come from
Because of you, I know where I belong

You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me

I was, I was, I was so wrong
To think, to think that it was wrong for me
I want, I want it, I want it all
I want, I want, I want it all so sweet
You got the moves, you got the moves
You got the moves, bang bang baby
You got the moves, you got the moves

I have never felt this strong
Dancing to you all night long
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me

Eyes, you’ve got the style
You’ve got the eyes, eyes
Eyes, you’ve got the style
You’ve got the eyes (dancing to you all night long)
Dancing to you all night long
Dancing to you all night long
(You're a new song
You're a new song, baby)
Dancing to you all night long
(You're a new song to me)
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me
You're a new song
You're a new song, baby
You're a new song to me5Embed
