Dre LyricsBody's asking for it
Calling for it
Anyone around me
Calling for love I guess
A compliment
To me
Did we call it in before
In the times when we were new
Was it love's design before us
To have us in mind
I wonder these things
Waiting
You sure look good, sure look good
You sure look good, now don't you baby
And it does feel good, does feel good
And it does feel good, now don't it baby
(Bitch I got you
Bitch I got you)
Body's calling on it
Asking for it
Everyone around me
Trying for love again
A compliment
To me
Did we call it in before
In the times when we were new
Was it love's design before us
To have us in mind
I wonder these days
Waiting
You sure look good, and a sun comes up
You sure look good, now don't you baby
And it does feel good, does feel good
And it does feel good, now don't it baby
(Bitch I got you
Bitch I got you)
You sure look good, now don't you baby
And it does feel good
You sure look good, now don't you baby
And the sun comes up
And the lights go down
You sure feel good, sure feel good
You sure feel good, now don't you babyEmbed
