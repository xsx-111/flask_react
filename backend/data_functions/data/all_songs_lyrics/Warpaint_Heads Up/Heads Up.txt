Heads Up LyricsMy love
How've you been?
My love
Turn around
Put your head up
Then turn around
I'm not scared
I know, I know
I know why
I know, I know
I know why
You got me one way
Turn around
You remind me of our son
All brought up on my own
You make me other ways
You burn the eyes on my alright
I know, I know
I know why
I know, I know
I know why
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
Now it's awkward
Always awkward
Always awkward
Always awkward
Tell me you're not around
Then you're asking me to be alright
(In in in in, out out)
(Go in in in in, out out)
Always, always
Always down
I know, I know
I know why
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
And it's okay, it's okay, it's okay
Got to keep my mind at ease
Got to keep my head up
Got to keep my mind at ease
Got to keep my head up

It's alright, I know, I know why
It's alright, I know, I know whyEmbed
