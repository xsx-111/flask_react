Above Control LyricsAbove control
Above control
Above control
Above control
I like you here
I like you out
It brings me joy
You fit in mine
I love to sow
I have for so
Very long
I want to know
To see the low
It's getting madder than you know
I wanna know
See it now
I love, I love, I love, I love
No
I love, I love, I love, I love
Above control
Above control
With the waking eyes
Something I can't live without
I wanna say it, but I don't
Who's my idol now?
Something gotta take me out to be above control
Say it
Get outta my life
Get outta my life
Get outta my life
Cut me out
Get outta my life
Get outta my life
Get outta my life
And send me
And send me
And send me
Above control
Above control
Coming up, see it, coming up
Now you see me walking on
Somebody see if you, Somebody see if you mind
Get out, get out, get out, get out
Above control
Above control
Above control
Have you seen me walking on solid?
Have you seen me walking on solid?
Have you seen me walking on solid?
Have you seen me walking on solid ground?Embed
