Girl in the Moon LyricsYou got a long face, no place
Everywhere a bad case of nowhere news
And the weather man telling me
All of the time
" ... looks like rain ... "
Put on my Cadillac boots
And my magazine jeans
Though the colours don't rhyme
And I won't stop walking
'til I turn the blue world upside down
I say "Hey!"
To the girl in the moon
There's a mad clock ticking
Inside of my brain
And it might just explode
I got a subway running
Right over my roof
I can't hear a sound
And there's Bayman and Robin
Leaking into my room
Through a hole in the wall
And there's Jane and Tarzan
With their favourite monkey
... what's his name?
I say Hey! to the girl in the moon
There's a mad clock ticking
Inside of my brain
And the colours don't rhyme
I'm gonna stand here waiting
'til the girl in the moon
Comes back down
I say "Hey!"
To the girl in the moonEmbed
