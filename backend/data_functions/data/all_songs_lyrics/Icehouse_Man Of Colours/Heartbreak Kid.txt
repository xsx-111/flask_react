Heartbreak Kid LyricsDusty wind blew 'cross the high plains
As the stranger rode into town
With a certain reputation
For the ladies and the gun
Walked to the barstool casual
Just as easy as you please
He was bound to do some damage
With those valetino eyes
Well, the barmaid was an angel
And she looked so out of place
And she said her name was 'Sunset'
She was different from the rest
And she couldn't help but notice
As he walked through the door
That the gunman was something special
And the bullet found it's score
And that one mistake you make is just enough
And that one mistake is, "Boy... you talk too tough"
Only takes a single bullet
To bring the fastest trigger down
Only takes a pretty woman
Put a gunman underground
And you may here the same old story
In ev'ry town on ev'ry street
The story of 'Sunset' and the
Heartbreak kid
Dirty rain soaked through a doorway
Of an upper westside bar
And the TV news was talking
To the crowd of people there
'... well the kid was always reckless
He said, "I never stay to long..."
.. and when she knew that he would leave her
Sunset shot that gunman down...'
And that one mistake you make is just enough
And that one mistake is, "Boy... you talk too tough"
Only takes a single bullet
To bring the fastest trigger down
Only takes a pretty woman
Put a gunman underground
And you may here the same old story
In ev'ry town on ev'ry street
The story of 'Sunset' and the
