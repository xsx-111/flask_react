Nothing Too Serious LyricsTwenty storey buildings coming down on me
Mountain ranges sliding into the sea
Rivers of blood running red
I've got a broken heart and a broken head (head head head)
I've got a broken heart and a broken head
I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious
Well i shook myself and i feel out of bed
I can't remember a thing or was it something i said
And i don't know my name and i don't know my place
And there's a crack in the mirror, cracking my face (face face face)
(Baby is blue) she had a heavy night
(Baby is blue) she's gonna be all right
(Baby is blue) she'll never the same
You better take her home
I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious
(Instrumental Break)
I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious
I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious
I had a little accident
Nothing too serious
Take a look at this place take a look at this mess
Nothing too serious
If you close your eyes it may go away
Nothing too serious
We can do it again some other day
Nothing too serious
Nothing too serious (is that right?)Embed
