Crazy Lyrics
0:00 - 0:18

I've got a pocket
Full of holes
Head in the clouds
The king of fools
You've got a ribbon of rainbows
The sun in your eyes
Burning through
Could be I'm happy, I'm sad
Could be I'm losing my head
Over you

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby (woh, woh)
To want a guy like me (woh, woh)
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
(out of your mind) (woh, woh)
Crazy

So, if I'm dreaming
Don't wake me tonight
If this is all wrong, I don't want it right
'Cause you're the one sure thing when I get lost in the game
Once again
Hey, I'm a lucky guy without a reason and I
Don't understand
Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby (woh, woh)
To want a guy like me
(guy like me) (woh, woh)
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
(out of your mind) (woh, woh)
Crazy (crazy crazy crazy) (woh, woh)

Well, there must be some kind of mistake (woh, woh)
To give your heart away
(give your heart away) (woh, woh)
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
(out of your mind) (woh, woh)
Crazy

2:12 - 2:29

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby (woh, woh)
To want a guy like me
(guy like me) (woh, woh)
Yeah, you've gotta be out of your mind
(out of your mind) (woh, woh)
Crazy (crazy crazy crazy)
Well there must be some kind of mistake
(woh, woh)
To fall in love with me
(fall in love with me) (woh, woh)
Yeah you gotta be out of your mind
(out of your mind) (woh, woh)
You're crazy
Crazy

Well, you've gotta be crazy, baby (woh, woh)
To want a guy like me
(guy like me)
Yeah, you've gotta be crazy baby1Embed
