The Kingdom LyricsOne of those days
That just comes and goes
It's not so special
She watches the birds
That rest on a ledge
Outside her room
The wallpaper old and faded
A crack in the window pane
The radio just keeps playing
Playing that same old song
She smiles to herself
"they think that i'm strange...
...they say I'm a dreamer
...but I don't complain
Though I don't have much
To call my own."
And she's not a movie star, no
And she's not a beauty queen
She'll tell you it doesn't matter
'cause she's not the only one
She says
"I know a place
Where I keep the best of things
I'm not gonna wait
For my piece of heaven
Where there's a road
It leads to the promised land
I just turn the key
The key to the
...kingdom..."
She stares at the page
Of a new magazine, the morning papers
She walks into town
And catches a show
If she can find the time
And she's not a movie star, no
And she's not a beauty queen
She'll tell you it doesn't matter
'cause she's not the only one
She says
"I know a place
Where I keep the best of things
I'm not gonna wait
For my piece of heaven
Where there's a road
It leads to the promised land
I just turn the key
The key to the
...kingdom..."Embed
