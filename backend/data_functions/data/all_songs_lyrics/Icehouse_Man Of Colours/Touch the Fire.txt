Touch the Fire LyricsShe moves like a mystic
Like a priestess, tall and pale
She lays down the mystery
All her secrets are unveiled
Wherever I look, I see her there
Wherever I go, you know she's there
And she takes posession, she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes ahold
Next to you I can touch the fire
Her words fall in echos
Ringing bells like gypsy rhymes
She has the power
No believer can explain
Wherever I look, I see her there
Wherever I go, you know she's there
CHORUS
And she takes posession, she has control
Next to you I can touch the fire
And when the fever takes ahold
Next to you I can touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fire
Wherever I look I see her there
Wherever I go you know she's there
CHORUS
She takes posession
Touch the fire
Touch the fire
I feel the heat pumping in my veins
Next to you I can touch the fire
I see myself going up in flames
Next to you I can touch the fireEmbed
