Over My Head LyricsYou say it’s easy
If you really want to see
You say I always turn and walk away
You say there’s no mystery
It’s a simple fact of life
It’s gonna slap you in the face one day
I don’t want to know, hey
I don’t want to know, hey
Funny, but I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
When you tell me so many lies
The words go straight over my head

It doesn’t mean a single thing to me
I don’t want to know, hey
I don’t want to know, hey
Funny, but I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
I feel like a cloud in the sky
The sun streaming over my head
I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
When you get that crazy look in your eyes
Bells ringing over my head
You say there’s no mystery
It’s a simple fact of life
Baby, we'd just slap you in the face one day
I don’t want to know, hey
I don’t want to know, hey
Funny, but I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
I feel like a cloud in the sky
The sun streaming over my head
I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
When you get that crazy look in your eyes
Bells ringing over my head
I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
When you tell me so many lies
The words go straight over my head
I can’t seem to understand (over my head)
I can't seem to understand
I can't...Embed
