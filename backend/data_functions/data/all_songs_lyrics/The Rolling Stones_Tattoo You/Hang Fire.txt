Hang Fire Lyrics
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo-doop, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo-doop, doo-doop

In the sweet old country where I come from
Nobody ever works, nothing ever gets done
We hang fire, we hang fire
You know marrying money is a full time job
I don't need the aggravation, I'm a lazy slob
I hang fire, I hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire, baby
I hang fire, hang fire
Put it on the wire, baby
Go ahead, hang fire

We've got nothing to eat, we got nowhere to work
Nothing to drink, we just lost our shirts
I'm on the dole, we ain't for hire
Say what the hell, say what the hell, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire, baby
Hang fire, hang fire, hang fire, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire, baby
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo-doop, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo-doop, doo-doop (Hang fire, hang fire, hand fire)
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop (Hang fire, hang fire)
Doo-doop, doo-doop (Throw it on the wire)
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo-doop, doo-doop
Yeah, take a thousand dollars, go have some fun
Put it all on a hundred-to-one, hang fire
Hang fire, hang fire, put it on the wire, baby
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop
Doo, doo, doo-doop (Hang fire, hang fire)
Doo-doop, doo-doop (Put it on the wire)
Doo, doo, doo-doop (Hang fire, hang fire)
Doo, doo, doo-doop (Hang fire)
Doo, doo, doo-doop (Put it on the wire)
Doo-doop, doo-doop (Put it on the wire)1Embed
