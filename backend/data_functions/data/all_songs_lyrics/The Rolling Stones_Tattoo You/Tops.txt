Tops Lyrics
Hey baby
Every man is the same come on
I'll make you a star
I'll take you a million miles from all this
Put you on a pedestal
Come on, come on

Have you ever heard those opening lines?
You should leave this small town way behind
I'll be your partner, show you the steps
With me behind your tasting of the sweet wine of success

'Cause I'll, I'll take you to the top, baby
Hey baby
I'll take you to the top
I'll take you the top, baby
I'll take you to the top

Step on the ladder, toe in the pool
You're such a natural you don't need no acting school
Don't need no casting couch or be a star in bed
Never, never let success go to your pretty head
'Cause I, I'll take you to the top, baby
I swear we'll never going to stop, baby
I'll take you to the top

Don't let the world pass you by
Don't let the world pass you by
Don't let the world pass you by
You take your chance now baby
Or be sorry for the rest of your sweet loving life, baby

Oh, sugar
Hey sugar, I'll take you to the top
I'll take you to the top
Yeah, I'll take you to the top, sugar
I'll take you to the top, come on baby
Ay yi yi yi, yi yi
Ay yi yi yi, yi yi
I'll take you to the top
I'll take you to the top
I'll take you to the top
I'll take you to the topEmbed
