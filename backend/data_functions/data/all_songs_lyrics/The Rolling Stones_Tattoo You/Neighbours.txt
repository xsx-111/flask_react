Neighbours Lyrics
Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours

Neighbours
Have I got neighbours?
Have I got neighbours?
All-day and all night

Neighbours
Have I got neighbours?
Ringing my doorbells
All day and all night

Ladies
Have I got crazies?
Screaming young babies
No peace and no quiet

I got T.V.'s
Saxophone playing
Groaning and straining
With the trouble and strife
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight?

But neighbours
Do unto strangers
Do unto neighbours
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself


Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
Is it any wonder
That we fuss and fight?

Neighbours
Do unto strangers
Do unto neighbours
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself, yourself
Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours, neighbours


Neighbours, neighbours, neighbours, neighbours

Neighbours
Do yourself a favour
Don't you mess with my baby
When I'm working all night

You know that neighbours
Steal off my table
Steal off my table
And doing alright, alright, alright, alright

Neighbours
Do unto strangers
Do unto strangers
What you do to yourself, yourself, yourself
Yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours, yours
AlrightEmbed
