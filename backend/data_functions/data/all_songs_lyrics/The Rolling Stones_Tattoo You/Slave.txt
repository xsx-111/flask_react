Slave LyricsDo it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
24 four hours a day
Hey, why don't you go down to the supermarket
Get something to eat
Steal something off the shelves
Pass by the liquor store, be back about a quarter to 12?
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave - baby I...
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave - I got to...
Don't want to be your slave
Got to go, got to go, got to go, got to go
Got to, got to, got to go
Yeah baby, yeah baby
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave
Don't want to be your slave, yeah
Don't do it
Don't let them do it, no, no
Don't, don't...
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no - ow
No, no, babe, ow... no
Ah ha ha ha
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do itEmbed
