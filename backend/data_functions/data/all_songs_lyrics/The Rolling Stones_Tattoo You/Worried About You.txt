Worried About You Lyrics
Sometime I wonder why you do these things to me
Sometime I worry, girl, that you ain't in love with me
Sometime I stay out late, yeah, I'm having fun
Yes, I guess you know by now that you ain't the only one
Yeah-hey, oh baby, ooh, sweet things that you promised me babe
They seemed to go up in smoke, yeah, vanish like a dream
Baby, I wonder why you do these things to me

Because I'm worried
Yeah, I just can't seem to find my way
Baby

Ooh, the nights I spent just waiting for the sun, yeah
Just like your burned out cigarette, you threw away my love
Why did you do that girl?
I wonder why, why you do these things to me?

Well, oh I'm worried
Lord, I'll find out anyway
Sure goin' to find myself a girl someday
Till then I'm worried
Yeah, I just can't seem to find my way
Ooh ooh

Yeah, I'm a hard workin' man, when did I ever do you wrong, huh?
Yeah, I get all my money, baby, yeah yeah, I bring it,  Ii bring it all home
Yeah, I'm tellin' the truth, yeah, well
Sweet things, the sweet things, Lord that you promised me

Well, I'm worried
Ay, I just can't seem to find my way

Baby, ah, ah, I'm worried about you, yeah
I'm worried about you, yeah
Tell you something now
I'm worried about you, oh yeah
Worried about you, child, oh yeah
I'm worried about you, woman, oh yeah
Come on, tell you somethin' now
I'm worried about you, child, oh yeah, yeah
Worried about you, yeah oh yeah
Yeah, I'm worried
Lord, I'll find out anyway
Sure as hell burns I'm going to find that girl someday
Oh I'm worried
Lord, I just can't seem to find my wayEmbed
