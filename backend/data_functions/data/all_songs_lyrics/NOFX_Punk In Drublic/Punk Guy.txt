Punk Guy Lyrics
Crazier than GG
More PC than Ian
Got colored teeth like Johnny
Exudes a vicious disposition
His hair sticks out like Colin's did, he jumps
Similar to Springa, yeah
He points his middle finger

Not just the singer in the band
Voted biggest asshole
And role model of the year
Got a face like Charles Bronson
Straight outta Green Bay, Wisconsin
Not just a singer in the band

He'll puke on you
He'll fuck your mom
He'll smoke while huffing gas
He was the punkest mother fucker I ever did see
"Ah hell, he's even more punk than me"
He should've been on the cover
He should've been on the cover
He should've been on the cover of Punk and Disorderly, yeahEmbed
