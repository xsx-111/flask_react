Dying Degree Lyrics
Dresser drawers are filled with pocket change
Coupons cut smoked to the butt
Is this what dreams are made?
Adding up, subtracting down, you find
Yourself sucking the rind

Dying degree
Graying amie

Final payment made, had you forgot
The rightful owner of one deluxe cemetery plot?
Paisley satin lined, how apropos
What a better way to go?

Dying degree
Graying amie


No more eating crumbs
When my pension finally comes
You kids won't eat mush anymore 'round me
Dying degree
Graying amie

Dying...Embed
