The Brews Lyrics
Friday night, we'll be drinking Manischewitz
Going out to terrorize Goyim
Stomping shagitz, screwing shiksas
As long as we're home by Saturday morning

'Cause hey, we're the Brews
Sporting anti-swastika tattoos
Oi-oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, Hasidic, OG Ois

Orthopedic Doctor Martens good for
Waffle making, kicking through the shin
Reputation gained through intimidation
Pacifism no longer tradition

'Cause hey, we're the Brews
Sporting anti-swastika tattoos
Oi-oi, we're the Brews
The fairfax ghetto boys skinhead Hebrews

We got the might, psycho mashuganas
We can't lose a fight, as we are the chosen ones
Chutzpah driven, we battle, then we feast
We celebrate, we'll separate our milkplates from our meat
Oi-oi, we're the Brews
Sporting anti-swastika tattoos
Oi-oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, Hasidic, OG Ois

Come on, ya schmucks, no more playing for 
Oi-oi, we're the Brews
Sporting anti-swastika tattoos
Oi-oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, Hasidic, OG Ois
Oi-oi, we're the Brews
Sporting anti-swastika tattoos
Oi-oi, we're the boys
Orthodox, Hasidic, OG Ois1Embed
