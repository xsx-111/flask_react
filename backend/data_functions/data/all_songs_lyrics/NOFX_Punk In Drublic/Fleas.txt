Fleas Lyrics
Father used to say, "You sleep with dogs, the next day
You'll wake at midnight scratching those inevitable fleas"
At ten years old, you listen to what you're told
I never had the itch, I never would

Mother had forbidden me to waste away my life
"I want you to have all the things I could never buy you
Don't stop what I've begun, you're my one my only son
Follow what I say, not what I've done"
"Follow what I say, not what I've done"
"Shower, scrub, and shave, cleanly boys don't misbehave
Follow what I say, not what I've done"Embed
