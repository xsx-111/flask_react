Lori Meyers Lyrics
Lori Meyers used to live upstairs
Our parents had been friends for years
Almost every afternoon, we'd play forbidden games
At nine years old, there's no such shame
It wasn't recognition of her face, what brought me back
Was a familiar mark as it flashed across the screen
I bought some magazines, some video taped scenes
Incriminating acts I felt that I could save

Who the hell are you to tell me how to live?
You think I sell my body, I merely sell my time
I ain't no Cinderella, I ain't waiting for no prince to save me
In fact, until just now, I was doin' just fine
And on and on
I know what degradation feels like, I felt it on the floor
At the factory where I worked long before
I took control, now I answer to me
The 50k I make this year will go anywhere I please
Where's the problem?Embed
