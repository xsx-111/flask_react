Reeko Lyrics
Reeko, try and understand
It really is that bad
It won't just go away
The party's over
It's past two o'clock
It's about time we stopped
'Cause I see the keg has been sucked dry
Cisco emptied into the aquarium
The fish all seem to float
The ex lax lines the dog bowl
The toilet's overflowed
We've had our fun, so
There's nothing left
We got no place left to go


Mr. President, please understand
It really is that bad
It won't just go away
It's just beginning
The ballots have been cast
We make like seaward rats
Leave this sinking ship
Leave and not look back
Things we never tried to disallow
Have come back to haunt us now
With apple pie and Chevrolet
We've come to see the end
We all made this bed
Now we got nowhere to lay
Decent gentlemen
Try and understandEmbed
