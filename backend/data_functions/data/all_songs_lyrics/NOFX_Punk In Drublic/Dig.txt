Dig Lyrics
Rationalize values, it's so easy to succeed
Keeping your eyes on the prize, excess, success

Camped outside laissez-faire
People understand me there
Don't talk to me, we'll get along just fine
Blowing out your mores
Henry Ford tradition preys
On idle minds, left the emergency
Brake on too long

Underneath the city lies the ruins of mankind

The excavation was a financial
Success with artifacts of gold
The arrowheads went straight to the Smithsonian
The rest was melted down and sold

Substantial gains, minimal losses are tolerable
As long as the machine keeps running on
Cannibals functioning on pheromones
Rational thought lost to instinctualEmbed
