Jeff Wears Birkenstocks Lyrics
Don't wanna chill, don't wanna sit
Don't wanna hear no hippie shit
Don't tell me I'm closing my mind
Don't wanna groove, don't wanna dig
Don't wanna spend the day naked
Don't like my music country-fried

He's got a tye-dyed Rancid shirt
Wears his Birkenstocks to work
Is he a jerk? No, just confused
Jeff don't wear regular shoes

Fat Mike, I gotta let you know
It's not the tunes, it's their live show
And all the people you get to meet
Plenty of good vibes and decent drugs
Stinky people give you hugs
Walk around in your bare feet

He's got a tye-dyed Rancid shirt
Wears his Birkenstocks to work
Is he a jerk? No, just confused
Jeff don't wear regular
Shoe-ooh-ooh-oohs
Shoe-ooh-ooh-oohs
Shoe-ooh-ooh-oohs
Shoe-ooh-oohs
Jeff don't wear regular shoes1Embed
