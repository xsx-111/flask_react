The Cause Lyrics
Isn't for the money
No, it isn't for the fun
It's a plan, a scam, a diagram
It's for the benefit of everyone
You gotta have a little respect
Subterranean ideals
Traditional neglect
Reflect on how it makes you feel

The cause, we're just doing it for the cause

No, it isn't for the fortune
It isn't for the fame
It's a scheme, a dream, a barterine
We want everyone to think the same
'Cause you know what you know is right
And you feel what you can't ignore
And you try so hard to point the blame
Ashamed, what are we doing this for?

The cause, we're just doing it for the cause
The cause, we're just doing it for the cause
Open your eyes
Don't trust, these lies
What are we doing this for?

The cause, we're just doing it for the cause
The cause, we're just doing it for the causeEmbed
