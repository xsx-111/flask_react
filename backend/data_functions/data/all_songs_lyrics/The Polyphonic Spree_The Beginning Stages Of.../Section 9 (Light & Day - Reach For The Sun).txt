Section 9 (Light & Day / Reach For The Sun) LyricsLight
And day
Is more than you'll say
Cause all
My Feelings
Are more
Than I can let by
Or not
It's more than you've got
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the SUN!
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're done
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Reach for the bright side
You don't see me fly into the red - one more you're nuts
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the SUN!
You don't see me fly into the red â€" one more you're done
Just follow the seasons and find the time
Reach for the bright side
You don't see me fly into the red â€" one more you're nuts
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the SUN!
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the SUN!
Just follow the day
Follow the day and reach for the SUN!Embed
