Section 4 (La La) LyricsLa-la, la-la, la-la-la...
If you walk out and face a good day
Somehow the look seems to fall off your face
Wonder whose finding this all a game
Bet they're slipping down into decay
La-la, la-la, la-la-la...
La-la, la-la, la-la-la...
Somehow you fall down, you pick up the ground
Keep all the message and make it your sound
Why not, what not, slip into ice
If you want more, take some advice
La-la, la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-laEmbed
