Section 7 (Hanging Around the Day Part 2) LyricsWell, you like what you're given
A lot of us are standing in line
And you find that you're missing
What others thought you had all the time
And it's high but you're reaching
The trees are getting harder to climb
So you try to begin there
Cause life is such a wonderful slide
You're hanging around the day
You're fooling yourself with blame
You're taking it all to a future sight
Hanging around the day, but God only knows what you're missing
Well, you know where you're going
And knowing is a comfortable fight
And your wish is pretending
To slightly move over the light
And you sigh at the rainbow
That's coming from the other side
And you slide with the message
This trouble seems to give me some life
You're hanging around the day
You're fooling yourself with blame
You're taking it all to a future sight
Hanging around the day
You're hanging around the day
You're fooling yourself with blame
You're taking it all to a future sight
Hanging around the dayEmbed
