Junior Saw It Happen LyricsMy sweet child was seen across town
With some stranger man
She had a smile on her face
Looked out of place
Suitcase was in her hand
Junior saw it happen
Why didn't I listen to you, hey
Whoa, ohh
Whoa, put your hat on back
Whoa, ohh
Whoa, now she's down the tracks with him
I remember on the day she left me
That's one thing I'll never forget
In the apartment we owned
All she left was a phone
And a broken down TV set
Junior saw it happen
Why didn't I listen to you, hey
Whoa, ohh
Whoa, put your hat on back
Whoa, na na na na na
Whoa, now she's down the tracks with him
Didn't believe it when I first got word
But boy, I sure do now
I couldn't face it, my mind wouldn't take it
It didn't make sense somehow
Because I thought you was happy
With the way we lived
And the things that we used to do
Whoa, no no no
Whoa, put your hat on back
Whoa, no no no no
Whoa, now she's down the tracks with himEmbed
