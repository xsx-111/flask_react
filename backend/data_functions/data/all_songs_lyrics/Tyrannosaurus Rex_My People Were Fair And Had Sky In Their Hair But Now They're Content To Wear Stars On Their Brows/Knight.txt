Knight LyricsNight comes down just like a giant umbrella
Slows me down, got to get it together
Saxophone sage plays upon her doorstep
Evening's lies are dying all around him
Head of plumes and crimson ostrich feathers
8th Hussars' manners gush out of my bloodstream, my queen
Clad in drag of oriental beggar
Ju-ju beads holding me all togetherEmbed
