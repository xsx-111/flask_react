Chateau in Virginia Waters LyricsBroken English words cracked the air like a bell
She had a chateau in Virginia Waters
Free from all those culture vultures
Her silver car a silver cloud cloaked the air in a shroud
Her pearly author's teeth tore the seasoned cedar coloured pheasant
Her one rich wish is to write a book about
A Venetian mother's problems on a barge in little Venice
She peers at the portrait of her poetess grandmother
Who's theatrical in character
Wise just like Socrates
She sinks her nails into the aged canvas
But the power from the wordster's head was cool and shrill and frightening
Miss Drag is intermingled with the powder-blue chaise lounge
She types some acid words to her hairless Havana art dealer
Her one rich wish is to write a book about a chateau in Virginia Waters
Free from all those culture vulturesEmbed
