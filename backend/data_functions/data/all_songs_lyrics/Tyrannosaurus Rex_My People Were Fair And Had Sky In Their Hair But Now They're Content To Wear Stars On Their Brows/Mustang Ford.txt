M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-my Mustang Ford
My Baby she knows I'm on a scene
My baby keeps asking where I've been
My baby's guessing that I'm messing
It's all put together with alligator leather
My Baby she knows I'm no fool
My baby she says hey keep cool
My baby don't realise I'm hypnotised
It's all put together with alligator leather
M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-my Mustang FordEmbed
