Wielder of Words LyricsWielder of words is steeped within traditional verbs and curiously a dented top hat
Discovered in the moonlit Laundromat
A busted cheroot is smoking on the heel of his boot
His opera is torn thru' the haste of operatic oyster eating evenings of waste
Sleek astrakhan, reclining on a chippendale stand so sad they should be owning a man who's thicker than the forestry from where they began
