Serpentine Lyrics
See the dogs come running
Smelling blood now
To an open sore
On a parasite
Countless hearts have fallen
Hard to number
Damnation's whore
Is looking for a victim tonight

With an angry soul
And a wicked design
Your will cannot endure
And your heart is torn away

I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right
I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Damn what I'm becoming
One of them now
Just an opened door
On an endless night
Dark desire burning
In my blood now
How can I be sure?
I don't know if I'll be able to fight

With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away

I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right
I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Now that I've been torn apart
Will there be an end to this?
Will there finally be release?
Will I finally rest in peace?
I'm determined to believe
My prayers will be received

With a tortured soul
And an honest design
My will cannot endure
As my heart is torn away

I was caught up in the moment
We were alone and you seemed to harness the light
Even though I felt cold inside
When you told me it would be all right
I had given up control and
I didn't focus hard enough
To see the warning signs
Your heart is serpentine

The warning signs
Your heart is serpentine
Evil personified
Your heart is serpentine1Embed
