Leave It Alone Lyrics
I can’t control my anger and
I’ve been about to explode
Far too many times
I’ve seen my dreams becoming more violent
Every time that I see you
No matter how you try to define it
I have been broken too many times
Too much emotion too long confined has
Weakened the wall that protects you

Ease your mind, this moment will pass if you just
Leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My dysfunction is on your mind
When you find that you’re at odds with your desire
Just leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My destruction is on your mind
Before you find that you have
Tested my resolve one too many times

I am a stranger, you know I’ve been
Pressed to the wall far too many times
Stop your behavior or you will find
My murderous nature surround you
Others have wandered over the line that
Awaken the monster too many times
Leave it unspoken and you will find an
End to the violence if you can
Ease your mind, this moment will pass if you just
Leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My dysfunction is on your mind
When you find that you’re at odds with your desire
Just leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My destruction is on your mind
Before you find that you have
Tested my resolve one too many times

Ease your mind, this moment will pass if you just
Leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My dysfunction is on your mind
When you find that you’re at odds with your desire
Just leave it alone, leave it alone every time
My destruction is on your mind
Before you find that you have
Tested my resolve one too many times1Embed
