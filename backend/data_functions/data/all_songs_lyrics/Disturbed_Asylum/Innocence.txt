Innocence Lyrics
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent
Who is innocent?
Who is innocent?
No one is innocent
Who is innocent?

Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
The killer walks again
Freed by evil men in their dark charade
This can’t be happening
A mother’s selfish pride
Her child's homicide
Can she be to blame?
The suited vultures circling
A father’s cruelty
A murdered family
Is the world insane?
Their defenders ready to embrace their lies
With their devious smiles
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

Who is innocent?
No one is innocent
Who is innocent?

Presumed innocent
Justice fails again in the masquerade
A battered woman trembling
Her lover drunk again
When will the torture end in her web of shame?
Is death the only way?
A child victimized
The crime politicized
For the counselor's gain
The rabid media congregates
His tortured memories, a pervert's fantasies
Is the world insane?
The parasitic devastation seen
On your TV screen
Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

False defender, burn forever
False defender, burn forever
Cold and spineless, have you no soul?
Wicked-minded, out of control, and guided
By their hunger, they will find new ways to betray us

Your corruption is like a cancer growing inside
You owe the world an apology
You’ve been taught all your life
That truth is easy to hide
You'll face your judgment another day
And suffer eternally

Who is innocent?
Is it relevant in the world today?
I shake my head in disbelief
Presumed innocent
Justice fails again in the masquerade
Has the whole world become insane?1Embed
