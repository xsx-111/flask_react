Sacrifice Lyrics
I will forever be reminded
Of how I struggled to survive
The betrayal that you conspired in
All that devotion thrown away
And with everything I confided
I should have known not to trust again
This insanity has divided
Left me with nothing left to destroy
I'm becoming so paranoid
Everyone is so paranoid

In a moment
You will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies
He demands your sacrifice

I can barely control this feeling
Look at the murder in my eyes
I was never good at concealing
Violent thoughts have come to life
Horror will have a deeper meaning
You are the reason this began
Even now I can hear you screaming
There's only one thing left to destroy
And I'll no longer be paranoid
No more reason to be annoyed
In a moment
You will see my other side
When I'm confronted
My demeanor turns from Jekyll into Hyde

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies
He demands your sacrifice

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale deception anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies

Hell has broken free tonight
No pale reflection anymore
You awoke him, now he will feed on the lies
He demands your sacrificeEmbed
