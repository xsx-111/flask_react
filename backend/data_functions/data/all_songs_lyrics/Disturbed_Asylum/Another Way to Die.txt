Another Way to Die Lyrics
The indulgence of our lives
Has cast a shadow on our world
Our devotion to our appetites
Betrayed us all
An apocalyptic plight
More destruction will unfold
Mother Earth will show her darker side
And take her toll

It's just another way to die
There can be no other reason why
You know we should have seen it coming
Consequences we cannot deny
Will be revealed in time
Glaciers melt as we pollute the sky
A sign of devastation coming
We donâ€™t need another way to die
Can we repent in time?

The time bomb is ticking
And no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?
Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
Ooh, can we repent in time?

Greed and hunger led to our demise
A path I can't believe we followed
Black agenda's rooted in a lie
Will we repent in time?
Species fall before our very eyes
A world that they cannot survive in
Left them with another way to die
Are we dead inside?

The time bomb is ticking
And no one is listening
Our future is fading
Is there any hope we'll survive?

Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
Still, we ravage the world that we love
And the millions cry out to be saved
Our endless maniacal appetite
Left us with another way to die
It's just another way to die
Ooh, can we repent in time?

It's just another way to die
Ooh, can we repent in time?6Embed
