My Child Lyrics
Tore it up again
I couldn’t stop again
Let it go till there was nothing in the way
Fought the feeling then
I gave in again
Sweet surrender to the angel I denied
When you came to life
I was terrified
I knew that nothing else would ever feel the same
Doubt came over me
What kind of father would I be?
I knew the time had come to stand up and be a man

To change the face of my life
(To change the face of my life)
With your future in mind
(With your future in mind)
Time to do what was right (What is right)
A new beginning

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn’t a sin
Can someone tell me
Why this has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Were you redeemed, my child?
No serenity
Within agony
Every day brings on a hundred ways to fight
Constant scrutiny
I can feel you judging me
Resurrecting every demon left inside
Her face was horrified
You struggled, still alive
My one desire was to trade my soul for yours
Grief crippled me
The reaper cheated me
Left me yearning for the path I'd come to adore

To change the face of my life
(To change the face of my life)
With your future in mind
(With your future in mind)
Time to do what was right (What is right)
A new beginning

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn’t a sin
Can someone tell me
Why this has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Were you redeemed, my child?
My child

The world around me died
When I saw that heartbeat
I knew it wasn’t a sin
Can someone tell me
Why this has happened to me?
Why was it only in death
Were you redeemed, my child?

I pray you were redeemed, my child1Embed
