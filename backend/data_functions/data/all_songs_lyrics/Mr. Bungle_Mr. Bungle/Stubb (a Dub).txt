Stubb (a Dub) Lyrics
Do you remember we called you puppy?
Now you're one of us, we call you family
Family, family, family, family, family, family, family

Treading underfoot and stinking ass
Hold the door aside and let her pass
Glaucoma!
Reflections of a bloated lie
A life stored in your cloudy eye
Now it's time to say goodbye
Stubb a Dub will never die
Ohh way-ohh ahh oooh
Chase a tail that isn't there
It's time to wipe your butt
Sliding down butt hill
Dahg Rastubfari - do you know
That you're a fucking dog?
And if you can hear me, then throw up
Give me a sign
And I'll throw a stick, bring it back
Roll over and die
You taught me a lesson - thanks mom!
Do you understand me?
Do you think about me when you're peeing?
Do you really think you're gonna grow into a human being?
This dog has seen better days
You're gonna die
How does it feel, Stubb?

Eat and sleep, fulfil your only role
Let your problems seep out of your hole
Cataract!
Reflections of a bloated lie
A life stored in your cloudy eye
Now it's time to say goodbye
(Dog noises)
Chase a tail that isn't there
It's time to wipe your butt
Sliding down butt hill
Dahg Rastubfari (Dahg Rastubfari)
Do you know (do you know)
That you're a fucking dog? (That you're a fucking dog?)
And if you can hear me  (And if you can hear me)
Then throw up (then throw up)
Give me a sign (give me a sign)
And I'll throw a stick (And I'll throw a stick)
Bring it back (bring it back)
Roll over and die (Roll over and die)
You taught me a lesson (You taught me a lesson, mom)
Thanks mom!
Do you understand me?
Do you think about me when you're peeing?
Do you really think you're gonna grow into a human being?
This dog has seen better days
You're gonna die
How does it feel, Stubb?

Do you remember we called you family?
Now you're underground, we call you memory
Memory, memory, memory, memory, memory, memory, memory
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Crying)
("What do you want?")
("I want you to hurt me")1Embed
