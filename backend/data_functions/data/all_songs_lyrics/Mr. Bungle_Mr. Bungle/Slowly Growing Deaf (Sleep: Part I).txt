Slowly Growing Deaf (Sleep: Part I) Lyrics
As the congregation grows
The lung of solitude deflates
To my ears the greatest sin
Feel a bit like Beethoven
Simultaneous they speak unbeknownst
Exiled to the inner voice
Difference is, he had no choice

We can't seem to find the air
To get our message through your heads
Poor respiration is sure
To keep clear communication obscure
As if I should care
As if you are listening out there

The louder you speak the more I can hear
The less I can understand
Pound on it, pound it in
To my ears the greatest sin
Feel a bit like Beethoven

Paint my lungs so silently
The darkest color of your noise
A crowd will contradict its own audibility
Can't hear the dialogue for the voice
No one is listening, yet ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing

In the morning I will see
What you were trying to say to me
As I respond into the sink
Need not again hear myself think

Ears are ringing, ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing
Ears are ringing, ears are ringing!

Wax within my ears has grown
Just like the snot inside my nose
My interpretation
Of distorted conversation

I will kill for isolation
Sacrifice the energy
To enjoy the breath of silence
When the blood comes naturally
I have chosen to plug my nose
Before the threshold of pain has grown
Mole out from society
Survive off my soliloquy
Removed I can speak as he, he, he has
Bleeding from nose, throat, and ears
("I'm gonna get a cup of coffee")
("Most, most folks, most, most, folks, uh... most, mo-most fol-, most folks"
"Alright once again"
"Uh most, most folks have heard about..."
"Alright that's good, good very nice"
"That's why folks call it fi... that's why folks call it finger lickin'"
"Sounds good"
"That's why folks call it, call it - oh wait... that's that's why, that's why folks call it fi- that's why folks call it..."
"That's it"
"That's why folks call it..."
"I'm not gettin' anywhere with this damn thing"
"Okay, fine")Embed
