My Ass Is on Fire Lyrics"EARTHSHAKER!"
Impotence, boomerang
I'll stab you
('Scuse me, pardon me, oh I'm sorry, whoopsie)
I'll stab you (stab you)
Clumps of hair in the sink
Who's hiding things from me?
You knew all along, goddammit
But you wouldn't tell me
Well, look at you now!
It's not funny, my ass is on fire
Paraplegic, inhuman liar
("Possibly uh, might be some drug activity...")
Carve a smile on your face
Everything's great, suffocate
("What the fuck?")
("What you looking at fuck?
What you looking at fuck?")
("Don't you fucking look at me
Don't you fucking look at me
Don't you fucking look at me")
("Jeffery... Hurt me.")
It's beyond my control
It's beyond my control
It's beyond my control
I'm, I'm coming!
It's not funny, my ass is on fire
Paraplegic, inhuman liar
Boo
Redundant
Boring

"Excuse me, I am lost, please help me."
("Will there be anything else, Mr. Bungle?"
"No that's fine Carl, thank you."
"So you see Mr. Bungle, Dylan's fucking up your whole campaign! He's totally incompetent, Sleeper-X commercials will be laughed off of television if you approve his campaign."
"Well, that's very interesting; I never thought too much of Dylan now that you mention it."
"And I'm starting my own agency, Mr. Bungle, I could do a 100% better job than that turkey!"
"I'll bet you could. What you say is very interesting, in fact, you're very interesting."
"Oh, Mr. Bungle, I didn't know you were interested. And you will give me your account for my new agency!"
"Later honey, we'll talk business later. Right now I want to make love to your beautiful, beautiful body...")Embed
