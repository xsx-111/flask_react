Love Is a Fist LyricsClenched emotions
'Round my ween
Feel my heart beat
Off and your head in
I feel strongly about violence!
Love is a fist
Love is a fist
Love is a fist
There's no effort
To what's in
Open faced
Knuckle sandwich
What's love got to do with
I feel strongly about violence!
Aaaaah
Love is a fist
Love is a fist
Love is a fist
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Fist love
Is a
Just before lunch one day, a puppet show was put on at school. It was called "Mr. Bungle goes to lunch", it was fun to watch. In the puppet show, Mr. Bungle came to the boys room. He looked at his hands, his hands were dirty and his hair was messy but Mr. Bungle didn't stop to wash his hands or comb his hair, he went right to lunch. Then, instead of getting in the line at the lunch room, Mr. Bungle pushed everyone aside and went right to the front. Even though this made the children laugh, no one thought that was a fair thing to do. Then, in the lunch room, Mr. Bungle was so clumsy and impolite that he knocked over everything and no one wanted to sit next to him and when he finally knocked his own tray of the table, that was the end of the puppet show. The children knew that even though Mr. Bungle was funny to watch, he wouldn't be much fun to eat with. Phil knew that a Mr. Bungle wouldn't have many friends, he wouldn't wanna be like Mr. BungleEmbed
