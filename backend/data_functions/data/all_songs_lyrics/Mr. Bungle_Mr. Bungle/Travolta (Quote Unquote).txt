Travolta (Quote Unquote) Lyrics
All behold the spectacle
A fleshy limbless rectangle
Sitting on a pedestal
So nasal handicapable
Sniff and remember silver ball
Contortions that he can't recall
The torso on a trampoline
The happiness melts into dream

To talk is an enunciated sneeze
To taste is some foul air to breathe
(Grease is the word, it's the word, that you heard
It's the word that you heard
Is the time, is the place, is the motion)

One thought it lasts a day
And at that rate he'll most likely live forever!
He's a bird in flight, a hermaphrodite
And he fucks himself as he fucks the world

His twitching brain can dance within
Gyrating more like gelatin
A secret means of ecstasy
Acute and very olfactory
To see is colors crawling in the nose
To hear is stinking highs and lows

He's got an itch, but nothing with which
To scratch the itch, so wish it away
With his mouth sewn shut, he still shakes his butt
Cuz he's Hitler and Swayze and Trump and...
Travolta

Smell, Sweat, Movement
Everyone's dancing
Disco
Dimple
Fading. Darker
A subtle fragrance
Faint
Everyone's dancing without him
Where did it go?
Dark
Odorless
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing4Embed
