Egg Lyrics
Rotting from the inside
Over-incubated by the heat of fear and love
The self's coagulated

Egg, egg, egg, egg
Egg, egg, egg, egg

La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

Boiling hard in euphemism
Slowly becoming part of the water
Like a frog who never knows
The jacuzzi's getting hotter

Blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah
Blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah

Hey! How'd you know I was looking at you
If you weren't looking at me?
Yeah!
A stagnant pale perfume
Conceived to block the pores
The clotting glands encroach
The endless comfort of a mom
Deep inside my tanning salon
Wishing life was poached

La la, la la la la la
La la, la la la la la

I can't seem to differentiate
Between the yellow love you give and the white sex I take
I just want to fertilize you

Blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah
Blah blah, blah blah blah blah blah

Egg, egg
Stupid...

The cracks finally appear
Release cholesterol tears
The flooded cyst drains itself of pus
The lonely stomach chills unless it's drunk
So as she drives she'll close her eyes
Feel it warming up inside

Egg!
Egg, oh an egg comes out of a chicken
Egg, oh a chick comes out of an egg
Egg, oh an egg comes out of a chicken
Egg, oh a chick comes out of an egg
Egg, oh an egg comes out of a chicken
Egg, oh a chick comes out of an egg
Egg, oh an egg comes out of a chicken
Egg, oh a chick comes out of an egg

There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like...
There's no place like home

There's no place like...
(Choking noises)
No place like home (laughing)
No place like home (crying)
No place like...

No place like home, there's, there's, there's
No place like...
(Growling)
There's no place like home, there's there's...
N-n-n-no place like home
There's no place, place, place, place, li-li-like...
(Whimpering noises)
No place like home!
There's, there's, there's no place like home
There's no place like...
(Grunting, scatting)
(Stop it, stop it)
(Giggling)
No! Place! Like!
