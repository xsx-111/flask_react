Carousel Lyrics("Hurry hurry, step right up")

A carnival for the human race, cotton candy, happy face
A child talking with his mouth full, girlfriend gets stuffed animal
A festive mood is all around another world is what we've found
Step right up, let's make a deal, "ride the ferris wheel"
You know there's something lurking underneath the shape
With a mask over it's head and makeup on his face
Will Warner Brothers put our record on the shelf?
Take a look in the mirror and see the clown in yourself

Spinning, grinning, believing, deceiving
Whirling, twirling, confusing, amusing
Discovery, recovery, inherency, transparency
Fusion, conclusion, reality, fatality

If you want to know what's behind the show
You'll ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell
Love and blood begin to meld
You've lost the self that you once held
Merry go round your head
Awake, asleep, alive, or... dead
("Hey you!")
The clown that painted a smile on you is now the one unmasking you
Animated scenes unwind dormant figures come to life
Entangled in your own web a twisted tunnel overhead
A glimpse of light, a drop of dew you slide into the, into the
Into the, into the swimming pool!

A roller coaster ride into the rivers of your mind
The currents merge, your feelings surge, your life's a pantomime
Beauty is the spiral going round & round the beast
Without the vampire effect the carnival is deceased

Spinning, grinning, believing, deceiving
Whirling, twirling, confusing, amusing
Discovery, recovery, inherency, transparency
Fusion, conclusion, reality, fatality

If you want to know what's behind the show
You'll ride my carousel and enter life's jail cell
Love and blood begin to meld
You've lost the self that you once held
Merry go round your head
Awake, asleep, alive, or... dead
("Welcome to my house")
Running, so fun
("Round and round we go")
Roly-Poly, topsy turvy
Hang upside down, fall to the ground
I-I-I think I'm gonna, gonna be sick!
(Gag and puke sounds)
(Laughter)
(Sample of R.B.I. Baseball)Embed
