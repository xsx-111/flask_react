Ah, Sunflower! Weary of Time LyricsAh, Sun-flower! weary of time
Who countest the steps of the Sun
Seeking after that sweet golden clime
Where the traveller's journey is done
Where the Youth pined away with desire
And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow
Arise from their graves and aspire
Where my Sun-flower wishes to go
Ah, Sun-flower! weary of time
Who countest the steps of the Sun
Seeking after that sweet golden clime
Where the traveller's journey is done
Where the Youth pined away with desire
And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow
Arise from their graves and aspire
Where my Sun-flower wishes to goEmbed
