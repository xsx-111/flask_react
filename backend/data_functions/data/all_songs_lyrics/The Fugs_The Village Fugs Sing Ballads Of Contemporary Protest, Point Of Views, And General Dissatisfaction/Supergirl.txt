Supergirl Lyrics
I want a girl that can
Fug like an angel
Cook like a devil
Swing like a dancer
Work like a pony
Dream like a poet
Flow like a mountain stream

Super girl, my super girl
Super girl, my super girl

I want a girl that can
Kiss like a cherry
Squeeze like a berry
Smell like an ocean
Talk like a songbird
Walk like a fountain
Touch like a flower
Sing like the Leaves of Grass

Super girl, my super girl
Super girl, my super girl
I want a girl that can
Love like a monkey
Hug like a castle
Think like a darling
Laugh like a lemon
Eat like a monster
Roar like a jug of wine

Super girl, my super girl
Super girl, my super girl

I want a girl that can
Kiss like an eagle
Bend like a sapling
Bark like a beagle
Bite like a bagel
Fly like a butter
Shake like a 
(in the background during fadeout) 'up up and away!'Embed
