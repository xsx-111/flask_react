Slum Goddess LyricsAs I floated lonely down the street one day
Who did I see slippin' my way?
Slum Goddess from the Lower East Side
Slum Goddess gonna make her my bride
Not a chick in the world who's happy to be she
My swinging little goddess from Avenue B
It's really very groovy
To take her to a movie
Where we make it in the balcony
Slum goddess from the Lower East Side
Slum goddess gonna make her my bride
First time that we balled it nearly drove me insane
Next time that we balled it ripped me out of my brain
The third time that we balled I nearly fainted dead
I woke up she was on her knees stompin' on my head
Slum goddess from the Lower East Side
Slum goddess I'm gonna make her my bride
As I floated lonely down the street one day
Who did I see slippin' my way?
Slum Goddess from the Lower East Side
Slum Goddess, I'm gonna make her my brideEmbed
