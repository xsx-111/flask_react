My Baby Done Left Me LyricsMy baby done left me
My baby done went to the drive-in movie with someone else
And I feel like homemade shit
(Yodel yodel layhe, yodel layhe, yodel hoo)
My baby done left me
My baby done parked by Coonskin Creek with somebody else
And I feel like homemade shit
(Yodel yodel layhe, yodel layhe, yodel hoo)
Clara-June, Clara-June
I'm a-kickin' up sparks for you
Clara-June, Clara-June
I'll give a hoot for you
Cause I feel like homemade shit
(Yodel yodel layhe, yodel layhe, yodel hoo)
I'll sit in church and hold your hand
I'll give up heifer fucking
I'll buy a suit from the Sears Catalogue
Clara-June, Clara-June
Come back, come back
Clara-June, Clara-June
I feel like homemade shit
(Yodel yodel layhe, yodel layhe, yodel hoo)
I'm a-sitting in a tavern and a-holding my head
My hearts a-pounding like sixteen gongs
Clara-June, Clara-June
I sure miss that moon
Clara-June, Clara-June
I feel like homemade shit
(Yodel yodel layhe, yodel layhe yodel hoo)
I feel like homemade shit
(Shit)Embed
