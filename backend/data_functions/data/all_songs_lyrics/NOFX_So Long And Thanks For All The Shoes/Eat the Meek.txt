Eat the Meek LyricsWhy must we stay where we don't belong
Why must we stay where we don't belong
Because there's never gonna be enough space
So eat the meek, savour the taste
It's always gonna be a delicacy
So lick your chops and eat the meek
Why must we stay where we don't belong
Why must we stay where we don't belong
The factory mass producing fear, bottled
Capped, distributed near and far
Sold for a reasonable price
The people, they love it, they feed it
Brush with it, bathe with it, breathe it
Inject it direct to the blood
It seems to be replacing love
Why must we stay where we don't belong
Why must we stay where we don't belong
Because there's always gonna be token truth
Forgotten code discarded youth
You know there's always gonna be pedigree
One own the air one pay to breathe
Why must we stay where we don't belong
Why must we stay where we don't belongEmbed
