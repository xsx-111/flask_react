Kids of the K-Hole LyricsEverybody needs some time away
Just stuck in the k-hole again
An 18 hour holiday
Just stuck in the k-hole again, just once again
Mrs. Kitty Ketamine your perseverance may
Outlast my ambition to go home
Infatuation with your dark side I obey
Forbidden pleasures, I have grown to loathe/love
Somewhere between some eden and north utopia
Somewhere beneath the astral plain
I've taken residence on sybaritic soil
You won't be seeing me again
You won't be seeing me again
Dropping crumbs and flying thumbs
Won't help me get back home
The home is where the heart is, I've been told
Cause I promised my heart to her
She cooked it medium well
Then proceeded to swallow it whole
It may sound good to you
It may sound oh so wrong
(So fucking wrong)
Just stuck in the k-hole again
Winter's broken, summer's gone
Just stuck in the k-hole again
Just once again1Embed
