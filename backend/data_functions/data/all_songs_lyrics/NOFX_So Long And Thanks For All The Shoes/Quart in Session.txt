Quart in Session LyricsIt's funny how nothing seems much fun
Anymore to me now that I quit the drink
'cause soberness it might be what I need
But it's certainly not how I wanna be
Cause nothing seems much fun anymore to me
Consequence never had any time to
Think about what shoulda coulda happened to me
But common sense my parents said I
Never had any, but now look whose got the dough
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me
Don't feel like goin' out
Nothing worth singin about
Missin' the alcohol
No longer born to lose
Put away my party shoes
Missing the alcohol
Without Tonic N gin
Without no Vicodin
Nothin seem much fun anymore to me X 4Embed
