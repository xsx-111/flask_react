Monosyllabic Girl LyricsI take her down to the aquarium, she says shark;
I take her to the planetarium, she says dark;
I take her to the seaside
Where she likes to spin and twirl;
Oh, she says sure and cool and yeah;
She's my monosyllabic girl
I take her to the university, she says huh;
I take her to our anniversary, she says one;
I take her to the jewelry store
I say diamonds, she says pearl
Oh, everyone knows I'm in love
With a monosyllabic girl
You know everyone knows I'm in love
With a monosyllabic girlEmbed
