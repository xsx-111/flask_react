Get Outta London LyricsWords and music by roddy frame
The sun dying on a dusty room
Tv lying to me through the gloom
Even remote control can't change this mood
Get outta london while the getting's good
Get outta london while I know I could
Get outta london
Train's come just ride and believe
The engine running's all the music I need
I've got a fear of the past and a hunger to feed
Get outta london and you shall be free
Get outta london and it's guaranteed
Get outta london
I walked the avenue of dumb signs
Meant nothing and it felt fine
Then I remembered what was really mine
A silver shiver running down my spine
Down where the streets are pave with sick schemes
The river's running like a snake through a dream
The politicians gaze across it's slime
I need another way to waste my time
Get outta london, get outta london
I saw the spectre of charity
And he didn't seem brotherly
Popping up what should be blown away
A brotherhood of man in disarray
I got hit by the dreamers disease
Where your big ideas
Don't make connection with your buckling knees
And saw the greed and agreed that it sucked
But they said, "don't laugh at money cos it's bad luck"
Get outta london, get outta londonEmbed
