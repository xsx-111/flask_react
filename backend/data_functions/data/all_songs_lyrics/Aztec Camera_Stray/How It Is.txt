How It Is LyricsWords and music by roddy frame
Well you can get grades, toe the line
Keep your behind above the water in the meantime
Join the corporate pyramid
I couldn't blame you if you did
Until you sell out your brother while your sister falls
Playin' daddy, doing the company crawl
You don't deserve your daughter's kiss, I know it's sad
That's how it is
Well, uptown there's been more than an oilspill
Another woman beaten, raped, blood spilled, male hate
The paper's couldn't wait, racism, sell this
Well there's excusin' in what I'm saying
It's just that there's a million colours praying
For real justice
That's how it really is
You just get born, keep on keepin' on
Defend yourself against the worries
Try and have fun
Party on until your number's picked
But beware cos the fight is fixed
It was them but it could be you next
Paranoia saves lives
So if you wanna exist
Get your head round this...
That's how it isEmbed
