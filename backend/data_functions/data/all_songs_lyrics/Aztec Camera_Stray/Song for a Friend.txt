Song for a Friend LyricsWords and music by roddy frame
Awake
In winter's crystal hours
And give to what gets you in the end
For the sake of a love that just devours
And smiles and takes
And lays you down again
Run free
The moon is always female
Straight to what's still and will not bend
Don't wait for the sunshine to surround you
Consume and fake
And let you down again
Cos' life is short
And you better get smart
To the people who know nothing
And surround you
Stand straight
In what kills you and confounds you
And break it's chains
And still believeEmbed
