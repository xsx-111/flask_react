Notting Hill Blues LyricsWords and music by roddy frame
All the madness in the mirror
The tremblin' and the tears
It takes a long time comin' out
It's comin' out of here
I've been wandering your london town
And it's wearin' out my shoes
It's a long road comin' down
Comin' down with the blues
But when you hold me and really make love to me
I know that love is true forgiveness
Time on my mind is time spent with you
But it's time that I can't find
With the notting hill blues
Lovers pass me on the gate
Like distant cousings, removed
Holding hands, it seems like an act of fate
And I'm almost moved
But love has left me standing still
With no directions and no clues
No speech to let my feelings loose
A celebration of the blues
But when you hold me and really make love to me
I know that love is true forgiveness
Out on the road I was down with the crew
Now I'm all alone, on the run
With the notting hill blues
And it's a lonely, lonely time
Sadness preys upon my mind
A telephone and a bottle of booze
But who do you call? when your tongue tied
Up all nightEmbed
