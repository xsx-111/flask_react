Stray LyricsYou don't have to tell me what you're still looking for
Two arms to hold you and a voice to say "That's alright, you can spend the night"
Well, come around
'Cos I've been there and these are the notes from the overground
The World Saxophone Quartet, the smell of violets
And a passing friend won't let you down
Listen to the rhythm of the rain falling
Say you're gonna change your foolish ways
Make a promise, break a promise in the same day
It goes the same way, anyway
So you pray for silence and its sadness and its violence
To be washed away
One day
I understand that state you've reached of being unreachable
Somewhere out there where only the music plays
Loneliness and being alone don't always mean the same
Who needs the movie? You can see the music anyway
A Sketch For Winter, a Burgundy and sanctuary can make me stay
When I feel that way
And if my words don't say the things that they were meant to say
And if confusion comes and carries all my words away
And if you still don't understand, I wanna hold your hand
And look at it this way...
Someone singing's better than the war they're winning
Winging its way, your way or my way, any day, anyway
