African Man LyricsAll I want to do, monkey see, monkey do
I eat a monkey for breakfast
I eat a skunk for lunch
I live in the bush
I eat with my fingers
I don’t use no knife and fork ‘cuz I live in the jungle
I live in the jungle
I know each tigers
I know about lions
I know about the elephants
I know about everything that lives in the jungle
I’m an African Man
I’m an African Man
I’m an African Man and I do what I can
I do what I can
Because I been so strange
In a blue Kenya sky
It’s a dirty plague
Go home you dirty white man
Go home you, go home you
Dirty white man
I hate ya, I hate the white man
Wanna go back to the jungle again where I came
What do ya say?
It’s good in the jungle
It’s good in the jungle
It’s good in the jungle
I know lions
I know tigers
I know elephants
I’m an African Man I don’t eat with my fork
I use no knife
I eat with my finger
Live in the bush
I live in the bush
I live in the bush and I’m going to stomp like a gorilla
Here I beat my chest
Live in bush
Pretty tiger
Tiger rag
I know lions
Eat with fingers
I live in bush
I live in bush
I live in bush
I live in bush, look up at blue sky
Blue sky of Kenya
Airplane up high
But that airplane is flying too low
That white man’s airplane is flying too low
Sometimes things change too slowEmbed
