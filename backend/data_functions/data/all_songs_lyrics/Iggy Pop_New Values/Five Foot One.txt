Five Foot One Lyrics
I'm only five foot one
I got a pain in my neck
I'm looking up in the city
What the hell what the heck
I stare at the concrete
The girders eye high
The steel's above me
There's love in my eyes

And I'm doing the things
A five foot one man can do

I'm only five foot one
I got a pain in my heart
All the night I'm working
In the amusement park
With a bottle of aspirin
A sack full of jokes
I wish I could go home
With all the big folks

And I wish life could be
Swedish magazines
I wish life could be
Swedish magazines
I wish life could be
Anything
Ugh! Aie! Aie! Aie!
Ugh!
I'm only five foot one
Unless the time has come
I won't grow anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore
Until I'm losing my head
I'm checking it twice
I'm going to find out
Who's naughty and nice

And I'm doing the things
A five foot one man can do

I wish life could be Swedish magazines
I wish life could be Swedish magazines
I wish life could be Swedish magazines
I wish life could be
Yeah, I wish life could be
Ohhh, I wish life could be

I wish life could be Swedish magazines
I wish life could be Swedish magazines
I wish life could be
I won't grow anymore
I won't grow anymore
I won't grow anymore
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
I'm only five foot one
I'm only five foot one
I'm only five foot one
I'm five foot one1Embed
