Tell Me a Story Lyrics
What must I do to take a holiday?
Show me a bill that they can make me pay, ha
Tell me a story and maybe I'll believe it

Me, I'm just a lucky guy
I'm young and free, too hard to cry

Lorna from my school she's twenty one
She's good looking and American, so
Tell me a story, hey man, I ain't complaining

Me, I'm just a lucky guy
I'm young and hard, too tough to cry

Standing in a show, the lights ain't low
They're shining down on me
I like, I like it, just like I like I like it
I'm taking like I find it
What did they do to chill the joy away?
What did they do to say you had to pay
And pay and pay and tell me stories
You know I never can believe them, never
Me, I'm just a lucky guy
I'm young and free, too dumb to cry


Me, I'm just a lucky guy
I'm young and free, too hard to cryEmbed
