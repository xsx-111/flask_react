Pretty Flamingo LyricsOoo, pretty flamingo
You locked the door on me so I crawled in your window
Ooo
Ooo, pretty young flamingo
I, I will protect you
And you, you are so worth protecting
Ooo
Ooo, pretty young flamingo
You'll never be cold flamingo
You'll never grow old flamingo
You my pretty flamingo
Flamingo I'm right on the brink
So what do you think?
Can I buy you a drink?
You're built like a willow
I ?
So when I undress you
I peek in your window
They want to look in your window
'Cause your a pretty flamingo
Ooo, pretty young flamingoEmbed
