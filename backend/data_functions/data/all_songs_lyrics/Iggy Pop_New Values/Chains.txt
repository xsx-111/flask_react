Chains LyricsI remember the time when I was hunting for dimes
All  the time at the best stuff I knew
I  knew I was alright stuff
I was alright
Chains, chains, chains
Chains,  chains, chains
How  about chains
Chains
Am  I still the same?
Chains
No, I am not the same
Chains, chains, chains
No,  I'm not the same
Chains
I love my chains
Chains
I love my chains
Chains
My chains of love
You can walk around on your own
You can drive around on your own
All the time that you do
You are a candidate for depression, anxiety
Chains, chains, chains
Chains, chains, chains
Where are your brain?
Chains
Are you still the same?
Chains, chains, chains
No you are not the same
Chains, chains, chains
You love your chains
Chains, chains, chains
You love your chains
Your chains of love
Chains, chains, chains
Your chains of love
Chains, chains, chains
Your chains of love
Chains, chains, chains
Your chains of love
Chains, chains, chains
No you are not the same
Chains
No I’m not the same
Chains
I'm not the sameEmbed
