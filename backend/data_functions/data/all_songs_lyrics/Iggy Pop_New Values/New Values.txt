New Values Lyrics
I'm healthy as a horse
Ah, but everything is spinning
And if I use a gun
I'm sure to go to prison
I'm stubborn as a mule
And nobody breaks my rules
Ah, but nothing comes my way
I've got a hard-ass pair of shoulders
I've got a love, you can't imagine
Yeah, and what I got, I double
I swear, I'm keeping out of trouble
I'm looking for one new value
I'm looking for one new value
But nothing comes my way
We live in the same world
We were young in the 20th century
Ahh, but nothing comes my wayEmbed
