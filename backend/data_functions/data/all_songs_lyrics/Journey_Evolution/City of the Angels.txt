City of the Angels Lyrics
City of the angels
Walking and talking and laughing
About dreaming the things that you want will work out
People in places where you want to be
I'm lost in the city, who's got the key?

City of the angels
Oo, I hear you calling me
City of the angels
I've got this feeling that things will work out
I've got this feeling, and there ain't no doubt
I'm holding on, hoping to find
Life in this city can bring peace of mind


Just like, just like it used to be, yeah
City of the angels
I'm going home, home, bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye
Oh, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye
Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving, leaving
Oo, oo, I'm going home
I'm leaving, leavingEmbed
