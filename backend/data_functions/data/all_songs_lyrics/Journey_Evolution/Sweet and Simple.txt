Sweet and Simple Lyrics
Try and keep it simple
Not too far away
Moving slow, so simple
Never felt this way
Moving sweet, so simple
Taking time to say
The way to being, to being simple
Never felt this way
Don't be lonely
Oh, my friends, forget the past
Sweet as sugar
When you're moving
When you're moving slow at last
It's what I like to do
How could it be so simple?
To forget the way
A way to being, to being simple
Never felt this way
Don't be lonely
No, no, no, forget the past
Sweet as sugar
When you're moving slow
Your moving slow at last
It's what I like to do
Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely
It's what I like to do
Sweet as sugar, sugar, sugar
It's what I like to do
Moving slow, moving slow at last
It's what I like to do
Don't be lonely, lonely, lonely
It's what I like to do
Sweet as sugarEmbed
