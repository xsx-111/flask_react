You Got Me Singing Lyrics
You got me singing
Even though the news is bad
You got me singing
The only song I ever had
You got me singing
Ever since the river died
You got me thinking
Of places we could hide

You got me singing
(Singing,) even tho the world is gone
You got me thinking
(Thinking) that I'd like to carry on
You got me singing
(Singing,) even though it all looks grim
You got me singing
(Singing) the Hallelujah hymn
(Singing that Hallelujah hymn)

You got me singing
Like a prisoner in a jail
You got me singing
Like my pardon's in the mail
You got me wishing
Our little love would last
You got me thinking
Like those people of the past

You got me singing
(Singing,) even though the world is gone
You got me thinking
(Thinking that) I'd like to carry on
You got me singing
(Singing,) even it all went wrong
You got me singing
(Singing) the Hallelujah song
(Singing that Hallelujah song)Embed
