Little Guns LyricsTiny people with little guns
Little armies march to little drums
What do they want?
What do they want?
Tiny soldiers with little guns
Little tanks, no bigger than your thumb
They want you
Little people with tiny brains
Little bullets flowing in their veins
What do they want?
What do they want?
Little airplanes with tiny bombs
Little squadrons dropping thimbles of napalm
They want you
You, you
You, you, you, you
Tiny people with little guns
Little armies march to little drums
What do they want?
What do they want?
Tiny soldiers with little guns
Little tanks, no bigger than your thumb
They want you
You, you
You, you, you, you
Tiny people, little gunsEmbed
