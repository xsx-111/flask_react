Cry Of The Vatos Lyrics(backwards message)
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Praise God, brothers and sisters!
Accept Jesus in your heart and you will be saved!
You will receive everlasting life!
Listen to me, I've sinned, I know
Praise Jesus and you will be saved, saved!
Praise God and you are healed, healed, healed!Embed
