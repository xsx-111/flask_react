Who Do You Want To Be? LyricsWho do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Oh, boredom is so terrible; it's like a dread disease
Nothing could be worse
Than when there's nothing on TV
I'd rather be a cowboy than to stare blank at the walls
I've been reborn so many times
I can't remember them all
(And I say)
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV!
I think I'll be a teddy boy; I think I'll be a hunk
I think I'll be a tough guy and I think I'll be a punk
I might just be a fashion star
All dressed in frilly rags
Or perhaps I'll cross the other side
And walk around in
Drag!
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV!
Do you like to be just like a rock
In the middle of the sea?
Do you want to suffer by yourself
In a pool of blissful misery?
Do you feel like a saint in artists' clothes
With a rosary in your hand?
Do you wanna be crazy like Van Gogh, like
A stranger in a
Strange, strange land
Would you rather push the buttons
And be feared by all humanity?
Or perhaps you'd like to be a bum?
Do you wanna be stupid, just like me?
Who do you want to be today?
Who do you want to be?
Who do you want to be today?
Do you want to be just like someone on TV?
Just like somebody on TV!
Who do you want to be...?Embed
