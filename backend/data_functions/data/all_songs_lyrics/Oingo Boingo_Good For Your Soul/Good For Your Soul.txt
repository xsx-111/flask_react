Good For Your Soul LyricsHave you ever felt that somehow
You were not yourself
That your body was the same
But everything around you wasn't right
And images so strange and foreign
Flooded in like raging water
Have you ever been in love
With someone you hardly knew
Whereas every time you closed your eyes
You saw this person come alive
It kept you wide awake at night
You felt like you were burning up
It made you want to scream
Then you passed out in a dream
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
If you don't stop, you'll lose control
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Ever lay there half-asleep all hours of the night
With some nagging demon tugging
At that tiny bell inside your mind
When suddenly, that strange idea
Bursts into an inspiration
You grab for it and then
The whole thing slips right through your fingers
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
If you don't stop, you'll lose control
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
Just once or twice is good for your soul
It's good for your soulEmbed
