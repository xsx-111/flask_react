The Land of Rape and Honey Lyrics
Face to face
Blood to blood
The mountain
You tumbled from

And in the land of rape and honey
You pray

Step by step
You climb the mountain
You pray

Fist to fist
Eye to eye
The rulers of the wasteland

And in the land of rape and honey
You pray

Step by step
You climb the mountain
You pray

Head to head
Chest to chest
Which country is the very best?

And in the land of rape and honey
You pray

Step by step
You climb the mountain
You pray1Embed
