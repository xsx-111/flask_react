I Prefer LyricsHave you run into the human race
Have you run into the world
Have you run into the system
And I raise the white flag
And I raise the white flag
And that's the way
I prefer...flagellation!
Have you run into your head
Have you run into your balls
Have you run into the human condition
And I raise the white flag
And I raise the white flag
And that's the way
I prefer...flagellation!
I prefer flagellation!Embed
