Punk Rock Lyrics
Well, I'll tell you about punk rock: 'punk rock' is a word used by dilettantes and, uh, and, uh heartless manipulators about music, that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it. And it's a- it's a term that's based on contempt, it's a term that's based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism, and everything that's rotten about rock'n'roll
I don't know Johnny Rotten but I'm sure, I'm sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as Sigmund Freud did
You see, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius: myself
And that music is so powerful that it's quite beyond my control and, uh, when I'm in the grips of it I don't feel pleasure and I don't feel pain, either physically or emotionally
Do you understand what I'm talking about?
Have you ever felt like that?
When you just, when you just couldn't feel anything and you didn't want to either
You know? Like that? Do you understand what I'm saying, sir?Embed
