Dogs Got A Bone LyricsOne, Two, Three, Four
Dog's got a bone, all of his own
Wednesday morning, middle of the road
Can't help this feeling, of feeling so alone
Gotta go home now, dog's got a bone now
Listen you will see, coming on in to me
Listen you will see, coming on in to me
Listen you will see that we are climbing
Listen you will see that we are climbing
Wish you were here, tied to the pier
Words disappear, every time you call me
So won't you come home now
If you're feeling so alone now
Dog's got a bone, all of his own now
Listen you will see, coming on in to me
Listen you will see, coming on in to me
Listen you will see that we are climbing
Listen you will see that we are climbing
Listen you will see, coming on in to me
Listen you will see, coming on in to me
Listen you will see that we are climbing
Listen you will see that we are climbing
Yeah, do, do, do, do
Falling on your face with a little white safeEmbed
