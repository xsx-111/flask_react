Dr. Baker Lyrics
Dr. Baker phoned me in the morning
Left a note, he's still yawning
Dr. Baker phoned me in the morning
Left a note, she couldn't make it
How did she ever take a lesson outside his head?
Dr. Baker phoned me in the morning
He couldn't understand, he was a busy man
Tried to reach him again, plead with him
Please come, please come, please come
Please come, please come, please come

See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
Hovering and hovering and hollering home
Hovering and hovering and hollering home
Hovering and hovering and hollering home
Hovering and hovering and hollering home
Dr. Baker phoned me again later that day
Said he cried and he really sounded out of it
His wife was dead and his dog was dead
And misery planned inside his head
I tried to reason with him, tried singing
He said, "No boy you'll never listen"
Try it again, try it again
Try it again, again, again

See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
See me lost inside
You will see me lost, how high
Hovering and hovering and hollering home
I'm a hovering and hovering and hollering home
I'm a hovering and hovering and hollering home
I'm a hovering and hovering and hollering home
I'm a hovering and hovering and hollering home
I'm a hovering and hovering and hollering homeEmbed
