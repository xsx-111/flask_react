Needles In My Eyes Lyrics
Last night it was so good
I felt like crying, I felt crying
Last night though you looked so cold
I felt like smiling, smiling while I'm dying
Last night you looked so good
I felt like crying, felt like crying
Last night though you looked so old
I felt like smiling, smiling while I'm dying

You left me cold, you left me cold
You left me cold, you left me cold

Needles in my eyes won't cripple me tonight, alright
Twisting up my mind please pull me through the light, alright
Needles in my eyes won't cripple me tonight, alright
Twisting up my mind please pull me through the light, alright

Last night I dropped my heart
And I never wanna see it again
Getting tighter with you all the time
I think I'm gonna my buckle my spine
I crept in and I stole your mind
I think, I'm having trouble with mine
Crept in and I stole your mind
I think, I'm having trouble with mine

You left me cold, you left me cold
You left me cold, you left me cold

Needles in my eyes won't cripple me tonight alright
Twisting up my mind please pull me through the light, alright
Needles in my eyes won't cripple me tonight alright
Twisting up my mind please pull me through the light, alrightEmbed
