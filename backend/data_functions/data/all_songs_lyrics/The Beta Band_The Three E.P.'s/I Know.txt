I Know LyricsI know I can't find you
I'll go to sit beside you
I need to remind you
That I still, I still love you
I know I can't find you
I'll show every one around you
That I need to be with you
I still, I still love you
But I know, I can't find you
I know, I can't find you
I know, I can't find you
I know, I can't find you1Embed
