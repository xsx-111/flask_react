Just One Drink LyricsYou drink water
I drink gasoline
One of us is happy
One of us is mean
I love you
But honey, why don’t you love me?
Yeah, well, I love you
But honey, why don’t you love me?
Well, just one drink gets me closer
Just one drink, it rolls you over
But then I start to think you’re growin' colder
The older and older, I am
Well, I watch TV
You watch the ceilin'
And when you turn over
I get a funny feelin'
I should grab my rock and rye
And pop the top until my baby comes clean
Yeah, I should grab my rock and rye
And pop the top until my baby comes clean
Well, just one sip and then you showed me
You bust your lip, on wine spodie-odie
So, c’mon take a trip if you wanna know me
Put a fork in the road with me
Alright
(Chorus)
You drink water
And I drink gasoline
One of us is happy
The other one is mean
I love you
But honey, why don’t you love me?
Yeah, well, I love you
But honey, why don’t you love me?
Oh
Oh, well, I love you
But honey, why don’t you love me?
