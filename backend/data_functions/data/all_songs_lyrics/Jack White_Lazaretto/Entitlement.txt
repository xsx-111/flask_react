Entitlement Lyrics1,2,3
Every time I'm doin' what I want to
Somebody comes and tells me it's wrong
Whenever I'm doin' just as I please
Somebody cuts me down to my knees
Yeah, somebody cuts me down to my knees
In a time when everybody feels entitled
Why can't I feel entitled too?
Somebody took away my God given right
I guess God must have gave it to you
Yeah, I guess God must have slipped it to you
"Stop what you're doin' and get back in line"
I hear this from people all the time
"If we can't be happy then you can't be too"
I'm tired of bein' told what to do
Yeah, I'm sick of bein' told what to do
There are children today who are lied to
Told the world is rightfully theirs
They can have what they want, whenever they want
They take like Caesar and nobody cares
Live like Caesar and nobody cares
I can't bring myself to take without penance
Or atonement or sweat from my brow
Though the world may be spoiled and gettin' worse every day
Don't they feel like they cheated somehow?
I feel like I've been cheated somehow
"Stop what you're doin' and get back in line"
I hear this from people all the time
"If we can't be happy then you can't be too"
I'm tired of bein' told what to do
Yeah, I'm sick of bein' told what to do
I guess nobody on earth is entitled
Not mothers, not children, not kings
Not a one single person on God's golden shore
Is entitled to one single thing
We don't deserve a single damn thing8Embed
