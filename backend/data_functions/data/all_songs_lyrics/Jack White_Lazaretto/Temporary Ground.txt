Temporary Ground LyricsOn a floating lily island
Movin' over slowly sideways
Rest the temporary creatures
Spendin' all of their days
Waitin' for the floor to
Buckle down below their belts
Crashin' into yet another
Driftin' continental shelf
Movin' without motion
Screamin' without sound
Across an open ocean
Lyin' there on temporary ground
Movin' without motion
Screamin' without sound
Across an open ocean
Lyin' there on temporary ground
The old explorers had it easy
They discovered nothin' new
But returned on home with answers
Of sad existence clues
All the creatures have it hard now
Nothin' but God is left to know
And while He left us all here hangin'
With an illusion of a home
(Chorus)
Movin' without motion
Screamin' without sound
Across an open ocean
Lyin' there on temporary ground2Embed
