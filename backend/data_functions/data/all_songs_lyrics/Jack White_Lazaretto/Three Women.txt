Three Women LyricsYeah, I got three women
Red, blonde, and brunette
I got three women
Red, blonde, and brunette
It took a digital photograph to pick which one I like
Well, I'm lonely at night, but I stay up until the break of day
Yeah, I'm lonely at night, but I stay up until the break of day
How come I gotta have a woman to blow these blues away?
Yeah, alright, I said
Lawdy lord, lawdy lord, lawdy lord, lawdy lord
Lawdy lord, lawdy lord
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lord
Yeah, I got one in California and one back in Detroit
I got one in California and one back in Detroit
I brought my woman to Nashville, cast the bottle with her daddy all night
Yeah, well, she hauled my ashes, but she took 'em too far away
Yeah, she hauled my ashes, but she took 'em too far away
She said she loves her daddy
But only when she's got bills to pay
Aw, listen, all right
Lawdy lord, lawdy lord, lawdy lord, Lawdy lord
Lawdy lord, lawdy lord
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lord
Yeah, yeah
Well, I wish I could tell you just what my three women do
Yeah, I wish I could tell you just what my three women do
But if I open my mouth, well, that'll be three women that I lose
Yeah, now I know what you're thinkin'
What gives me the right?
Yeah, I know what you're thinkin'
What gives you the right?
Well, these women must be gettin' somethin'
'Cause they come and see me every night
Lawdy lord, lawdy lord, lawdy lord, lawdy lord
Lawdy lord, lawdy lord
Lawdy, lawdy, lawdy, lord5Embed
