I Think I Found the Culprit Lyrics
I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothin' better yet
What's the matter with you, ya' got nothin' to do?

Two crumbs on my windowsill
Two birds sittin' there perfectly still
One of them up to no good
The other one doin' what he totally should

I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothin' better yet
What's the matter with you, ya' got nothin' to do?

Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothin' better yet
What's the matter with you, ya' got nothin' to do?

Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun4Embed
