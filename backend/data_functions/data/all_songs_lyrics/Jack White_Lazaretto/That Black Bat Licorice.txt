That Black Bat Licorice LyricsWhat?
Behave yourself
Behave yourself
You need to behave yourself, boy
Yeah, she's built for speed like a black Castrum Doloris
Good for the needy, like Nietzsche, Freud and Horace
But I'm skinflint, broke, makin' no money, makin' jokes
But baby, I won't joke with you
My feet are burnin' like a Roman hypocaust
But the Romans are gone, they changed their name because they lost
She writes letters like a Jack Chick comic
Just a buncha' propaganda, make my fingers histrionic;
Like this, and this
I mean, she's my baby
But she makes me get avuncular
And when my monkey is jumpin'
I got no time to make it up to her
I fantasize about the hospital
The army, asylum, confinement in prison
Any place where there's a cot to clear my vision
I spit it out
Whatever's in my mouth
Just like that Black Bat Licorice
Yeah, that Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice
Yeah
I wanna cut out my tongue and let ya' hold onto it for me
'Cause without my skill to amplify my sounds it might get boring
I've got the wit of the staircase with atomic clock precision
And the phases of the moon directin' all of my decisions like this
When I need to know, I play dumb like Columbo
And get my feelin's hurt and move to NY like I'm Dumbo
Don't you want to lose the part of the brain that has opinions?
To not even know what you are doing, or care about yourself or your species in the billions
Yeah, I have to spit it out
Ah, whatever's in my mouth
Ah, I have to spit it out (behave yourself)
Just like that Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice
That Black Bat Licorice, I never liked it, I never will
Now state the same damn thing with the violin
Whatever you feed me
I'll feed you right back
But it will do no good9Embed
