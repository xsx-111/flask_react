Lazaretto LyricsOh, my veins are blue and connected
And every single bone in my brain is electric
But I dig ditches like the best of 'em
Yo trabajo duro
Como en madera y yeso
Como en madera y yeso
And even God Herself has fewer plans than me
But she never helps me out with my scams for free, though
She grabs a stick and then she points it at me
When I say nothing, I say everything
Yeah, when I say nothing, I say everything
They threw me down in a lazaretto
Born rottin', bored rotten
Makin' models of people I used to know
Out of coffee and cotton
And all my illegitimate kids have begotten
Thrown down to the wolves, made feral for nothin'
Quarantined on the Isle of Man
And I'm trying to escape any way that I can, oh
Any way that I can, oh
Damn, I have no time left, time is lost
No time at all, throw it in a garbage can
And I shake God's hand
I jump up and let Her know when I can
This is how I'm gonna do it
They wanna burn down the prison
They're lighting fires with the cash of the masses
And like the dough, I don't fall down
I'm so Detroit, I make it rise from the ashes
Yeah, that's it54Embed
