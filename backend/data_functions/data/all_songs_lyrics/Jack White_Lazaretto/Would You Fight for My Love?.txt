Would You Fight for My Love? LyricsIt's not enough that I love you
There's all these things I have to prove to you
You use the sun to erase the past
But you think it only raises for you
Well, I'm afraid of bein' hurt, that's true
But not afraid of any physical pain
Just as I am always scared of water
But not afraid of standin' out in the rain
The last person in the room she hurt
Was the person that the loved the most
Nobody noticed I was down on the rug
I'm gettin' better at becoming a ghost
I know that you want more
But would you fight for my love?
And I've hurt you before
But can you ignore my love?
No walkin' out my backdoor
Lookin' back for my love
I know that you want more
But would you fight for my love?
People do their best to not let passion begin
It's dead before it has a chance to start
And so there I am, the caretaker of sin
To your abandoned and malignant heart
It's such a pleasure, to sing with you together
Makin' love when there is nobody home
But I can't kiss you 'til you lift up your chin
You have to want to stop being alone
I want you to fight for my love
I want you to fight for my love
I want you to fight for my love20Embed
