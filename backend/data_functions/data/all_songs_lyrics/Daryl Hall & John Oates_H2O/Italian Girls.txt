Italian Girls LyricsI see, I see, I see, all the monumental illumination
I see, I see, I see the greatest works of art in western civilization
Ooh, but where are (Ooh)
Tell me, where are (Ooh)
Ooh, but where are the Italian girls?
Faccia bella, (Ooh) cara mia, (Won't ya tell me?) Somebody tell me...Where are the Italian girls?
Faccia bella, (Ooh) cara mia, (cara mia) Somebody tell me...Where are the Italian girls?
I drink I drink I drink too much vino rosso no more amarone
I eat I eat I eat so much pasta basta I'm so full and yet so lonely
Ooh, but where are (Ooh)
Tell me, where are (Ooh)
Ooh, but where are the Italian girls?
Faccia bella, (Ooh) cara mia, (Won't ya tell me?) Somebody tell me...Where are the Italian girls?
Faccia bella, (Ooh) cara mia, (cara mia) Somebody tell me... So tell me where, oh, where...
I see Sophia on the silver screena
There must be more like her in Roma
I believe, I believe, I believe that she must be somewhere and I know I'm gonna find her
'Cause I need, I need, I need some little dream come true please tell me where
They're keeping ya
Ooh, but where are (Ooh)
Tell me, where are (Ooh)
Ooh, but where are the Italian girls?
Faccia bella, (Ooh) cara mia, (Tell me where) Somebody tell me...Where are the Italian girls?
Faccia bella, cara mia, (Tell me now) Won't ya tell me...
Faccia bella, (Ooh) cara mia, Somebody tell me...Tell me where they're hiding tonight...
Faccia bella, cara mia, (Ooh, please) Won't ya tell me...
Faccia bella, (Wanna know) cara mia, (tell me where) Somebody tell me...Tell me where they're hiding tonight
