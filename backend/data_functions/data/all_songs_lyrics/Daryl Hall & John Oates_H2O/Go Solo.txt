Go Solo LyricsYou need to make it on your own
You wanna shake it, go it alone
Whatever happened?
I did alright by you
I can feel the passion girl
It's still as strong
Though the places have turned around
Oh I can be the one to wait
You take the easy way out
I'm no one to doubt
(If that ain't enough)
Ain't enough for you
Go solo
(You can take the lead)
Play a brand new part
Go solo, solo
You say there's trouble in paradise
I'm only joking but you better be right
Oh, whatever happens, there ain't no turnin' 'round
I can understand you need to find yourself
Make a way without any help
Oh I can be the one who waits
To take the only way out
I'm no one to doubt
(If that ain't enough)
Ain't enough for you
Go solo
(You can take the lead)
Play a brand new part
Go solo, solo
I don't mind your flying blind
Just shake it up and take it to the break this time
Shake it up and take it to the break this time
This time, oh
Shake it up and take it, shake it up and take it girl
(If that ain't enough)
Ain't enough for you
Go solo, go solo
(You can take the lead)
Play a brand new part
Go solo
How could you go solo?
(If it ain't enough)
Ain't enough for you
Go solo, oh girl
(You can take the lead)
Play a brand new part
Go solo
Oh, shake it up and take it, shake it up and take it
(If that ain't enough)
Ain't enough for you
Go solo
How could you go solo?
(You can take the lead)
Play a new part
Go solo ooh
Shake it
(If that ain't enough)
Ain't enough for you
Go solo, soloEmbed
