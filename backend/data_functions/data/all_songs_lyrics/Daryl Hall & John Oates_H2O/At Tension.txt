At Tension LyricsI'd like to join the army
Don't want to join the war
I'd take my place in line hell (hell)
Never go AWOL
We keep on marching forward
Never will retreat
Don't let the enemy inside you
That's the beginning of defeat
All good soliders stand (to arms)
All good soliers try (so hard)
To follow orders never asking why
I'm standing at tension
(At tension)
I'm standing at (tension)
I'm standing at tension
(At tension)
I'm standing at (tension)
So ill at ease with you
Afraid to make a move
Yeah
Now a shaky finger on the trigger
Ready aim to please
Now how can such a little bullet
Drop big soldier to his knees
But there's no warning only waiting
When a Strangelove drops the bomb
All this fighting it can hurt you
But its the little wounds that do the harm
All good soldiers stand (to arms)
One good solider tries (so hard)
He follows orders never questioning why
Never questioning why
I'm standing at tension
(At tension)
I'm standing at (tension)
I'm standing at tension
(At tension)
Standing at (tension)
So ill at ease with you
Afraid to make a move yeah
All good soldiers stand (to arms)
All good soliders try (so hard)
To follow orders never asking why
They never asking why
I'm standing at tension
(At tension)
I'm standing at (tension)
I'm standing at tension
(At tension)
Standing at (tension)
So ill at ease with you
Afraid to make a moveEmbed
