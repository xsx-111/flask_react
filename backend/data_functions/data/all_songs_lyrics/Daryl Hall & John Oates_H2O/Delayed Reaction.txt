Delayed Reaction LyricsYou strike a low blow
You fight a dirty fight
Right to the heart you're putting me away
Time was movin' slow
But I was in control
There were so many things I should've said
But couldn't think of one word
(Delayed reaction) oh yeah
At first I was ashamed
Then I was inflamed
I wanted to hurt you
Say that (delayed reaction) oh no
At first I was alright
And then I had to fight
I wanted to hurt you
I wanted to hurt you so
There was a backlash
No I couldn't let it pass
I was so mad I couldn't keep it down
I made it real tough
Ooh I had to blow you off
I couldn't stand it having you around
I couldn't stand the sound, no
(Delayed reaction) oh yeah
At first I was ashamed
And then I was inflamed
I wanted to hurt you
Say that (delayed reaction) oh no
At first I was alright
And then I had to fight with you
I wanted to hurt you
I wanted to hurt you so
But if the rage is right
Then you better be wrong
'Cause if I force a fight well then I'm twice a fool
Ooh, I could've listened more
Was that what you were waiting for?
I can't imagine why
I can't imagine why
I can't imagine why you'd wanna let it go
I didn't wanna blow but
(Delayed reaction oh yeah)
At first I was ashamed
And then I was inflamed
I wanted to hurt you
Say that delayed reaction oh no
At first I was alright
And then I had to fight with you
I wanted to hurt you so
(Delayed reaction oh yeah)
Ooh I had to fight, fight, fight you
(Delayed reaction oh no)
You strike a low blow, you fight a dirty fight
(Delayed reaction oh yeah)
What could I say, I lost my head, I didn't mean it girl
(Delayed reaction oh no)
Ooh baby, ooh baby
I can't imagine why you wanna let it go
(Delayed reaction)
Ooh, and if I force a fight then I'm twice a fool
(Delayed reaction oh no)
I can't imagine why, I can't imagine whyEmbed
