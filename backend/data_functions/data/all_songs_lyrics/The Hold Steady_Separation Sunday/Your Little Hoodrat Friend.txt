Your Little Hoodrat Friend Lyrics
Your little hoodrat friend makes me sick
But after I get sick I just get sad
'Cause it burns being broke
Hurts to be heartbroken
And always being both must be a drag

She's been calling me again
She's been calling me again

Your little hoodrat friend's been calling me again
And I can't stand all the things that she sticks into her skin
Like sharpened ballpoint pens and steel guitar strings
She says it hurts, but it's worth it

Tiny little text etched into her neck
It said "Jesus lived and died for all your sins"
She's got blue black ink and it's scratched into her lower back
Says "Damn right, I'll rise again"
Yeah, damn right, she'll rise again
Damn right, she'll rise again

And I've been dusted in the dark up in Penetration Park
And I've been plastered
I've been shaking hard and searching in a dirty storefront church
And I've been plowed
But I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
What makes you think I'm getting with your little hoodrat friend?

Your little hoodrat friend got me high though
When we were 17 and stuck up, up in Osseo
She said, "It's funny how true love
Gets troubled by still water
And washed up in the Mississippi River"

Her claddagh ring was pointed at the people
She said, "St. Theresa came to me in dreams"
She said, "I ain't gonna do anything sexual with you
I'm kinda saving myself for the scene"

And I've been dusted in the dark up in Penetration Park
And I've been plastered
I've been shaking hard and searching in a dirty storefront church
And I've been plowed

But I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
What makes you think I'm getting with your little hoodrat friend?
And she said city center used to be the center of our scene
Now city center's over
No one really goes there
And then we used to drink beneath this railroad bridge
Some nights the bus wouldn't even stop
There was just too many kids

I was waiting for my ride and I got jumped from behind
I got punctured
I got stopped by the cops and they found it in my socks
And I got probed

But I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
I ain't never been with your little hoodrat friend
What makes you think I'm getting with your little hoodrat friend?5Embed
