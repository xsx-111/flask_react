Crucifixion Cruise LyricsHalleluiah came to in the confession booth
Infested with infection
And smiling on an abscessed tooth
Runnin' out on residue
And crashing through the vestibule
The crucifixion cruise
She climbed the cross and found she liked the view
Sat reflecting on the resurrection
And dreaming about an old connection
Talking loud over lousy connections
She put her mouth around a difficult question
She said "Lord, what do you recommend
To a real sweet girl who's made some not-sweet friends?"
"Lord, what would you prescribe
To a real soft girl who's having real hard times?"Embed
