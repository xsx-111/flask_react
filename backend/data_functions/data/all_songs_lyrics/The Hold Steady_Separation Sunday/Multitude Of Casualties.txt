Multitude Of Casualties LyricsShe drove it like she stole it
She stole it fast and with a multitude of casualties
She said I shipped it out from Boulder
Packed in coffee grounds and wrapped around in dryer sheets
We spent a few months just wandering the Sonoma
High as hell and shivering and smashed
We were trying for a vision quest
We opened up three buttons
And all we saw was desert trash
It's a funny bit of chemistry
How a cool car makes a guy seem that much cooler
And it's worth noting that throughout history
Kids come around the corner to a multitude of casualties
We spent a few hours circling the city
Like a hawk out on the highways
We were looking around for something that just died
We heard the deacon's hopeful eulogy
At least in dying you don't have to deal with
New Wave for a second time
And after your party we got off the grid
Oh we just couldn't get with all those clever kids
And now we forage on the frontage roads
We drive at nights
I guess it just feels somewhat safer
Yeah, we scrounge around for sustenance
We mostly eat it in the back half of the theaters
We spent a few years nodding off in matinees
We were high as hell and shivering and smashed
Yeah, we were hoping for an action adventure
Or something loud that we could feel through all the Feminax
And after the movie
We got off the ground
I got in your car
Crawled around in Lowertown
While she was at The Citadel
He was getting high as hell
When she came to in the matinee
She was asking 'round for someplace else to stay
While he was down in Lowertown
She was feeling out the 5:30 folk mass
And the night that she got born again
He was getting with her little hoodrat friend
They did "Wade Into The Water" into "One Tin Soldier"
She started to cry
Yeah, youth services always find a way
To get their bloody cross
Into your druggy little messed up teenage life1Embed
