Hornets! Hornets! LyricsShe says "Always remember never to trust me"
Ah, she said that the first night that she met me
She said "There's gonna come a time when I'm gonna have to go
With whoever's gonna get me the highest"
She said "I won't be much for conversation
If we go and do the rest of this"
"And I've never been much for conservation
I kinda dig these awkward silences"
She's got those Bones Brigade videos
She knew them back and forth, she slept with so many skaters
She had the place to herself, she had a couple hundred bucks
And he had nothing but the number
I like the guy who always answers the door
He always knows what you came to his house for
She said "I won't be much for all this Humbert Humbert stuff"
"I've never really done that much of this"
And I have to really try so hard not to fall in love
I have to concentrate when we kiss
She mouthed the words along to "Running Up That Hill"
That song got scratched into her soul
And he never heard that song before, but he still got the metaphor
Yea, he knew some people that switched places before
I like the crowds at the really big shows
People touching people that they don't even know, yo
I guess the heavy stuff ain't quite at its heaviest
By the time it gets out to suburban Minneapolis
We were living up at Nicollet and 66th
With three skaters and some hoodrat chick
Drove the wrong way down 169
