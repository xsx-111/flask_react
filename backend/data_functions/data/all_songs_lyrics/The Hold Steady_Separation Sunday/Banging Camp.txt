Banging Camp LyricsHolly wore a string around her finger
She said it helps her to remember
All the nights that we got over
And besides, it ties her outfit all together
Holly wore a string around her finger
There are strings attached to every single lover
But they still can't even tether us together
Listen to the back of the theater
I think they really love one another
There are strings attached to every single lover
When they say great white sharks
They mean the kind in big black cars
When they say killer whales
They mean they wailed on him 'til they killed him
Up in penetration park
Holly wore a cross to ward them off
She said if they think you're a Christian
Then they won't bring in the dogs
And if they think you're a Catholic
Then they'll want to meet your boss
Holly wore a cross to ward them off
Yeah, there's camps down by the banks of the river
And it's sketchy in the night
But they mostly lay low in the light
Hey sweet recovery, come on
Won't you wade into the water with me?
You know, there's camps down by the banks of the river
When they say black and tans
You know they mean the kind from the cans
We don't got time to mix it all together
I'm a very busy man, man
She said I dig those awkward silences
Cause I grew up in denial
And went to school in Massachusetts
He said hi, I like to party on the problem blocks
And I can't stand it when the banging stops
I saw her at the party pit
Yea, she was shaky but still trying to shake it
Half naked and three-quarters wasted
She was completely alone
I saw him at the riverbank
He was breaking bread and giving thanks
With crosses made of pipes and planks
Leaned up against the nitrous tanks
And he said take a hit
Hold your breath and I'll dunk your head
Then when you wake up again
Yeah, you'll be high as hell and born again
Yeah, there's strings attached to every single lover
Yeah, there's strings attached to every single loverEmbed
