Charlemagne In Sweatpants LyricsWhen he's holding then the streetlamps
They seem an awful lot like spotlights
Yeah, sometimes Charlemagne gets uptight
Running numbers between bars
Running girls between the cars
And sometimes Charlemagne feels alright
Alright
Alright
Charlemagne had eyes just like a lover
Last winter there was weather
And his eyes they iced right over
Cassanova's in the corner and he's asking for a dance
Speed shooters driving 'round
And coming down
And trying to hook up with an entrance ramp
Tramps like us and we like tramps
Yeah, Charlemagne's got something in his sweatpants
Holly was supposed to be at CCD
But she was walking around on shady streets
She was looking around for something
She could take up to a party
And it's not like she's enslaved
It's more like she's enthralled
She don't need it but she likes it
So she always makes that call
First it makes her feel tall
And then it makes her feel small
And it's all a sweet fleeting feeling
We did the "been caught stealing"
Into "dancing on the ceiling"
And you're damn right we danced
Charlemagne's got something in his sweatpants
Do you want me to tell it like it's boy meets girl and the rest is history
Or do you want it like a murder mystery?
I'm gonna tell it like a comeback story
Cause when we left we were defeated and depressed
And when we arrived we were ripping high
We had a gun in the glove box
We had some sweet stuff tucked into our socks
And Jesus Christ in all His gloryEmbed
