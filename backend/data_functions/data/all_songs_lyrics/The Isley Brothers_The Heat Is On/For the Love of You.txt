For the Love of You Lyrics
Yeah, well well well, yeah-heh
Yeah, hey, hey
Ooh

Driftin' on a memory
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Than with you, yeah
Lovin' you, well, well, well
Day will make a way for night
All we'll need is candle lights
And a song, yeah
Soft and long, well, ooh

Glad to be
Here alone with a lover unlike no other
Sad to see
A new horizon slowly comin' into view, yeah

I wanna be living for the love of you
Ah, yes I am
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
Alright now
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Lovely as a ray of sun
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
That touches me when the morning comes
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Feels good to me, yeah
My love and me (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Smoother than a gentle breeze
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Flowin' through my mind with ease
Soft as can be (Ooh, ooh, ooh), well
When you're lovin' me
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
When you're lovin' me, ooh

Love to be
Ridin' the waves of your love
Enchanted with your touch and
It seems to me
We could sail together in and out of mystery, well

I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving is for the love of you
You got me, girl
I wanna be living for the love of you
Alright now
All that I'm giving, giving, is for the love of you
Ah, yes, I am
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Paradise I have within
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Can't feel insecure again
You're the key
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Well, and this I see
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, I see
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now and then I lose my way
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Using words that try to say
What I feel (Ooh, ooh, ooh), yeah
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Love is real
Oh, love is real, ooh

I might as well
Sign my name on a card which could say it better
Time will tell
'Cause it seems that I've done just about all that I can do

I know that I'm living for the love of you
Oh, yes, I am
I know that I'm living for the love, love of you
Every, every day, I'm, living, for, the love of you
I'm living, for the love
Each and every day, I, I, oh oh, I
Oh, yes, I am
I wanna say it one more time
Said I'm living for the love
Each and every day, I, I, oh oh, I
Lord knows I am
Write that down
Said that I'm living for the love, love of you
