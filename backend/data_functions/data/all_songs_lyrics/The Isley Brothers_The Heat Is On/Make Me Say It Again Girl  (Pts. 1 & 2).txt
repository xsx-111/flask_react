Make Me Say It Again Girl  (Pts. 1 & 2) Lyrics
Oh, I believe you are a rainbow
All the heaven I need to see
You're the promise everlasting
Ah, and where you are I hope to be

And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are
You're all I need

Whatever pain's inside, you make it better
Ah, you seem to realize when I'm concerned
You are the only one who goes through the changes
Ah, giving my life directions if I am turned

And oh, make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I need, oh yes you are
You're all I need
How am I worthy of love from an angel?
Princess imperial of my soul
Don't really matter if you choose not to answer
Hoping that what I've revealed you already know

Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
Make me say it again, girl
You're all I need, oh yes you are, you're all...
You're all I, ooh ooh
You're all I need

Oh, I love you, I love you, girl, oh oh
You're all I, ooh ooh, all I need, all I need
Ah, sweet lady
