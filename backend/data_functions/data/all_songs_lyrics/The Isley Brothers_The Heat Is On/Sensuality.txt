Sensuality Lyrics
Here I lay, so close to you
Knowing that you'll see me through
Another night when we'll feel the joy
The joy that makes me smile more and more

And every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
And every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Nah, oh, oh babe

It seems that time moves much too fast
Love is here and love will last
Your body's warm and sure to please
Lady of love, take all of me

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
No, ooh, oh

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Aah oh ooh aah

And through the night, the touch of love will be
Forever strong and forever sweet
And giving in to passion's flow
Creates a world we want to grow

Every day I dream
Of holding you close to me
Every night I find
Me touching your lips with mine
Every day-hey-hey
Oh, every night
Every day-hey-hey
Whoa-oh, every, every night
Every day-hey-hey
No, oh, every, every night
Every day I dream, oh, I dream
No, oh, each and every night
You're moving me, soothing me, girl
Loving, touching, feeling, oh oh
And I'm feeling good
Oh, feels goodEmbed
