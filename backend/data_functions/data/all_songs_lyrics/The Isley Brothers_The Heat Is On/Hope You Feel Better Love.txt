Hope You Feel Better Love Lyrics
Who is to say you'll be livin' in sadness
Hope you feel better Jove
Now's not the time to give in to the madness
Hope you feel better love, better love

Thought you were sharin' and found you were takin'
Hope you find better love
Try it on me and there'll be no forsaken
Gotta find better love, better love

Hope you feel better love, girl
Hope you find better love
Hope you feel better love, girl
Better than before

Runnin' away you gave in to deceivin'
Hope you find better love
When you find out it was for the wrong reason
Hope you find better love, better love

I hope you feel better love
Find it, baby
I hope you find it
I hope you feel better love
Find it, find it, baby, find better love
