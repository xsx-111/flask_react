Tremor Christ LyricsWinded is the sailor drifting by the storm
Wounded is the organ he left all bloodied on the shore
Gorgeous was his savior, sees her, drowning in his wake
A-daily taste the salt of her tears but, a chance blamed fate
Little secrets, tremors, turned to quake
The smallest oceans still get big big waves
Ransom paid the devil. He whispers pleasing words
Triumphant are the angels if they can get there first
Little secrets, tremors, turned to quake
The smallest oceans still get big big waves
I'll decide
Take the dive
Take my time
Not my life
Wait for signs
Believe in lies
To get by
It's divine
You know what it's like
Turns the bow back tows and drops the line
Puts his faith and love in tremor christ1Embed
