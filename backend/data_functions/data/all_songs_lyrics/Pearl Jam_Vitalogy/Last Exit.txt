Last Exit Lyrics
Lives opened and trashed
"Look ma, watch me crash"
No time to question
Why'd nothing last
Grasp and hold on
We're dyin' fast
Soon be over
And I will relent

Let the ocean swell, dissolve 'way my past
Three days, and maybe longer
Won't even know I've left

Under your tongue
I'm like a tab
I will give you what
You're not supposed to have
Under my breath
I swear by sin
For better or for worse
A best we began

Let the sun climb, oh, burn 'way my mask
Three days, and maybe longer
Shed my skin at last
Shed
Shed
Let the sun shine, burn 'way my mask
Three days, and maybe longer
Won't ever find me here

Let the ocean dissolve 'way my past
Four days, and not much longer

Let my spirit pass
Uh
This is, this is
This is, this is
This is, this is
My
