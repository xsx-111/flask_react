Immortality LyricsVacate is the word
Vengeance has no place so near to her
Cannot find the comfort in this world
Artificial tear
Vessel stabbed, next up, volunteers?
Vulnerable. Wisdom can't adhere
A truant finds home
And a wish to hold on
But there's a trapdoor in the sun
Immortality
As privileged as a whore
Victims in demand for public show
Swept out through the cracks beneath the door
Holier than thou. How?
Surrendered, executed, anyhow
Scrawl dissolved. Cigar box on the floor
A truant finds home
And I wish to hold on too
But saw the trapdoor in the sun
I cannot stop the thought of running in the dark
Coming up a which way sign
All good truants must decide
Oh, stripped and sold mom
An auctioned forearm
And whiskers in the sink
Truants move on
Cannot stay long
Some die just to live5Embed
