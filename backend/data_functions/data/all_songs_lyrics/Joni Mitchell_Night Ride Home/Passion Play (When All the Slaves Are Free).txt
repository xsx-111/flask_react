Passion Play (When All the Slaves Are Free) Lyrics
Magdalene is trembling like a washing on a line
Trembling and gleaming
Never before was a man so kind
Never so redeeming

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Ecstasy, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get?)

I am up a sycamore, looking through the leaves
A sinner of some position
Who in the world can this heart healer be
This magical physician

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Misery, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Oh ho)

Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded, they come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes (Oh ho)
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me
From the middle of unrest
They think is light is squandered
But he sees a stray in the wilderness
And I see how far I've wandered

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Apathy, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Oh ho)
Enter the multitudes
The walking wounded, they come to this diver of the heart
Of the multitudes (Oh ho)
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

Oh, all around the marketplace, the buzzing of the flies
The buzzing and the stinging
Divinely barren and wickedly wise
The killer nails are ringing

Enter the multitudes
In Exxon blue, in radiation rose
Tragedy, now you tell me
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work
When all the slaves are free?

(Oh ho)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)
(Who're you gonna get?)2Embed
