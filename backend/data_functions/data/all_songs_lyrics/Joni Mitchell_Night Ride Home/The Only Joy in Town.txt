The Only Joy in Town Lyrics
I want to paint a picture, Botticelli style
Instead of Venus on a clam, I'd paint this flower child
You are the air my flowers breathe, he calls, and the ladies turn around
On the first day of Spring, I'm looking at the only joy around

He's the only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
The only joy in town

The Spanish steps are crowded, bunch of bodies brooding there
Deadpan sidewalk vendors hustling vacant stares
Making all the more exceptional this fool in a flower crown
On the first day of Spring, I'm looking at the only joy in town

He's the only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
The only joy in town, Botticelli black boy
Botticelli black boy

The Botticelli black boy with the fuchsias in his hair
Is breathing in women like oxygen on the Spanish stairs
In my youth I would have followed him all through this terracotta town
On the first day of Spring, we'd dance and sing and be the only joy around
We'd be the only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy in town, Botticelli black boy
He's the only joy I've found all day

At night these streets are empty, where does everybody go?
Where are the brash and tender rooms in Roman candle glow?
Where are Fellini's circus' La Dolce Vita clowns
On the first day of Spring, I'm looking at the only joy around

The only joy around, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
He's the only joy in town

Botticelli black boy
He is the only joy in town, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
The only joy I found, Botticelli black boy
He is the only joy in town, Botticelli black boyEmbed
