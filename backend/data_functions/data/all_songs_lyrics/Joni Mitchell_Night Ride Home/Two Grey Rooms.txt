Two Grey Rooms Lyrics
Tomorrow is Sunday, now there's only one day left to go
'Til you walk by below my window
The weekends drive me mad, holidays are all too sad
'Cause you don't go below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here with a view
When you walk by below my window

You look so youthful, time has been untruthful
Heaven knows I loved you thirty years ago
Hot days, your shirt's undone, rainy days, you run
Oh, and then you fade so fast below my window

No one knows I'm here
One day I just disappeared
And I took these two grey rooms up here with a view
Only when you walk by below my window
When you walk by

Below my window
Below my window
Hey hey
Below my window
Below my window
Below my windowEmbed
