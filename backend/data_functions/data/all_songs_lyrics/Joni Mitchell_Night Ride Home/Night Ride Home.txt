Night Ride Home Lyrics
Once in a while, in a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist invented this
4th of July night ride home

Hula girls and caterpillar
Tractors in the sand
The ukulele man, the fireworks
This 4th of July night ride home

I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the overkill, far from the overload

Back at the bar, the band tears down
But out here in the headlight beams
The silver powerlines gleam
On this 4th of July night ride home

Round the curve and a big dark horse
Red taillights on his hide
Is keeping right alongside, rev for stride
4th of July night ride home
I love the man beside me
We love the open road
No phones 'til Friday
Far from the undertow, far from the overload

Once in awhile, in a big blue moon
There comes a night like this
Like some surrealist invented this
4th of July night ride homeEmbed
