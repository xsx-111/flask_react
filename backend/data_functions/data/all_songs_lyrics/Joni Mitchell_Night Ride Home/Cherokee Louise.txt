Cherokee Louise Lyrics
Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We are crawling on our knees
We've got flashlights and batteries
We got cold cuts from the fridge

Last year about this time
We used to climb up in the branches
Just to sway there in some breeze
Now the cops on the street
They want Cherokee Louise

People like to talk
Tongues are waggin' over fences
They're waggin' on the phones
All their doors are locked
God she can't even come to our house
But I know where she'll go

To the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend Cherokee Louise
Ever since we turned thirteen
It's like a minefield walking to the door
Going out to get your third degree
And comin' in you get the Third World War

Tuesday after school
We put our pennies on the rails
And when the train rolled by
We were jumpin' round like fools
Going "Look no heads or tails"
Going "Look my lucky prize"

Then she runs home to her foster dad
He open up his zipper
And he yanks her to her knees
Oh please be here - please
My friend Cherokee Louise

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel
In the Broadway bridge
We're crawling on our knees
I've got Archie and Silver Screen
I know where she is
She's in the place where you can stand
And press your hands like it was bubble bath
In dust piled high as me
Down under the street
My friend, poor Cherokee Louise

Oh Cheeroke Louise, poor Cherokee Louise
Cherokee Louise, Cherokee LouiseEmbed
