The Windfall (Everything for Nothing) Lyrics
So you think I should buy you a car?
Why, because Elvis did?
Darlin' come on

Because Elvis gave 'em cars, you think I'm cheap
And you're hard done by
Look, you live here like a star, rent-free suite
Big blue pool that you sun by

Trips to tropic shores
Clothes from fancy stores
You want too much, you want too badly
You want everything for nothing

Going to the church
You chant for my downfall
Chanting for my house, my friends
You want it all

The pillows on my bed
The visions in my head
You want too much, you want too badly
You want everything for nothing
In the land of litigation
The courts are like game shows
Take what's behind the curtain, the jury cries
I'm not going to be the jackpot
At the end of your perjured rainbow
Not if local justice has even one good eye

Oh it's not like I was blind, I saw
But I took no action
As you began to climb, green-clawed
Dissatisfaction

It wasn't hard to guess
That the end would be a mess
You want too much, you want too badly
You want everything for nothing

In the land of mass frustration
The judges are sleeping
Counting wooly little lawyers and grinding their teeth
Outside my sleepless window
The Hollywood sirens are shrieking
While down some search-lit alley runs some lost belief
Oh I'm tangled in your lies, your scam
Your spider web
Spit spun between the trees, doors slam
You want my head

You'd eat your young alive
For a Jaguar in the drive
You lie too much, you lie too badly
You want everything for nothingEmbed
