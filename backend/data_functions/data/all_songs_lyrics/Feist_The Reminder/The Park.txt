The Park LyricsWhy would he come
Back through the park
You thought that you saw him
But no you did not
It's not him who'd come across
The sea to surprise you
Not him who would know
Where in London to find you
With sadness so real
That it populates
The city and leaves
You homeless again
Steam from the cup
And snow on the path
The seasons have changed
From the present to past
The past
The past
Turns whole to half
The past
Why would he come
Back through the park
You thought that you saw him
But no you did not
Who can be sure
Of anything through
The distance that keeps you
From knowing the truth
Why would you think
Your boy could become
The man who could make you
Sure he was the one
The one
My one
My one1Embed
