The Limit to Your Love LyricsClouds part
Just to give us a little sun

There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

There's a limit to you care
So carelessly there
Is it truth or dare?
There's a limit to your care

I love, I love, I love
This dream of going upstream
I love, I love, I love
The trouble that you give me
I know, I know, I know
That only I can save me
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
Right down the road
There's a limit to your love
Like a waterfall in slow motion
Like a map with no ocean
There's a limit to your love
Your love, your love, your love

I can't read your smile
It should be written on your face
I'm piecing it together
There's something out of place
Oh

I love, I love, I love
This dream of going upstream
I love, I love, I love
The trouble that you give me
I know, I know, I know
That only I can save me
I'll go, I'll go, I'll go
Out on the road

Because there is no limit
There's no limit
No limit, no limit, no limit
Limit to my love1Embed
