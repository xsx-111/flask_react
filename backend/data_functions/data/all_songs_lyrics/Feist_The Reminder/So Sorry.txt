So Sorry Lyrics
I'm sorry
Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize, I was acting all wrong
So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh, actions of mine
When patience is in short supply

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh, we, we could
Hold each other tight, tonight

We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
And no one knows where the shore is
We're divided by the oceans
And the only thing I know is
That the answer isn't for us
No, the answer isn't for us
I'm sorry
Two words I always think
Oh, after you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
And we, we could
We could hold each other tight
Tonight
Tonight..
Tonight...
Tonight....2Embed
