So Sorry (One Mic Mix) LyricsI'm sorry
Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong
So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh, actions of mine
When patience is in short supply
We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh we, we could hold each other tight
Tonight
We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
No one, knows where the shore is
We're divided by the ocean
And the only thing I know is
The answer it isn't for us
No the answer isn't for us
I'm sorry
Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong
We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
No we, we could, we could hold each other tight
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...
Tonight...Embed
