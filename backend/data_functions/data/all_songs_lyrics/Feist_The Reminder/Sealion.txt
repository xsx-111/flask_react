Sealion Lyrics
Sea lion

Sea lion woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And rooster crows
Sea lion woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And rooster crows

Sea lion woman
Dressed in red
Smile at the man
When you wake up in his bed

Sea lion woman
Dressed in black
Wink at the man
And then stab him in his back
Sea lion woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And rooster crows

Sea lion woman
Dressed in white
Marry the man and you'll
Spend a long, sweet life

Sea lion woman
Dressed in green
Silver lining
And golden seams

Sea lion woman
Dressed in blue
Call on man and hope
He knows what he can do

Sea lion woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And rooster crows
Sea lion woman
She drink coffee
She drink tea
And rooster crows

Sea lion woman
Dressed in blue
Call on man and hope
He knows what he can do

Sea lion woman
Dressed in red
Smile at the man
When you wake up in his bed

Sea lion womanEmbed
