Intuition LyricsWhat gives what helps the intuition?
I know I'll know
I won't have to be shown
The way home
And it's not about a boy
Although although
They can lead you
Break or defeat you
A destination known
Only by the one
Whose fate is overgrown
Piecemeal can break your home in half
A love is not complete with only heat
And they can tease you
Break or complete you
And it came a heat wave
A merciful save
You choose you chose
Poetry over prose
A map is more unreal than where you've been
Or how you feel
A map is more unreal than where you've been
Or how you feel
And it's impossible to tell
How important someone was
And what you might have missed out on
And how he might have changed it all
And how you might have changed it all for him
And how he might have changed it all
And how you might have changed it all for him
Did I, did I
Did I, did I
Did I, did I
Did I, did I
Did I did I miss out on you?1Embed
