How My Heart Behaves LyricsWhat grew
What grew
And what grew and inside who
First so simple was the vow
Then the chorus sang about
Your shoulder
The mooring for me
Like water lost in the sea
The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake
I'm a stem now
Pushing the drought aside
Opening up
Fanning my yellow eye
On the ferry
That's making the waves wave
Illumination
This is how my heart behaves
The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake
(How her heart behaves)
The rain making me cry
(How her heart behaves)
Then the wind comes
Fanning my yellow eye
(How her heart behaves)
The waves wave the waves wave
(How her heart behaves)
This is how my heart behaves
A cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake
The cold heart will burst
If mistrusted first
And a calm heart will break
When given a shake
And what grew
What grew
What grew and inside who4Embed
