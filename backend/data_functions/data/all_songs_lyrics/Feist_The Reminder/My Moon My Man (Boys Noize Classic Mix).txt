My Moon My Man (Boys Noize Classic Mix) LyricsMy moon, the moon, my man, my moon, the moon, my man
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
My moon, my man, so changeable and such a loveable lamb to me
My care, my coat, leave on a high note, there's nowhere to go but on
Heart on my sleeve, not where it should be, the song's out of key again
My moon's white face, what day and what phase ?
It's the calendar page again
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
My moon and me not as good as we've been
It's the dirtiest clean I know
My care, my coat, leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go, there's nowhere to go
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
My moon, the moon, my man, my moon, the moon, my man
My moon, the moon, my man, my moon, the moon, my man
My moon, the moon, my man, my moon, the moon, my man
My moon, the moon, my man, my moon, the moon, my man
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it please
Take it slow, take it easy on me
Shed some light, shed some light on it pleaseEmbed
