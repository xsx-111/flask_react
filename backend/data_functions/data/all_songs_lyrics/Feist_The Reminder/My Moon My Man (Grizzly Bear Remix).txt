My Moon My Man (Grizzly Bear Remix) LyricsMy moon, my man
So changeable and
Such a loveable lamb to me
My care, my coat
Leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go but on
Heart on my sleeve
Not where it should be
The song's out of key again
My moon's white face
What day and what phase
It's the calendar page again
Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please
Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please
My moon and me
Not as good as we've been
It's the dirtiest clean I know
My care, my coat
Leave on a high note
There's nowhere to go
There's nowhere to go
Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please
Take it slow
Take it easy on me
And shed some light
Shed some light on me please
My moon
The moon, my man
My moon
The moon, my man
My moon
The moon, my man
My moon
The moon, my manEmbed
