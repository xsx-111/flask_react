Sealion (Chromeo Remix) LyricsSea Lion woman
She drinks coffee
She drinks tea
And we're so cold
Sea Lion woman
She drinks coffee
She drinks tea
And we're so cold
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in red
Smile at the man when you wake up in his bed
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in black
We got the man then stab him in his back
Sea Lion woman
She drinks coffee
She drinks tea
And we're so cold
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in white
Marry the man and then spend a long, sweet night
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in green
Silver lining and golden seams
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in blue
Call a man
And he knows what he can do
Sea Lion woman
She drinks coffee
She drinks tea
And we're so cold
Sea Lion woman
She drinks coffee
She drinks tea
And we're so cold
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in blue
Call on the man
And he knows what he can do
Sea Lion woman
Dressed in red
Smile at the man when you wake up in his bed
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion woman
Sea Lion, Sea Lion, Sea Lion
Sea Lion womanEmbed
