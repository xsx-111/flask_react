Past in Present LyricsThe scarlet letter isn't black
Gotta know who's got your back
Because they're right in front of you
Because they're telling you the truth
So much present inside my present
Inside my present and
So, so much past inside my present
Inside my present inside my present
So, so...
Feeling it from dark to bright
When a wrong becomes a right
When a mountain fills with light
It's a volcano, it's a volcano
It's a volcano, it's a volcano
So much present inside my present
Inside my present and so
So much past inside my present
Inside my present inside my present
And so
So much past inside my present
Inside my present
Inside my present
And so
So much past inside my present
Inside my present
Inside my presentEmbed
