I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as itâ€™s free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
I want your drama, the touch of your hand
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance

Want your bad romance
Romance, romance, romance...
Caught, caught, caught...
I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Caught in a bad romance
