Conquistadors Lyrics
It's a new day, motherfucker

Live cause I got no choice

This is for blacks, whites, Asians, Hispanics
Christians, Muslims, Moors and Malayans
From north, west, east, south, Pacific to Atlantic
Binary Star, we mold mountains out of granite

Feel the rhapsody
Fill this joint to capacity
Senim grasp mics with pit-bull tenacity
These emcees adheeds
My platoon never at ease
Deadly armada ready to seize the seas
Deep as twenty thousand leagues
Lyricist abyss
Drown rappers in my syllabus
Dive fifty fathoms
Still ain't met the depth that Silla's is
Chameleons can't adapt to this
Snatch a pebble, grasshopper, we done mastered this
No need to practice this
Cause every rhyme on my papyrus
Is naturally disasterous
I rock many fans, many hands clap to this
In many lands, from here to Minneapolis
These civil rights activists
Don't want none of me
Here's a brief summary:
I'm ripping foes apart
So remain seated like Rosa Parks
Because I bust like Montgomery
Suddenly
I let you have it
Nobody's next to grab it
I got lyrics to Go-Go like Inspector Gadget
In a bad habit fiending for the potency
I'm the Narcotics Anonymous Dope Emcee
On the hunt like scavenger
For months on the calendar
Any challenger trying to test this caliber
Binary Star battle your villainous characters to the end
With poet heroics like Super Friends

Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson
Dynamic combination
Get in simple complications
Burning sensations inflames these lame stations
Internal, infernal, blazing past you in planes racing
Keep you Star-gazing, stark raving, start raving
Binary's the amazing
Spectacular vernacular
(So what you're saying?)
There's no discussion
We set flames to your productions
Instantaneous, spontaneous combustion
Live cause I got no choice

This is for the men, women, boys and girls
Emcees, DJs, fans throughout the world
For those who drink, smoke, and choose to say sober
Binary Star is here to take it over

I'll tie your body to the tracks
My rhymes run you over like trains
How many times I gotta say that?
One Man Army assume the battle stance
I snow rap flows, impact like avalanche
You never had a chance
We got it locked like Dominoes
Unstoppable, my style is diabolical
I write articles equivalent to light particles
My rhyme's definition is shine, it's quite logical

We set sail, jet propel and excel
We fire on all these cats catch hell when I exhale
We shall overcome, overthrow and prevail
The system we rebel
The mainstream as well
Save your politics Silla's soul is not for sale
We don't blaze the same trail
Drink from the same well
My only purpose is to derail the infidel
And bust his head swell
And expel that crap smell
Propel your personnel
Bon voyage to those that don't fare well
Your petty plan failed in your lifespan can tell
We tipping the scale
Star rock decibel
You ain't close or parallel
You can't flow
You need rainbows and leprechauns to go gold
I'm dropping these lyrical Megatons
With my crew as Decepticons
Transform my trigger hand's warm
Holding the mic like Megatron
I take aim and bust enemy planes
Remain calm like Saddam Hussein
It's obvious who remains Anonymous
My words get off like a SCUD in the Persian Gulf
Check it

When you want it live x4
You can't compromise or settle

This is for blacks, whites, Asians, Hispanics
Christians, Muslims, Moors and Malayans
From north, west, east, south, Pacific to Atlantic
Binary Star, we mold mountains out of granite
...
Men, women, boys and girls
Emcees, DJs, fans throughout the world
For those who drink, smoke, and choose to say sober
Binary Star is here to take it over
...
Take it over, take, take it over

When you want it live, you can't compromise or settle2Embed
