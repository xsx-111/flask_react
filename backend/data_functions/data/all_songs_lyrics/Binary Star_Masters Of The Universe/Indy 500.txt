Indy 500 Lyrics
Thought you boys understood it's business? That's all it is
You still don't get it, do you boys? No more good guys!
They're running the whole show, they own everything
The whole damn planet, they can do whatever they want!
What's wrong with having it good for a change?
And they're gonna let us have it good if we just help 'em
They're gonna leave us alone! Let us make some money!
You can have a little taste of that good life too
Now I know you want it, hell everybody does
You'd do it to your own kind
What's the threat? We all sell out everyday
Might as well be on the winnin' team!

Yo, this is Decompoze, and I gotta say
We need to try to keep this music to ourselves
We selling out this art, for some money
To a guy who don't care nothing about this music
We gotta keep it to ourselves, trying to win the Indy 500
Like this, check it out, check it out, check it out

All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
'Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500

Start your engines, mo' pole positions got me sittin'
In the fifth row, you only go if you're gassed like Citgo
And since my terrorist car's brand new
My pit crew consists of me, and the Binary, too
For your car, you got the luxuries of a star
You got a crew of two dozen plus an A&R
That's your axle and your ratchet man
'Cause after he get rich, man
You skid out in the ditch and be abandoned, need refixin'
You also got the pressure, first to second no lesser
If you don't, you think you'll drive again, you'd never
See, it's not about the car, it's the way you drivin' it
If you cats is lame, can't maintain than you won't survive in it
I'm revivin' it
The record wreckage I steer though
Coming from behind, unseen by rear view
You sleep in your seat, don't even know what's the deal
No suggestions on directions, they're controlling your wheel
And if you ever finish first a platinum trophy is risen
Your prize money? Your staff of two dozen got dibs in
Know the cars, know the race, cause if you get outsmarted
It doesn't matter where you finish, you'll end up where you started
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win, my goal's to win, my goal's to win

It's the battle of Dave and Goliath, the big and small
We need to take control of this shit, and get it all
Expect these rec' execs to take a fall
I came to collect my checks and that's my call
Don't confuse it: They pay your dumb ass, to abuse it
To get rich they use it, then they call it nigga music?
You lose it, you're sold for some crumbs and promo
But if you really want the dough, bro, you would go solo
You put food on your table playing the game wrong
While you dialing that fast food, they eat filet mignon
They applied the pressure, so you gave 'em a song
And if that shit don't hit, the next day you're gone
My copyrights are exclusive, for my uses
They make you a public nuisance, every unit you get two cents
I got influence, the underground, the X factor
A record deal's slavery, so when you sign say, "Yes, master"

All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win, my goal's to win, my goal's to win
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win the Indy 500
My goal's to win, my goal's to win, my goal's to win
All we need is beats and rhymes to go and spark it
As long we got the underground, yo, we got a market
I don't need an agent to tell me how to run it
Cause my goal's to win the Indy 500

Uppercut 
Indy 500
That's all we need
Beats and rhymes  market in the underground
Yo, check it out: It don't matter where you finish as an independent, as long as you finish. Peace 1Embed
