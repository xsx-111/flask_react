Masters of the Universe Lyrics
The two-headed dragon breathes fire, blows flames
Veins pumping octane blazing pain, same brain
Same ankle that enabled Kain to slew, that's a sharp blade
Whether you're willing or able I see your stockade
I'm from an age where the eye displays caption
It's passin' the fact that what you're really tongue lashin'
Yo, and we strikin' their backs like they caught Kunta dashin'
Can't escape slavery, boy, I'm still the master
Of natural disaster; this rap tongue-twister
Emerging from Waterworld, the mighty whirlwind
Microphone cyclone blowing in your ears, like your girlfriend
Until the worlds end all these minds putting work in
Employ these toys on a job and we'll see
But what the hell was they thinkin'?
Must've been drunk, what the hell was they drinkin'?
Wild Irish Rose, drunk as hell in a Lincoln
Head-on collisions in these rap competitions
My crew cats' record turn their frames into scrap metal
(Off to the junkyard)
â€˜Cause ain't nobody's on my rap level, you can ask the devil
It ain't no way in hell these contenders can hinder
Remember: Guard your fender from a friender
Mr. Senim Silla, sinister swindler, I brought you stigmas
When your hides cross a land of temper
This is a warning to you men
We're joining these tournaments of journalists
And live by the pen, now die by the sword
Tears through your gourd, gouge you through the mic cord
This fine bladed expores, watch as fine wine is poured
Now toast to this
As we pour a little out for those who be approaching this
Be approaching this, be approaching this, be approaching this
Be approaching this, be approaching this, be approaching this
Battle vocalist, the One Man Army in a war against Iblis
Lack of knowledge means I'm weaponless
Don't just step to this
I sent Pharoah messages, like Moses
Taking my people on an exodus
We on the run, I split the m-i-c open
Kids try to follow, but get swallowed in the ocean
Preacher of the truth, non-believers making mockery
It ain't no stopping me, I fulfill all prophecy
Similar to David with the rock
I sling shots at your bestest warrior
Plus I'm ill with the poetry
You know it's me, but you still couldn't catch us
Maneuver on the mic or lose heads, like John the Baptist
When I rap this, wack MC's feel the rapture
Others fugitive style your brains couldn't capture
Ever since the beginning of time, let there be light
That's the first day, I wrote my first rhyme
I'm still writing, I seen you looking at 'em
But don't even think about biting
Forbidden poetry is a life, dig these
Your ass couldn't hide from me with fig leaves

We move fast, like Quickdraw McGraw
When it's time we get raw
Our crew come together, like jigsaw puzzles
We moving on the double; a t-r-o-u-b-l-e, we spell trouble
For you cats and dogs without muzzles
Barking in my face, that'll carry no weight, like space shuttles
We rock the mic, like rubble
Binary Star came to reign; drip, drop, rain puddles
Subtle, anonymous, rap hippopotamus
Milk homogeneous, deeper than a pit that's bottomless
The knowledge is: to see us, you must be an astrologist
Stars, quasars, Sirius, synonomous2Embed
