I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (Part 1) Lyrics
In jail, without the bail
In jail, without the bail
In jail, without the bail
In jail, without the bail
In jail, without the bail
In jail, without the bail
In jail

I got confined at 17, young and naive
Dashed in to a world with killers robbers and thieves
Cramped in a 8 man cell with 10 cats
8 on the bunks and 3 on just mats
Housed in max, with cat's facing all day
Habitual ways, short to long term stays
Going back and fourth the circuit
My life hanging on a verdict and laws I'm unable to interpret
I just knew I had to do some time...
Bottom line, laid up some years or so away from mine
Locked from the sun moon and sky, lack a fresh air
Had me feeling pail and dry
Circles forming under my eyes from sleepless weeks
Stress levels off the hook!
Reaching a new beach home sick, for my peoples in the street
A huge weight bearing on my back
Im chain smoking roll ups in attempts to kind of act and write my rap
No get-away cuz life goes on and tomorrows just another day of the same
Routine ain't a damn thing new
Either I grind, watch the tube with the phone, or get a view
So much time and so little to do
Just waiting on a court date so I can get through
Caught between a rock in a hard place
Prosecution had a hard case
So I'd have to plead or escape
If I took it to trial, they would have gave me a boat
Fresh 25 piece like a noose with a rope
I couldn't go that rout no doubt
So I waited for the best offer and I got the hell out
After getting sentenced, I was eager to ride
Just to be outside, just to see the sky
No more bars, no more court, held the county made the joint
Sounds like the resort, I was all in for it
I had my shit packed and ret, ready to jet
Standing at the bars anxious waiting on a debt (waiting on a debt)...
Without the bail
