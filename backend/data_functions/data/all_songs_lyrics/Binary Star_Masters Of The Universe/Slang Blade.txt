Slang Blade Lyrics
Hey you sayin, What the hell is this shit?
Reaching for the cover, turning up your deck
Who's blowing your cassette? Color me for suspect
Terror's what I am, terrorisms what I rep
Rap Hezbollah we don't forgive or forget
Strapped with dynamite, kamikaze rock the mic
Suicide, stage dive, it's gonna be a live night
Now just to be accurate, label me immaculate
Short fused like Montagues feud Capulets
Elaborate labyrinth, lavish pen patterning
Rick Rude The Ravashing, cabbage scavenging
From word babbling, babbling brook get words travelling
Like mouths tattling, I'm kind of partial to battling
Haven't you herd, you got beef I rustle cattle then
Hit the sunset saddling, rap Bronco
Riding over tracks, Lone Ranger and Tonto
Compoze on the console, making it feel better
Sunny to ill weather, I'm a all-season pro
All-terrain flow, shift five gears with four-by-four
On the go in the fast lane without reverse, I can't slow
No brakes, push the pedal to the metal
The Formula One devil
Heating up the treble, I rock like Prudential
Most cats is just Pebbles, when you want it live you can't
Compromise or settle, check my water level
My reservoir pours Great Lakes fifty States
And across seashores, the word spreads like pollen from spores
Like wisdom from folklores, my fans from tours
Now those are just metaphors
For how I distribute to you and yours
Opening doors
We bum rush like a drug bust
Nickel and dime, to all is mine alumnus, illustrious, wondrous
Ominous in my Prime, call me Optimus Senim
Transforming slang autofire maximize
Complete fumigation better jet for ventilation
Before you suffer from Senim inhalation
Air deprivation
Playing me for jolly, that's a dead man's folly
Or crippled probably
On the good ship, get popped for acting lolly
By the son of Bobby Rowe how you like me now, like pulling a shotty
Pistol whip your head knotty 'fore your boys lobby
You'll be carted on a dolly
Senim Synthesizer, kill with a sling blade
Some call it a kaiser
Equalizer blows your brains, expose your wiser
Now which bastard wants some acid
Corrosive chemicals casted
Spitting venom I mastered
Ran with dogs that's rabid, rivers that's rapid
Rapping fire thru your attire
Do you desire to be caught in cross-fire
Loaded gun-for-hire, Blazing Saddle esquire
Michigan, Michelin, my dogs will never tire
{Scratching of "Poison slang"}Embed
