Made for You Lyrics
One and two and three and four
One and two and three and four
One and two and three and four
One and two and three and four

I was writing, thinking with my long hand
Put pen to paper, everything was sinking
Then start to wonder how you're gonna handle me
When I'm under, swimming in the darkest sea

Everybody wants you to make it, it's all yours
Everybody wants you to take it, it's all yours
Everybody wants you to make it, it's all yours
Everybody wants you to take it, t-t-take it

Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love?
You feel all the love
Can you feel all the love like it was made for you?
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
It was made for you
Tell me something, something that can move me
T-tell me lies and I swear you're gonna lose me
Getting like an ocean jealous of the fish
It feeds your devotion, swimming inside of me

(Can you feel all the love?)
Everybody wants you to make it, it's all yours
(Can you feel all the love?)
Everybody wants you to take it, it's all yours
(You feel all the love)
Everybody wants you to make it, it's all yours
(Can you feel all the love?)
Everybody wants you to take it, t-t-take it

Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
Like it was made for you
It was made for you

Can you feel?
Can you feel?
Can you feel?
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
(Can you feel all the love?)
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces

All the right friends in all the right places
All the right moves and all the right faces
Ooh, we're going down6Embed
