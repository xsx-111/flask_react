Waking Up Lyrics
I found verity
On N'Orleans Avenue
Down where the air is thick
As L.A. skies are blue
The water tried to break it down, but it held through
It gave a little for the sake of staying true

We cut ties, we tell lies, we hate change
And we wanna claim where we feel
We take tolls, we rake yours
Yeah, we dig holes, and we're digging right in your fears

We're waking up, we're waking up
And right on time, and right on time
We'll take these roads, we'll break them up
And right on time, and right on time

We got cars, we'll write laws, we won't pause
Don't you know we're all wizards working the hours?
We don't lose, we might bruise
Yeah, but we'll rain fire on you till you're playing all of your cards
We're waking up, we're waking up
And right on time, and right on time
We'll take these roads, we'll break them up
And right on time, and right on time
On time
Right on time
Waking up, waking up
Yeah

Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!5Embed
