Lullaby Lyrics
Days feel harder, night grows longer
Summer says its goodbyes
In darkness' cover, we find shelter
Our own place to hide

Oh, as the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels all around us
Oh, as the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting and you hear a lullaby
Lullaby
You and I

Trees touch windows, say their hellos
Hear this house as it settles in
Worry slips away, it don't know your name
It don't know where to find us

Oh, as the light goes out
Thoughts turn to angels all around us
Oh, as the night comes in
Dreams start their drifting and you hear a lullaby
A lullaby
You and I
