All This Time Lyrics
Six on the second hand
To new years resolutions
And there's just no question
What this man should do
Take all the time lost
All the days that I cost
Take what I took and
Give it back to you

All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all these words
Can't waste them on another
So I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you

I don't know what day it is
I had to check the paper
I don't know the city
But it isn't home
But you say I'm lucky
To love something that loves me
But I'm torn as I could be
Wherever I roam
Hear me say...
All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all these words
Can't waste them on another
So I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you

Yeah, oh, running back to you
Oh, running back to you, yeah
Oh, every time is so far
It's just so far
To get back to where you are

All this time
We were waiting for each other
All this time
I was waiting for you
We got all this love
Can't waste it on another
So I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you
I'm straight in a straight line
Running back to you, yeah
Straight in a straight line
Running back to you4Embed
