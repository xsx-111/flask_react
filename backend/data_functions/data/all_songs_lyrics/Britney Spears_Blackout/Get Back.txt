Get Back Lyrics
The one and only Britney
Yeah (Yeah)
You ready B?
I think you're ready
One, two, three, four
Uh

Oh, no (Here we go)
Catch me if you can (Don't move too slow)
I'm on another level (Can you feel my flow?)
See how it do it (When I'm on the floor)
I wonder if you're ready for the thing that I got
I told you before that I'mma keep it hot
See how it is when I walk up in the spot
Standing in line, ha, I think not

I came to party, baby
You might think I'm crazy
By the way, I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You're gonna feel the heat
Dancing next to me
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then

DJ (Spin it back)
Know that I like it (When you do it like that)
Eyes on my waist, boy, you better think fast
Got that kind of body make you wanna spend cash
Shake it like you seen them do it in the video
Ladies on the floor, let me see you get low
Fellas at the bar, won't you spend a little dough?
This is how I do it when I'm tearing up the floor

I came to party, baby
You might think I'm crazy
By the way I'm moving to the beat
You're standing on the wall
What you come here for?
You're gonna feel the heat
Dancing next to me
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then

Watch me (Hey)
You like it? (Hey)
Well, come get it (Hey)
One, two, three, four

Would you like it if I tease you, get you really hot?
Watch me turn around then let me show you what I got
Baby, if you're ready won't you step up to the plate?
Don't be scared of how I'm moving
Boy, don't play it safe
Let me see you move
Let me see you dance
Let me see you bounce
Danja, bring it back
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
If you can't take it then get back (get back)
Get back (get back), get back (get back)
(If you can't take it then)
(Get back, get back, get back)
(Get back, get back, get back)
(If you can't take it then)
(Get back, get back, get back)
(Get back, get back, get back)
(If you can't take it then)3Embed
