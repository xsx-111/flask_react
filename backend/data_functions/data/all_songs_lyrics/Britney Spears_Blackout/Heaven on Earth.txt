Heaven on Earth Lyrics
Your touch, your taste, your breath, your face
Your hands, your head, you're sweet, your love
Your teeth, your tongue, your eye, you're mine
Your lips, you're fine, you're Heaven on earth

I've waited all my life for you
My favorite kiss
Your perfect skin, your perfect smile
Waking up and you're next to me (I feel you next to me)
Wrap me up in your arms and back to sleep

Lay my head on your chest and drift away
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)
I dream of you and I'm almost half awake
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like Heaven on earth
You're Heaven, you're Heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is Heaven on earth
I'm in love with you
Your breath, your face, your hands, your head
You're sweet, your love, your tongue

I'd move across the world for you
Just tell me when, just tell me where
I'll come to you
Take me back to that place in time
Images of you occupy my mind

Far away, but I feel you here with me
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)
Dream of you and you're almost next to me
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes
You're taking me so far away, one look and you stop time)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like Heaven on earth
You're Heaven, you're Heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is Heaven on earth
I'm in love with you
Fall off the edge of my mind
I fall off the edge of my mind for you
Fall off the edge of my mind
(The palest green I've ever seen, the color of your eyes)
I fall off the edge of my mind for you
(Taken me so far)

Fell in love with you and everything that you are
Nothing I can do, I'm really crazy about you
When you're next to me, it's just like Heaven on earth
You're Heaven, you're Heaven on earth
Tell me that I'll always be the one that you want
Don't know what I'd do if I ever lose you
Look at you and what I see is Heaven on earth
I'm in love with you

I'm so in love
I said I'm so in love
I said I'm so in love with you5Embed
