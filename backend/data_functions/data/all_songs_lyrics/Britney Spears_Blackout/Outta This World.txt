Outta This World Lyrics
I know you hear me on your radio
Well, here we go
Please turn up your radio
Want to tell you something
Hear me on your radio
Well, here we go
Please turn up your radio
Want to tell you something

There was a time I used to think
That love would never turn into reality
I never thought I'd find the one
The odds I would run into you was slim to none

You must be from heaven, baby, yes, you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try, but they can't touch (touch)
You got to look up to us

'Cause your love is outta this world (Oh)
How you bring me down to Earth
I love how you put me first
Baby, feel my every word
'Cause I’m singing universes about you
I keep singing universes about you
There’ll always be verses about you
Our love is here is to stay
There’ll always be a song about you
Forever and a day
There’ll always be a song about you
I'll be your moon (moon), I'll make it bright (bright)
And when it's dark, I promise that you'll see the light (light)
And just as far as the moon from the sun (sun)
That's how long that I'll be here and it's because

You must be from Heaven, baby, yes, you are
Your love is like a shooting star (oh, no)
So they can try, but they can't touch (touch)
You got to look up to us

'Cause your love is outta this world (Oh)
How you bring me down to Earth
I love how you put me first
Baby, feel my every word
'Cause I’m singing universes about you
I keep singing universes about you
There’ll always be verses about you
Our love is here is to stay
There’ll always be a song about you
Forever and a day
There’ll always be a song about you

In my sky, we're the stars
I'm on Venus, you're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man
In my sky, we're the stars
I'm on Venus, you're on Mars
People can't understand
How I'm your girl and you're my man (yeah, baby)
'Cause your love is outta this world (Oh)
How you bring me down to Earth
I love how you put me first
Baby, feel my every word
'Cause I’m singing universes about you
I keep singing universes about you
There’ll always be verses about you
Our love is here is to stay
There’ll always be a song about you
Forever and a day
There’ll always be a song about you3Embed
