Almost Human Lyrics
Uhhhâ€¦
Hah!

I'm almost human, can't help feeling strange
The moon is out, I think I'm gonna change

You're so smooth and tender, a living, breathing dream
I've got to have you, baby, I'm listening for your scream

(I'm almost human) I'm almost a man
(I'm almost human) Ooh

I'm almost human, baby, please don't run away
'Cause wherever you run, I'll be a scream away

I'm very hungry, and you're what I'm thinking of
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, so hungry for your love

(I'm almost human) Almost a man
(I'm almost human) Oh

I'm very hungry, and you're what I'm thinking of
Ooh, baby, baby, baby, so hungry for your love

(I'm almost human) I'm almost a man
(I'm almost human) I'm almost human

(I'm almost human) I'm almost human
(I'm almost human) I'm almost, almost, almost a man
(I'm almost human) Almost, almost, almost, almost, almost, almost human
(I'm almost human) I'm almost human
(I'm almost human) Almost a man
(I'm almost human) Almost, almost, almost
(I'm almost human)Embed
