Tomorrow and Tonight Lyrics
Ow!

Everybody's high when the week is through
Living like they wish they could
Listening to the teachers, bosses and the preachers
Ain't never done nobody good

(Are you happy?) Baby, I've been waiting
(Are you ready?) It's quarter to ten
(Are you coming?) Don't be hesitating
'Cause I'm headed for the city again

Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
Oh yeah, uh-huh, all right

Working like a dog, baby, all day long
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Take it in the cellar, let me be your fella
I'm gonna teach you something new
(Are you happy?) Baby, I've been waiting
(Are you ready) to do it again?
(Are you coming?) Now, don't be hesitating
'Cause you know the night is never gonna end

Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
Oh yeah, uh-huh, all right
Whoo!


I love it

Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
Oh yeah, uh-huh, all right

Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow, (Tomorrow)(Whoo!) tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow, (Tomorrow) tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow, (Tomorrow) tonight, whoo!
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow, (Tomorrow) tonight, whoo!
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow and tonight, tomorrow and tonight
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow, (Tomorrow)(Whoo!) tonight, yeah
We can rock all day, we can roll all night
Tomorrow, (Tomorrow) tonight, yeah
We can rock all day, we can roll all nightâ€¦Embed
