Then She Kissed Me Lyrics
Well, she walked up to me
And she asked me if I wanted to dance
She looked kinda nice
And so I said I might take a chance
When we danced, she held me tight
And when I walked her home that night
All the stars were shining bright
And then she kissed me

Each time I saw her I couldn't wait to see her again
I wanted to let her know that she was more than a friend
I didn't know just what to do, so I whispered, "I love you"
She said that she loved me too, and then she kissed me

She kissed me in a way that I'd never been kissed before
She kissed me in a way that I wanna be kissed forevermore

I knew that she was mine, so I gave her all the loving I had
And one day, she took me home to meet her ma and her dad
Then I asked her to be my bride and always be right by my side
Felt so happy, she almost cried, and then she kissed me

Then I asked her to be my bride and always be right by my side
Felt so happy, she almost cried, and then she kissed me
And then she kissed me
And then she kissed meEmbed
