Got Love for Sale Lyrics
Your condition's red, you can't get to bed
Your eyes are full of tears
You've got headache, heartache, a pain you can't take
I am who you have to fear

Your observation's correct
I'm someone you can't neglect
Whoa no, (Whoa no) whoa no, (Whoa no) whoa no (Whoa no)

Have love, will travel (I've got love for sale)
Have love, will travel (I've got love for sale)
Have love, will travel

You buy the magazine, in between the lines
You see my face, you read my name
And you can have me for one price, baby
You must have heard of my fame

You know you need me, I know you want me
Because I'm a living cross-your-heart man
You've got to have me, can't live without me
Because I'm the one-and-only, yes I am
I've got love for sale
And my love will not fail you
Whoa no, (Whoa no) whoa no, (Whoa no) whoa no oh (Whoa no, whoa no)

Have love, will travel (I've got love for sale)
Have love, will travel (I've got love for sale)
Have love, will travel (I got love for sale)
Yeah!


I've got love for sale
And my love will not fail you
Whoa no, (Whoa no) whoa no, (Whoa no) whoa no (Whoa no, whoa no)

Have love, will travel (I've got love for sale)
Have love, will travel (I've got love for sale)
Have love, will travel (I got love for sale)
Yeah!

I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for sale
I got love for saleEmbed
