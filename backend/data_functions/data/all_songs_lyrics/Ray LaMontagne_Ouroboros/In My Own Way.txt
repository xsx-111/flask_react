In My Own Way LyricsLock the door, draw the shade
Close my eyes, I'm miles away
I'll spend the day, in my own way
Count the hours, mark the days
Underneath it all, the rise and swirling of the waves
I'll spend the day, in my own way

All the plans that were made
Let them die, let them fade
I'll spend the day, inn my own way
Please understand, I'm only human
After all is said and done
We're only here a moment
Then the moment's gone
I'll spend the day, in my own way

Please understand, I'm only human
At times I fail, at times I fall
Don't break your back
Trying to carry the weight of the world
Can't please them all
Ah (Ooh)
Ah (Ooh)
Lock the door, draw the shade
Close my eyes, I'm miles away
I'll spend the day, in my own way
I'll spend the day, in my own way
I'll spend the day, in my own wayEmbed
