While It Still Beats Lyrics

So ends the game
So ends the chase
There's only one way to get out of this race
There ain't no second place
If you don't give every ounce
They'll cut it out
While it still beats


You close the wound
I'll bite the blade
Lie my dying body in the shade
Take my boots and the bullets from my gun
Point me towards the sun
Point me towards the sun!
