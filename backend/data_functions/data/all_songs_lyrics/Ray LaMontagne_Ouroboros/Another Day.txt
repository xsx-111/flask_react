Another Day LyricsSpring is here, spring is past
The sounds of summer settle in
A snake slips through the grass
Summer play, summer stay for a while
At least 'til autumn's gray gives way to winter's rasp
A while at least 'til autumn's gray gives way to winter's rasp
Under the Moon so round
The Moon, so round
Anyway there's really not that much to say
It's just another day
Come with me, come and see
The trill, the hush and glimmering of green
The mountain stream
The trill, the hush and shimmering of green
The mountain stream
Under the Moon so round
The moon, so round
Anyway there's really not that much to say
It's just another day
There's really not that much to say
It's just another dayEmbed
