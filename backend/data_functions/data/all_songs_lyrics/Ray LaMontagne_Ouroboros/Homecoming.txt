Homecoming LyricsBillboard, back road, meadow
Sunset through the trees
I can' t remember the faces I've seen
Low and mean
High rise, white light, shadows
Years in the air
I don' t recall all the why or the where, who was there
Show me feathers you've found
Glass in the ground
Comforting sound when the lights are down
Hillside flush with the sunrise
Springtime in the air
I can't remember a morning so fair
Not a care
Show me feathers you've found
Glass in the ground
Comforting sound when the lights are down
Birdsong tugging on my slumber
Open my eyes
Slowly I'm woken to find
A hand in mine
Show me feathers you've found
The glass in the ground
Comforting sound when the lights are down
Billboard, back road, meadow
Sunset through the trees
I can't recall all the faces I've seen
Low and mean
Birdsong tugging on my slumber
Open my eyes
Slowly I'm woken to find
A hand in mine
Show me feathers you found
Glass in the ground
Comforting sounds when the lights are down
