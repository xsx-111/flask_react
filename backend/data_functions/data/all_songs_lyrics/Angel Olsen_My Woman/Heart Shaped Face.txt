Heart Shaped Face Lyrics
I've seen you changing
I've seen you changing

Was it me you were thinking of?
All the time when you thought of me
Was it me you were thinking of?
All the time when you thought of me

Or was it your mother?
Or was it your shelter?
Or was it another
With a heart shaped face?
Got a heart shaped face
Was it a feeling you thought I could dig up or erase?

I've seen you changing
I've seen you aging

And I learned how to turn my head
And I learned how to walk away
And the truth never really lives
In the story of words we say
You never needed anyone
To expose you to yourself
And you never needed anyone
To raise you hell out of your mind
I never wanted to be someone
Who had to leave it all behind
Even still there is no escape
For what I face, I've faced before
Have whatever love you wanna have
But I can't be here anymore

There is nothing new
Under the sun
There is nothing new
Under the sun

Heartache ends
Heartache ends
Heartache ends
And begins again
And begins again
And begins again
Heartache ends
Heartache ends
Heartache ends
And begins
And begins
