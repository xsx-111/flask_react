Give It Up Lyrics
Hurts to be around you
I can't stand here lying
Whenever you're beside me
A part of me is dying
And every time I see you
I tell myself I'll never
Have this feeling with another
Oh, you're in my heart forever

What is it you think I need?
Everything? It's not true
Iâ€™d give it all up for you
Give it all up for you

Want to touch you, show you how
It feels whenever you're around
Take my time with you, my love
You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I'm thinking of
You're the one I really love

In my arms and fast asleep
In my arms in all my dreams
Where you are is where I want you
Where you are is where I want to
Where you are is where
I want to be
I want to be
I want to beEmbed
