What in the World Lyrics
You're just a little girl with grey eyes
Never mind, say something
Wait until the crowd cries
Oh, wait until the crowd cries
You're just a little girl with grey eyes

So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Talking through the gloom
What in the world can you do?
What in the world can you do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love
For your love

I'm just a little bit afraid of you
'Cause love won't make you cry
But wait until the crowd goes
Oh, wait until the crowd goes
I'm just a little bit afraid of you
So deep in your room
You never leave your room
Something deep inside of me
Yearning deep inside of me
Is talking through the gloom
What in the world can I do?
What in the world can I do?
I'm in the mood for your love
For your love
For your love

Oh, what you going to say?
Oh, what you going to do?
Ah, what you going to be?
To the real me
To the real me5Embed
