Good Girls Lyrics
Killing your idols is a chore
And it's such a fucking bore
'Cause I don't need them anymore
So maybe if you just got some guts
We'd kill them with a thousand cuts
And say we did it out of love
So save your breath
Give a little of what you have left
Do they know something I don't?

Is it easier when you don't have to count to ten?
When you don't have to pretend?
I want to know that feeling
Is it easier when you don't have to start again?
When you don't wanna make amends?
I want to know that feeling

Good girls don't cry
And good girls don't lie
And good girls justify
But I don't
Good girls don't die
And good girls stay alive
And good girls satisfy
But I won't
They tell me I'm hell-bеnt on revenge
I cut my teeth on wеaker men
I won't apologise again
And I never had a taste for liars
Or the uniquely uninspired
'Cause I don't need to be desired

Is it easier when you don't have to count to ten?
When you don't have to pretend?
I want to know that feeling
Is it easier when you don't have to start again?
When you don't wanna make amends?
I want to know that feeling

Good girls don't cry
And good girls don't lie
And good girls justify
But I don't
Good girls don't die
And good girls stay alive
And good girls satisfy
But I won't
No, I won't (Ha)
Killing your idols is a chore
And it's such a fucking bore
But we don't need them anymore
We don't need them anymore7Embed
