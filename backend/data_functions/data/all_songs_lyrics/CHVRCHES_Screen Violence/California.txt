California Lyrics
Waste a month, waste a year
Waste the time you could've been here
Count the debt, count the tears
Count the truths and all of my fears

I didn't want to be cynical
Passing place for the soul
You were never predictable
Now I need to let it go

Found the song, played it back
Heard your voice under the feedback
Found a tape that was blank
Saw your face fading into black

I know love is delusional
And I hate when I'm wrong
Yours was never conditional
And now I need to get it gone

No one еver warns you
You'll die in California
Falling in a dream, you lеt, let go
No one ever seems to say, say so
No one ever tells you
There's freedom in the failure
Dying in a dream feels like home
No one ever seems to say, say so
Close my eyes, close my heart
Close the book I never meant to start
Say your name in the dark
No one said it would be this hard

I didn't go to the funeral
Heard you cry on the phone
Your voice was so beautiful
And now I need to let it go

No one ever warns you
You'll die in California
Falling in a dream, you let, let go
No one ever seems to say, say so
No one ever tells you
There's freedom in the failure
Dying in a dream feels like home
No one ever seems to say, say so

God bless this mess that we made ourselves
Pull me into the screen at the end and
God bless this mess that we made for ourselves
Pull me into the screen at the end
Pull me into the screen at the end
Pull me into the screen at the end
To the screen at the endEmbed
