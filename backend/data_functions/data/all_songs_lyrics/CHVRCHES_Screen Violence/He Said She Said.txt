He Said She Said Lyrics
He said, "You bore me to death"
"I know you heard me the first time" and
"Be sad, but don't be depressed"
Just think it over, over and
He said, "It's all in your head"
"But keep an ear to the grapevine" and
"Get drunk, but don't be a mess"
Keep thinkin' over, over

I try
But it's hard to hit rewind
When I feel like

I feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Over and over, I
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
Over and over, I try
Ooh, ooh, ooh

He said, "You need to be fеd"
"But keep an eye on your waistline" and
"Look good, but don't bе obsessed"
Keep thinkin' over, over

I try
But it's hard to know what's right
When I feel like I'm borrowin' all of my time
And it's hard to hit rewind
When I feel like

I feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Over and over, I
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
Over and over, I
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Over and over, I
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
(Feel like I'm losin' my mind)
Feel like I'm losin' my mind
Over and over
I try5Embed
