Manhattan Skyline Lyrics
We sit and watch umbrellas fly
I'm trying to keep my newspaper dry
I hear myself say, my boat's leaving now
So we shake hands and cry
Now I must wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

You know
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to say goodbye
I don't want to cry again
I don't want to run away
I don't want to raise this pain
I'll never see your face again

Oh, but how
How can you say that I didn't try
You see things in the depths of my eyes
That my love's run dry, no
I leave to their goodbyes
I've come to depend on the look in their eyes
My blood's sweet for pain
The wind and the rain brings back words of a song
And they say wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye

You know
I don't want to fall again
I don't want to know this pain
I don't want another friend
I don't want to try again
I never want to see you hurt
Don't let me see you hurt
I don't want to cry again
I'll never see your face again

How can you say that I didn't try?
You know I did
You see things in the depths of my eyes
That my love's run dry
I don't want to cry again
So I read to myself
A chance of a lifetime to see new horizons
