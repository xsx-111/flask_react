The Swing of Things LyricsYou say the world's an eventful place
You give me news I don't want to know
You say that I should care
That I should speak my mind
Oh, but how can I speak of the world rushing by
With a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes
Oh, have we come to the point of no turning back
Or is it still time to get into the swing of things
Let us walk through this windless city
I'll go on till the winter gets me
Oh, "sleep" you wrote, "sleep, my dear"
In a letter somewhere
Oh, but how can I sleep with your voice in my head
With an ocean between us and room in my bed
Oh, have I come to the point where I'm losing the grip
Or is it still time to get into the swing of things
Oh, when she glows in the dark and I'm weak by the sight
Of this breathtaking beauty in which I can hide
Oh, there's a world full out there of people I fear
But given time I'll get into the swing of things
Yes, when she glows in the dark and I'm struck by the sight
I know that I'll need this for the rest of my life
What have I done? What lies I have told
I've played games with the ones that rescued my soul
Oh, have I come to the point where I'm losing the grip
Or is it still time to get into the swing of thingsEmbed
