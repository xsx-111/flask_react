Evelyn LyricsAll the tables nice and clean
Evelyn's asleep
On the grave yard shift again
Selling gasoline
And there's kids smoking on south first
See high school was just a blur, to her
And everything just found their place it seemed
There's an old folk song on the radio
Sounding thin and dark and haunted
Theres a bag of weed in the back beneath the books
And she can't stand the sight of this cul-de-sac
Like an old crow, king of the lamp-post
And this window hasn't been this clean since it last rained
Well, she pictures up a different day
Driving west to east L.A
And there ain't no sign of a dime, but hey
Anyone can dream
Anyone can dream
And all the college girls come in when the bars let out and theyâ€™re hungry
Making such a mess, Evelyn just talks trash as she's sweeping up
There's a thin dark cloud in the evening air
After every sunny day
There's a bum who lives in the parking lot
Wash the windows just to say hey
All the tables nice and clean
Evelyn's asleep
On the grave yard shift again
