Dandelion Wine LyricsSummer days were just a magazine
A magazine
A magazine
Cutting grass for gasoline
For gasoline
So I can see you soon
Fall swooned
Left me drunk in a field
Dandelion wine for a year
And I packed up the dust
Of all that I owned
Handkerchief hung from a pole
I rolled out the day that the apples fell9Embed
