Master & A Hound LyricsWhere were you when I was still kind?
Just a water-treader waiting on the line
Just a dry-gin-drinker, master-and-a-hound
Turned a circus-swinger
Look, he's coming down
Down
Can you shake it up
Just once for me
Your little globe just so we can see
The snow blowing 'round your hands
And the wing-nut turned
The song that we both know
Sent us flying 'round the carnival
You can throw all your lucky coins on me
On me1Embed
