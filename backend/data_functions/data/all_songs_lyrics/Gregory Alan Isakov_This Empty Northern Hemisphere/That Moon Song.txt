That Moon Song LyricsThe tail lights burn red
They were hotter than hell
And I've been long gone, couldn't you tell
The smoke in the air
Couldn't hide my shame
Saw it lit up on that silver screen
And ahh that full-bellied moon, she's a-shinin' on me
Yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea
And you came on strong like some running wave
And your beauty left me broke and hungry
Left me begging to the birds for a bone or an offering
Left me saying nothin', nothin', like I always say
And ahh that full-bellied moon, she's a-shinin' on me
Yeah she pulls on this heart like she pulls on the sea
And those broken-hearted lovers
They got nothing on me1Embed
