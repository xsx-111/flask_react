W.B.A.T. LyricsSeven seasons bloom out in June and July
Several reasons I feel like I'm shit when you lie
That's right!
Sister, sister, I've never felt so burned out
Sister, sister, what's left when the fire has gone out?
Seems it only served to magnify the pain and doubt
Stuck in stalemate with steadfast refusal to show
How much it's hurting to not have a clue, but to know
Just how painful it is to let go
When we close our eyes at night
It feels so right
We've lived another day
In dreams we dive into the light
Postpone the fight
And it kind of feels okay
To float along
Somehow belong
To not be right or wrong
All unspoken we're keeping it civil and kind
Nothing's broken if nobody speaks their mind
When we close our eyes at night
In dreams we dive into the light
When we close our eyes at night
It feels so right, we lived another day
In dreams we dive into the light, postpone the fight and it kind of feels okay
To float along, somehow belong, to not be right or wrongEmbed
