Starhammer (feat. The Electric Psalmon) LyricsIt's been a long time now since I've seen the sun rise high to greet a blue sky
Orbiting stoutfully I'm the starhammer, I'm bleakly keeping an eye on the world as I fly on by
Watch me!
I'm just a watcher I do not judge or side or care, I'm just a slave
I am outside and ever will I observe, I watch, I store and I save
What would you do?
Mutant star, I won't conceal, the believers as they bend and kneel, their backs were broken cruelly upon the wheel
What would you do?
If you could expose some lies, straighten backs and open eyes Would you cut the culprit down to size?
What would you do?
I am a starhammer, I never judge but always keep the score
I am outside and ever will I observe, I watch, I save and I store, forevermore1Embed
