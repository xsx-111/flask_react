The Bomb-Proof Roll and Beyond (For Arnie Hassle) LyricsRound and round and round we go
Always slightly faster
Round and round and round we go
Never catching up
Terminal velocity team up with the void
Come on and take my hand, come on and take my hand
Lets freefall endlessly one with the void
As we go tumbling down, the strings that bind us come undone
Will you drown in the strange brew meltdown
Or break on through
Break on throughEmbed
