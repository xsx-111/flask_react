X-3 (Knuckleheads In Space) / The Getaway Special LyricsI wanna go I wanna get up and go man
I need a lift off and I crave the sky
I've been chomping at the bit for several weeks now
I'm so ready I need to get high
My adrenaline's up beyond the scales man?
You couldn't kill me cause I'd never feel a thing
I might seem like a ball of nerves to you
But that's cool and hear they're really singing
It's gonna feel so good
Like we always knew it would
In this glorious pursuit
We're getting in our suits
Won't you fly us
Past the bright shining stars
Won't you fly us
To the X-3 pulsar
There's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong with all this brute force
Flinging metal to the eye in the sky
Inertial forces mass pulling skywards
Fighting gravity's holy nuclei
I'm gonna try I'm gonna try and make it matter
There's no excuses at the level we're at
We'll fly the flag and I know
We're representing humanity and democracy and all that
But hey!
It's gonna feel so good
Like we always knew it would
Cause in this glorious pursuit
We're getting in our suits
Won't you fly us
To the bright shining stars
Won't you fly us
Past the moon and past Mars
Won't you fly us
Won't you fly us
Won't you fly us
To the X-3 pulsar
So damn luminous, hotter than a pistol
A high energy ray gun in the swan
Is it really true it's made of quarks man
I guess it's just not your standard neutron
That's at the core of this wonderful creation
A gas sucking binary star
Thirty seven thousand light years
Man that's really way too far
Won't you fly us
Past the bright shining stars
Won't you fly us
Past the moon and past Mars
Won't you fly us
To the bright shining stars
Won't you fly us
Past the moon and past Mars
Won't you fly us
Past the bright shining stars
Won't you fly us
To the X-3 pulsar
Won't you fly us
Won't you fly us
Won't you fly us
Won't you fly usEmbed
