Close Your Eyes LyricsTo say it once again may make it seem
That all we had was nothing but a dream
Please say that it's all over, help me perceive
That all it ever was, was make believe
Dream, close your eyes and dream girl
Dream, close your eyes and dream
Of how it used to feel
Was it ever really quite real
Dream, close your eyes and dream girl
Dream, close your eyes and dream
Of how it used to feel
Was it ever really quite realEmbed
