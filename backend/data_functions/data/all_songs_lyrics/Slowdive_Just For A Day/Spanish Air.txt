Spanish Air Lyrics
Screams that seem unreal
Shouts follow the sins
There's nothing here for me now
The wind blows for as far as I can see

I long for the sun
The midland air
For all that I have
There's written in waves
I know that now
There's left to be seen
I know that I've lost him
I'm leaving here

Fastest knife a sign
Feels so far away
There's nothing here for me now
The clouds fly, so far
I'm lost there now

I long for the sun
The midland air
For all that I have
Is written in waves
And now that I know
Is left to be seen
And now that I've lost him
I'm leaving here3Embed
