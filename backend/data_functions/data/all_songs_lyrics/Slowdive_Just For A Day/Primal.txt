Primal Lyrics
Today, I watch the colours fade
Watch the games you play
And when it all falls down, yeah
Don't forget the days
When the sunshine fades away
Remember what they say
Remember what they say

To the right time
She calls to, to the day
Every time she says she's falling
And every time she called us friends


Cause
To the right time
She calls to, to the day
And every time she says she's falling
And every time she called us friends

I can't believe
Can't believe, disgusted
Disgusted, I can't believe it
Disgusted, can't believe it
Can't believe itEmbed
