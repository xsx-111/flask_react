Waves Lyrics
Watch the waves so far away
They're washing 'cross the paths that I have made
Leaving all my sins, I turn away
Like soaring birds, I watch my sorrows play

Don't you know, I've left and gone away
You're knocking on the door I closed today
And everything looks brighter
The waves, they just soothe my pain away

It felt so good to see the sun
I'll choose my time before I choose the one
Floating 'cross the waves, the silence runs
My thoughts can go, but now, my sorrow's done

Don't you know, I've left and gone away
You're knocking on the door I closed today
And everything looks brighter
The waves they just soothe my pain away1Embed
