The Sadman Lyrics
I know there is
It all away
It all goes round
The house today
The reason why
You're losing time

The sadman calls
He calls for you
He cries for you (..need to be..)
He cries for you
The sadman calls
He calls for me

The things you say
The songs that shine
For another time
I count the ways
Your smile's the place

The sadman calls
He calls for you
He cries for you
You hurt my feelings
You're losing me
The sadman cries
He cries for meEmbed
