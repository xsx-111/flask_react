Brighter Lyrics
She drifts in the sky, yeah
The birds made of grain
She can now see the sun
And everyone said, yeah
You're better off dead but
She didn't know we were alone

And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time

She said don't you know, yeah
There's people in places
And places is what made her see
And everyone said, yeah
She's better off dead but
She looked like she wanted to live

And when it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
When it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time

When it all looks brighter
Just turn around and smile
And when it's looking better
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time
Just leave it all to time2Embed
