Catch the Breeze Lyrics
Feels like all the days are gone
Just catch the breeze, you know you've had your fun
Rain washes waves down

And I, I want the world to cry
And I, I watch the winds you fly
You can believe in everything
You can believe it all

Hey, are you feeling something new
Just watch the rain, it helps in all you do
The breeze it blows, it blows everything

And I, I want the world to cry
And I, I want the sun to shine
You can believe in everything
You can believe it all
