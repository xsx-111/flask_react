Love Has Found a Way Lyrics
Waves are crashing on the sea
Lens flashing on how it should be
Some are reaching for the gun
Some are searching for the sun

Love has found another way
I knew it would make it some how yeah
We will find a better way for making love
And love (and love) has found a way
And love

Children reaching for a hand
Soldiers killing at every command
Though I've seen this with silent tears
Some will give this with violent fears

Love has found another way
I knew it would make it some how yeah
We will find a better way for making love
And love, love has found a way
And love, love, love has found a wayEmbed
