Soldier LyricsJust by the wave of my hand
I'd let you understand
I am not a lonely soldier
Just by the wave of my hand
I'd let you understand
I am not here for the love
No, no, no, no
She knows me
No, no, no, no
I love her
You have the world at your fingertips
No one can make it better than youEmbed
