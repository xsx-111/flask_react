Street Worm Lyrics
I'll be happy flying on the rooftops
I'll be happy burning in the streets
I'll be happy moving when I wish to
I'll be happy saying how I please

But I know I was never going to hear
I know I was never going to cut my brother
I know I'll never going to make no deals

I'll be happy staying with you baby
I'll be happy swimming for free
You got ya cars at your curb, you got your horses in the country
But I'm a city's own son I'm a man of means, yes indeed

And I know I would never going to heal
I know I was never going to wear no collar
I know I'll never going to make no deal


(Happy) I'm flying on the rooftops
(Happy) I'm burning in the streets now
(Happy) I'm a staying with you baby
(Happy) I'm a swimming for free
Talk to me baby
I'm swimming for free
Flying on the rooftops
I'm a-burning in the alley
Talk to me babyEmbed
