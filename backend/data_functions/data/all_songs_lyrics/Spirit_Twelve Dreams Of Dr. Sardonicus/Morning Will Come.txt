Morning Will Come LyricsCome, come, come to me
Ah yes, you've got a smile
Makes me wild for you, baby
Listen, you got a style that turns me on, man
Ohh
Please don't be late
No, don't hesitate
Cause in a while
The morning will come
Yes, the morning will come
Our morning will come
Yes, the morning will
Come, come, come to me
Well, you got a love
Makes me cry for you, baby
Such a special love
It turns me on, man
Come in the morning
In the morning
Come in the morning
In the morning
Yes, the morning will come
Yes, the morning will
Come, come, come to me
(Got to have you, girl!)
To me only
To me only, ohh
Please don't be late now
Don't hesitate
Because in a while
The morning will come
Yes, the morning will... (got to)
Morning will come
Yes, the morning...
Oh, don't you know that the morning will come?
Yes, the morning will come
Yes, the morning will come
Yes, the morning will
Come, come, come to me!!!!Embed
