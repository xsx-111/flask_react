Mr. Skin Lyrics
I raise my head in a touchy situation
(Mr. Skin, we know where you've been)
Yes, I make my bed in the heart of the nation
(Mr. Skin, we know where you've been)

I know it's a trait of human love
To make all the people holler
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Send them looking 'round for their woman
Send them reaching out for their dollar
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Uh, hey, hey

Ooh, I'm rolling, flowing
Through the whole population
(Mr. Skin, we know where you've been)
Oh, the high and the low-born
Are my friends and relations
(Mr. Skin, we know where you've been)

I can bring you pain
I can bring you sudden pleasure
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
Your life will only gain
If your love's the final measure
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, ooh)
(I wanna feel your skin)
(I wanna feel your skin)
(I wanna feel your skin)

I’m Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin, we know where you’ve been)
I’m Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin, we know where you’ve been)
I’m Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin, we know where you’ve been)
I’m Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin, we know where you’ve been)
Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin, we know where you’ve been)
Mr., Mr. Skin
(Mr. Skin, we know where you’ve been)…Embed
