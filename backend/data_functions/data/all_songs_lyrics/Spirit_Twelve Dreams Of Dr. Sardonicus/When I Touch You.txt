When I Touch You Lyrics
Often in my dreams
I see the strangest things
I see the mountains rise
I see them touch the skies
When I'm near to you
I feel the same way too
I feel the mountains rise
I feel them touch the skies
I... I won't see you any more
I... I won't see you any
I will not see you any....
More.... More.... MORE!!!!

And when I touch you
I feel the same way too
I feel the mountains rise
I feel them touch the skies
Your love holds all these keys
Why can't I be free
From thoughts of bitter rage
White lions in their cage
I... I won't see you any more
I... I won't see you any
I will not see you any.....
More.... More.... MORE!!!!

I.... I....
I.... I....
When I touch you
When I touch you
Ahaa.... Ahaa....
Mmmmm.... Mmmmm....
Mmmmm.... Mmmmm....Embed
