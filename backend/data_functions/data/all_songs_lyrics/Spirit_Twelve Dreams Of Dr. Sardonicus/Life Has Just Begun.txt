Life Has Just Begun LyricsOh hey Kiowa, I know your name
Catch me a glancing with one of your eye
So much we are chancing if we said goodbye, oh
Softly say you'll be my bride and
Our hopes all sun and feel
Say you'll always be here by my side
With the hopes all constantly, ohh
We walked in the dream and we knew it was
Married in the dreams
Strange as it seemed that we knew because
Because life has just begun
Life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Hey Kiowa, I know your name
Hey Kiowa, I know your name
Walking in that sunny hour
I even know your names Atowa
No war on the rocky hour
I want some people of desire
Walked in the dream and we knew it was
Strange as it seemed that we knew because
Because life has just begun
Life has just begun, life has just begun
Life has just begun, life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
Because life has just begun
BeginEmbed
