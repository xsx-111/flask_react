Animal Zoo Lyrics
Living in the city, I've been abused (He has)
The jobs I keep and people I meet
They don't do more than make me amused
Everywhere I turn now, just more bad news
So don't look now and don't ask how
Gonna find me a way to the animal zoo

Oh no, something went wrong
Well, you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey, hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on back to the animal zoo
Hey, hey-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, woo

Looking at my body, I'm slipping down (So far)
The air I breathe and the water I drink
Is selling me short and turning me 'round
Everyone I see now, on their way, too (Everybody)
So don't look now and don't ask how
We're gonna find our way home to the animal zoo

Oh no, something went wrong
Well, you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey, hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Hey, hey-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
Look out

Oh no, something went wrong
Well, you're much too fat and a little too long
Hey, hey, you got too much to lose
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
Hey, hey-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, oh

Oh no, something went wrong
Well, you're much too fat and a little too long
(Oh, no, something went wrong)
Hey, hey, you got too much to lose
(Well, you’re much too fat and a little too long)
Gotta get on home to the animal zoo
(Oh, no, you got too much to lose)
Oh, no, something went wrong
(Gotta get your ass to the animal zoo)
Well, you’re much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long
Much too fat and a little too long...Embed
