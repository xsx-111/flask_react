Today Lyrics
Cover me with shades of disbelief
Can happiness be someone else's dream?
Numbers call to spell my name, move about as values change
Catch me if you can, but don't delay

(Today, today) It's a dream away
(Today, today)

Governed by the title on the wall
Commit me to a life within a fool
Happiness can often bleed, beggars lay among the sheep
Let me take the choice the sermon pleads

(Today, today) It's a dream away
(Today, today) A dream away

Visions in my cell begin to breed
Was everything a fact of what I read?
Excuse me while l spell my name, boat and ship could sound the same
Catch me if you can, but don't delay
(Today, today) It's a dream away
(Today, today) A dream away

Belle Malissima
Belle Malissima
Belle Malissima
Belle Malissima

(Today, today) It's a dream away
(Today, today) A dream away
(Today, today) It's a dream away
(Today, today) A dream away1Embed
