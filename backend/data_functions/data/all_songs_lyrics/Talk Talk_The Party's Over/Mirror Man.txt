Mirror Man Lyrics
Out in the street today
We're parading around, we're the height of the fashion
And she laughs 'cos we look the same
Follow all of the rules

Every little bit of my time
Keeps me checking that my clothes are in line
I'll identify without wasting time
Mirror man

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Inside of her room today
She's been working all hours for the final presentation
Each day, dressed a different way
She's the star of the road

Every little bit of her time
Keeps her checking that she stays out of line
She'll wear anything you can't recognise
Mirror man
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

See the state she's in?
See the state she's in?
See the state she's in?

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
See the state she's in?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
See the state she's in?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohEmbed
