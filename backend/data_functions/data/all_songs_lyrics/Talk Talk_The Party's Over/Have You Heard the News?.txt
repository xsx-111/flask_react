Have You Heard the News? Lyrics

I turned around and saw him hit the ground
A little earlier, it was a game

D'you know anything I'm going through
I don't like to read the news
D'you know anything I'm going through
And she calls

It was on page ten
I swore to everyone
I'm not to blame
I turned around and saw him hit the ground
A little earlier, it was a game
I'm so disposable
You can throw me away
I don't like to read the news
D'you know anything I'm going through
I don't like to read the news
D'you know anything I'm going through
And she calls

What a fool I've been
Didn't get to him in time
"What's been happening?"
Its so hard to sleep at night
Its so hard to sleep at night, to sleep at night

I don't like to read the news
D'you know anything I'm going through
I don't like to read the news
D'you know anything I'm going through
And she callsEmbed
