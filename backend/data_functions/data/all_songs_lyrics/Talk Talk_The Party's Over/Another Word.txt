Another Word Lyrics
And when you're hanging round
Waiting on the other side of town
Kick a stone on a painted wall (oh oh oh oh)
And when the riot comes
Keep your head and keep your loving charm
Living life is a glamour show

But it's another word
It's another word

All soldiers have a cause
Giving life upon graffitied walls
As a way to pass the time
I saw a father's fear
For a leader standing over here
"Who's the King?" says a passerby

But it's another word
It's another word
Word
Word
And when you're hanging round
Waiting on the other side of town
Kick a stone on a painted wall (oh oh oh oh)
And when the riot comes
Keep your head and keep your loving charm
Living life is a glamour show

But it's another word
It's another word
Word
Word


It's another
