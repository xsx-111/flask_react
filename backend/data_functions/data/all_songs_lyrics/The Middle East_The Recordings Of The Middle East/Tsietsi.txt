Tsietsi LyricsThe trees are burnt
The grass is brown
The sky turns red
When the sun goes down
For all the tears
In God’s green earth
We haven’t cracked
In this old town
’cause we’re holding on to youth
And we’re stubborn to the tooth
The smell of dread
And burning heads
Is a sure sign
That you’re in town
And we’re holding on to youth
And we’re stubborn with the truth
Here on the shores of the sea comes the end
Here on the floor on our knees comes the end
Here on the shoulders of these comes the end
Here when you replace me comes the end
Comes the end
Here on the shores of the sea comes the end
Here on the floor on our knees comes the end
Here on the shoulders of these comes the end
Here when you replace me comes the end
Comes the end
Comes the endEmbed
