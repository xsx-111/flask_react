Dirty Looks LyricsI read the words of a thousand books
And gave away my dirty looks
And I cleaned out all my cupboards
One by one
I quit the job that I hated most
My pockets full of hundred dollar notes
But there’s not enough to buy back
What I lost
Now I wash my hair and I clip my toes
I leave the room just to blow my nose
And I shower twice a day with soap
But I don’t feel clean like I thought I would
My sins don’t wash away so good
They stick to me like glue
Like glue
So I pack my bags and change my name
To something that nobody can say
And I’ll squander all my hard earned cash
I speak too slow when I’m most in need
Your skins too soft and your hearts too clean
To be caught up in this awful mess
With someone like meEmbed
