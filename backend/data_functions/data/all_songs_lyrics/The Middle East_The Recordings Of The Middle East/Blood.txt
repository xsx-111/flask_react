Blood Lyrics
Older brother, restless soul, lie down
Lie for a while with your ear against the earth
And you'll hear your sister sleep talking
Say, "Your hair is long but not long enough to reach
Home to me
But your beard
Someday might be"
And she'll wake up in a cold sweat on the floor
Next to a family portrait drawn when you were four
And beside a jar of two cent coins that are no good no more
She'll lay it aside

Older father, weary soul, you'll drive
Back to the home you made on the mountainside
With that ugly, terrible thing
Those papers for divorce and a lonely ring
A lonely ring
Sit on your porch
And pluck your strings
And you'll find somebody you can blame
And you'll follow the creek that runs out into the sea
And you'll find the peace of the Lord

Grandfather, weary soul, you'll fly
Over your life once more before you die
Since our grandma passed away
You've waited for forever and a day
Just to die
And someday soon
You will die
It was the only woman you ever loved
That got burnt by the sun too often when she was young
And the cancer spread
And it ran into her body and her blood
And there's nothing you can do about it now23Embed
