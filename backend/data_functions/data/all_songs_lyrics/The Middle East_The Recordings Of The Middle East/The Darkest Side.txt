The Darkest Side Lyrics
One, two, three, four
Love
It’s the air in your mother’s lungs
When her fathers tore her fences down
Plastic bags and the panadol was out

Love
Was a sold Gibson 335
And your father’s dream died that night
Just to keep that electricity on

And it’s the darkest side of my heart that dies when you come to me
And it’s the golden ticket I win when you kill my enemies
I hear the farthest cry and the softest sigh when I’m empty
But if you leave me I’ll hide in a game like SimCity
Oh when I die I’m alive
And when I lose I find
My identity

Son
If I died on my bedroom floor
Would you cry on your bedroom floor?
And tattoo my name underneath your arm
Love
That was alive in the olden days
Been put to death in this golden age
By our colour TV

And it’s the darkest side of my heart that dies when you come to me
And it’s the golden ticket I win when you kill my enemies
I hear the farthest cry and the softest sigh when I’m empty
But if you leave me I’ll get me gone and drown face down muddy in the water
Oh when I die…
When I die…
Die I’m alive
When I lose I find
My identity

Love
Was those dark clouds on the Friday
It was a holy shaking earthquake
And you were stuck up the tree

And it’s the darkest side of my heart that dies when you come to me
Oh it’s the golden ticket I win when you kill my enemies
I hear the farthest cry and the softest sigh when I’m empty
But if you leave me I’d hello goodbye and I don’t shine at night look I’m dead man
Oh when I die…
When I die…
When I die…
When I die I’m alive
When I lose I find
My identityEmbed
