Lonely Lyrics
We have material minds
And restless hands
Longing hearts
And lonely beds
But we purchase stuff
And work too hard
Use our heads
And fill our beds

What’ve we done
What’ve we done

And we’re left with wretched hearts
And mangled minds
Concrete feet
And beggars lies
But we live our lives
On broken earth
We need repair our eyes
To kiss the dirt

But what do you do when you’re out of touch, what do you do?
And how do you live with a conscience so caught up, how do you live?

Oh what do you do when you’re out of touch, what do you do?
And how do you live with a conscience so caught up?
So caught up
So caught up
So caught up

So caught up! (x4)2Embed
