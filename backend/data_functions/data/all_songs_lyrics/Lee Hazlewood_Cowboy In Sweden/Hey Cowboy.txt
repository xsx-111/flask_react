Hey Cowboy Lyrics
Hey cowboy, where did you get the clothes you wear
Hey cowboy, where did you get the funny hair

What are you doing in the land of the midnight sun 'cause you better run
You're just a toy cowboy
I may not look right but I sure do feel fine
You hang around me and I'll undo your mind

Hey cowboy, where did you get the funny walk
Hey cowboy, where did you get the crazy talk

What're you doing in the land of the midnight sun 'cause you better run
You're just a toy cowboy
If I'm a toy then let me do what I do
You wind me up and watch what I'd do to you

Hey cowboy (what do you want?), where did you get that horse
Hey cowboy, from the men of course

What're you doing in the land of the midnight sun 'cause you better run
You're just a toy cowboy
I'm maybe small but I know I'm right for you
No big cowboy can do the little things I do
(You get that straight little Swedish girl?
Aha, allright)Embed
