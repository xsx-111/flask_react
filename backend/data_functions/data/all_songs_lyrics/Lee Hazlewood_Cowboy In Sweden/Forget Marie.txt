Forget Marie Lyrics
Standing on the corner with a raggedi-old suitcase by my side
Waiting for a Greyhound bus to come along so I can hook a ride

Gonna go as far as 14 dollars will take a fool like me
Gotta find a place where I can hide, you know I must forget Marie
Marie
I'm standing on the corner feeling raindrops raise tears down my face
Try and losers tears and knowing that I never should have run the race
Never should have let her built a house of love, it's falling in on me
Gotta find a place where I can hide, you know I must forget Marie
Marie
