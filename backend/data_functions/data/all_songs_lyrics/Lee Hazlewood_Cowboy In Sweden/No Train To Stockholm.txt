No Train To Stockholm Lyrics
One night Johnny sang the truth to me
On a northbound train from Nashville, Tennessee
Taught me all the letters, him alone

Saying freedom is where you think it is
But there ain't no train to Stockholm

Received your invitation to the war
I sent it back, so please don't send no more
I'd rather rot in some jail all alone


If I have to ride this train a hundred years
And all I have to drink is my own tears
I'll not kill for you or on my own

Singing freedom is where you think it is
But there ain't no train to Stockholm

Governments and politicians too
There's lots of people feel the way we do
A hundred million of us can't be wrong
