For A Day Like Today Lyrics
There's a dream I've been saving for a day like today
Yellow trees, Indian waters flowing softly on their way
There's a dove in the treetops singing peace on the wind
Again again and again

It's just a dream I've been saving for a day like today
There's some hope I've been saving for a day like today

Love will come, love will conquer every heart that beats today
And it may not be perfect, but at least we can try
You and I, you and I, you and I

It's just some hope I've been saving for a day like today
There's a song I've been saving for a day like today

And the words tell a story of our youngens far away
Bring them home, sings the chorus, for they're much too young to die
Must they die, must they die, must they die
It's just a song I've been saving for a day like today
Bring them home, sings the chorus, for they're much too young to die
Must they die, must they die, must they die
It's just a song I've been saving for a day like today
Just a dream I've been saving for a day like today
Just some hope I've been saving for a day like todayEmbed
