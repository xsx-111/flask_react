Leather & Lace Lyrics
Leather and lace hangin' in place and the fire was as warm as the wine
The leather was hot the lace it was not so she left my side for a time
Ran into town leaving her gown in a place by the door

Now the leather and lace still hangs in place but I never see her anymore
Leather and lace hangin' in place and desire was as warm as the wine
The leather was sure the lace couldn't 'dure and endure I did for a time
Then I run to town leaving my gown with a face like the red lace I wore

Now the leather and lace still hang in place but I never see him anymore
Leather and lace hangin' in place and desire was as warm as the wine
The leather was hot the lace it was not so she left my side for a time
Then I run to town leaving my gown with a face like the red lace I wore
Now the leather and lace still hang in place but I never see him anymoreEmbed
