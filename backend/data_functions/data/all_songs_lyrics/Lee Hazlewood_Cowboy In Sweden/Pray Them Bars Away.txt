Pray Them Bars Away Lyrics
Four years down and twenty one to blow
Ten thousand more breakfasts to go
Fourteen million seconds of living this way
And I guess it's time I started to pray them bars away
I wonder what you're doing since I don't see you none
Are you still a doin' all them rotten things we done
If you've got some spare time why don't you learn to pray
Maybe you can help me to pray them bars away
Remember old Red Barber we checked out last night
He still hold them eighteen years it serves the devil's
Right
He checked out in a casket he've been sixty two today
I heard that he went crazy tryin' to pray them bars away
Sometimes I miss the women and miss them all I do
Sometimes I miss the whiskey and I miss the good times
Too
Sometimes I miss my mama I saw her Christmas Day
But I never miss a time to pray them bars away
I'm told I should be thankful for everything I've got
So thank you for the rock walls and the brave bulls
Thanks a lot
And thank you for the good job and twenty cents a day
Thank you for the break time to pray them bars awayEmbed
