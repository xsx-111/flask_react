Easy And Me Lyrics
We rode on trains with hunger and pain but we didn't cry
Easy and me and some other guy
We hook some rides, stood side by side and watch cars go
By
Easy and me and some other guy
The days and the nights we cared for each other
The wrongs and the rights we shared with each other
Then one day last week she kissed my cheek and whispered
Goodbye
Then Easy walked on with some other guy1Embed
