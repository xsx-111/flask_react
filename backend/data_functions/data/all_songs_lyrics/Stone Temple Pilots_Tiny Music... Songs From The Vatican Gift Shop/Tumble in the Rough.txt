Tumble in the Rough Lyrics
I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't live
I can't cry
I can't die
I can't walk
I can't talk
Booze
I can booze
Steal your shoes
So I can move
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough

I'm looking for a new meditation
Still looking for a new way to fly
Don't want any plastic validation
Not looking for a new way to die

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what? So what?
So what? So what?
I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't live
I can't cry
I can't die
I can't walk
I can't talk
Can't booze
I can't booze
Steal your shoes
So I can move
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough

I'm looking for a new stimulation
Quite bored of those inflatable ties
I'm looking for a new rock sensation
Dead fish don't swim around in jealous tides

I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what? So what?
So what? So what?
Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the Rough)
Left on a summer intermission
Can't hold you when I miss you
(Tumble in the Rough)
Left on a summer intermission


I can't eat
I can't sleep
I can't live
I can't cry
I can't die
I can't walk
I can't talk
Can't booze
I can't booze
Steal your shoes
So I can move
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough
Tumble in the rough
I made excuses for a million lies
But all i got was humble kidney pie
I made excuses for a million lies
But all I got was humble kidney pie
So what? So what? So what?Embed
