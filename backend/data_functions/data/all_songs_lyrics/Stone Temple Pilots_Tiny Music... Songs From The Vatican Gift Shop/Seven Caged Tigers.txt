Seven Caged Tigers Lyrics
Pass the time kicking as time rips by
Neither goose nor the gander fly
Buy a minute spend an hour burning, burning
Take a peak as the model earns it, earns it
Walk a mile as it keeps crawling, crawling
Clean the politician, and wash with ever-pure

So the answer gets harder
And the truth's getting farther and farther
And the bottle keeps churning and churning
Seven caged tigers fly by, fly by

Wasting time chasing those cows that fly
Churning out all that butterfly sugar-boost
Track the blade as it sweeps downward and onward
Take a pill it'll kill all the martyrs, martyrs
Passing time ripping as time kicks by
Pass the umbilical cord down for fly by
Take a sneak while the model she earns it, earns it
Hike a mile as it keeps crawling, crawling

So the answer gets harder, harder
And the truth's getting farther and farther
And the bottle keeps churning and churning
Seven caged tigers fly by, fly by
So the answer gets harder, harder
And the truth's getting farther and farther
And the bottle keeps churning and churning
Seven caged tigers fly by, fly by1Embed
