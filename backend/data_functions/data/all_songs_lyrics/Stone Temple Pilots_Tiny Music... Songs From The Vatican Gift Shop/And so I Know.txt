And so I Know Lyrics
And so I know, it's begun again
Never be the same, and with that I said
Never ever ever be this way again
Hold on till the end
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
Like it's the last hello
Whirlwinds and roller-coasters
Long grass making shapes hello
Disappearing, disappearing floating graves

Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
And never, ever be this way again
Never, ever, ever, ever be this way
And never, ever be this way again

And so I know (Campfire girls make me feel alright)
It's begun again
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
Never the same, and with that I said
(Campfire girls make me feel alright)
Campfire girls, make me feel alright
Campfire girls, make me feel alright
