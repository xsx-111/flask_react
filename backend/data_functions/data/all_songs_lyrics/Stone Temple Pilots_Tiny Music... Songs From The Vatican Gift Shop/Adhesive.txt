Adhesive Lyrics
My friend blue he runs the show
With hot pink purple china glow
His family trees are molded
No longer grows in summer
He holds it closer lets it go
Picks a fruit but keeps it whole
Can't keep the submarining
Can't keep the light from fading

Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's so so confusing

Ain't the same for you and me
Cartoons like reality dogs and cats and children
The deepest wound is hidden
Ain't the same for you and me
Comatose commodity
The superheroes dying
All the children crying
Sell more records if i'm dead
Purple flowers once again
Hope it's sooner
Hope it's near corporate records' fiscal year
Down the river, down the river
Have a listen lend an ear
Here's a song now if ya care
We can all just hum along
Words don't matter anymore
Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drum it out
It's so so confusing
Adhesive love, adhesive
Adhesive love
Adhesive love, adhesive
Adhesive love

Flying high across the plain
Purple flowers ease the pain
Here, now have a listen
Ain't the songs you're missing
Down the river, down the river

Stitch the womb and wet the bed
With a whisper i'll be dead
Don't let the living die yet!
Grab the hate and drown it out
Grab the beat and drown it out
It's all so confusing
Adhesive love, adhesive
Adhesive love
Adhesive love, adhesive
Adhesive love2Embed
