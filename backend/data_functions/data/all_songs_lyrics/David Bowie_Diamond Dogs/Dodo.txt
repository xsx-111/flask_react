Dodo LyricsNow we can talk in confidence
Did you guess that we've been done wrong
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line
Such a shameless design
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top
It's a shame that his children disagree
They coolly decide to sell him down the line
Daddy's brainwashing time
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
He's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore
When a unit was a figure not a she
When lovers chose each other now the perk's are due
Another memo to screw
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
She's a dodo, no no didn't hear it from me
Can you wipe your nose my child without them spotting in your file a photograph
Can you sleep alone at night wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim
He's come to turn you in
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me
Another do, do
Didn't hear it from meEmbed
