True Confessions LyricsDon't look so surprised
You've been telling me lies
It's hard to wake up to your makeup
So please take off that disguise
All your true
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
True
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
You are just a gnat
I don't know it for a fact
I got a picture from your sister
There was writing on the back
All your true
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
True
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
(Self-delusion)
(Or confusion)
(Sometimes winning)
(Always losing)
Let's sit down and sort this out
Not so hard to talk about
You can hide your fears and tears
You can even scream and shout
All your true
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
True
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
Don't look so surprised
You've been telling me lies
It's hard to wake up to your makeup
So please take off that disguise
All your true
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
True
(True-true-true-true-true)
Your true confessions
(Self-delusion)
(Or confusion)
(Sometimes winning)
(Always losing)Embed
