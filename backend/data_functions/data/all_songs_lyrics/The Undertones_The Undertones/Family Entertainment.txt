Family Entertainment LyricsSo you think you're so clever
Never in doubt
But I've seen you together
Fooling about
Don't get me wrong, now
I've seen what you are
Mummy wouldn't like it
It's gone too far
Got to
(Keep it in the family)
Learn to
(Keep it in the family)
Have to
(Keep it in the family)
Want to
(Keep it in the family)
Playing with each other
It's your favorite game
(Favorite game)
You never try to hide it
There's no shame
(There's no shame)
You'll soon be discovered
What will you do then?
Family entertainment will come to an end
Got to
(Keep it in the family)
Learn to
(Keep it in the family)
Have to
(Keep it in the family)
Want to
(Keep it in the family)
Keep it in the family
(Family)
