Here Comes The Summer LyricsOoh baby, baby, what can I do?
You know you drive me crazy when I'm looking at you
The summer's really here, and it's time to come out
Time to discover what fun is about
Here comes the summer 
Keep a lookout for the girls with their faces all tanned
They're lying on the beaches, all covered in sand
Stretching out their long legs, lying in the sun
They know they're beautiful, they're having fun
Here comes the summer 

Here comes the summer 
Lookout for the girls with their faces all tanned
They're lying on the beaches, all covered in sand
Stretching out their long legs, lying in the sun
They know they're beautiful, they're having fun
Here comes the summer...Embed
