Wrong Way LyricsStop treating me this way, girl
'Cause you know I meant no harm
Is this the way you want it to be now?
My head's going 'round and 'round
I can't understand the way things are
This is the wrong way
You'll have to change someday
Stop treating me this way, girl
'Cause you know I meant no harm
Is this the way you want it to be now?
My head's going 'round and 'round
I can't understand the way things are
This is the wrong way
You'll have to change someday

I can't understand the way things are
This is the wrong way
You'll have to change somedayEmbed
