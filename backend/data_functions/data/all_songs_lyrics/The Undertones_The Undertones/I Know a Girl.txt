I Know a Girl LyricsI know a girl
I know that she knows about me
She's not just a girl
I think that she knows how I feel
I know a girl
I know a girl
I know a girl
See her all the time in the street
She makes me feel
I'm in love every time that we meet
I know a girl
(I)
I know a girl

I know a girl
See her every day in the week
She makes me feel
I'm in love every time that we meet
I know a girl
(I)
I know a girl...Embed
