Teenage Kicks Lyrics
A teenage dream's so hard to beat
Every time she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good

I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

I'm gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over 'cause I'm all alone
I need excitement, oh, I need it bad
And it's the best I've ever had

I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
All right!

A teenage dream's so hard to beat
Every time she walks down the street
Another girl in the neighbourhood
Wish she was mine, she looks so good
I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night

I'm gonna call her on the telephone
Have her over 'cause I'm all alone
I need excitement, oh, I need it bad
And it's the best I've ever had

I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
All right!

I wanna hold her, wanna hold her tight
Get teenage kicks right through the night
All right!4Embed
