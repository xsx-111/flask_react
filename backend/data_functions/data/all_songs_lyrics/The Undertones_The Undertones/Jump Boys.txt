Jump Boys LyricsJump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
Jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
Jump boys are crazy
They don't have no sense
Never getting lost in coincidence
Never lost for words, they're always shooting for the moon
To make it with the girls who can't come to their rooms
Oh, jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
Jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
They're too slick to be sorry, got more energy than most
Night time's not the only time they prowl the streets like ghosts
Say what they like to your face, never try to walk away
Get into trouble, they've got a lot to say
Oh, jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
Jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)

(Ooh, jump boys) 
Ah, jump boys are crazy
They don't have no sense
Never getting lost in coincidence
Never lost for words, they're always shooting for the moon
To make it with the girls who can't come to their rooms
Oh, jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
Jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
Jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)
We're all jump boys
(Ooh, jump boys)Embed
