Jimmy Jimmy LyricsLittle mummy's boy
He wasn't very old
Though he was very small
He did what he was told
Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh
Jimmy, Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go
He'd stay awake at night
(Whoa-oh-oh oh)
Lying in his bed
No one ever listened
(Whoa-oh-oh oh)
To a single word he said
Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh
Jimmy, Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go
(Silly boy)
(Silly boy)
(Silly boy)
(Such a silly boy)
Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh
Oh Jimmy, Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go
Now little Jimmy's gone
(Whoa-oh-oh oh)
He disappeared one day
But no one saw the ambulance
(Whoa-oh-oh oh)
That took little Jim away
Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh
Jimmy, Jimmy
Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go
(Poor little Jimmy wouldn't let go)

Jimmy, Jimmy
Jimmy, Jimmy, oh...Embed
