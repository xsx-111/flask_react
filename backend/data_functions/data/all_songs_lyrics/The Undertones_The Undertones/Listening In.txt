Listening In LyricsI was sitting on my own
No one rang 'til I picked up the phone
Then I heard your voice, I was listening in
You were talking in the hall
I wasn't there, but I heard it all
Nothing I could do, just listening in
(Listening in)
On the carpet you're so small
He had you covered wall to wall
Nothing I could do, just listening in
(Listening in)
Now you're gone and your line's dead
Nothing I can do instead
No more, no more, no more listening in
(Listening in)Embed
