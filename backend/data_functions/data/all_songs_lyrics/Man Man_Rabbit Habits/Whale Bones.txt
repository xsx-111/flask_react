Whale Bones LyricsHe felt her curves surrounding his neck
Like a yoke; he knows he'll never forget
The way she cut through his bed
Like a snake would bite through a cape of flesh
But he holds her though she's broken
Swears he don't care where she's been
He's tired of being human
Wears her close to the bone as though
She were his own skin
Shoots from the heart instead of the head
His mouth and his words, they rarely connect
He looks to the past and where his tongue's tread
And he knows he's meant the opposite
But she holds him like an infant
Though it breaks her in half to know he'll wake like a man
Sold on cold indifference
When he reaches for her, she's gone
She slips like the wind through blackened sails, but
Who are we to love at all?
I hope you don't mind
If I hang all of my hopes
I hang all of my hopes on this time
Although I've been warned
I'll probably get burned
I'd rather get burned
Than to not try
I hope you don't mind
If I hang all of my hopes
I hang all of my hopes on this time
'cause you won't
