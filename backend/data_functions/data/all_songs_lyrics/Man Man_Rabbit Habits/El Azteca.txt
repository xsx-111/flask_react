When the pyramids fall back
The pyramid's gods will come and take
All the dancing in the temple shrine
The tarantulas will be keeping mine
(HUH!)
When the pyramids fall back
The pyramid's gods will come and take
All the dancing in the temple shrine
The tarantulas will be keeping mine
(SHAKE!!!)
When the pyramids fall back
(YOUR BODY IS MINE!!!)
The pyramid's gods will come and take
(ALL MINE!!!)
All the dancing in the temple shrine
(SACRIFICE!!!)
The tarantulas will be keeping mine
