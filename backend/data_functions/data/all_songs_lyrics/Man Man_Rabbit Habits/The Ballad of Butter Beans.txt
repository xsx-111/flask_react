The Ballad of Butter Beans LyricsButter beans, I’m gonna get you
I’m gonna stick you I’m gonna take you down
And then romp; I’m goin' to hell, you're riding shot gun
(Butter beans, I’m gonna get you
I’m gonna get you, I’m gonna get you)
Butter beans, I know she wants you
That you’ll make a lovely headdress or
A double breasted suit of skin
(Butter beans, I’m gonna get you
I’m gonna get you, I’m gonna get you)
Cause Butter beans, you better stay sharp
Cause I’m gonna freeze out life blood from that black heart
I’m gonna fry I’m gonna fry with a smile on my face
(Butter beans, I’m gonna get you, I’m gonna get you
I’m gonna get you)
You think you’re so slick
I seen her lipstick 'cross your dillsnick
You think you’re so slick
I seen a lipstick cross you're dillsnick
Butter beans, you go and try and hide
In the swamp grass I got swamp eyes
And I’ll track you down like a bloodhound
It’s your time to die
(Butter beans I’m gonna get you, I’m gonna get you
I’m gonna get you)
Butter beans, you’ve gotten so fat
I can barely carry your weight across my tiny back
Taught me singing and aim and I'll sin when you say my name
(Butter beans, I’m gonna get you, I’m gonna get you
I’m gonna get you)
Real thick black magic can't stop the tragedy
From happening
Pig’s feet and snake piss
Crow tongue and cat face
Horse tail and bone bits
Bird’s nest and grave dust
All of it won’t keep the tragedy from happening
So runEmbed
