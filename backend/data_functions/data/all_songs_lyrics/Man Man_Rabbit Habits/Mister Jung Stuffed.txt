Mister Jung Stuffed LyricsBeen locked down way too long
I've been locked down way too long
Been locked down way too long
I've been locked down way too long
Been locked down way too long
I've been locked down way too long
Been locked down way too long
I've been locked down way too long
Take me in your boat
To those fiery shores
I don't want to love
Anymore
Up she goes, down she goes
Up she goes, down she goes
Up she goes, down she goes
Up she goes, down she goes
Oh no, this man
Crawls into my skin
When I’m this man
Don’t never see the way
I want to crawl
All up into your skin
And on my own
Throw it to the wind
Take me in your arms
Out of harms way
I don’t want to love
Anymore
Lay me on the shores
Of the fiery shores
I don’t want to love
AnymoreEmbed
