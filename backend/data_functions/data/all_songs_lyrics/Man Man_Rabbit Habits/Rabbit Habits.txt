Rabbit Habits LyricsDon't you dare say that you weren't warned
That the end was coming soon
And your eyes shine like Oppenheimer's
As he talks about the boom
And he don't even taste the food he eats anymore
And there's a space in place of where his heart was before
And he don't even taste the food he eats anymore
And she don't wanna dine alone
And he don't wanna die alone
And she wants to live to eat
Don't you dare say that you weren't warned
That the end was coming soon
And your eyes shine Enola Gay-like
As you see the light of day
And he don't even taste the food he eats anymore
And there's a space in place of where his heart was before
And he don't even taste the food he eats anymore
And he don't wanna dine alone
And she don't wanna die alone
And he wants to eat to live
You're an elegant little pelican
And all your sorrows are stacked
Amongst your nest of friends
And over time, defined by how you carry on
And all of the torch songs you keep inside
And all of the songs that hang in the night
Even after you're goneEmbed
