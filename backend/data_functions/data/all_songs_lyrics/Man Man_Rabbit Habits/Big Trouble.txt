Big Trouble LyricsWhatever makes you tick
Is what makes me crawl
Through the mud, the blood and the mammaries
And the worst of it all
What have you seen my past
You shouldn't see
Love me like each breath you use
And use me like you breathe
'Cause you make me feel
Like a zombie
Forever fall into pieces
All over your feet
Woe is me
I'm a zombie
You look bodacious
In that guillotine
The way you look right through me, girl
It sucks me down the street
And I pray for days
When we're quarantined and squirreled away
'Cause one-on-one with you
It's like wounded outlaws on the run
And you make me feel
Like a zombie
Forever fall into pieces
All over your feet
Woe is me
I'm a zombie
Forever falling like peanut brittle
All over your skin
You walk like a man
But you talk like a fool
You strut like a stallion
But you hump like a mule
You walk like a man
But you talk like a fool
You strut like a stallion
But you walk like a mule
You walk like a man
But you talk like a fool
You strut like a stallion
But you fuck like a mule
Well I'm a son of a gun
I'm the outcome of cum
The way I feel inside you, girl
I'm the bratwurst in your bun
And you make me feel
Like a zombieEmbed
