Doo Right LyricsI wanna hold you
Till the mountains turn into sand
Oh my God, what happened to all those days
Before we were bruised
Before we were cut loose
To drown in your wake
I can't breathe underwater
Like I used to 'fore I met you, oh
I just can't remember
January straight through December
My collective memories are in shambles
And so are my scruples
I'm outside your window
Throwin' bricks at the moon
I can't breathe underwater
Like I used to 'fore I met youEmbed
