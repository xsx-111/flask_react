Top Drawer LyricsYou need a haircut
You need a shoeshine
You need aristocratic
Glow-in-the dark erotic magnet
I know
You need more debt
Half boar, half horse head
You need a black cadillac
So death can drive him or ride in the back
I know
I am a smoke fire
Scared of holy water
People claim I'm possessed by the devil
But mama, I know I'm possessed by your daughter
I know
I've been told
I am dancing through
I am the top dog, top dog
Hot dog, hot dog
I am the top dog, top dog
Hot dog, hot dog
You need new body
You need a new latte
You need the lingering scent
Of elderly men doing hot pilate
I know
You cried "Wet cement!"
You love accidents
You wonder where the true love went
'Cause a breeder in your bed don't butter your bread
I know
I am a smoke fire
Scared of holy water
People claim I'm possessed by your daughter
But mama, I know I'm possessed by a problem
I know
I've been told
I'm passing through
I am the top dog, top dog
Hot dog, hot dog
I am the top dog, top dog
Hot dog, hot dog
I know
I've been told
I'm passing through
I am the top dog, top dog
Hot dog, hot dog
I am the1Embed
