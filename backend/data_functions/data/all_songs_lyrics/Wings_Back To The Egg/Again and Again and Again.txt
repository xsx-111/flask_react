Again and Again and Again Lyrics
Now, you don't want to be the little woman
No, you don't want to be the little woman I love
No, no, no, no
I love
Now, you don't want to stay in my school
You don't want to be the one that's cool
You don't want to be the little woman I love

You're up all night, and we can let it hang out right (Yeah!)
I said good-bye to all my expectations
The day you walked out of my life

Winter time is a-coming now
Give me a sign if you can somehow
Make it clear where you're heading for
Will I see you someday at my door?

Taking it all into consideration
Love's a game I never win
I've been in very similar situations
Again and again and again
Oh, no, you don't want to be the little woman
You don't want to be the little woman I love
I love
Now you don't want to stay in my home
You just want be on your own
Well you don't want to be the little woman I love
Take it away!

Go down right

Well, things were fine all the summer long
And then things changed, so where did we go wrong?
We can run, but we cannot hide
In greener grass on the other side

Taking it all into consideration
Love's a game I never win
I've been in very similar situations
Again and again and again

Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and again and again (and again, and again)
Again and...Embed
