After the Ball/Million Miles LyricsAfter the Ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me
After the ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me
After the ball

Well, I arrived, looked around, but the room was full of strangers
Nowhere was a friendly face to be found
Later on, I awoke, but the party it was over
There you were waiting to bring me around

After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me
After the ball
After the ball, after the ball
You were the one out in the hall
You were the one, the one who would love me
After the ball
Million Miles
How many million miles, Deo?
How many million miles, Deo?

When I get up, up, up in the morning
Whoa! Lord, I know
When I look up, up, up in the evening
Whoa! Lord, I know

How many million miles, Deo?
How many million miles, Deo?

How many million miles, Deo?Embed
