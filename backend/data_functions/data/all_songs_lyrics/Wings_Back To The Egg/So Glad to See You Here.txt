So Glad to See You Here Lyrics
Someone's got a home tonight
Someone's got a road tonight
Someone's got a wed, action will be red
Why'd you want to worry?
Oh, you're gonna knock them dead again
Well someone's got a show tonight
Someone's got to go tonight
Someone's doing rhyme, someone turn your mind
Someone lift your eyes up
Leaning towards the light
Woo hoo

So glad to see you here, so glad you could come (Yeah!)
So glad to see you here
Carry on, carry on

Yeah, yeah!
Oh, we're going up tonight
Well in time to make a flight
The airplane's standing on the runway
Engine nervously waiting for something to bite
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Got to roll tonight
You got to roll tonight
Some have got it bad, some have got to do it
You got it better, and there's nothing to it
No no no no
So glad to see you here, so glad you could come (Yeah!)
So glad to see you here
Carry on, carry on

Ah we opened up tonight
Someone's got to hold the light
Someone's got a wed, action will be red
Why'd you want to worry?
Oh you gonna knock 'em dead yeah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Whoa

We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for fun
We're open tonight for funEmbed
