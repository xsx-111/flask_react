Spin It On Lyrics
This is it!

Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
I wanna spin it on
Spin it on!

Off to the flicks with the piddle in her nicks
To the fair with her hair in curlers
Their cousins didn't get all down to the pleasure dome
Their cousins didn't spend their night in an aircraft hanger
Memories

Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
That's why I always spin it on
Spin it on, spin it on!
Spin it on!
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
That's why I wanna spin it on
Off to the fields with a missionary's zeal for the life
Of the wife of the farmer
Their cousins didn't get on down to the village hall
Their cousins didn't spend their night on a pinball table
Memories

Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you
That's why I wanna spin it on
Spin it on, spin it on!
Spin it on!
I wanna spin it on!
Spin it on!
I wanna spin it on!
Spin it on!
Spin it on, don't stop
Take it back to the top
'Cause I've got another lot of love for you2Embed
