Old Siam, Sir Lyrics
In a village in Old Siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way
In an effort to find a man, sir
She found herself in the old U.K.
She waited 'round in Walthamstow
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
She waited 'round in Walthamstow
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
In the village in old East End, sir
She met a fellow who made her reel
Took her rushes to show his mam, sir
Met his dad at the wedding meal


In a letter from Old Siam, sir
Came a terrible tale of woe
She decided the only answer
Was to get up a pile of dough
She waited 'round in Walthamstow
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
She waited 'round in Walthamstow
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
When a relative told her man, sir
He directed her not to stay
In a village in Old Siam, sir
Lives a lady who lost her way


In a village in Old Siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way
In an effort to find a man, sir
She found herself in the old U.K.
She waited 'round in Walthamstow
She scouted 'round in Scarborough
She waited 'round in Walthamstow
She scouted 'round in Scarborough

In a village in Old Siam, sir
Lived a lady who lost her way
In an effort to find a man, sir
She found herself in the old U.K.
