To You Lyrics
Well, if the same thing happened to you
Will you still put me through what you put me through?

If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
What if it happened-

And the man keeps shaking you down
But you can't get a ride to his side of town?

If it happened to you
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
Keep it out of my shoes, and if you're stepping on toes
Keep it out of my nose

'Cause if the same thing happened to me
Well, it won't be as bad as it used to be

If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
What if it happened to you?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you too?

Well, if it happens to you
If it happens to you
What if it happens to you?
Keep it out of my shoes, and if you're stepping on toes
Well, keep it out of my nose

'Cause if the same thing happened to me
Well, it won't be as bad as it used to be

If it happens to you
If it happens to you
What am I going to do?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
If it happened to you
What if it happened to you?
If it happened to youEmbed
