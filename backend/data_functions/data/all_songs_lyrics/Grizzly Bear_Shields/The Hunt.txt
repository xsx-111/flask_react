The Hunt Lyrics
Prove it all to me
Check again to see
Leave me with no words
If you call again, subside

And I know I've made it all a lie
Shuffled back and forth, it's only in my eyes
And Iâ€™ve always wanted to rescind
Everything I bought until there's no amend

Fool me once, it's fair
The floodgates leave me there
I count on you in a way
There's nothing left besides

And I want to hide it all away
Taking back all of the silly things I used to say
And I'll give you all of my time
Because I'm foolish and never know how to resign
Looking back and forth, turn around
One that makes no sense but feels good anyhow
And I'll leave it all as it should be
Where you are you and I stay me2Embed
