Yet Again Lyrics
Yet again, we're the only ones
No surprise, this is often how it's done
Lately it's about all I can take
I will move, mend and mold this break
Shell with another crack
I'm small but I can keep track
Too soon, everyone just step away
I'm sure this isn't the last play

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely have a case
It's done before we try
It's darkened and by night
A desert in your face

Keep score, even playing feels this game
I know when all said we're the same
If I could I would leave it all be
No chance to move backwards and see

Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely have a case
It's done before we try
It's darkened and by night
A desert in your face
Take it all in stride
Speak, don't confide
We barely have a case
It's done before we try
It's darkened and by night
A desert in your face14Embed
