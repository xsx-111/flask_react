A Simple Answer Lyrics
Those saints in lockstep
Across the wasteland
Forever gone
They're home and walk along
Plod ever onward
Across some tundra
The light is long
But it's not long before it's gone
Well fine

It calls you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness, mercy mine
Soldier on, but please not so long
This time

Too young and thoughtless
To comb your memories
I know it's wrong
Just give until it's gone
Some tired mantra
Calls ever onward
Shout it loud
Just make it up somehow
Well alright
And it'll call you back to mind
At once, at last
Oh goodness, mercy mine
Soldier on, but please not so long
This time

Move on, let's face
That all you trust is a cynical phrase
No time, no place
When all you hope is that everything breaks
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like
No wrong or right
Just do whatever you like

No bliss, no light
Tell me it's all just a lie
You can't scare me none
I'm still the lucky one6Embed
