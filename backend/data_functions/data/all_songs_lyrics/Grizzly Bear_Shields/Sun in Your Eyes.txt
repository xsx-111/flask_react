Sun in Your Eyes Lyrics
You've fallen once you'll fall again, and lean on
Your tired hands that crawl and grasp, the soft ground

By the look on your face
You set out on a path
Never to arrive
By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes

Stretched out far and wide, the light that scorched the sand
So bright so long, I'm never coming back

Every stone and every step, I won't recall
Emptied of every thought, just soft ground

By the look on your face
The burden's on your back
And the sun is in your eyes
Gone at last
Stretched out far and wide, the light that scorched the sand
So bright so long, I'm never coming back

It overflows, it overflows, It always runs
It overflows, it overflows, It always runs
Silver and silent
Endless abundance overflows
Silver and silent rushing on
Endless abundance overflows
Always surrounds you, always glows
Look on your face
Burden's on your back
Sun is in your eyes

Stretched out far and wide, the light that scorched the sand
So bright so long, I'm never coming back4Embed
