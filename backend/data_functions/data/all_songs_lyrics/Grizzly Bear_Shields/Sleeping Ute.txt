Sleeping Ute LyricsDreamed the long day
Just wandering free
Though I'm far gone
You sleep nearer to me
If I could find peace
If this night leaves
But I can't help myself
So I'll walk out
These wandering dreams
Up the north road
Dressed gold and green
If I could lie still
As that great hill
But I can't help myself
Well, it's calm and it's clear
Collapsed here on the stone
Delivered to this place
A vision dark and cloaked
And those figures through the leaves
And that light through the smoke
And those countless empty days
Made me dizzy when I woke
And I live to see your face
And I hate to see you go
But I know no other way
Than straight on out the door
And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself
And I can't help myself12Embed
