Skip-a-Long Sam LyricsCome run jump skip a long sam
A very happy man I am
To know you are well and you're doing fine
Kind-of puts at rest my mind
How's your brush and your lady fair
Not to mention your stained glass stair
Flower pot on window sill
On top of honeycomb hill
Have you found the secret door
To let you down to the earth's deep core
You'll be back in time fot tea
With a diamond to show me
Come run jump skip a long sam
A very happy man I am
To know you are well and you're doing fine
Kind-of puts at rest my mind
How's your brush and your lady fair
Not to mention your stained glass stair
Flower pot on window sill
On top of honeycomb hillEmbed
