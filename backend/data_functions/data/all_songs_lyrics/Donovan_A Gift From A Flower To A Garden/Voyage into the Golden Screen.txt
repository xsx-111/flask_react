Voyage into the Golden Screen LyricsIn the golden garden Bird of Peace
Stands the silver girl the Wild Jewels niece
Paints in pretty colours children's drawings on the wall
Look of doubt I cast you out begone your ragged call
In the forest thick a trick of light
Makes an image magnet to my sight
Gown of purple velvet enchanted glazed eye
The sound of wings and sparkling rings behold a crimson sky
Tread so light so not to touch the grass
Breathe the air so slowly as you pass
Silent sudden dewdrop lies unseen until
Eyes to fall to hidden call the power of love and will
Symphonies of seaweed dance and swoon
God's celestial shore beneath the moon
See the dark and mighty peaks pierce the cumulus
Violet and mauve they sit power you can suss
Tread so light so not to touch the grass
Breathe the air so slowly as you pass
Elvin fingers clutch a deep black cloak of fine Damask
Aged rocks in Mexico reveal a bejewelled cask
In the golden garden Bird of Peace
Stands the silver girl the Wild Jewels niece
Paints in pretty colours children's drawings on the wall
Look of doubt I cast you out begone your ragged callEmbed
