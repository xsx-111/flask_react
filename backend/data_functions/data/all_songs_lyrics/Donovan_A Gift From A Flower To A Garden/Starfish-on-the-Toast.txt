Starfish-on-the-Toast LyricsFine rock-pooling coast
This Starfish-On-The-Toast
The men in the crabbin' boats they cry
Far across the harbour
And 'round the sandy cove
The Shepherd wi' his pipe and sheepy-drove
Big cloud tumbling high
The amazing flying sky
How the gulls are pillaging the town
Fanfaring daffodilly trumpetingly small
All along the bathing hut wall
Far across the empty beach the tide has left a world
Old men in tweed find study there
Holding whelks and periwinkles tingling in his hand
Little does he know they hold him too
Fine rock-pooling coast
This Starfish-On-The-Toast
The men in the crabbin' boats they cryEmbed
