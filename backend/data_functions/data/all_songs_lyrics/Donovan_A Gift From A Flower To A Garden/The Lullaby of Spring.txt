The Lullaby of Spring LyricsSpring has showered far her drip
Splash and trickle running
Plant has flowered in the sand
Shell and pebble sunning;
So begins another spring
Green leaves and of berries
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Motherbird eating cherries
In the misty, tangled sky
Fast a wind is blowing
In a newborn rabbit's heart
River life is flowing
So begins another spring
Green leaves and of berries
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Motherbird eating cherries
From the dark and whetted soil
Petals are unfolding
From the stony village kirk
Easter bells of old ring
So begins another spring
Green leaves and of berries
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Motherbird eating cherries
Spring has flowered far her drip
Splash and trickle running
Plant has flowered in the sand
Shell and pebble sunning
So begins another spring
Green leaves and of berries
Chiff-chaff eggs are painted by
Motherbird eating cherriesEmbed
