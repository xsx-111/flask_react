Oh Gosh LyricsWith your coat of many colours
And the flowers in your hair
You may while away the pleasant hours
To think upon all that is fair
Think about it you'll agree
Many miracles you'll see
Miracles you'll seee ee
You'll see ee ee, see ee ee, ee
With the baby in your belly
And the poems on your tongue
You may chance to see me on your telly
Giving love to the newborn one
To look upon and to touch
Oh gosh life is really too much
Life is really too much
You'll seee ee ee, seee ee ee, eeEmbed
