Little Boy in Corduroy LyricsA little boy in corduroy
A little girl in lace
A little coy jump for joy
Colour in a space
Little boy in corduroy
After me say
Save a sunny wish for a rainy day
How many wishes can you wish in a day
Wish i had a wish to wish a wish away
Take a seed
Thread a bead
Make a pretty thing
In a deed plant a seed
Make a daisy ring
Little boy in corduroy
After me say
How many wishes can you wish in a day
I wish i had a wish to wish a wish away
Little boy in corduroyEmbed
