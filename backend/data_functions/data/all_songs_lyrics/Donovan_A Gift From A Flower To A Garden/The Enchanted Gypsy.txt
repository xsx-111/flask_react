The Enchanted Gypsy LyricsA day once dawned, as sleepers yawned
A day of leaves so greeny—o
That a man rode high
In a tinker's sky
And bade me to go a-running—o
And follow the path of a gypsy—o
Seaweed clings to ruby rings
On the fingers of my Lady—o
And the people in the town
They would not look round
To see me go a-running—o
On the trail of the Enchanted Gypsy—o
I passed a glade, and took me shade
Beneath an Oak so twisty—o
And a vision I saw
As a Crow did "craw"
No more need I go a-searching—o
One the trail of the Enchanted Gypsy—o
Seaweed clings to ruby rings
On the fingers of my Lady—o
And the people in the town
They would not look round
To see me go a-running—o
On the trail of the Enchanted Gypsy—o
His caravan was a-painted by a hand
That's touched every pebble in the ocean—o
And the pictures there
They move in thin air
They're forever a-telling—o
The tales of the Enchanted Gypsy—o
Seaweed clings to ruby rings
On the fingers of my Lady—o
And the people in the town
They would not look round
To see me go a-running—o
To follow the path of a gypsy—o
