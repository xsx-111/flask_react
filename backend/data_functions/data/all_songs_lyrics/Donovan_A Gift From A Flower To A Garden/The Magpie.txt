The Magpie LyricsThe Magpie is a most illustrious bird
Dwells in a diamond tree
One brings sorrow and one brings joy
Sorry and joy for me
The Magpie is a most royal bird
Black and blue as night
I would that I had feathers three
Black and blue and white
I saw the gentle Magpie birds
In dusky yester-eve
One brought sorrow and one brought joy
And sooner than soon did leave
The Magpie is a most illustrious bird
Dwells in a diamond tree
One brings sorrow and one brings joy
Sorrow and joy for me....
Sorrow and joy for me....Embed
