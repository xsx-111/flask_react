Sun Lyrics
Sun, the earth is turning (Turn, turn)
It's turning round (Round, round)
And love is the access (Love, love)
But they chop the tree down (Timber)
All the proud trees are standing (Nice trees)
As green as the sky (Sky, sky)
As green as the greenstone (Green, green)
That makes seabirds fly (Fly)

All the proud trees are standing
They're as tall as the sky
As green as the greenstone
That makes seabirds fly

Ovens are baking (Bread, bread)
And the rivers run dry (Dry, dry)
As dry as the ocean (You might say)
On wings of a fly (Fly, fly)
Go if you're able (Go, go)
And come if you can (Can, can)
Life's very unstable (Life, life)
It's built upon sand (Sand)
Marianne set the table
An old friend I see
Marianne fetch the papers
There's two for tea

Sun, the earth is turning (Turn, turn)
It's turning round (Round, round)
And love is the access (Love, love)
And they chop the tree down (Timber)
All the proud trees are standing (Nice trees)
They're as green as the sky (Sky, sky)
As green as the greenstone (Green, green)
That makes seabirds fly (Fly)

Go if you're able (Go, go)
And come if you can (Can, can)
Life's very unstable (Life, life)
It's built upon sand
Build upon sand
Lying in your hand1Embed
