Widow with Shawl (A Portrait) LyricsDear wind that shakes the barley free
Blow home my true love's ship to me
Fill her sail; I aweary wait upon the shore
Forsake her not in times of storm
Protect her oaken beams from harm
Fill her sail; I aweary wait upon the shore
Whether he be in Africa
Or deep asleep in India
Fill his dreams; I aweary wait upon the shore
Dear snow white gulls upon the wing
I, like you, am lamenting
For my love; I aweary cry upon the shore
And in my chariot of sleep
I ride the vast and dreamy deep deep sea
I awake aweary on the shore
Seven years and seven days
No man has seen my woman ways
Dear God; I aweary cry upon the shore
Along the shingle beach I go
The wind about me as I make my way
To my weary dream upon my bed
Dear wind that shakes the barley free
Blow home my true love's ship to me
Fill her sail; I aweary wait upon the shoreEmbed
