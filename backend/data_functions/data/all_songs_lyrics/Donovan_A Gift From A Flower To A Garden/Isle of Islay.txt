Isle of Islay LyricsHow high the gulls fly
O'er Islay
How sad the farm lad
Deep in play
Felt like a grain on your sand
How well the sheep's bell
Music makes
Roving the cliff
When fancy takes
Felt like a tide left me here
How blessed the forest
With birdsong
How neat the cut peat
Laid so long
Felt like a seed on your land1Embed
