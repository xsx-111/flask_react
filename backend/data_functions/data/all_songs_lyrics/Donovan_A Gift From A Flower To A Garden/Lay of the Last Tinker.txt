Lay of the Last Tinker LyricsI can see by your eyes you're a good man
And the sparkle of the ring on your hand
You have a muzzled dancing Monkey
A little cup in a hairy hand
Break cheese with me
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
Break cheese with me
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
A goat-skinned tambourine
What sights that has seen
Blazing eyes of dancers
Daughters of Tinker Queens
Break cheese with me
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
Break cheese with me
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
You hang your coat in a Gypsy fashion
I see a scar of an ancient lashing
Born a babe in Macedonia
To the sounds of seas a-crashing
Break cheese with me
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
Break cheese with me
Won't you break bread and have some wine?
I can see by your eyes you're a good man
And the sparkle of the ring on your hand
You have a muzzled dancing Monkey
A little cup in a hairy hand
I can see by your eyes you're a good man
And the sparkle of the ring on your hand
You have a muzzled dancing Monkey
A little cup in a hairy hand
There you go...Embed
