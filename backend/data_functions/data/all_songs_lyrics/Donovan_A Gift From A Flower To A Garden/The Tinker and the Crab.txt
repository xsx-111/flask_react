The Tinker and the Crab LyricsOn the windy beach the sun is shining
Through with weather fair
White horses riding on the seas
Pasture onto the sand
Over the Dunes came a travelling man
Sack on back Wild flowers in his hand
Old rusty cans
Pebbles 'bedded in the sand
Stand and stare
Scratching his beard through the grass
He steered his sandy shoe
Disappearing in the dips pondering
And wandering along
Nice as you please
Comes the travelling man
Drinking a bottle of milk in his hand
Speaking to no one in particular
But happily
Down where yon gulls dance
Driftwood lying drying for the fire
Yellow beak and sleek now
The gulls are crying flying higher
Out from the sea came a little green Crab
Taking the Sun the morning being very drab
Old rusty cans
Pebbles 'bedded in the sand
Stand and stare
The Tinker and the Crab
The Tinker and the Crab
The Tinker and the CrabEmbed
