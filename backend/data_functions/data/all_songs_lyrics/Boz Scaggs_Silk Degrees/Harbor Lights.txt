Harbor Lights LyricsSon of a Tokyo Rose
I was bound to wander from home
Stranger to whatever I'd awaken to
Spun the wheel, took a shot in the dark
One way ticket and a runaway heart
A sailor's dream came true the night I dreamed you
Through the neon doorways
Down the stony streets I fell
All hands high side, all eyes erect, I follow
Sailing shadows, reds and blues
Curtains drawn but I saw through
The window to your soul, and I found you
Whoa, the harbor lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back to you my love
To you my love, to you my love
My eyes must be betraying
But that lonesome jukebox playing
Something about the harbor lights is calling me
Back to some Jamaican Bay
Doesn't seem so far away
Keep the change, but I'll repay these memories
Dawn came in this morning
Like some old junked out melody
The words she spoke when we awoke still haunt me
What you feel too won't reveal you
Let me steal you from my life
Whoah, the harbour lights of Venus
Shining through the breeze
That brings me back to you my love
To you my love, to you my love
