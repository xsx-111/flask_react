Georgia LyricsGeorgia
I swear
I've never seen such a smile
Gorgeous enough
To make an angels heart run wild
Your lazy eyes and small town lies
Have got me in your spell
Your drive-in boys and backseat noises
Oh you learned so well
Oh oh oh
So how was I to know
You got me you got me... by now
Georgia
Your daddy was high
The night he dreamed of you
Georgia the stars were flying
The night that you came through
Christmas in your eyes
Oh what a nice surprise
Oh oh oh
And now I miss you so
But baby I'm comin' back to you
Georgia
We will be together dear
If they ever let me out of here
They will say that its not true
But I did it all for you
Georgia
Won't you tell them for me dear
Georgia girl
I never lived through a night like that
Sure enough
Got your loving where I like it at
Moonlight through the pines
Oh oh oh
But how were we to know
That wasn't moonlight
They were searchlights
Oh no
Georgia
We will be together dear
If they ever let me out of here
They will say that its not true
But I did it all for you
Georgia
Won't you tell them for me dear
Georgia
We will be together dear
Oh my dear
If they ever let me out of here1Embed
