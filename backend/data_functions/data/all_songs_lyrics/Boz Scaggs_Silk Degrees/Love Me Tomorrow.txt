Love Me Tomorrow LyricsYou say that you love me anyway
But I know it's not in your eyes
You say you can take it night and day
But I know it's an alibi
Dejon where did we go wrong
You said that you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
I say it's a sad sort of play
When you never get to my lines
You say that I'm better off this way
But I know it's all in your mind
Dejon where did we go wrong
You said that you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Forget all your sorrow
Love me tomorrow
Dejon where did we go wrong
You said that you'd be mine
Till the end of time
Love me tomorrow
Love me tomorrow
Forget all your sorrow
Love me tomorrowEmbed
