Jump Street LyricsDawn came sneaking
Like a skinny snake
The harder they go
The harder I ache
Get so high
Got so low
Somebody tell me
'Bout this debt I owe
West side bomber
Looked like a comer
Looked like I'll be back at school
Put two on the nose
And look how she goes
Little trained squeeze
Look like a fool
Rock on..
And I'm gone
Stone gone
Said you can forget about me
And I'm gone
Stone gone
Working girls
Just tryin to get ahead
Somebody's bound
To end up dead
And honey
You better stop coming down on me
On me
Stop
Jump Street
Sally comes creeping
At the break of dawn
Can't figure out
Whose side I'm on
Bomber comes back
Like a ringin' a bell
Knows a good thing
And she knows it well
Well enough best left alone
Wish your mamma
Had kept you at home
Wish your mamma
Had kept the evidence
Worryin' about the Feds
Has crucified me for dead
She wish I was dead
Well I wish I was dead
But I'm gone
Stone gone
As gone as I can be
And I'm gone
So gone
Don't look much
Like a Saturday night
Honey
Don't look for those flashing lights
But baby
You'd better stop coming down on me
Stop coming down on me
I don't need it
Stop coming down.. on me
Ow!
Jump Street
And I'm gone
Stone gone
You can forget about me yeah
I'm gone
Stone gone
So long
Workin' girls
Just tryin' to get ahead
Somebody's bound
To end up dead
Honey
You better stop comin' down on me
Stop your comin' down
Stop comin' down on me yeah
Stop comin' down on me
Look out funk
