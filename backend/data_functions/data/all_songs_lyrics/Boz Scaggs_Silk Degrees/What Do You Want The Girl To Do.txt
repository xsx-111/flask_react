What Do You Want The Girl To Do Lyrics(so...)
So you think the girl is crazy
To eat up your lies like it's good
(Your lies like apple pie)
(She don't even cry)
She is not a fool
She's just tryin' to do what her heart says to
To love you
And as you t
Ake to the wind
(to the wind again she breaks down)
And as she breaks down within (within, within)
Pre-chorus:
She waits for you patiently
Hopin' that someday you'll see
 all she really wants to be
Is yours and your
S alone, eternally
Chorus:
What do you want the girl to do
 you're breakin' the child in two
What do you want the girl to do
All she really wants is you
She knows what you are
Still she'll be your queen if you let
Her
(Just say the word today)
(Build the world around her)
Now and then you'll promise
All the way-out things you're goin' to get her
(You will see, you will see)
(You're so damn glad you found her, found her, years ago)
'Cause ma
Ybe she knows better
As she watched you come and go (all you'll show)
And as she watched your promises erode

What do you want the girl to do
Don't you know you're breakin' the child in two
What do you want the girl
To do
Can't you see you're breakin' the child in two Embed
