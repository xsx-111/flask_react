Can You Give It LyricsOne last push with all the strength of us all
Under one great shadow floorshow take the strain for us all
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
One last pull to tight the slack of before
Slow rolling boulder, rock, stone, pebble, grit, sand, dust, grain, speck of it all
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Bolt hold, tape together
Concrete to another
Bind tight, and deliver
Hold fast, hold fast, hold fast
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give it
Can you give itEmbed
