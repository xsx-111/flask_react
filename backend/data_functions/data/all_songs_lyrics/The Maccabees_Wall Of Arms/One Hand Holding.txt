One Hand Holding LyricsOh love, I was torn, I was torn
But I put those thoughts away
Love, just a thought
Will the gods look kindly, those thoughts are behind me
Oh, why would you be led to suppose
Oh, why would you be led by your nose
Why would you kill it, kill it
Kill it before it dies
Why would you kill it, kill it
Kill it before it dies
Those puffy eyes are no surprise
When there's a devil in the doorway, heaven in the hallway
Say you'll still adore me
And I'm far out on an ocean, trapped in a disaster
I'd say I still adore you
Oh, why would you carry on a name
Oh, why would you carry on the same
Why would you kill it, kill it
Kill it before it dies
Why would you kill it, kill it
Kill it before it dies
Those killer eyes don't look the same, the same
The same as they used to do
Not like the eyes, the eyes, the eyes
That I make at you, I make at you, I make at you
It was torn up, but now it's alright, alright
It was torn up alright
It was torn up, but now it's alright, alright
It was torn up alrightEmbed
