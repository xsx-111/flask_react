No Kind Words / Bag of Bones, Part A LyricsDear friend of mine has
Broken his union
Broke from tradition
Broken his vision of the future
Alone, alone, alone
Not alone at all
Dear friend of mine is
Testing his body
Tempting disaster, testing water
With another's daughter
Alone, alone, alone
Not alone at all
Dear friend of mine
My ear is bending
I'm not helping, I'm not telling
I'm not solving, I'm not saying you're pretending
Alone, alone, alone
Not alone at all
Alone, alone, alone
Not alone at all
Dear friend of mine is
Helpless without helping
Healed without scab or scar
New union found him
Alone, alone, alone
Not alone at all
If you've got no kind words to say
You should say nothing more at all
If you've got no kind words to say
You should say nothing more at all
If you've got no kind words to say
Carry no weight
Let the weight carry you
If you've got no kind words to say
You should say nothing more at allEmbed
