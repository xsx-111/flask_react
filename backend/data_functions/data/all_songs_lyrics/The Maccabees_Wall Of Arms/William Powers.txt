William Powers LyricsThere is love
There is lust
There is love fuelled lust, little thing called trust
Which I must not break
For you
Forsaking
All others but you
There are storms
I must brave
There are things I must do
Things I must not do to break
For you
Forsake
All others for you
And I'll see you when you're older
When we're older
And I'll see you when you're older
When we're older
Strong arms, they held you to it
That's what they are singing in the shadows
There's all this nonsense in the dark
We may bend
No doubt stretch
Pull at the seams of these four legged jeans for what is at stake
I will not break
For you
Forsake
All others for you
And I'll see you when you're older
When we're older
And I'll see you when you're older
When we're older
And in faith I left you to it
That's what they sing in the shadows
There's all this nonsense in the dark
Left you in strong arms
Two strong arms that held you through it
And I blew it, and I blew it
Now, now, now, now, now
There's something in it
Now, now, now, now, now
We've grown up with it
Now, now, now, now, now
We know, if that's enough
Then that's enough for now
Now, now, now, now, now
There's something in it
Now, now, now, now, now
We've grown up with it
Now, now, now, now, now
We know, if that's enough
Then that's enough for now
That's enough
Then that's enough for nowEmbed
