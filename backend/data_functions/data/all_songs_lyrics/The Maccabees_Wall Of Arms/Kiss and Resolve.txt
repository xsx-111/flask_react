Kiss and Resolve LyricsBegrudgingly I
I cut your hair
And argument, it
Followed there
That's growing old together
Lovers kiss, let's kiss
Kiss and resolve
So pride aside I
Clear the air
And sweet smells, they
Followed there
That's compromise sweetheart
Lovers kiss, let's kiss
Kiss and resolve
Oh, my love
There's ritual in the dance, my love
And under day old sheets
We will dance, my love
So sins confessed, I
Left you there
Went out into the
Midnight air
Taking my bedside manner
Lover's tryst, on the list
Left to kiss and resolve
Oh, my love
There's method in this madness, love
And in a moment of
Hold me, love
Oh, my love
There's ritual in the dance, my love
And under day old sheets
We will dance, my love
Little give, little take
Little something you break
Little salt, little shake
Sweetheart, oh sweetheart
Goodnight, goodnight
Sweetheart, goodnightEmbed
