Bag of Bones, Part B LyricsDouble noose a necklace
Bubble wrap to safe the place
Wrinkles of a trophy one
Could think of it as showing us the way
Think of it as showing us the way
Keep it all from sympathy
Your day today, your dignity
Bring the other brothers round
We'll think of it as showing us the way
We'll think of it as showing us the way
Bag of bones
Beautiful old bag of bones
So much more besides
Silent when you're so
Or silent, nothing more to say
Could think of it as showing us the way
Could think of it as showing us the way
Bag of bones
Beautiful old bag of bones
So much more besides
Bag of bones
Beautiful old bag of bones
So much more besides
Bag of bones
Beautiful old bag of bones
So much more besidesEmbed
