Love You Better LyricsBetter
Get another coal on the fake fire
Cover on the wet tiles
On the wet tiles
Better
Run it out of town
That thought will cost you more than just a sweet smile
To a sweet smile
And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better
And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better
Then we
Learn to love better
So the words you leave me on my pillow read better
Cheap card forever
Then we
Can pull it apart
And in time you see it's going better than ever
It's going better than ever
Hard fought, safe guard in your bedclothes
And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better
And I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better, I will love you better
I will love you better
I thought, and I thought, and I thought of you
I thought we'd be doing the faithful few
Together
Together
And I thought that you might feel the same
With your insect skin and the lion's mane
And be new
To be new
And the thought of you, it was crystal clear
I could warm myself up in you, dear
And be you
And be you
To be youEmbed
