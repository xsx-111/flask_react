Dinosaurs LyricsTrue ring, true ring
Gonna make this crystal sing
Other ways, other ways
Otherwise, we're just going backward
True ring, true ring
Gonna make this songbird sing
Get a load, get a load
Get a load, get a load of it
True ring, true ring
For the one that's listening
Sound advice, sound advice
Empty hands and tired eyes
True ring, true ring
Giving up and giving in
Little arms, little arms
Little arms on a big body
And I hold you to the light to see
And keep you safe inside of me
Oh
Restore this crack so
I want nothing tonight to hold but you
I keep this pillow, it's such a poor substitute
For a soul, a soul
For a soul, a soul
Truth told, truth told
Tear the tear, and fold the fold
Pick it up, pick it up
Pick it up when it's yours to hold
Truth told, truth told
When you hit the ground just roll
Bend your knees, bend your knees
Bend your knees when you're lifting these
And I hold you to the light to see
And cotton wool you safe in me
Oh
Restore this crack so
I want nothing tonight to hold but you
Keep close the cold compress, such a poor substitute
For a soul, a soul
For a soul, a soulEmbed
