Seventeen Hands LyricsCall out the soft sound
The four letter word that you found
Call it out
Call out the soft sound
And make it round, everyone together
Hell for leather over good ground
All caught up and love struck
All caught up in love struck hands
Struck hands
You're all caught up and love struck
Never seem to get enough
And everything you wanted
Gonna get it, go aesthetic, go
Hold out your left one
The number three finger from your thumb
And put it on, put it on the left one
And lay it down one upon the other as a measure of the way it stands
All caught up and love struck
All caught up in love struck hands
Struck hands
You're all caught up and mud stuck
Money made on good luck
And everything you wanted
Gonna get it, go aesthetic, go
So call out you're all fired up
You're all fired up
Call it out
Call out you're all fired up
You're all fired up
Call it out
Call out if you're love struck
All caught up with love struck hands around
Call out, you found it out
Cos you always would set it up
Only to let up
Hey, hey
Those are silver hairs
On your father's chin
And on your motherâ€™s head
Hey, hey
Those are still laughter lines
On your father's brow
And round your mother's eyesEmbed
