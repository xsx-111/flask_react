Beautiful girls with ugly guys
What do they take us for, anyway?
What do they take us for, anyway?
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
Ugly guys with beautiful girls
Ugly guys with beautiful girls
Ugly guys with beautiful girls
What, what, what, what
What, what, what, what
As they walk down the street, arm in arm
I see them and once again feel the need to ask myself the question
The question that has weighed heavily on me of late
"How is it possible that a guy and a girl
So dissimilar in physical appearance
There being such a disparity in how attractive each is
In nonetheless, in what would appear to be a relationship?"
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
What, what, what, what

Ugly guys with beautiful girls
What, what, what, what

How do we explain this?
An attraction of opposites?
No, that theory has been refuted by many experts in the fields of human psychology
A much greater attraction seems to come from one more similar to oneself
Personality perhaps? (What, what, what, what)
Without intending to sound judgmental
I would say he doesn't look like what was once called a "live wire"
Or "the life of the party"
He appears rather expressionless
His movements are stiff, and even awkward
Perhaps he's a person of some intellect?
An expert in science?
The arts? Political theory? No, I think not (What, what, what, what)
See how well tailored his clothes are?
How well cut his hair is? (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
What, what, what, what

I must confess to you, my listeners
That I have been a little less than honest
In pretending I had no answers to my previous questions
You see, I lost someone very dear to me (What, what, what, what)
Someone very beautiful
To someone much like him (What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what)
"Why," you ask?
Surely there must've been some areas where you were deficient and he was not
No, I don't believe so, my shortcomings were of an economic nature
He was rich, I was not (What, what, what, what)
You see, I underestimated the appeal to her of things
Imported things on wheels
Large things with manicured lawns and Olympic swimming pools
Things to wear around her neck that would glisten in the night light
Things! (What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what)
Still, I am not bitter
Rather, I am an observer who saw first-hand how life may not always be fair
Would things have worked out differently between me and her
Had I moved up the corporate ladder quicker?
Been born of more noble stock?
Or had done better on one of our journeys to Las Vegas?
Perhaps
In fact, I'm certain of it
Things would've turned out differently between me and her
I know this now
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
It ain't done with smoke and mirrors (What, what, what, what)
What, what, what, what
