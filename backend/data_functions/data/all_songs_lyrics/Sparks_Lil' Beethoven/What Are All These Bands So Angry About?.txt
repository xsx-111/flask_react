What Are All These Bands So Angry About? LyricsHey everybody, what do you know
What are all these bands so angry about?
Hey everybody, what do you say
Someone's stolen our spotlight, Ray
Hey everybody, what do you say
What are all these bands so angry about?
Hey everybody, what do you know
Something's stolen our thunder, Joe
Hey everybody, what do you know
What are all these bands so angry about?
Hey everybody, what do you know
Something's stolen our thunder, Joe
Hey everybody, what do you know
What are all these bands so angry about?
What are all these bands so angry about?
What are all these bands so angry about?
Hey everybody, what can we do?
Crank it up just a notch or two?
Hey, everybody, what can we do?
What are all these bands so angry about?
Hey everybody, they called our bluff
Our profane ain't profane enough
Hey everybody, they called our bluff
What are all these bands so angry about?
So angry about, so angry about
So angry about, so angry about
So angry about, so angry about
So angry about, so angry about
Hey everybody what do you say
Someone's bounced us from center stage
Some might have done it, but not today
Beethoven, Coltrane, or Lady Day
Some might have done it, but not today
What with all these things besieging us now
Some might have done it, broken on through
Wagner, Tatum, or Howlin' Wolf
Some might have done what we'll never do
What are all these bands so angry about?
Hey everybody, what do you know
Something's stolen our thunder, Joe
Hey everybody, what do you know
What are all these bands so angry about?Embed
