Technical facility
Old-world sensibility
All of this I did for you
Still there is no sign of you
I practiced, I practiced
Carnegie Hall was beckoning
I practiced, I practiced
Carnegie Hall was beckoning
I was ready, I was ready
Carnegie Hall was beckoning
Still there is no sign of you
Still there is no sign of you

Practice on the Steinway

Practice on the Steinway
Practice, practice
They loved it, they showed it
The audience was deafening
I was ready, I was ready
The critics all said "riveting"
On the Steinway, on the Steinway
I guess it doesn't mean a thing
