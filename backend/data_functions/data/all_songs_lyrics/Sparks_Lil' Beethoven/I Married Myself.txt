I Married Myself LyricsI married myself
I'm very happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy, happy
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy, happy
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Long, long walks on the beach
Lovely times
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Candlelight dinners home
Lovely times
This time it's gonna last
This time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy, happy
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy together, happy together
Happy, happy
This time it's gonna last
This time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
This time it's gonna last
This time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
This time it's gonna last
This time it's gonna last
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Long, long walks on the beach
Lovely times
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Candlelight dinners home
Lovely times
This time it's gonna last
This time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
Hey baby, how you doin'?
You're fine, so fine
Hey baby, how you doin'?
You're fine, so fine
Long, long walks on the beach
Lovely times
Candlelight dinners home
Lovely times
Long, long walks on the beach
Lovely times
Candlelight dinners home
Lovely times
This time it's gonna last
This time it's gonna last
Forever, forever, forever
I married myself
I'm very happy together
Long, long walks on the beach
Lovely timesEmbed
