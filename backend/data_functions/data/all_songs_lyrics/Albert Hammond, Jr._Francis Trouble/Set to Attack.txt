Set to Attack Lyrics
I was so quiet
But you were excited
Waiting for romance
Someone come talk to me
Lonely out on this tree
There is a need to feel safe
How do we get to this place?
With eyes on my back, I'm set to attack
I've come to take your hand

Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do with you

I was so quiet
But you were excited
Waiting for the dance
They all just waltzed in
A second behind me
I stood there like some dumb kid
The music played and the boys would take you
Far from where I was
I was still hoping that you were the victory
To what I felt like love
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on

Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do with you

Hold on
Hold on
Hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on4Embed
