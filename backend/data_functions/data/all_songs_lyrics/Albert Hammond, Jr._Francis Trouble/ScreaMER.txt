ScreaMER Lyrics
Help me understand
There doesn't seem to be a plan
Here in motion
Grab the treasure from the streets
We got buried in the deep
Atlantic ocean

I saw you as someone I wanted to trust
I saw you as everyone I wanted to fuck
Oh baby I want
I don't know what's good for me
But can't you tell
I'm living proof of exile in hell
Upside down
Insides out

I heard the talkers talk
When they talk their talk
In mute frustrations
Truth was on the leaves
Falling from the trees
As demonstration
I saw you as someone I wanted to trust
I saw you as everyone I wanted to fuck
Oh baby I want
I don't know what's good for me
But can't you tell
I'm living proof of exile in hell
Upside down
My inside's outEmbed
