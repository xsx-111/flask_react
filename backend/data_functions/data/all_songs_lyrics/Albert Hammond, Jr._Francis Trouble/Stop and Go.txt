Stop and Go Lyrics
Stop and go

Do I have a share in this?
It's as if I don't exist
I look up to see the stars upon my face

I don't know the songs you like
Or the space to make it right
It is life in slo-mo
Stop and go

I've been lying in this room
Summer breeze will take me soon
It's been time since Madeline let me forget

Your ignorant life
Cuts like a knife
While tending two shops you adore
There's nothing inside
Get dressed for the ride
A romance, a joke, and a war
Look how easy we got fooled
How cheap they bought and sold us fools
Wish we could have become friends
Without smoking their cigarettes
The stars collide
And formed you and I
We made a plan but had no time
Most of the girls made up their minds
Somehow the boys knew they just had to wait in line

I've been lying in this room
Summer breeze will take me soon
It's been time since Madeleine let me forget

Your ignorant life
Cuts like a knife
While tending to shops you adore
There's nothing inside
Get dressed for the ride
But romance, a joke, and a war
Look how easy we got fooled
How cheap they bought and sold us fools
Wish we could have become friends
With cops smoking their cigarettes

Your ignorant life
Cuts like a knife
While tending to shops you adore
There's nothing inside
Get dressed for the ride
But romance, a joke, and a war
The stars
Collide
The stars, collide
They're for you and IEmbed
