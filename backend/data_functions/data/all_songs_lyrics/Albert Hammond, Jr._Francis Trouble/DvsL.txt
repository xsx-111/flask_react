DvsL Lyrics
Well come around, I'm with a friend
(I don't even wanna say)
Got some time, I can't explain
(I don't even wanna say)
Well what's your advice?
(I don't even wanna say)

You take me everywhere
We want to go
Rome was built to self-destruct
People and their homes

Brother got your lip
Mother make you sick
Your father is a prick

There's some families that you'll meet
(I don't even wanna say)
That get lost giving head
(I don't even wanna say)
I've been found in neighbor's beds
(I don't even wanna say
I don't even wanna say)
You take me everywhere
We want to go
Rome was built to self-destruct
People and their homes

It's a truth, it's a truth
That we stay up all night
Well carry on, carry on
Carry on with the fight
But I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where to go
Anymore
Carry on, carry on
Carry on with the fight
Here we go, here we go, here we go


Oh can't you see between the lines?
What ya, stuck up all night?
Remind me what she said
I don't remember
You best be on your tippy-toes
Cause this ain't jazz
You take me everywhere
We want to go
Rome was built to self-destruct
People and their homesEmbed
