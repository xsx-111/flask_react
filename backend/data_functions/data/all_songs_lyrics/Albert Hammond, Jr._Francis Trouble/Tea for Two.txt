Tea for Two Lyrics
Say no more, I was yours
When your silence came over me
Head to toe, dangers own
You're afraid to throw away the key

Tell all your friends
Cover your losses on my expense
Tell all your friends
While we burn at both ends

Brief collisions in the passing lane
Your turning signals light me up but nothing's changed
Red tape, silver lines
Tough breaks, working overtime
Is there something that you're looking for?
It's hard to tell when your ear's against the door
Nice shot, old flame
Can't stop, but nothing lasts forever

Say it matters
If it ain't from the heart then it ain't for me
Say it matters
Your secret is safe when you're close to me
Say it matters
I know that I'm touched but you're out of reach
Tell all your friends
While we burn at both ends
Brief collisions in the passing lane
Your turning signals light me up but nothing's changed
Red tape, silver lines
Tough breaks, working overtime
Is there something that you're looking for?
It's hard to tell when your ear's against the door
Red dots, white wine
Safe sex, fighting all the time


Brief collisions in the passing lane (Say it matters)
Your turning signals light me up but nothing's changed (Say it matters)
Red tape, silver lines (Say it matters)
Tough breaks, working overtime (Say it matters)
Is there something that you're looking for? (Say it matters)
It's hard to tell when your ear's against the door (Say it matters)
Nice shot, old flame (Say it matters)
Can't stop, but nothing lasts forever3Embed
