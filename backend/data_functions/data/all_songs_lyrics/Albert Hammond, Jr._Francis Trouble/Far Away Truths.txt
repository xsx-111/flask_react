Far Away Truths Lyrics
Something ‘bout the rules you attract
Don’t tell me that you made it up
We can always screw with the facts
Don’t tell me that I’ve seen enough
Cause if I saw nothing why would I look twice?

Ain't about the dress that you own
Its just something came undone
Everything you hide between the lines
Is just another give-away

You’re always the last one to know
We’re finally close when you first walk away
There’s something about how you go
That makes me feel everything you wanna say
Whether we’re fucking around
Or just feeling it out

With every role that you play
The revolution televised
There’s a time and a place
Don’t tell me that its paradise
Everything you hide between the lines
Is just another give-away
We can always leave this town
Or stay to watch it all fall down
Just between you and I
Its just a moment along the way

You’re always the last one to know
We’re finally close when you first walk away
There’s something about how you go
That makes me feel everything you wanna say
You’re always the last one to know
We’re finally close when you first walk away
There’s something about how you go
That makes me feel everything you wanna say
Whether we’re fucking around
Or just feeling it out
Its just a moment, its just a moment, its just a moment away

We can always screw with the facts
Tell them that we made it up
When all the words were taken back
It doesn’t mean you’ve given up
Cause if I saw nothing why would I look twice?
But between you and I
Its just a moment along the way
You’re always the last one to know
We’re finally close when you first walk away
There’s something about how you go
That makes me feel everything you wanna say
Whether we’re fucking around
Or just feeling it out
Its just a moment, yeah, its just a moment away2Embed
