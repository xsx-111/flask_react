Harder, Harder, Harder Lyrics
Harder, harder, harder, harder
Or so they say
Harder, harder, harder, harder
In your way

When I was younger I was in need of advice
I watched you learn to live as I just rolled the dice
Never trying hard enough with such fear in failure
What's funny is that I was worried about all the wrong things

You and I
In time our minds evolved
And everywhere we said we'd hear new ideas
I recall
That time in Central Park we heard the sound
There's some new ground for new ideas

Faster, faster, faster, faster
Though time moves on
Faster, faster, faster, faster
It won't be long
I've been thinking to myself the reasons that I try
I've been thinking to myself about the modern lie
Not easy to explain when you're stuck in line
Not easy to explain what's on your mind

You and I
In time our minds evolved
And everywhere we said we'd hear new ideas
I recall
That time in Central Park we heard the sound
There's some new ground for new ideas
I recall
That time in Central Park we heard the sound
There's some new ground for new ideas
You and I
In time our minds evolved
And everywhere we said we'd hear new ideas
New ideas!
Yeah!
C'mon!
Well, change yourself!
Pretty good!
