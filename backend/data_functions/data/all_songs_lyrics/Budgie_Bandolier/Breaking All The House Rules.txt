Breaking All The House Rules LyricsI've been running from a dark horse, I can't lose it
I've been calling to an old force, don't excuse it
Now I'm in the back and I'm all right
Got a mean kinda woman she's outta sight
Well I don't mind now sit me with the old fool
Out the back door, break the house rules
I go looking for my ego, don't explain it
Don't want never never leave girl, just sustain it
Well I've got a home and it's all right
With a mean kinda woman she's outta sight
Well I don't know about ripping up the old school
No no more breaking all the house rules
I got things I wanna do girl,don't refuse me
I don't wanna be a bad boy, you don't rule me
Well you knowing me well that's all right
When a guy's gotta live and he's outta sight
I just wanna leave everything paid for
Feeling good that it's our thing girl
It's obscene
Well here we go
I got things I wanna do girl,don't refuse me
I don't wanna be a bad boy, you don't just rule me
Well I'm neat neat well that's alright
With a kind kinda woman she's outta sight
I just wanna beat everything you throw me
You don't think that that's obscene?
Yes it isEmbed
