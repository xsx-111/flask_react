Slipaway LyricsI, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, oh
Um hmm, uh hmm
In the morning
Light of day
Leaves are falling
Slipaway, slipaway with you
And the reason
That I told
Is the feeling of never getting old
Growing old with you
In the daytime
Feel like it's almost gone
And the evening gently lingers on
And the feeling warms my glow
Fading time
Taking time we know
In the morning
Light of day
Leaves are falling
Slipaway, slipaway with you
Ooooooooh, gently slipaway
Oooh ooh ooh, gently slipaway
Oh oh oh now, gently slipawayEmbed
