Who Do You Want For Your Love? LyricsOh well, I ain't got nothing
I got nothing to say to the right one
I don't need nothing
I got nothing to feel for the bright one
I ain't loving you dear, running away with no one
Who do you want for your love?
I got nothing taking my time, I’m a wild one, one
And if I’d ever tried another to stay, I’ll lie like a son
Yeah, I don't know when who can play
At the same way
Who do you want for
I ain't messin', burn your hand
Don't you ever turn your back on a friend
Slowly come girl, to my bed
Underrated, underfed, dead
I've been getting bad vibes living in the smoke
Try and tell you good friend but it sounds a joke
Giving up the good things changing all my ways
Meat is going bad girl, now I will be saved
Yeah, I wish I could be strong
Living with the good wins, that I wear them long
Ooh, now hear me calling out your name
Here’s a lesson, there's a game
Don't you fool it, do it friend
Keep your cool girl or you're dead
Hear me moving
Hear me moving
Hear me movingEmbed
