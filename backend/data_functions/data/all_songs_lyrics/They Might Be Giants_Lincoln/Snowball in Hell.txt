Snowball in Hell LyricsAvalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Avalanche or roadblock
A jailer trapped in his cell
Money's all broke
And food's going hungry
If it wasn't for disappointment
I wouldn't have any appointment
Side effect or drug trip
Don't tease me with all of your might
Side effect or drug trip
My panacea's in a xerox shop
Have a nice day
You want it when?
Have a nice day
Have a nice day

(I didn’t expect to find a salesman drinking coffee this late in the morning. How long you been here, Joe?
-Oh, I don’t know, I guess 30, 45 minutes maybe. Why do you ask?
-You must be making a lot of sales, piling up a good income
-Oh, uh, I’m doing all right. I could do better, but… Ohhh, I get it Paul. Back on that old ‘Time is Money’ kick, right?
-Not back on it, Joe, still on it.)
Avalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Avalanche or roadblock
A jailer trapped in his cell
Money I owe, money-iy-ay
Money I owe, money-iy-ay
Avalanche or roadblock
I was a snowball in hell
Yes, I was a snowball in hell
Yes, I was a snowball in hellEmbed
