Lie Still, Little Bottle Lyrics
Lie still, little bottle and shake my shaky hand
Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
I know I must investigate, I hope that I can sing along

"There's no time for metaphors," cried the little pill to me
He said, "Life is a placebo masquerading as a simile"
Well, I knew that pill was lying - too gregarious, too nice
But as he walked, I had to sing this twice

Lie still, little bottle - don't twist, it ain't twistin' time
With every move you make, you just disintegrate
My ever-troubled mind
Lie still, little bottle and shake my shaky hand
Black coffee's not enough for me, I need a better friend
One pill at the bottom is singing my favorite song
I know I must investigate, I hope that I can sing along

Lie still, little bottle
Lie still
Lie still, little bottle
Lie still
Lie still
Lie stillEmbed
