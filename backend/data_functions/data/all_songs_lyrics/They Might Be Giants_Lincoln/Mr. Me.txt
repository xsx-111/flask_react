Mr. Me LyricsOnce a boy named Mr. Me bemoaned a great regret
I've floundered in the misty sea
But can't abide its mystery
I wound up sad, you bet
So onward go and Edward Ho into the bounding main
Enjoy the show, look out below
But mind the misty sea
Or end up sad like Mr. Me
He ended up sad, he ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad, he ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
So take the hand of Mr. Me and mister, make him glad
To swim the Mr. Misty Sea
And cease the Mr. Mystery
That mister, made him sad
He ended up sad, he ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad, he ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad, he ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad
He ended up sad, he ended up sad
He ended up really, really, really sad1Embed
