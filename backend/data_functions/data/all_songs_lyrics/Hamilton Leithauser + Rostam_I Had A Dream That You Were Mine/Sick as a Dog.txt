Sick as a Dog Lyrics
Sing to me softly
Your words had lost me
Yeah, but your voice sounds nice
Sing to me slowly
Blow me some smoke
I don't mind it in my eyes

Oh, I've been running
I ran out of room
So I took my pocket change
And bought a chain for you
Your suitcase is empty
Your clothes are still out
At night I still wonder
Why we can't leave this town

Don't leave me now
(Don't leave me now)
Don't leave me now
(Don't leave me now)
Don't leave me now
(Don't leave me now)
Don't leave me now
Sing to me softly
Your words have lost me
Yeah, but your tune is right
Talk to me slowly
Blow me some smoke
It's something I always like

Oh, I'd keep humming
That strange hollow tune
Till I blew my pipes out
Left my throat in ruins
My heart is so empty
The bottom fell out
Tonight, I'm just begging you
Please don't shut me out

Don't shut me out
(Don't shut me out)
Don't shut me out
(Don't shut me out)
Don't shut me out
(Don't shut me out)
Don't shut me out
And so I sing that song
The one from way back
Right now, the hurt is gone
It doesn't sound so bad
Yeah, when I sing that song
It doesn't sound so bad
I use the same voice
I always had

I use the same voice
I always had
I use the same voice
I always had
I use the same voice
I always had1Embed
