The Morning Stars LyricsThe scotch bonnet shells
From your bedside drawer
I snatched them myself
Off the ocean floor
Are strung around your neck
On a white boot lace
You'd wear them like that
Back when we used to date

If the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?
If the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?
'Cause I'm the one
Who rattles all
Your windows
And your doors
Howling in the night
Beyond your walls
Beneath your floors
At dawn I retire
With my palms on the glass
I stroll through the arcade
With the happy rats
And my hat fell in the river
And a Portuguese girl swooned
"You're as a free as the water
But it's harder to love"

So if the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?
If the man that you need
Honestly wasn't me
Tell me, honey
Who could that be?
Oh, I'm the one
Who rattles all
Your windows
And your doors
Howling in the night
Beyond your walls
Beneath your floors
In other words... I'm your ghost
And we'll all run together
Underneath the morning stars
Won't you come out with us anymore?
Won't you come out with us anymore?
Why won't you come out with me anymore?
Why don't you come out with me anymore?Embed
