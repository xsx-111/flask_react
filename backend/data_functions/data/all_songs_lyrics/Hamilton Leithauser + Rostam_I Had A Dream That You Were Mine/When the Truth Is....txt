When the Truth Is... Lyrics
I was drowning out the night with the last of the wine
And my story began to unwind
So I gathered all the shards of a glass from the bar
And I left from 17th Street for St. Marks

Won't you listen to me now?
I was trying all the time
Maybe half the time I got you right
But not tonight

Oh I'll always be lonely
And you’ll never hear the truth
Yeah the truth is there's some distance, but you're listening
And I keep talking my way back into your heart

Your mama told you I'd long gave up, baby but
Your mama lied
Half the time I must've got it right
But not tonight

Oh I'll always be lonely
And you’ll never hear the truth
Yeah I'll always be lonely
And you'll never hear the truth
In the graveyards, in the harbors, in the beer halls and the parks
I'll be wandering under unfamiliar stars
But the spirits in my heart don't persuade me anymore
Than my echoes off the brick and mortar walls
And the truth is there's some distance, but you're listening
And the truth is there's some distance, but you're listening2Embed
