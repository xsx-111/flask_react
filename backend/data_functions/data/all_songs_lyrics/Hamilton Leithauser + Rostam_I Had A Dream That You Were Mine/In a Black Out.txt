In a Black Out Lyrics
I live in a nameless town
No need to wander around
I live in a nameless town
In a black out

Many friends have said goodbye
Paraded out in one proud line
I say they all just lost their minds

Midnight where we used to dance
Underneath the ugly halogen lamps
Oh, it all went away so fast
In a black out

Weâ€™ll wait for the year
When the tide comes
Rolling over the rails
From here till the end
Of the island
Washing away

I rent a room with all our stuff
When you come home I'd lift you up
And there's only the two of us
In a black out
Now you're sleeping in the back
Of a speeding yellow cab
Throw a kiss goodbye to all of that8Embed
