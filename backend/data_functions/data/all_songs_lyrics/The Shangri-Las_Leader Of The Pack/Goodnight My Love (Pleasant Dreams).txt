Goodnight My Love (Pleasant Dreams) LyricsBefore we go
Please we remember we love you so
And this love that we have for you
Will never grow cold
Goodnight, my love
(spoken)
Pleasant dreams
Hope you all sleep tight
It's been a real ball working with you, and I hope we get to see one another real soon
But before we go, I want you all to remember this little messageEmbed
