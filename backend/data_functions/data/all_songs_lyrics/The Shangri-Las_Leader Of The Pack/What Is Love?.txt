What Is Love? Lyrics
Please tell me, what is love?
(Oh, yes, won't you tell me what is love?)
What is love?
(Oh, yes, won't you tell me what is love?)
What is love?
(Oh, yes, won't you tell me what is love?)
What is love?

Love is a funny thing you can't explain (woah-oh)
It makes you happy but it brings a lot of pain
Who can tell me of this feeling I found
(Wo-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Whenever he's near me I feel my heart pound
(I feel my, feel my heart pound)
Oh, boy, oh, boy

Love is a funny thing, it helps you forget (woah-oh)
All of the troubles that you might have met
When you have dreams that are shattered and torn
(Wo-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
You will know he'll be there and glad dreams are born
(And you know that glad dreams are born)
Is this love?
So if your heart is broken and you long for his embrace (oh oh oh)
Just wait and he'll be there with love you can't replace
He'll hold you, and kiss you, and whisper, "You're mine"
(Wo-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
And then you'll be bright and happy for the rest of time
(For the rest, the rest of time)
Oh, gee

The rest of time, oh-oh, he'll be there
The rest of time, (rest)
Oh-oh (oh-oh-oh)
He'll be there the rest of time....Embed
