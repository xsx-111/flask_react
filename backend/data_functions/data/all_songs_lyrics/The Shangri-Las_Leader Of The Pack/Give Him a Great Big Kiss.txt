Give Him a Great Big Kiss Lyrics
When I say I'm in love, you best believe I'm love: L-U-V!

Here comes my guy
Walking down the street
Look how he walks
With a dancing beat (da-da-da-da-da)
Thick wavy hair (da-da-da-da-da)
A little too long
All day long he's a-singing his song

And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

Well, what color are his eyes?
I don't know, he's always wearing shades
Is he tall?
Well, I've got to look up
Yeah? Well I hear he's bad
Mm, he's good bad, but he's not evil
(sung)
Tell me more, tell me more
Big bulky sweaters (tell me more)
To match his eyes (tell me more)
Dirty finger nails (tell me more)
Oh boy, what a prize! (tell me more)
Tight tapered pants (He's so cool)
High button shoes (He's so cool)
He's always looking like (He's so cool)
He's got the blues (He's so cool)

And when I see him in the street
My heart takes a leap and skips a beat
Gonna walk right up to him
Give him a great big kiss! Mwah!
Tell him that I love him
Tell him that I care
Tell him that I'll always be there

Is he a good dancer?
What do you mean is he a good dancer?
Well, how does he dance?
Close... very, very close...1Embed
