Maybe Lyrics
Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
And maybe if I cry every day
You'll come back to stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)

Maybe if I hold your hand
You will understand
And maybe if I kiss your lips
I'll be at your command
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)

I prayed and prayed (doo-doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)
To the Lord (doo-doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)
To send you back (doo-doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)
My love (doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
But instead (doo-doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)
You came to me (doo-doo-doo-wop, doo-doo-doo-wop)
Only in my dreams

Maybe if I pray every night
You'll come back to me
Maybe if I cry everyday
You'll come back to stay
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)
Maybe
(Maybe, maybe, maybe)Embed
