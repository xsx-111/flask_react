Leader of the Pack Lyrics
Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is. Let's ask her
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mhm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Mnm
By the way, where'd you meet him?
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture?
Yes, we see
That's when I fell for the Leader of the Pack

My folks were always putting him down (Down, down)
They said he came from the wrong side of town
(What you mean when you say
That he came from the wrong side of town?)
They told me he was bad
But I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the Leader of the Pack

One day my Dad said, "Find someone new"
I had to tell my Jimmy, "We're through"
(What you mean when you say
That you better go find somebody new?)
He stood there and asked me why
But all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the Leader of the Pack
He sort of smiled and kissed me goodbye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow
Whether he heard, I'll never know
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Look out, look out, look out, look out!

I felt so helpless, what could I do?
Remembering all the things we've been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide my tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the Leader of the Pack

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
(Leader of the Pack, and now he's gone)
Gone, gone, gone, gone...2Embed
