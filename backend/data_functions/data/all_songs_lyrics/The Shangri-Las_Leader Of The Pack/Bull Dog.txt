Bull Dog LyricsI'm in love with the prettiest boy in the USA
(Hey, what'dya say? Hey, what'dya say?)
I'm in love with the prettiest boy in the USA
(What'dya say?)
I said, hey
But his momma bought a dog
Just to keep little me away
(Hey, what'dya say? Hey, what'dya say?)
You know he barks when he sees me
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
Growls every time I touch his hair
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
You know he barks when he sees me
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
Growls every time I touch his hair
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
And everytime I shoo him, he tries to bite a leg
But I don't care
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad dog)
(Shoo, shoo, hey, hey, hey hey)
You know his momma keeps that dog chained
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
Out on the porch all night
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
You know his momma keeps that dog chained
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
Out on the porch all night
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad bull dog)
You know he barks like a charm
But he don't bite
(Big bad bull dog, that big bad dog)
Un-hun (big bad bull dog)
Oh, yeah (that big bad bull dog)
Alright (that big bad bull dog)
OK (that big bad bull dog)
Alright (that big bad bull dog)
So fine (that big bad bull dog)
OK (that big bad bull dog)
Un-hun (that big bad bull dog)
Alright (that big bad bull dog)
Ooo-ooo (that big bad bull dog)Embed
