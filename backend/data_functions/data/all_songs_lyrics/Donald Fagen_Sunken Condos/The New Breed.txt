The New Breed LyricsTonight, I ran into that kid, who's been upgrading all your stuff
You're right, he really knows his shit, a real diamond in the rough
A funny little load clicks on, inside my head
So tell me, he doesn't seem your type, but is there something I should know?
Don't lie, are you trying to hide that special glow?
Back then, I know one thing you liked, was my flatline attitude
You'd think, you'd never fall for this, some total "as if" type of dude
Funny little load clicks on...
You're the New Breed alright
I guess what you're what she wants now
You're young and strong, and you're older now
Good luck to you both, I'll get along somehow
I get it, you look at me and think, he's ready for Jurassic Park
He's sweet, but it's time to find a keener spark
I guess, I'll make my exit now
Before you twist the knife
It's best, if I just leave you here
To your new dot com slash life
Funny little load clicks on...
You're the New Breed alright
I guess what you're what she wants now
You're young and strong, and you're older now
Good luck to you both, I'll get along somehowEmbed
