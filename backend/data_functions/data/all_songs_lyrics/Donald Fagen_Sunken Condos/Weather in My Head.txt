Weather in My Head LyricsThe air is boiling - sun on my back
Inside I'm frozen girl - I'm about to crack
They may fix
The weather in the world
Just like Mr. Gore said
But tell me what's to be done
Lord - 'bout the weather in my head
Girl when you hurt me - when you told
Those lies
It's like a typhoon exploded behind my eyes
They may fix the weather in the world
Just like Mr. Gore said
But tell me what's to be done
Lord - 'bout the weather in my head
Here comes my own Katrina - the levee
Comes apart
There's an ocean of misery floodin' my heart
They may fix the weather in the world
Just like Mr. Gore said
But tell me what's to be done
Lord - 'bout the weather in my head
Seaquake by morning
Says QUAKE-TV
Rogue wave comes high
And it breaks all over me
They may fix the weather in the world
Just like Mr. Gore said
But tell me what's to be done
Lord - 'bout the weather in my head
Four old hippies drivin' in the rain
I asked for a lift - they said:
Get used to the pain
They gonna fix the weather in the world
Just like Mr. Gore said
But tell me what's to be done
Lord - 'bout the weather in my headEmbed
