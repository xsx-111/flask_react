Slinky Thing LyricsIt was an October morning
Near the carousel
I met a light young beauty
And we talked there for a spell
We walked up by the green lawn
And my heart began to sing
Mad man on a bench screams out
“Hold on to that slinky thing
Hold on to that slinky thing.”
Went to a party
Everybody stood around
Thinking, “Hey, what’s she doing
With a burned out hippie clown?”
Young dudes were grinning
I can’t say it didn’t sting
Some punk said, “Pops, you better
Hold on to that slinky thing
Hold on to that slinky thing.”
More light, more light, more light, more light, more light, more light
More light, more light, more light, more light, more light, more light
Today we were strolling
By the reptile cage
I’m thinking, “Does she need somebody
Who’s closer to her own age?”
Try not to worry
What tomorrow may bring
I’m just going to do my best to
Hold on to that slinky thing
Hold on to that slinky thing
More light, more light, more light, more light, more light, more light
More light, more light, more light, more light, more light, more light
Today we were strolling
By the reptile cage
I’m thinking, “Does she need somebody
Who’s closer to her own age?”
Try not to worry
What tomorrow may bring
I’m just going to do my best to
Hold on to that slinky thing

(Repeat and fade)
She smiled
There’s a sun in my sky
She laughed
That’s my power supply
She stayed with me
I know heaven is right here on earthEmbed
