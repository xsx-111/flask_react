Memorabilia LyricsHave you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
Have you met that lovely creature
The exceptional Ivy King
She knows just what she's after
She's got a jones for the real thing
For that vintage atomic trash
For the alien breeze
The bright white flash
From the island East of the Carolines
Lovely island
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
In a room right off the kitchen
There's an old gas centrifuge
Color film of Castle Bravo
Girl you know that shot was huge
There's a crateful of lead-lined pipes
A photo of laughing Navy types
On the island East of the carolines
Lovely island
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
There was an island
East of the Caroline
Lovely island
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroom
Have you seen the memorabilia
The rusty old memorabilia
The souvenirs of perfect doom
In the back of Louis Dakine's backroomEmbed
