Good Stuff LyricsI walked into Lindey's, tired and tight
Me and my Julie, been a' fighting all night
Bankroll don't like it when I come in late
We got a big beef with a small concern we must liquidate
We cab down to the St. Mark for a lookie-lou
They'ra all loungin' in the lobby, and we do what we come to do
Lotsy goes down easy, Moe takes it in the face
Weinburg brothers, run for cover, squirting metal all over the place
There's a special satisfaction
When a job comes off so right
Better break out the good stuff
The boss wants to party all night
My Julie's in the chorus, on Mr. Ziegfield's stage
My little canary, in a golden cage
I'm goofy on the girlie, but she runs hot and cold
It's a relief to get marching orders, and do just what I'm told
Tonight we 'jack the convoy, 200 barrel run
Trucked in from a brewery in East Patterson
Rolled in around midnight, delivered to the Speaks
All that bubble, no trouble, whole crew gets to dip their beaks
There's a special satisfaction
When a job comes off so right
Better break out the good stuff
The boss wants to party all night
It's just about dawn, when I finally get home
I find my twist with that punk, Johnny Rome
So I popped the both, and I ankled downtown
To a hop-house in the Tenderloin, need to kick that gong around
There's a special satisfaction
When a job comes off so right
Better break out the good stuff
The boss wants to party all nightEmbed
