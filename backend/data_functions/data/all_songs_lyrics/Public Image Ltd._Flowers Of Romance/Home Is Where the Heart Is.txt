Home Is Where the Heart Is LyricsHome
I got the oven repaired
This was security in luxury
Home is where the heart is
The daily paper and the carpet
My body burns
My body needs to follow suit
Blind lead the blind
From Russia with love
I look good in dust
Shadow in the back of the hall
The images of everyone
Isn’t nature such a wonderful thing
Spreading all over the world
By geography
I’m not a stranger
My fingers burn
My body burns
I’m practising
I’m separating
I look good in dust
My body burns
My body needs to follow suit
Blind lead the blind
From Russia with love
I look good in dust
I look good in dust
Spreading all over the world
I got the oven repaired
This was security in luxury
Home is where the heart is
The daily paper and the carpet
My body burns
Shadow in the back of the hall
The images of everyone
Isn’t nature such a wonderful thing
Spreading all over the world
By geography
I’m not a stranger
My fingers burn
My body burns
I’m practising
I’m separating
I’ve had enoughEmbed
