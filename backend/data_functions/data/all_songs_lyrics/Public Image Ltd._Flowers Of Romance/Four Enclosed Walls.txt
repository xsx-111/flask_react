Four Enclosed Walls LyricsAllah
Allah
Doom sits in gloom in his room
Destroy the infidel
In a mosque
In a ghost
Is a sword
Is a Saracen
Allah
Joan of Arc was a sorcerer
The trilogy, the desert sand
Scriptures in the tower of Babel
Allah
Only ending is easy
Burn, burn, burn
In the tower
Only ending is easy
Allah
Arise in the East
The trilogy
Allah
Allah
I take heed
Arise in the West
A new crusadeEmbed
