Another LyricsSomeone made the story up
I tell the truth
It wasn’t me
Let me in
I won't be long
Open doors
Feel the draft
Someone made the story up the next day
Being here
Is not enough
Another
Another
Another
I tell the truth
It wasn’t me
Follow the leader
I can’t be patient
I am a shadow
Coming
Another
Another
Another
Another
Another
Another
Another
Another
Another
It don’t ????
????????
????????
Real as a statue
????????
Easy
Another
Being here
Is not enough
Being here
Is not enough
Let me in
Another
Another
