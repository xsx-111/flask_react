Banging the Door LyricsHello
What do you want?
You're irritating, go away, It's not my fault
That you're lonely
Just look around
I think you'll find that everyone has the same problem
This is not a real home
The walls are so thin, the neighbours listen in, keep the noise down
They're complaining
Humiliated
You were born and bred
Humble, to the spoon-fed
Why worry now? You're not dead yet
You've got a whole lifetime to correct it
You're wasting
Admiring, hating, this lot are not happy heroes
Just better actors
A-hundred-and-one dilations
And fifty-seven varieties
Outside with the empties
Keep banging the door
Keep banging the door
Keep banging the door
I won't answer the phone
I won't answer the door
Reptilians
I won't let you in
If he knew we were here I'm sure he'd let us in
I won't let you in
(Alright, stop Nick)
This is not a real home
The walls are so thin
The neighbours listen in
Keep the noise down
They're complaining
I won't let you in
If he knew we were here
I'm sure he'd let us in
I won't let you in, I won't let you in, I won't let you in
Won't let you in
If he knew we were here I'm sure he'd let us in
I won't let you in
If he knew we were here I'm sure he'd let us in
Keep banging the door, keep banging the door, keep banging the door, keep banging the door
I won't answer the phone, I won't answer the door
Keep banging the doorEmbed
