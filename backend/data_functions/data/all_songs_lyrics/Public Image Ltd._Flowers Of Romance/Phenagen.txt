Phenagen LyricsDown in the dark
Tell us a story
From the room below
You are an ostrich
Bury your head
Personal Auschwitz
Fermenting in bed
Empty promises help to forget
No more, no more
Repair the damages you made
Amen, amen, amen, amen
Empty promises help to forget
No more, no more
Amen, amen, amenEmbed
