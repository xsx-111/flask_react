Breaking Down Lyrics
All alone
It was always there, you see
And even on my own
It was always standing next to me

I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?

Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down

All alone
Even when I was a child
I've always known
There was something to be frightened of

I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down

All alone
On the edge of sleep
My old familiar friend
Comes and lies down next to me

And I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Smiling in the streetlight
Even with my eyes shut tight
I still see him coming now

Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down5Embed
