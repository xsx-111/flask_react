Down to the Sea LyricsCarry me down to the sea
Carry me down where they're waiting for me
That's where I want to be, that's where it all comes around
Watching the ships pass by me
Friendships and small ships and hardships and dreams
That's where I want to be, here where it all comes around
Oh, my head is in the sand
All my life passin' by
All of my days I have seen
All of the tears and the laughter and dreams
Movin' before me, waves and the ocean and sea
Life is a big tambourine
The more that you shake it the better it seems
This is my wisdom, these are just words from the sea
Oh my head is in the sand
All my days passin' by
When I get older, settling down
Would you come down to the sea
Carry me down to the sea again
Carry me down to the sea againEmbed
