Great Spirit (Acoustic Mix) LyricsWho has chased away the moonbeams?
Who has pulled a blanket across the sky?
Who will sing in celebration
Throughout this land that's bound to die?
Oh, Great Spirit come
Great Spirit come
Oh, who will put an end to all this sadness?
Who will hear the earth that cries beneath the burning rain?
All truth reduced to piles of greed and madness, ah
The accident remains the same
Oh, Great Spirit come
Oh, Great Spirit come, yeah
Mmm, said it's alright, seems okay
Robbery and evil and the stealing
From the body and the mind for the healing
Of the spirit and the pride and the will and the will of the land
(Grace, courage, honesty and love)
(Grace, courage, honesty and love)
There's evil, there's evil, there's evil going on
(Great Spirit come)
(Great Spirit come)
I love my brother, I must share the seed
That falls through fortune at my feet
The fate of nations and of all their deeds
Lies trapped inside these hearts of greed
Ooh, oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Great Spirit come) Great Spirit come
(Great Spirit come) Come on, come on, come on
(Great Spirit come) Oh yeah
(Great Spirit come)
Ooh yeah. Ooh yeah
(Grace, courage, honesty and love)
(Grace, courage, honesty and love)
(Great Spirit come)
(Great Spirit come) Come on, come on, come on
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration
Ooh, we'll sing in celebration, celebration
Sing in celebration, now now now now
Sing in celebrationEmbed
