Network News LyricsGuns, death, and noise
Sand, oil, and blood
Frontiers drawn on paper
No consideration made for
The poor creature who is living
By the grace of God just giving
He's live on network news
Live on network news
Flags, princes, kings, patriotic fools
As freedom lies in twisted heaps
Whose final breath his soul to keep
Whose greatest foe, the endless sleep
Whose dying wish to reach next week
A bloody star on network news
A bloody star on network news
Oh yeah
Tanks, boats, and planes
Fire, pain, and lies
Environmental terrorists
Tease propaganda's paper fist
Whose trade is all the truth that fits
Who often lies but never sits
But on the fence, it's network news
Yes on the fence, it's network news
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, oil, oil
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, oil, oil
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
The lion and the serpent parade out in the sun
All order, flex, and gesture
All hail the techno infidel has come
With satellite bravado and infra-red texture
Beyond these days in time to come
Whose fate is it to measure
Upon these sands such damage done
To spoil God's finest treasure
Oh, beyond these days in time to come
Whose fate is it to measure
Upon these sands such damage done
To spoil God's finest treasure
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, oil, oil
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Beyond these days in time to come
Oh, whose fate is it to measure, ohh
Beyond these days in time to come
Who, oh, who is it to measure, oh
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Guns, death, and noise
Sand, oil, and blood
Guns, death, and noise
Sand, oil, and bloodEmbed
