Rollercoaster (Demo) LyricsSad and lonely, but I don't care
There's something wrong with my neighbour's hair
It can't be long when I'm the only one
It's sad and lonely, but I'm only having fun
It's just a rollercoaster in my heart
It's just a rollercoaster tearing me apart
Sad and lonely, but I just don't care
There's something wrong, but I can't understand
Every time that I look around
Every time I'm kinda running around
Gonna be the one
Gonna be the one for you
Gonna be the one
Gonna be the one for you
Love is love, then there's sin out there
I don't care why you wanna be fair
The only thing that I wanted to do
Is I wanna, wanna love with you
Said, it's in a rollercoaster in my heart
Oh, keep moving around and then you're tearing me apart
I've been lonely, but I don't know right away
Little bit lonely 'cause I'm down, but I don't wanna wait
Oh, rollercoaster in my heart
I'm gonna be the one
I'm gonna be the one for you
I'm gonna be the one
Gonna be the one that's true
Roll around, pushing about
Up and down, talking about it
Something that I can't understand
Got love, I'm a loving man
Just a rollercoaster in my heart
Oh, just a-moving me round and movin' me apart
When I start to think about it, it's over
Oh, could be there never was love
Mmm, stop and think it overEmbed
