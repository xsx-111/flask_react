Calling to You LyricsBeyond the river, over the sea
Somewhere past last farewell whatever will be
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
Out in the blue now, just waiting to feed
A little breath of selflessness adrift in all the greed
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
Long before the mountains cry for Adam and Eve, oh
All the world we knew was fire and still was the seed
Ah, just the seed... oh, you can hear it now
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
Where you gonna go? When you gonna stop?
Who stole the keys to the gates of the castle of love?
Ooh, yeah, mmm
What's goin' down now, what's goin' on, what's goin' down
Ooh yes ohh yes, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
Who you gonna call? What you gonna say?
Standin' in the shadows as the world's just fadin' away
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
Who you gonna call? What you gonna stop?
Who stole the keys to the gates of the castle of love?
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
It's callin' to you, callin' to you, callin' to you
Who you gonna call? What you wanna say?
Standin' in the shadows as the world's just fadin' away
Oh, just fadin' away
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh, yeah
Just fadin' away, just fadin' away
Just fadin' away, just fadin' away
Ooh yeah... ohh Jimmy!Embed
