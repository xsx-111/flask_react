8:05 Lyrics8:05, I guess you're leaving soon
I can't go on without you, it's useless to try
Oh to love you was so good
To keep you, would be so wonderful
Here is my heart that I give
It's all that I have
Please change your mind
Before my sunshine is gone
Do you think you could try?
Do you think you could try?
Do you think you could try?
Oh, understand how I feel
Until I can prove that it's real
Fill my world with rain
You know your tears would only bring rain in my heart
8:05, I guess your leaving
Good-byeEmbed
