Memory Song (Hello Hello) LyricsOn my mind, all my talk
From the lips of so many memories
Sun breaks the cool
Are you lost without a clue?
Stars still shine, winds will howl
All my friends sense you now now
Strange, so very strange
Ooh, yeah, on my mind, all my talk
From the lips of so many memories
Sun breaks the cool
Are you lost without the clue?
Remain divided, we had our day
The hell provided the sad display
Hello, hello, hello, I saw you once before
In my dreams, you've come to call
You are my friend, you are my friend
You touch my soul, ooh, ooh
You touch my soul, whoo
Hello, hello, hello
Ooh, hello, hello, hello
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
So strange, so very strange, now
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Oh-ho-hoo, come on, ooh yeah
Mmm, ooh yeah, eh
You are my friend, you are my friend
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-oohEmbed
