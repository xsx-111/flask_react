Promised Land LyricsOh baby, can't eat, can't sleep
Can't understand a love song
Drive me crazy 'cause my feet won't quit
As I go slidin' in the sweet zone
Round round like you want me to do
Down down like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep
I can't kiss you enough when I go to sleep
Oh baby, got those personal moves
So deep inside my move groove
I go crazy, my head won't quit
As I crawl inside your love groove
Down down like you want me to do
Round round like you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and it's much too steep
I can't kiss you enough when I go to sleep
I feel alright, 'cause my little girl wants to dance all night
What can I do? I know my little girl wants to dance with you
Oh darlin', come on baby, come on and mess with me
Oh woman, I'll make it up to you, if you just drive me wild, child
Down down like you want me to do
Round round, you're daring me to
The floor's small and the wall's too steep
I can't kiss you enough when I go to sleep
I feel alright because my little girl wants to dance all night
Oh what can I do? I know my little girl, she wants to dance with you
I feel alright, my little girl wants to dance all night
Oh what can I do? ooh ooh
I know that girl, she wants to dance, dance, dance
Round round like you want me to do
Down down you're beggin' me to
The floor's small and much too steep
I can't kiss you enough as I go to sleep
I feel alright 'cause my little girl she wants to dance all night
All of my life, you know my little girl she wants to dance, dance, dance
I feel alright, oh my little girl she wants to dance all night now
What can I do? Oh my little girl wants to dance
Come on dance with me baby
Come on dance with me baby
Oh, well... ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I gotta keep movin'
I gotta keep movin
Blues fallin' down like hail...Embed
