Dark Moon (Acoustic) LyricsI love the feel of his money
One time I loved the feel of him
It was not until he was crucified
That the benefits began
Oh it's a dark moon
Oh it's a dark moon
For restoration I may ??
I have my standards to maintain
The angle I come from is quite absurd
The aggravation leaves a stain
In this dark moon
In this dark moon
If I had the possession that I thought that I should
I would never cease to amaze
From the angle that she stands and stirred
She always smells so afraid
In this dark moon
Oh this dark moon
In this dark moon
Under this dark moon
Ohhh this dark moon
Rainer, play it
'Cause
Watch your soul, watch your soul, watch your soul
Watch your soul, watch your soul, watch your soul
Watch your soul for myselfEmbed
