Colours of a Shade LyricsThe day was old, the light was dim
As I stepped through the door
And all my friends were gathering
That day that I recall
I shivered and shook, Lord, I stood
Just waiting to chase the fall
I wondered how my time would be
When spring comes round once more
I face the wind, I have no choice
But you must guard the hearth
And cast adrift from those I love
Alone, I drag my heart
Against the cry of why
I turn my back to go
But out beyond the tears somewhere
Someone I need to know
It's only love in the colours of the shade
It's only love in the colours of the shade
Ah in shade, it's only love
Old photographs were fading dim
My seed will tell it all
Oh by the Fathers' Fathers have such pain
And all was robbed
They read the signs without surprise
Of how they knew it well
And in the mirror still I see
The man who came from hell
It's only love and the colours of the shade
It's only love in the colours of the shade
It's only love in the colours of the shade
They say, they say, they say
It's only love, it's only loveEmbed
