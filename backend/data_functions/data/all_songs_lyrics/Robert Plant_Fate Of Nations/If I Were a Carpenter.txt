If I Were a Carpenter LyricsIf I were a carpenter
And you were a Lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
If a tinker were my trade
Would you still find me?
Carryin' the pots I made
Followin' behind me?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness
Give me your tomorrow
If I worked my hands at wood
Oh would you still love me?
Answer me, babe, "Yes I would
I'd put you above me"
If a miller were my trade
At a mill wheel grinding
Would you miss your glory-box
Oh your soft shoes shining?
Save my love through loneliness
Save my love through sorrow
I give you my only-ness
Come give me your tomorrow
I give you my only-ness
Give me your tomorrow
If I were a carpenter
And you were a Lady
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway?
Would you have my baby?
Would you marry me anyway? Marry me?
Would you have my baby? Ah-ah-ahEmbed
