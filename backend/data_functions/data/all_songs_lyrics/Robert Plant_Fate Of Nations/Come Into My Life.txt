Come Into My Life LyricsHopes drift in higher places, it's easier above the gloom
Among the hollow of faces I know you're there, it must be soon
And I must straighten up, review my disposition
Pour the hope back in my eyes I thought I'd lost so long ago
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh
Always a love and beauty, a lover's sighs content too soon
Somewhere behind her heartbeat, a breath of kindness hints of gloom
So I must straighten up, review my disposition
Pour the hope back in my eyes I thought I'd lost so long ago
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh
When you get there, well you know
Oh, yeah, I wanna be there
Oh yeah, ah-you get there, well, you know
Oh yeah, I wanna be there, yeah
I wanna be there, I wanna be there
Take it on, take it on
Oh yeah, when you get there, well, you know
Oh-oh, I wanna be there
Oh, when you get there, well, you know
Oh, I wanna be there
I wanna be there, I wanna be there, oh
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away the gloom, oh
Come into my life, here where nothing matters
Come into my life and roll away, roll away
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
And roll away, roll away, roll away
Hopes drift in, higher places
It's easier-ah, above the ground you know
Hopes are drifting, hearts been lifting
Somebody somewhere no, done you wrong
I don't know, ah no no no no no
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, babyEmbed
