29 Palms LyricsA fool in love
A crazy situation
Her velvet glove
Knocks me down and down and down and down
Her kiss of fire
A loaded invitation
Inside her smile
She takes me down and down and down and down
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Her moves look good
A touch of desperation
From where I stood
She turned my head around, round and round
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It comes kinda hard
When I hear your voice on the radio
(When I hear your voice on the radio)
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you
Oh, oh, oh
29 Palms
I feel the heat of your desert heart
(Feel the heat of your desert heart)
Taking me back down the road that leads back to you
Oh, I'm burning in love
Oh, strange infatuation
Why a cold, cold touch
Mm, what must I do and do and do and do?
The heat and the dust
Increase my desolation
In God we trust
Always for you and you and you and you
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
It comes kinda hard
When I hear your voice on the radio
(When I hear your voice on the radio)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
Oh, oh, oh
29 Palms
I feel the heat of your desert heart
(Feel the heat of your desert heart)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
Baby, now it comes kinda hard
When I hear your voice on the radio
(When I hear your voice on the radio)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you
Oh, don't you hear me, baby, now?
29 Palms
I feel the heat of your desert heart
(Feel the heat of your desert heart)
Leading me back down the road that leads back to you, you, you, yeah, yeah
I'm comin' home
Uh-huh
Gonna get there, gonna get there
Don't ya know, baby?
It comes kinda hard
I said, when I hear your voice on the radio
Leading me back down, down the road
That leads back to, ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
