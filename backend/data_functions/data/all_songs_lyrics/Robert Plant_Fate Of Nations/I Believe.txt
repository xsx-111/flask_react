I Believe LyricsTears, tears at the water's edge
Hey little sister give us laughter instead
Tears for the teacher, from her eyes, from her soul
This restless spirit takes a long way back home
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper I hear you, so talk to me
Oh, I believe, I do, I
Say brother, sisters, see your brother's in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
There's only glory from the story untold
Oh I believe, I do, I
Say brother, sisters, see your brother's in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
There's so much glory from the story untold
Big fire on top of the hill
A worthless gesture and last farewell
Tears from your Mother, from the pits of her soul
Look at your Father, see his blood run cold
Like the wind, you are free
Just a whisper, I hear you, so talk to me
Oh talk to me, oh talk to me, oh talk to me
Oh, come on now, come on now
I believe, I do, I
Say brother, sisters, see your brother in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
There's so much glory from the story untold
I believe, I do, I
Say brother, sisters, see your brother in the sky
Neighbour, neighbour, don't be so cold
It's so much glory from the story untold
I believe, I believe, I believeEmbed
