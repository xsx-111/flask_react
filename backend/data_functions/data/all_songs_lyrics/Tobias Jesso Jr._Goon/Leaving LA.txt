Leaving LA Lyrics
I ask her the question, “How long do you have?”
And with no hesitation, she says, “One week and a half”

Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her

I wonder, will she make it wherever she may go?
She listens as I say to her, “You don’t have to be alone”

Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her
Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her
Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her
Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her
Move town, there’s nothing left around here without her
Move town, there’s nothing left around here without herEmbed
