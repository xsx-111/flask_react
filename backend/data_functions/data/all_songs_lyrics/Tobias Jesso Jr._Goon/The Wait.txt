The Wait Lyrics
Maybe you wanted more
But if I change
Could I ask you on a date?
We've never kissed before
So we might be strange
And I know it's getting late

But honey I'm tired
Tired of the wait

We're always having fun
Someway, somehow
And everything we can relate
So would you be the one?
Tell me now
Cause I won't leave it up to fate

But honey I'm tired
Tired of the wait1Embed
