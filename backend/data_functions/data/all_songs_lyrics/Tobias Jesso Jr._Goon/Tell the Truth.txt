Tell the Truth Lyrics
Why don’t you let me go?
I’d like to know
Why don’t you save the lies?
It’s no surprise

Why don’t you tell the truth sometime?
You know you should

Why don’t you stop this game
Of who’s to blame?
Why don’t you say goodbye?
It’s in your eyes


Don’t hesitate to tell me straight
Oh, I want you to


Would you tell the truth?
Tell the truth, tell the truth1Embed
