Without You Lyrics
Why can't you just love me?
Should I move on or should I wait?
How'd you get so high above me?
I reach higher every day
But nothing changes
No, it all just stays the same

I can hardly breathe without you
There is no future I want to see without you
I just don't know who I would be without you
There is nothing out there for me without you
Without you
Without you

I feel like I just hit the ground
Wish I could show you what it's like
But you will never come down
And I've been staying up at night
To face the changes
But they all just stay the same

I can hardly breathe without you
There is no future I want to see without you
I just don't know who I would be without you
There is nothing out there for me without you
Without you
Oh, what have you got to lose?
Oh, what have you got to lose?
Oh, what have you got to lose?

I can hardly breathe without you
There is no future I want to see without you
I just don't know who I would be without you
There is nothing out there for me without you
There is nothing out there, there is nothing out there
There is nothing out there without youEmbed
