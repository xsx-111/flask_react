Bad Words LyricsVerse 1]
Will we make it, make it through?
After all those things I said to you
You got me angry so I called you names
And I don’t know what I said and it’s all the same
I know I’ve gone and lost the game
Won’t you come on home?

Will you forgive me, forget the past?
Or will you let bad words be the last?
I’m broken, baby, just cry in shame
And I don’t know what you did but I’ll take the blame this way
I won’t ever talk that way again
If you come on home

Come on home
Please
Didn’t know what I had
Now it’s goneEmbed
