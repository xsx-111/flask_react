Crocodile Tears Lyrics
I wonder why, I got nothing to do
Well, I'm scratching my head, I'm behind on the news
Every time I think about you
I forget what I said, I'm telling the truth

My baby, she loves to see me cry
Boo hoo

The sun shines right into my room
I can't get back to sleep, I'm still hitting the snooze
Say goodbye, maybe start anew
There's nothing left to keep, there's nothing left to lose
