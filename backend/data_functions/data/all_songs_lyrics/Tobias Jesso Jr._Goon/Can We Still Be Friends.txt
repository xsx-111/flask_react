Can We Still Be Friends Lyrics
Well, don't you hate it when you mess up with a friend
From around the bend?
Thinking this could be the end
And you won't know what you got until it's gone
And it's been so long
That no one's right and no one's wrong

And have you ever given up in a fight
On a Friday night
Saying, "Who turned out the light?"
Well, don't you worry cause it happens all the time
Somewhere down the line
You'll be okay and he'll be fine

And then one night, he arrives to your surprise
Someone let him in and all you can say is
"I know it's not the same but I'm glad you came
Can we still be friends?"

And just be careful if forgiveness can be found
The second time around
There's not a thing to bring you down
And don't you listen to your head when you're alone
Just pick up the phone
And hope it ain't the busy tone
