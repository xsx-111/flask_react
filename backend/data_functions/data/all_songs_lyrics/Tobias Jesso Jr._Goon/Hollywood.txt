Hollywood Lyrics
I was looking forward to see where I was going
But I don't know if I can make it, no, I don't know if I could
Think I'm gonna try in Hollywood

Well, I had to find my way by looking at the city
I don't know if I can fake it if they tell me I'm no good
I think I'm gonna fry in Hollywood

Well, I'm a man, I was brought up right
I said my prayers every night since 1995
And I pray, God help me, I've done the best I could
But I think I'm gonna die in Hollywood
I think I'm gonna die in Hollywood

So I found the best advice: "Go and get a job"
But I don't know if I can take it cause I never understood
How everybody lies in Hollywood

And somewhere, I lost my mind; it's never coming back
And I don't know if I can make it and I don't know if I should
I think I'll say goodbye to Hollywood
Well, I'm a man, I was brought up right
I said my prayers every night since 1995
And I pray, God help me, I've done the best I could
But I think I'm gonna die in Hollywood
I think I'm gonna die in Hollywood

I think I'm gonna die in Hollywood
Think I'm gonna die in Hollywood4Embed
