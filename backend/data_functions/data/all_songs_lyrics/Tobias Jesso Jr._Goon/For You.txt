For You Lyrics
I would do anything for you
But you are the only thing good in my life
I would run if you asked me to
Run far away, how it could be so nice

Every time I see ya, I'm always smiling
Every time I see ya, you're always shining
There's nothing that I wouldn't do

I would say anything to you
But you would have a light to my deep dark insides
I would build us a home for two
And, if we needed more room, then there's more time


Every time I see ya, I'm always smiling
If you don't agree, well I'll just keepâ€”1Embed
