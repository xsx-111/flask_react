Go Limp LyricsOh Daughter, dear Daughter
Take warning from me
And don't you go marching
With the N-A-A-C-P
For they'll rock you and roll you
And shove you into bed
And if they steal your nuclear secret
You'll wish you were dead
(refrain:)
Singin too roo li, too roo li, too roo li ay
Singin too roo li, too roo li, too roo li ay
Oh Mother, dear Mother
No, I'm not afraid
For I'll go on that march
And I'll return a virgin maid
With a brick in my handbag
And a smile on my face
And barbed wire in my underwear
To shed off disgrace
(Refrain)
One day they were marching
A young man came by
With a beard on his cheek
And a gleam in his eye
And before she had time
To remember her brick...
They were holding a sit-down
On a nearby hay-rick
(Refrain)
For meeting is pleasure
And parting is pain
And if I have a great concert
Maybe I won't have to sing those folk songs again
Oh Mother, dear Mother
I'm stiff and I'm sore
From sleeping three nights
On a hard classroom floor
(Refrain)
One day at the briefing
She'd heard a man say
"Go perfectly limp
And be carried away."
So when this young man suggested
It was time she was kissed
She remembered her brief
And did not resist
(Refrain)
Oh Mother, dear Mother
No need for distress
For the young man has left me
His name and address
And if we win
Tho' a baby there be
He won't have to march
Like his da-da and meEmbed
