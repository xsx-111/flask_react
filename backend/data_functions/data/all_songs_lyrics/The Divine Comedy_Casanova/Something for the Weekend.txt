Something for the Weekend Lyrics
(Females tittering)
Hello
Ooh
(Females tittering)
I say
How about a little kiss?
(Females tittering)
Oh, don't be unkind
Wooooo
She said, "There's something in the woodshed"
And I can hear it breathing
It's such an eerie feeling, darling"
He said, "There's nothing in the woodshed
It's your imagination
End of the conversation, darling"
(Something in his heart)
Something in his heart
(Told him to come clean)
Told him to come clean
(Tell her he was not)
He was not who he claimed to be
(Something in his genes)
Something in his genes
(Told him to pretend)
Told him to pretend
(Something in his genes)
'Twas something for the weekend
(Females tittering)
Oh, come on
You know you want to
But she said, "There is something in the woodshed
I know because I saw it
I can't simply ignore it, darling"
So he said, "Now baby don't be stupid
Get this into your sweet head
There ain't nothing in the woodshed (except maybe some wood)"
(Something in his heart)
Something in his heart
(Told him to come clean)
Told him to come clean
(Tell her he was not)
He was not who he claimed to be
(Something in his jeans)
Something in his jeans
(Told him to pretend)
Told him to pretend
(Something in his jeans)
'Twas something for the weekend
"I'll go all the way with you
If you'll only do the same for me
Go and see
If it's nothing like you say
Then you can have your wicked way with meeeeeeeee"
Oh yeah yeah!
(Weekend)
(It's something for the weekend)
(It's something for the weekend)
(It's something for the weekend)
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
(It's something for the weekend) Something for the weekend
He went down to the woodshed
They came down hard on his head
Gagged and bound and left for dead
When he woke she was gone with his car and all of his moneyEmbed
