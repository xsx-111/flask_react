The Frog Princess Lyrics
I met a girl, she was a frog princess
I guess I ought to make it clear
That I saw nothing through her see-through dress
Until she whispered in my ear

"You don't really love me and I don't really mind
'Cause I don't love anybody
That stuff is just a waste of time
Your place or mine?"

I met a girl, she was a complete mess
I should've left her well aloneâ€”but oh no, not me!
I had to see if underneath that dress
Her heart was really made of stone

"You don't really love me and I don't really mind
'Cause I don't love anybody
That stuff is just a waste of time
Your place or mine?"

I met a girl, she was a frog princess
And yes I do regret it now
But how was I to know that just one kiss
Could turn my frog into a cow?
And now I'm rid of her I must confess
To thinking 'bout what might have been
And I can visualise my frog princess
Beneath a shining guillotine

You don't really love me and baby that is all right
'Cause I don't love anybody
I come and go through people's love lives
Oh, your place or mine?

Your place or mine?
Baby, oh baby, sweet baby
You don't really love me, and I don't really mind
'Cause I don't love anybody
That stuff is just a waste of time
You don't really love me
Well I do, yeah
Ooh woo hoo-hoo-hoo
Ooh hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hooEmbed
