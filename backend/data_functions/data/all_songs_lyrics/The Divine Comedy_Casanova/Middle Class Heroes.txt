Middle Class Heroes Lyrics
Hello, what have we here?
A young lady
To what do I owe this pleasant surprise, my pretty one?
How may I be of service this dark and wintry night?
Ahh, I see. You wish me to look into the future
Your future
After GCSEs, A-levels, university
After your first badly paid job in advertising
Okay, my pretty
Just cross my hand with plastic
And I'll see what we can do
Wait, the fog is lifting

I see Oriental paper globes
Hanging like decomposing cocoons
While exotic candles overload
The musty air with their stale perfumes
And I see lentils, beans, seaweed, and rice
In jars on the windowsill
And it ain't hardly enough to feed the mice
Running behind the lines of allergy pills

All these things will come to pass
When heroes of the middle class
Face up to their responsibilities
I see an Indian fertility god
He's got 37 limbs to spare
And tasteless tie-dyed tablecloths
That double up as evening wear
And I see naked bodies twist and turn
On the futon of dreams fulfilled
But their three year old kid seems unconcerned
He'd rather swallow all those allergy pills

All these things will come to pass
When heroes of the middle class
Face up to their responsibilities

I see
Unspeakable vulgarity
Institutionalized mediocrity
Infinity tragedy
Rise up, little souls
Join the doomed army
Fight the good fight
Wage the unwinnable war
Elegance against ignorance
Difference against indifference
Wit against shit
My words fly up to heaven
My thoughts remain below
Words said without feeling
Never to heaven go
Never to heaven go
Never to heaven go
Never to heaven go

All these things will come to pass
When heroes of the middle class
Face up, repent, and pay the price
For accidentally creating life
An oversight for which they must atone
And sacrifice their ownEmbed
