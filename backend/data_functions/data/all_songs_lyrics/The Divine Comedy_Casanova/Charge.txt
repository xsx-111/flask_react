Charge LyricsLadysmith wants you forthwith
To come to her relief
Burn your briefs, you leave for France tonight
Carefully cut the straps of the booby-traps
And set the captives free
But don't shoot till you see her big blue eyes
Then sound the charge—
Breathe your final breath
And charge into the valley of death
Cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang all night
We'll fight them on the beaches
Yes, we'll fill'm full of lead
Fighting naked in the open air
We'll fight them in the kitchen, in the bathroom
In the garden shed
Fighting the good fight any-fighting-where
So sound the charge—
Breathe your final breath
And charge into the valley of death
Cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang all night
There'll be a cannon to the left and cannon to the right
They'll go bang bang bang bang bang bang bang all night...
"Hey baby, I love it when you talk sense to me
Especially when you say 'live and let love'
I hear what you're saying...
I have in my hand a piece of paper
It says "Let's make love, not this phoney war-thang"
We going over the top -
You're so sexy when you're angry, honey-child"
"Roaming around in no man's land, I'm getting caught in your barbed wire
Baby baby, gonna set your village on fire..."
"Come into my parlour," said the spider to the fly
Come inside and make yourself at home
CHARGE—I'm gonna hit you where it hurts
CHARGE—So sound the red alert!
There'll be a cannon to the left...
...And a cannon to the right...
(The hills are alive with the sound of)
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG
All night!Embed
