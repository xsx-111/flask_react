In & Out of Paris & London LyricsIt is a far far better thing that I do now
Than I have ever done before
It is a far far better place that I go to
Than I have ever known before
My slap and tickle made her giggle
Made her wiggle like a willow tree
So suggestively
So I suggested
She protested
I persisted till she said
Well OK
And I said Wey-hey!
In or out
Of one thing there can be no doubt
Out or in
This is not a sin
It's not even original
And hey, we're all individuals
So let the games begin
I fall in love with someone new
Practically every day but that's OK
It's just the price I pay
For being a man (if that's really what I am)
And I refuse to take it all too seriously
It's such a strange activity
Far too peculiar to be taken any other way
Don't wait until tomorrow - do it today
In out in out in out in out in out in out in out
Shake it all aboutEmbed
