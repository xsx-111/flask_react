A Woman of the World Lyrics
When she was just a girl
She became a woman of the world
Soon there wasn't room enough for her
In between the bosoms of her family
She popped the cork
Got on the Greyhound to New York
Small-talked her way 'round just the sort
Of playboys' playgrounds she'd once dreamed about

Maybe I love her
But I'm jealous of her
She's a woman of the world

(She's a fake)
Sure, but she's a real fake
(On the make)
Making up for lost time
(Just you wait)
Give the girl a break
(And fifty dollar bill will
See to that)
That ain't enough to feed the cat
(Serve up the rats and super rats)
Well, they just get fatter
While she fades away
Maybe I love her
Cause I'm jealous of her
She's a woman of the world
Maybe I hate her
Cause I didn't create her
It's human nature, girl
Maybe I'll suffer
Just to be her lover
Just to be part of her world
Maybe I need her
Because I want to be her
Baby, can I be your girl
Maybe I'll kill her
Just trying to thrill her
If she don't kill me first

We're making eye contact
Oh those hypnotic eyes attract
Such philanthropic flies that's that
You cannot stop it so why the devil do you try?Embed
