Love Is Lighter Than Air LyricsSummer, summer, summer slowly turned into fall
Me and my baby doll never went to the beach
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere was a place we could run
On the sand with the sun always just out of reach
Somewhere sunny summer's marching to a different drummer, singing
"Summer, summer, summer's gonna turn into fall
You and your baby doll better go to the beach"
'Cos love is lighter than air
It floats away if you let go
Love is lighter than air
Rising through the falling snow
A crime, crime, crime, sin and illness is time
Neither reason nor rhyme can obstruct his bad dance
The nasty little swine slipped us mickeys in wine
Wove his hair into twine and then tied up our hands
We're forced to watch him wriggle
And endure his fulsome giggle
And his mime, mime, mime
Unforgivable mime -
Our one chance is to climb into blimps of romance...Embed
