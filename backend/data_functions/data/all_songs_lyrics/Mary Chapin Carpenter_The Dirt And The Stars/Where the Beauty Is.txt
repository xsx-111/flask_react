Where the Beauty Is Lyrics
The crooked line beneath the paint
From faraway it looks straight
Where practiced hands betray a shake
That's where the beauty is

The mark upon your skin revealed
Where injury and pain were sealed
But a scars the place where you were healed
That's where the beauty is

Walk with me and hold my hand
There's so much we don't understand

The shattered pieces of a bowl
Filled and fused with dust and gold
In brokenness we are whole
That's where the beauty is

Walk with me and hold my hand
There's so much we won't understand
All that's buried in your heart
The cold and lonely, hopeless part
Dig down deeper and find the spark
That's where the beauty isEmbed
