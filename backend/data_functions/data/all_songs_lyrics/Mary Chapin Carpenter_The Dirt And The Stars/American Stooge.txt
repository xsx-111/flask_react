American Stooge Lyrics
Oh, yeah-yeah

He was a small-town southern boy, born and bred
Credit to his hard-working mother and dad
Clutch of diplomas and a uniform
Served his country then he shipped back home
Hung out his shingle, but it didn't take
He had real big dreams that he could not shake
Left that town with his hand on his heart
Ready for his oath and his life to start

Ah, he just can't lose
He's all over the news
Battin' sweet baby blues
It's the American way
To hell with the truth
He's suckin' up to the dude
He's an American stooge
And maybe he likes it that way

Once he stood at a fork in the road
Scratchin' his head which way to go
Power on his left, conscience on his right
A soul in the balance in a knockdown fight
When he's not kissin' the ring and levelin' threats
He's proud to be your favorite hypocrite
Polishin' sound bites for the folks at home
A moth to a flame and a microphone
I just can't lose
I'm all over the news
Battin' my sweet baby blues
It's the American way
To hell with the truth
I'm suckin' up to the dude
I'm an American stooge
And, baby, I like it that way

We all fall down

Ah, I just can't lose
To hell with the truth
I'm an American stooge
And I like it that way
I'm starting to ooze
From my head to my shoes
I'm an American stooge
Don't care if there's hell to pay
I just can't lose
I'm all over the news
Battin' my sweet baby blues
It's the American way
To hell with the truth
I'm suckin' up to the dude
I'm an American stooge
And, baby, I like it that way
I like it that way
I like it that way
I like it that way

I like it
Very stable geniusEmbed
