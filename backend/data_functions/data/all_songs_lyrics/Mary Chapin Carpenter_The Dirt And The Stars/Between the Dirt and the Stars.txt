Between the Dirt and the Stars Lyrics
Try to conjure up a night
Of jessamine upon the air
I'm seventeen and in a car
Ready to ride anywhere
This summer night sticks to my skin
And the beer's gone to my head
My arm hangs out the window
And I can't hear what you just said

Over the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everything you'll ever know
Is in the choruses

Everything that made you whole
Everything that broke your heart
Whatever called you by your soul
And piece by piece took you apart
Every spark you ever chased
All the faith love robbed you of
Every light the dark erased
Every cause that gave you up
Turn on the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everywhere we'd ever go
Is in the choruses

Standing on the porch tonight
All I hear is a distant car
Watching the fading light
Between the dirt and the stars
Between the rough and smooth
And the easy and the hard
The lonely sound of loneliness
That's shaped just like my heart

Years will pass before we turn
To face the place where we come from
Years will pass before we learn
What time denies to everyone
If we're lucky ghosts and prayers
Are company, not enemies
I time travel straight back there
When you were singing back to me
Along with the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everything we'll ever know
Is in the choruses
Over the radio
Wild, wild horses
Everywhere we'll ever go
Is in the chorusesEmbed
