Old D-35 Lyrics
As long as there's a sky turning into darkness after day
As long as you and I are standing in a photograph in a frame
As long as there's a vine of summer squash and peach pie on a sill
As long as there's still time and room to chase it, try and hold it still

An old hat in the hallway
The way the light turns gold
Twilight on a fall day
And the sound of your old D-35

As long you appear in my dreams to show me how it was
As long as I am here to shake a fist at the universe above

A shot glass filled with whiskey
A screen door that won't close
Loneliness and mystery
And the sound of your old D-35

We find the one we're meant for if we're truly meant to be
As if fate's in charge and all we have to do is call on destiny
As long as there are songs that sound like rain on an old terne roof
As long as we belong to another time before we knew how much we'd lose
As long as there's a sky turning into darkness after day
As long as you and I are frozen in a photograph in a frame

A cigarette's ash glowing
An endless stretch of road
Everything worth knowing
And the sound of your old D-35
