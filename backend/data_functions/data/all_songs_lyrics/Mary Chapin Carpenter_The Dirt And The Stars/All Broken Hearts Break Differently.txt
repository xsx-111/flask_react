All Broken Hearts Break Differently Lyrics
You look around with both eyes clear
How long it took to arrive right here
Where what you want and what you need
Is little more than the air you breathe
Between blades of grass or grains of sand
Nothing ever stays in your hands

All broken hearts break differently
Some crash and burn, some go quietly
Love only knows there's no apology
All broken hearts break differently

Those things we'd change and still we'd yearn
A dream not chased, pages still unturned
You'd wring your hands, you'd twist the knife
Trade anything for someone else's life
But like truth to dare and push to shove
We risk everything when it comes to love

All broken hearts break differently
Some slip the chains
Some throw away the key
Love only knows which one you will be
All broken hearts break differently
Love only knows which one you will be
All broken hearts, all broken hearts, all broken hearts
Break differentlyEmbed
