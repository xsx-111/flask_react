Secret Keepers Lyrics
Give it up or go down with it
A secret's a boat tossed on a wave
All these years you've been living with it
And it's fucked you up every which way

Secret keepers are lost and found
Spare a little kindness when you meet someone
You never really know what they're carrying around
Every day is a battle that's never won

It's not safe to keep it hidden
And it's not safe to let it out
You just learn to do its bidding
As it blows you up from the inside out

Secret keepers are lost and found
Spare a little kindness when you meet someone
You never really know what they're carrying around
Is it a live grenade or a loaded gun?

Out of sight, out of questions
With your truest friend: depression
Whispering "me too," true confession
No relief and no redemption
Secret keepers, we're all the same
Looking for some kindness when we meet someone
We get years of practice camouflaging shame
But the armor we're wearing weighs a ton
Secret keepers are lost and found
Spare a little kindness when you meet someone
You never really know what they're carrying aroundEmbed
