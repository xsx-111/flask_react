Asking For a Friend Lyrics
How do you tell someone it's not working?
Admitting it's because of you, not them
Can silence be a crueler way to hurt them?
Sorry, I'm just asking for a friend

How do you explain when it feels finished?
You've been trying but no longer can pretend
Why does the fact of loving you leave them diminished?
Sorry, I'm just asking for a friend

Don't worry there's nobody else, I know I haven't been myself
I guess I'm just wondering aloud
Reaching for some words that help to lead us back to how we felt
The things love has always been about

Have you ever wondered why you feel so empty?
You've been around this block, now here you are again
Wondering why some know so little and others plenty
Sorry, I'm just asking for a friend

Don't worry there's not someone else, I know I don't talk much myself
But now I'm just wondering aloud
Searching for some words that help to lead me back to when I felt
The things love is supposed to be about
When there's nothing left to say, how do you say it?
When there's nowhere else to go, have you reached the end?
Will this song always remind me when I play it?
Sorry, I'm just asking for a friendEmbed
