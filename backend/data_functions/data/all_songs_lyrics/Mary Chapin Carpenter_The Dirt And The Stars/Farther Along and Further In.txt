Farther Along and Further In Lyrics
Farther along and further in
I've never gone, I've never been
But I feel a shift, a turning in
I've never felt before

Farther along and further in
There's a crack in the armor, an opening
My heart seeing out and my eyes see in
But they've never seen before

What I chased that couldn't be caught
Wars I lost I shouldn't have fought
Everything that can't be taught

Farther along and further in
I think I'm finally listening
To some kind of spirit murmuring
I've never heard before

Hold the world and trust the wait
The road back home is never straight
Bang the drum and keep the faith
Time, memory, love and grace
The kindred eyes in a strangers face
Lead down to the deeper place

Farther along and further in
We're atoms and stardust circling
Catching the light then we're gone again
Farther along and further inEmbed
