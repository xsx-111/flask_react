Aubade (Morning Love Song) Lyrics
Yes, I thought our mouths would meet
Or at the very least our eyes
Never even tried
Ignoring every bit of light
That escaped our minds

As if we were asleep
As if we were asleep
As if we were asleep
As if we were

In the morning I'll be fine
In the morning I'll be fine
In the morning I'll be fine
In the morning I'll be fine
In the morning I'll be fine

Let me bathe amidst my ignorance, ignorance
As if I were asleep
As if I were asleep1Embed
