Pile! No Pile! Pile! Lyrics
You're not listening, I said "stop!"

Because it's come to be too much
I can't just pile aesthetic-perceptive dilemma
Over-analytic demeanors, feelings of lonely worthlessness
And unproductivity atop the other
Allowing each to bleed through their fabricated boundaries
And become one more thing to...

Notice me
Before it's too late and too far away
From when I dreamt of explaining to you
That you are an everywhere
That caused these words I'd somehow type
My fingers, feet and diaphragm
All screaming

And as things grew more complicated
Conscious expansion cultivated
The books' ideas, songs' polyphony
Texture, content danced around me
And unlike all the events staged
The puppeteered facade I'd made
This was naturally extraordinary
And grabbed me from the ordinary
Now perceived reduction theory
Of where we are
From afar
It made less sense and appeared
Beautyless, which I guess is its defense
Not that any simple allegory transcends
My inability
To relate, it's this ability to relate that
Provides the socially obligatory things that I
Want to re-learn
Why we're friends again
I thought you knew

I can pile one atop the other, it just feels bad
It just feels bad to realize
You might hear something
In the quietest of nights

There are two of me and
One of them will say "Hannah"
Way before now
Way before now
Way before now
Way before now
Way before now
"So now, a relationship that was totally meaningless and trivial is over. It's hard to get too upset"1Embed
