Angel Eyes LyricsI try to think that love's not around
But it's uncomfortably near
My ol' heart ain't gaining no ground
Because my angel eyes ain't here
Angel eyes, that old Devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's misspent
Misspent with angel eyes tonight
So drink up all you people
Order anything you see
Have fun you happy people
The laugh's and the joke's on me
Pardon me but I got to run
The facts uncommonly clear
Got to find who's now number one
And why my angel eyes
Oh, where is my angel eyes?
'Scuse me while I disappear
Angel eyesEmbed
