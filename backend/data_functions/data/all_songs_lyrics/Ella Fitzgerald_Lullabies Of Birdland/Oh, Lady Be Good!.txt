Oh, Lady Be Good! LyricsListen to my tale of woe
It's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue
I must win some handsome guy
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
With somebody just like you. So...
Oh, sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh, lady, be good to me
I am so awf'ly misunderstood
So lady, be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good to me
Oh lady be good to me

Listen to my tale of woe, it's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue
I must win some winsome miss
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
Which somebody just like you. So...
Oh sweet and lovely
Lady be good
Oh lady be good to me
I am so awf'lly misunderstood
So lady be good, to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So lady be good....to me
Auburn and brunette and blonde:
I love 'em all, tall or small
But somehow they dont' grow fond;
They stagger but never fall
Winte'rs gone, and now it's spring!
Love! where is thy sting?
If somebody won't respond
I'm going to end it all
So.....
Oh sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh lady, be good to me!
I am so awf'ly misunderstood
So, lady be good to me
This is tulip weather -
So let's put two and two together
I tell you
I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So, lady be good, to me
Show Version:
What a killing we could make;
Oh, lady, oh, please come through!
Susie, oh, for goodness' sake;
It isn't so hard to do
In this moment of distress
Hear my S.O.S
All my future is at stake
And, Susie, it's up to you
So......
Oh sweet and lovely, lady be good
Oh Susie, be good to me
I am so awf'lly misunderstood
So Susie, be good, to me
Oh, please have some pity
I'm all alone in this big city
I tell you I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So Susie be good....to me
Listen to my tale of woe, it's terribly sad but true
All dressed up, no place to go
Each ev'ning I'm awf'ly blue
I must win some winsome miss
Can't go on like this
I could blossom out I know
Which somebody just like you. So...
Oh sweet and lovely lady, be good
Oh lady, be good to me!
I am so awf'ly misunderstood
So, lady be good to me
This is tulip weather -
So let's put two and two together
I tell you
I'm just a lonesome babe in the wood
So, lady be good, to me
Oh, sweet and lovely wifey, be good
Oh, wifey be good to me!
I've put an end to your widowhood
So wifey, be good to me
We should be more clubby -
I hope you're glad to see your hubby
Or else, dear
I'll be a lonely babe in the wood
Oh wifey be good to meEmbed
