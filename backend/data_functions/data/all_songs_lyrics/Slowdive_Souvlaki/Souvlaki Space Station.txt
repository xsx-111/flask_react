Souvlaki Space Station Lyrics
Closed doors
Brings open minds
(and I don't want to see you)
See you smile
Inside
(and I don't want to know you)
Faces
And I've fallen
(and I don't want to hear you)
Wonder why
I'm here now

In asylum
Don't you see?
In asylum
Don't you see?

Doors close
And feelings flow
(and I don't want to know you)
Through my mind
I feel his
(and I don't want to hear you)
Pictures
And I've fallen
(and I don't want to know you)
Wonder why
I'm here now
(I promise to be near you)
Curse your soul
I don't wanna hear you
(and I) Curse your soul
I don't wanna know you...
Curse your soul
I don't wanna hear you
(and I) Curse your soul
I don't wanna know you...5Embed
