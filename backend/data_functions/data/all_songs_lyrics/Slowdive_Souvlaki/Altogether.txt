Altogether Lyrics
Sleepyhead, where did you go?
I saw you turning, but I couldn't catch your eye
It's alright, we're altogether
Yeah, yeah, yeah

And this is just a dream
It broke my heart, but then I guess you didn't know
It's alright, we're altogether
Yeah, yeah, yeah

So tired, you're so right
I'm so tired, it's alright tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Sleepyhead, what did you know?
I saw you talking, but I didn't hear a word
It's alright, we're altogether
Yeah, yeah, yeah2Embed
