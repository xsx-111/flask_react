Melon Yellow Lyrics
Sitting by, I watched you fall away
Sudden fall, I watched you for a day
You know I don't believe in death
Follow the sun, I watched you follow the sun

Sitting here I watched you dance
Looking for the sun I watched you dance

So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you

I saw you looking at the sun
I saw you looking at the sun

So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you
So long, so long
It's just a way to love you4Embed
