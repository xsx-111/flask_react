When the Sun Hits Lyrics
Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games, don't leave me
I've come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me
You're a sun, yeah (Hey hey!)

Sweet thing, I watch you
Burn so fast it scares me
Mind games, don't lose me
Come so far, don't lose me
It matters where you are

As the sun hits, she'll be waiting
With her cool things and her heaven
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me
You're a sun, yeah (Hey hey hey!)
Sweet thing, I watch you (Burn away)
Sweet thing, I watch you (Burn away)
Sweet thing, I watch you (Burn away)20Embed
