Sing Lyrics
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
Here come my man
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
Here in my mind
Watch you fall away
I know
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
See you cover death
I know

What's in your mind, calling from behind
See you fall away, I know he's here to stay

(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
Who are you, where are you, in time?
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
I thought I 
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
Everything I say
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
Oh, here another day
(Sing where the other boys can watch you dance)
I 
Reaching for me
And I know that he's gone away4Embed
