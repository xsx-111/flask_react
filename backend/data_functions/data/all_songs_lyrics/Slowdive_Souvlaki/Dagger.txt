Dagger Lyrics
The sunshine girl is sleeping
She falls and dreams alone
And me, I am her dagger
Too numb to feel her pain

The world is full of noise, here
I hear it all the time
And me, I am your dagger
You know I am your wound
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time

She whispers while I'm sleeping:
"I love you when you smile"
I didn't really lose you
I just lost it for a while

The world is full of noise, yeah
I hear it all the time
You know I am your dagger
You know I am your wound
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time
I thought I heard you whisper
It happens all the time10Embed
