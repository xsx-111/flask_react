40 Days Lyrics
Forty days and I miss you
I'm so high that I've lost my mind
It's the summer I'm thinking of
Forty days and I'm blown away

If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care

You said you're always sleeping
But if so, I'll be leaving
It's just that I'm always falling
And it makes me feel bad, yeah

If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't worry
If I saw something new
I guess I wouldn't care

Just to try and watch you
Said I love the way that you smile
I don't know
Makes me try and watch you
I said I love the way that you smile
I don't know
Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile
I don't know
Smile whenever I watch you
I said I love the way that you smile
I don't know5Embed
