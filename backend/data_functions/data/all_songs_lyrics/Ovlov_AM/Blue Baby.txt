Blue Baby LyricsYou watched it
Saw the truth of Austin
Luke, old friend
Know we could have offed them
You watched them
Forgot your way to be
You soften
And on your way you see
Blue baby
Grab the phone to save me
Fear that maybe
Soon we'll grow up shady
My lady
You save up half the time
Delay me
Don't say we have the timeEmbed
