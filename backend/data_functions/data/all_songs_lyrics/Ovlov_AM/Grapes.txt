Grapes LyricsSoon you crawl inside your waiting
Don't waste your time to feel; never hating
Should it be mine to feel like you hate it?
You fit your size to be anyway
To your hall in silent waiting
You make your wine for free cause you're clever
I sip your wine and feel where they waited
Don't fix; you're fine to me and you're well
Now come with me
I will not ask to be and wait to say goodbyeEmbed
