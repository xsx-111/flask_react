Moth Rock LyricsYou were alone just like a moth
Flown away; feel the whisper in my head
Feel your tone right through the rock
All the way; free your simple minded head
For you alone, tonight
Wait for a while to oversee those for miles through
Wait for you to show tonight
Wait for a while for older seat scraped the tile floor
To your home, you carry rocks
Peel the mold and fear the mist brings on our heads
Hear you say another name
All the pain building up inside my head
And you were wrong to right
Wait for a while more and you'll see space through my old door
Hey, you do it for the night
Wait for a while more and you'll see haste; a mile tour
Hold on
Try in your head again
Feel more fine and you're there again
See for time with your pair again
Feel for youEmbed
