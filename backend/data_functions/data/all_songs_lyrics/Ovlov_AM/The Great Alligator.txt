The Great Alligator LyricsHere
We're on our way
Be there today
And there we'll stay
Fear
You understand
I made the sand
Bury your hand
Take time
Almost that you are
Made fine
Selma where you are
Wait a while for you
Gator gall for 2
And i feel the red eye
Please
Don't sing this wrong
This is your song
Don't think too long
We're
Already fine
So take your time
It's clear your mine
Take time
Almost that you are
Made fine
Selma where you are
Take a mile in 2
Gator crawls to you
And i feel the red eye
You need the oak wine
A meal for old timeEmbed
