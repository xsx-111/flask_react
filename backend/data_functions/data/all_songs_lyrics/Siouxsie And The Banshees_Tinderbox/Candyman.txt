Candyman Lyrics
Sickly sweet, his poison seeks
For the young ones who don't understand
The danger in his hands
With a jaundiced wink
See his cunning slink
Oh, trust in me, my pretty one
Come walk with me, my helpless one

Candyman

Syrup lies upon your tongue
Gelatin saliva spills
A flash of a guillotine a smile

Candyman
Oh, candyman

No pity for him
Their misery screams unspeakable things
No pity for him
Their misery screams unspeakable things
Candyman
A cool missile, yes, it's in his smile
With open arms to welcome you
Beware the masked pretender
He always lies, this candyman
Those lips conspire in treachery
To strike in cloak and dagger, see!
Candyman
Oh, candyman

And all the children, he warns, "Don't tell,"
Those threats are sold
With their guilt and shame
They think they're to blame for

Candyman
Candyman
Candyman
