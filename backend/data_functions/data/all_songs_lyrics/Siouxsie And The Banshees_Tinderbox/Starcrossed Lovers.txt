Starcrossed Lovers Lyrics
It's in the wind with a kiss on your face
The taste that thought lingers on your lips
Yet even as we freeze, even as you burn
Discussed the coils through your fingertips
In the scorching depth of memory

Starcrossed lovers on a treacherous night
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight
Starcrossed lovers on a treacherous night
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight

Strapped to the moon in a silver light
The crow wings beat in the lungs of the sun
Put your hand on my heart
And cast back raindrops shrivelled in the night

Starcrossed lovers on a treacherous night
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight
Starcrossed lovers on a treacherous night
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight
Starcrossed lovers on a treacherous night
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight
Delight
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight
Starcrossed lovers, on a treacherous night
Sharpening the blades of murderous delight1Embed
