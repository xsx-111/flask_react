State Of Things LyricsBlind fold me
Tie me up or tie me down
Yeah take me anywhere
Keep your ears close to the ground
Listen to me but don't die laughing
All things must end, yeah
But I can see my fate in your eyes
As I'm stitched up by my friends again
They just can't defend the state of things
Between you and me
Used to be on fire
So slip off your shackles
You don't need them where we're going
See what happens just happens
And there ain't no straight lines in the state of things
So try to cling on for dear life
And don't forget the world keeps on turning round
Despite you and me
Used to be on fire, fire
Now look now at where we're going
I don't know where I'm going
I don't knowEmbed
