The Road LyricsThere's a road with two yellow lines
That go on for years
And the people there smile and wave
It's not like back home
In their doorways, where the evening sky
Lights up my room, lights up my room
Lights up my room, lights up my...
Times are fierce and times are fine
Yeah it goes that way
Down some highway, yeah down some lonely road
In that old fashioned way
In the garden, yeah where the evening sky
Lights up my room, lights up my room
Lights up my room, lights up my...
But the darkness
Let's some see all of the people they never knew
So float into space
Falling through puddles and places I've never been
Will my soul be angry?
When you die do you feel alright?
In the garden, yeah where the evening sky
Lights up my room, lights up my room
Lights up my room, lights up my..
There's a road with two yellow lines
That goes on for years
And the people there, oh they smile and wave
Oh it's not like back home
In their doorways, where the evening sky
Lights up my room, lights up my room
Lights up my room, lights up my...Embed
