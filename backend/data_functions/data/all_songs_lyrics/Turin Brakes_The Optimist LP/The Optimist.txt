The Optimist LyricsSitting here staring out the window
Traffic always makes me feel like I'm coming home
Cold blood bleeding still at least I'm breathing
Patiently waiting, clinging on to my mobile phone
Cracked skulls with a creepy mind inside
I'm planning the greatest of escapes you know
Patiently waiting in the line
Soon I'm gonna stand up, yeah I'm gonna rear up
And there's no escape lonely planet
Oh it's too late lonely planet
Cold blood bleeding still at least I'm breathing
Patiently waiting, soon I'm gonna take control
Cracked skull with a creepy mind inside
I'm planning the greatest of escapes
Patiently waiting in the line
Soon I'm gonna stand up, yeah I'm gonna rear up
And there's no escape, lonely planet
Oh it's too late, lonely planetEmbed
