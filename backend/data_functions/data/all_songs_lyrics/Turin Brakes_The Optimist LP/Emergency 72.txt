Emergency 72 LyricsWell all my colours bleed for you
Can't you see them running?
My hazy hills glow green for you
You could just call me, you know?
On my mobile number cause I'm always in
And I was just thinking about you on emergency
72 72 72 yeah
Well all my lust comes down to dust
Can't you see it crumbling?
My hazy hill come down to rust
But you could call me, you know?
You're pulling me out of this whirlpool
Your making me breathe again
And I was just thinking about you on emergency
72 72 72 yeah
And I just can't forget 72
And I just can't forget
72 72 72 72 72 yeah 72
72 72 72 72 72 yeah 72
72 72 72 72 72 yeah 72
72 72 72 72 72 yeah 72
Well all my colours bleed for you
Can't you see them running?
My hazy hills glow green for you
You could just call me, you know?Embed
