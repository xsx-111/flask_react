Slack LyricsI've got a rifle on my back
Swinging past the birch trees
Well I set of a bomb way back there
I don't care about nobody but me
I, no I ain't slack
Ran back home and drunk all the wine
Well I stole a bottle for myself
With insects crawling in my hair
The trees are black and I don't care
'Cos I, no I ain't slack
Rescued a cat from a tree
Well its fur was all caked in dirt
So I killed it dead for liking me
Yeah I stole a car and drove to town
And I, no I ain't slackEmbed
