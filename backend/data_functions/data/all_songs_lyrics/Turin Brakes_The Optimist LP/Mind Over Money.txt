Mind Over Money LyricsMind over money, bent over backwards
Light up my life like a very last cigarette
Time after time dear we will just lie here
Staring at ceilings, it doesn't really matter where we are
Wearing a smile like its going out of style
Look at yourself , there's nothing in there
Just put points on a grave stone
Can you see yourself sinking
Staring at ceilings, it doesn't really matter where you are
That's alright I warned myself
Keep blood on the inside and nowhere else
Up on a shelf that's where I need to be...
La da da dee
I need to get something, I can't sleep for red eye
Internal combustion can that really happen?
I take it back, yeah, whatever I did, yeah
I didn't mean it, I was only joking
What does this matter in the grand scheming sky
All that I multiply adds up to nothing
That's alright I warned myself
Keep blood on the inside and nowhere else
Up on a shelf that's where I need to be...
La da da deeEmbed
