By TV Light LyricsWine bottle why are you weary
And why are my eyes so grey
Semi circle people are pointing
And staring up to the sky
And the dogs are all gone and my muesli is mouldy
And the saints they are sinners in their songs
And the crickets they call to their rusted rainbow
I swear if you listen
You might just hear our song
TV light flickers so fiercely
Bridging the gap between my eyes
Outside the rain is tapping my window
A jet trail left hanging in the sky
And the puddles reflect the sky in the morning
And the pavements lead to another place
With one ear to the west and an ocean beside me
I swear if you listen
You might just hear our song
Electric sensation will not stay with us for long
Wine bottle why are you weary
And why are my eyes so grey
Semi circle people are pointing
And staring up to the sky
And the dogs are all gone and my muesli is mouldy
And the saints they are sinners in their songs
And the crickets they call to their rusted rainbow
I think if you listen
You might just hear their song
Eclectic sensation will not be with us for longEmbed
