Feeling Oblivion LyricsCubscouts are screaming
Needing icecreaming and all the pleasures of June
I'm in a parked car
Flowers seem friendly and people in hall ways feel walls
Now it is night time, maybe we're cruising avoiding the anti-cruise
Oh I don't really know where we are
If things get real promise to take me somewhere else
By the time fear takes me over will we still be rolling and feeling oblivion
Once in a while now the lie in the laughter can burn through a hole in my ears
Like a man with glasses catching a sunbeam and burning the skin of a kid
Hypereal fragments disturbing the stagnants of almighty fear
Well I'll just go under the water
If things get real promise to take me somewhere else
By the time fear takes me over will we still be rolling and feeling oblivion
So don't leave me here on my own
So don't leave me here on my own
If things get real promise to take me somewhere else
By the time fear takes me over will we still be rolling and feeling oblivion1Embed
