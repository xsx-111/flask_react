Future Boy LyricsSo Future Boy where are you from?
My time machine crashed over yonder
The syphillis is a bitch, but contracting HIV is much worse
Why are you pushing info into me
I have no need for it, I'm from the stars
I thought you'd like to know the scoop
I'm taking babies back with me, yeah
I'm taking them back home
So they can see there's a much better place
I've got a sister with an open mind
And my friends are all junkies
But they're still my friends
As long as they don't use monkeys
We enjoyed the heat of stolen days in the summer of '93
Well the future boy said
"I've got friends but you know some times
It all depends on how tall they are against yourself"
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
I am the future boy (Hello, the future boy)
My friends have all gone and left me
So I decided to come here and see myself as a baby
But it looks like I'm stuck here this time
Oh shit, gonna miss my friends
And no, you're still you're the future
Yes I'm still the future boy
We'll build you a time machine to get back home
Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Oh, I'm still the future boy
Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Still the future boy
Well, I'm still the future boyEmbed
