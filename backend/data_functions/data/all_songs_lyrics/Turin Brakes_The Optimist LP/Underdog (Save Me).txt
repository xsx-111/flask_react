Underdog (Save Me) Lyrics
Two black lines streaming out like a guidance line
Put one foot on the road now where the cyborgs are driving
With the WD-40 in their veins
The screeching little brakes complains
With the briefcase empty and the holes in my shoes
I try to stay friendly for the sugary abuse
So tell my secretary now to hold all of my calls
I believe I can hear through these walls

Oh please save me, save me from myself
I can't be the only one stuck on the shelf
You said you'd always fall for the underdog

Well I've been dreaming of jetstreams and kicking up dust
A 37,000-foot wanderlust
And with skyline number 9 ticked off in my mind
Oh, can't you hear me screaming out now through the telephone lines?

Oh please save me, save me from myself
I can't be the only one stuck on the shelf
You said you'd always fall for the underdog
Save me, save me, save me...Embed
