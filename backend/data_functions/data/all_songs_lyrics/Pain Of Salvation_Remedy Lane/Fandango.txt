Fandango LyricsWatch them dance
She is intimacy - a wonder of closeness
Fighting hypocrisy - a lonely child that
Never could believe, yet never give up
On life's insanity
Understanding is all, she fails to find it
She can never fall
All her life she's longed to be weak
All this time on roads turning bleak
(Roads turning bleak)
Watch her dance
He is sharpness of mind - a lonely Peter Pan
Always standing behind and from a distance
Looking at a world of love and deceit
This child of air defies every rooftop and tree
Instead of what he's craving for the most
Getting close
Live that you might find the answers
You can't know before you live
Love and life will give you chances
From your flaws learn to forgive
All his life he's sought to be brave
All this time sought someone to save
(Someone to save)
Watch him dance
They are two of a kind - two children warm and wild
In a world going blind they raise their voices
Speaking for the mute
Building dreams of love finding their way through it
They are turned into myths - a beacon of hope
Live that you might find the answers
You can't know before you live
Love and life will give you chances
From your flaws learn to forgive
All his (life) he was (just) wishing (to) be touched
(but) too scared (of) what he (de)sired (while)
All her (life) she was (an) object (of) grown men's (de)sire
(and) wished to (be) untouched (now) they must (try) to work (their)
Unforgotten sexuality out
Watch them dance
Always being much more human than they wished to be
They built up a world so wonderful
So pure and tense
Stained only now and then by the blood
Of their young innocence
All their life (All their life)
On Tolkien's grounds (Of forests and dreams)
All their time (All their time)
On islands unfound (Islands unfound)
Trapped in a fandango
Watch them dance
Watch them dance
Fandango
Live that you might find the answers
You can't wait before you live
Love and life will give you chances
From your flaws learn to forgiveEmbed
