This Heart of Mine (I Pledge) LyricsI lie awake watching your shoulders
Move so softly as you breathe
With every breath you're growing older
But that is fine if you're with me
I pledge to wake you with a smile
I pledge to hold you when you cry
I pledge to love you 'till I die
'Till I die
The morning light plays on your eyelids
A sleeping beauty dressed in sun
I will wake you with a smile
I will hold you when you cry
I will love you 'till I die
'Till I die
I believe this heart of mine when it tells my eyes
That this is beauty
I believe this heart of mine when it tells my mind
That this is reason
I believe this heart of mine when it cries at time
That this is forever
I believe this heart of mine when it tells the skies
That this is the face of God
I lie awake watching your shouldersEmbed
