Undertow LyricsLet me go
Let me go
Let me seek the answers that I need to know
Let me find a way
Let me walk away
Through the undertow
Please let me go
Let me fly
Let me fly
Let me rise against that blood red velvet sky
Let me chase it all
Break my wings and fall
Probably survive
So let me fly
Let me fly
Let me run
Let me run
Let me ride the crest of chance into the sun
You were always there
But you may lose me here
Now love me if you dare
And let me run
I'm alive
And I am true to my heart now
I am I
But why must truth always make me die?
Let me break
Let me bleed
Let me tear myself apart I need to breathe
Let me lose my way
Let me walk astray
Maybe to proceed
Just let me bleed
Let me drain
Let me die
Let me break the things I love I need to cry
Let me burn it all
Let me take my fall
Through the cleansing fire
Now let me die
Let me die
Let me out
Let me fade into that pitch-black velvet night2Embed
