Rope Ends LyricsShe is still young
Another day of emptiness
This life is wearing her down
The room around her is a mess
Her children safe with her mom
She is still young but feeling old
Two children with different fathers
She sits on the bathroom floor alone
The shower chain broke, her neck hurts
Then another night of emptiness to wear her down
Naked to the world she wraps her sadness in a gown
Her children fast asleep she sears the dark with glassy eyes
Choosing carefully among her husband's business ties
"Over!" she cries through rope ends and silk ties
Beautiful life escaping her young blue eyes
"Over!" she cries (But life holds her hands)
Through rope ends and silk ties (Refusing to let go)
Beautiful life (Leaving her breathing)
Escaping her young blue eyes (On the floor)
They're still asleep don't hear her cry
And she's still obsessed with rope ends
This time she picks a stronger tie
With Winnie the Pooh and friends
She is still young but feeling old
A child dying to be a mother
Now she hangs from the ceiling all alone
All pressure is falling from her
Seeing guilt has taught her guilt she's raised on disbelief
Merely twenty beautiful but with a taste for grief
She has learnt all that there is to know about hopelessness
Seeing that no effort in this world can stand her test
"Over!" she cries (And Winnie is strong)
Through rope ends and silk ties (Would never let her fall)
Beautiful life (Prevents her from breathing)
Escaping her young blue eyes ('Till she's not there at all)
"Over!" she cries (But life holds her hands)
Through rope ends and silk ties (Refusing to let go)
Beautiful life (Leaving her breathing)
Escaping her young blue eyes (On the floor)
Seeing guilt has taught her guilt she's raised on disbelief
Merely twenty beautiful but with a taste for grief
She has learnt all that there is to know about helplessness
Seeing that no caring in this world can ease her stress
Helpless she lies (The ceiling let go)
In rope ends and undies (The old house let her fall)
Unseeing eyes(Dropping her breathing)
Fixating Eeyore's smile (To the hard cold floor)
"Over!" she cries (Hitting her head)
As she's going unblind (A broken china soul)
Still in this life (red stains on porcelain)
Still in this troubled mind (And she's not there at all)
Breathing she cries (Blackened and bruised)
For rope ends and silk ties (Learning how to see)
Beautiful eyes (Staring at her tooth)
Piglet stands shy behind (Crimsoned ivory)
Broken she lies (Hours they pass)
Undead and unblind (This broken china soul)
Beautiful life (Red stains on porcelain)
Beautiful crying young eyes (And she's not there at all)Embed
