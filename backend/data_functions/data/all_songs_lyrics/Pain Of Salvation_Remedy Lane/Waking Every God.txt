Waking Every God LyricsTicking, ticking
Wishing, wishing
Standing here in Buda trying to explain
To myself and to the girl beside
Why I feel so weightless and free from all my pain
Telling myself that you're here inside
For the wind is in my hair as we are on this sun hot roof
And far below the Danube passes as we talk
And I'd like to think that this is what you wanted me to find
This happiness could help us rebuild what we've lost
Calling - waking every god
Falling - love is in my blood
Breathing - love is life unbound
Kneeling - let me tread its ground
Through her eyes I can see
Who you used to be
Through my eyes she can see
What that feeling means to me
Oh, ticking
Wishing I was stronger
Wishing I was whole
Wishing I was someone that I'm not
And I wish that I could linger
To the faith I used to have
Wishing of myself to be a god
Oh, I'm wishing to be God
Calling - waking every god
Falling - love is in my blood
Breathing - love is life unbound
Kneeling - let me tread its ground
Through her eyes I can see
Who you used to be
Through my eyes she can see
Numb anxiety
Love take me home
Life shake me homeEmbed
