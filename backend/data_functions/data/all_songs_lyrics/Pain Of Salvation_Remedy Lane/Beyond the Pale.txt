Beyond the Pale Lyrics
And sex was always there
From when I was only eight years
Tempting me, leaving me thirsty
Sweat, skin, a pulse divine
To balance this restless mind
It seemed so wonderfully physical

Oh the blood, the lust
The bodies that color the world
All drugs to die for
Won't you share my fire?
How can love make that world
A minefield of forbidden ground?
A map of untouchable skin
And silenced desire?

And love was there in vain
Profound and deep but traced with pain
Too early for a child of ten
Loving the pure and sane
He sought the goddesses unstained
Watching them turn to flesh again
Hungry for both the purity and sin
Life seemed to him
Merely like a gallery of how to be
And he was always much more human
Than he wished to be
But there is a logic to his world
If they could only see

Wishing
Sickened
Ill
Ticking

Someone still this hunger (It's in my blood)
Always growing stronger (Ticking)
Budapest I'm learning
Budapest you're burning me

This is not who I wanted to be
This is not what I wanted to see
She's so young so why don't I feel free
Now that she is here under me?
Naked
Touching
Soft
Clutching

And then after all
It lead me here to wake up again
Seeking a love
That might make me
Feel free in myself but then
It proves to be
Something that hurts inside
When we touch
So I move on
I lose my way
Astray I'm trying too much

To feel unchained
To burn out this sense of feeling cold
And every day
I seek my prey
Someone to taste and to hold
I feel alive
During the split second when they smile
And meet my eyes
But I could cry
'Cause I feel broken inside

Come and drown with me
The undertow will sweep us away
And you will see that I'm addicted
To my honesty
Trust, 'cause after all
My sense of truth once brought me here
But I've lost control
And I don't know if I am true to my soul
I've lost control
And I don't know if I am true to my soul
Losing control
And I don't know if I am true at all

And we were always much more human than we wished to be

And I remember when you said
You've been under him
I was surprised to feel such pain
And all those years of being
Faithful to
You
Despite the hunger
Flowing through my veins

And I have always tried to
Calm things down
Swallow down swallow down
"It's just another small
Thorn in my crown"
But suddenly one day there was just
Too much blood in my eyes
And I had to take this walk down
Remedy Lane of whens and whys

Empty
Licking
Clean
Choking

Someone still this hunger (Possessing my mind)
Always growing stronger (Craving)
Budapest I'm learning
Budapest I'm burning me

This is not who I wanted to be
This is not what I wanted to see
She's so young
So why don't I feel free
Now that she's under me
In the morning she's going away
In a Budapest taxi I've paid
Seeking freedom I touched the untouched
It's too much
I'm beyond the pale

Prematurity is the story
Of both you and me
And we were always much more human
Than we wished to be
Prematurity is truly the story
Of both you and me
And we were always much more human
Than we wished to be
We were always much more human than we wished to be
We were always much more human than we wished to be
We will always be more human than we wish to be
We will always be so much more human than we wish to be2Embed
