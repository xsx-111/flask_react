Second Love LyricsDay after day
Nothing's changed you're far away
But I need you to know that I can't sleep anymore
By the nights
Night after night
The stars are shining so bright
Though our pain is larger than universe
Tonight
I want you to know I can't sleep anymore
By the nights
By the nights
Day after day I want you to say
That you're mine
You are mine
Year after year
Tear after tear
I feel like my heart will break in two
You came like a wind
I couldn't defend
You cut my heart so deeply
The scars won't mend
I'll never believe in love anymore
After this
After this
Can never change or rearrange
What we lost
What we lost
Time after time
I am wasting my time
Living in a past where I was strong
But now I am gone
I leave no shadow when I'm alone
I'll stay forever in my dreams where you are near
I want you to know I can't sleep anymore
By the nights
By the nights
Day after day I want you to say
That you're mine
You are mine
I want you to know I can't sleep anymore
By the nights
By the nights
Day after day I want you to say
That you're mine
You are mineEmbed
