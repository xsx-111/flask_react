Ending Theme LyricsAnd so I find myself here once again
First step down Remedy Lane
Budapest you tore my world apart
Well, here I am
(To be honest, I don't know what I'm looking for)
Worn with rope ends on my mind
Torn with blood scarred in my eyes
But now I'm back to shake that from my life
Ending theme, ending theme
Ripping at the seams, for an opening
Back again at Deák Tér
I know I could have left her there
It was the feeling of leaving myself that I could not bear
The same old hotel room in Pest
One night before the Sziget fest
Hungarian Princess will you share my rest?
To rest in my
Ending theme, ending theme
Ripping at the seams, for an opening
To be honest I don't know what I'm looking for, who to be
Sitting here as once before, weeks ago, just waiting for a knock on that door
And I Have left all I thought was me to find out
To make sure if it was you or me
That made me feel so free, so real, but when we kiss I don't know, I just don't know
Cause it leaves a taste of emptiness, and I think :"What if I'm simply depressed?"
Blind, just finding temporary rest from my mind here in Budapest?
Confusing zest with the joy of being blessed with the bliss of self-escape as we kiss?
And mixing my being unstressed with your being undressed and the taste of being true
With the fresh taste of me and you as we touch?
I don't know
But I saw so much of me in you, the me I've missed, the young and free in you
But still, that doesn't mean a thing, may not mean anything about me needing you
But I guess we had to meet, to be near, to make sure, but still my dear
Beyond this bed and that door, to be honest, I fear I just don't know
Ending theme, ending theme
Fanning flames to dreams of belonging
Ending theme, ending theme
Ripping at the seams, for an opening
To be honest I don't know what I'm looking for
Lying here, watching you leave through that doorEmbed
