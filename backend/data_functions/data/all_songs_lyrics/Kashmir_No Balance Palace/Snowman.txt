Snowman Lyrics3am and 7 blocks away
We can see him sigh
And feel im sway
Speaking out his frozen sympathy
Penning down a sense
He doesn't feel
Stroke his cheek
The man is made of snow
Plain to see his eyes are merely holes
Reaching out
Impatient for the goal
Melt my friend
A warm wind is going to blowEmbed
