The Curse of Being a Girl LyricsYou pretend that you're alright
The worst noise
Is when you are keeping quiet
You say you're not that kind of girl
Who will dramatize or traumatize
Don't fold your hands
Don't hold your tongue
The other girls will try
To prove you wrong
Their words will toss you like a storm
You can't step aside
You can't resign
It's just the curse of being a girl
Tonight you must hold your head up high
And be aware that
You're the purest pearl tonight
And shoot their reflections
Back in their eyes
You're reaching out to grab his hand
But he must be the world's most tired man
Acerbic in his compliments
If he sees it all
Your new shoes and all
It should be unforgettable
The cloudy sky should be convertible
And then we end in this smokey hole
Full of concubines
And replicants
It's just the curse of being a girl
Tonight you can hardly make a change
Look around
It's more than half the world tonight
Who must go through that same rage
It's just the curse of being a girl
Tonight you can hardly make a change
Look around
It's more than half the world tonight
Who must go through that same rageEmbed
