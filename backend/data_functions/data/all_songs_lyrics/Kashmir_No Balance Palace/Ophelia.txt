Ophelia LyricsYes the black magic worked
And it might be well deserved
With a pin through my third eye
But the long frozen stare
Shooting holes in stagnant air
Sends me off to die
Waltzing out through your clouds
And I know there is no doubt
Venus is your star

Ophelia...
You're falling out
Too tedious...
To talk about?
Disappeared in the park
Left me probing through the dark
Put me off the path
You're the pebble in my shoe
And the beauty in my view
Beaming through the glass

Ophelia...
You're falling out
Too tedious...
To talk about?
Insurmountable...
Always colourful
I don't want to know
How you do what you doEmbed
