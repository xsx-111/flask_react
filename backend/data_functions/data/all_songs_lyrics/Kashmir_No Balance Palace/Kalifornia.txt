Kalifornia LyricsKalifornia
Have you gone wild?
I'm sifting through your dark miles
Reaching out for you
In the headlight's glare
But you're way to devious
To be aware
Restless, restless
Windswept road
Take me some place
Unfold
Kalifornia
In a bleak road song
Old Nick warned me
Against the storm
But I'm your slipstream
You're my trail
Drive wild with me
Full sails
Restless, restless
Windswept road
Take me some place
Unfold
Sometime
Get there sometime
Sometime
Get there sometime
Sometime
Get there sometime
Sometime
Get there sometime
Sometime
Get there sometimeEmbed
