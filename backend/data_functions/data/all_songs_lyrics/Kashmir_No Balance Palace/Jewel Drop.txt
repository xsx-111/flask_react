Jewel Drop Lyrics...and in the corner of this room
Lucifer's now observing
I'm swaggering past the wall of fiends
Surely it makes her nervous
What a grand spree
Just like the old times
Everyone is here
What's in the bag exchanging hands
The actions are somewhat cloudy
Don't wanna know so let's just dance
Billy is screaming loudly
Let's turn it 'round
Bring ceilings down
And fall in love again
Who was that actor next to her
That everyone seems to know of
An angel is whispering (well deserved)
You made the choise to blow it all up
That's a new dress
She's heaven sent
She wasn't sent for me
Let's turn it 'round
Bring the ceilings down
And fall in love againEmbed
