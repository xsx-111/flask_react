Black Building Lyrics
I've passed that little black building
Down on the corner so many times
And I often wondered
If anyone lived there
It looked like an empty dwelling
With its cracked faade
Dusty windows
Curtains withdrawn
No lights
No signs of anything
I talked to Jewel about it
She had the same idea
That old guy that always hangs out outside the liquor store next door
(Reghmann)
Told me he'd once seen the devil
In one of those windows up there
Blowing him a kiss
He had a certain serious, almost eerie
Look on his face as he said it
As if he'd actually seen the dark lord
'said he'd seen him
Throw trash out of the back window
That he'd been stealing the furniture
From whatever bars
Closed down in the neighbourhood
But he's an old guy
Probably delirious
So anyway
The other day me and Rico
Decided to break in
To see what the dark palace was really all about
(It had a long tall hallway)
It had a long tall hallway
That led to a staircase in the back
And on the right side
I counted seven doorsEmbed
