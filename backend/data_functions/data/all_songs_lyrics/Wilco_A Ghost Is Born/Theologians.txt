Theologians LyricsTheologians don't know nothing
About my soul
About my soul
I'm an ocean
And this emotion
Slow motion, slow motion
Illiterati lumen fidei
God is with us everyday
That illiterate light
Is with us every night
Theologians they don't know nothing
About my soul
Oh they don't know
They thin my heart with little things
And my life with change
Oh in so many ways
I find more missing every day
Theologians
I'm going away
Where you will look for me
Where I'm going you cannot come
No one's ever gonna take my life from me
I lay it down
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
A ghost is born
I am a notion
I am all emotion
I am a cherry ghost
Cherry ghost
Hey I'm a cherry ghost
A cherry ghostEmbed
