Muzzle of Bees Lyrics
There's a random painted highway
And a muzzle of bees
My sleeves have come unstitched
From climbing your tree

When dogs laugh some say they're barking
I don't think they're mean
Some people get so frightened
The fences in between

The sun gets passed from tree to tree
Silently then back to me
With the breeze blown through
Pushed up against the sea
Finally back to me

I'm assuming you got my message
On your machine
I'm assuming you love me
But you know what that means

The sun gets passed from sea to sea
Silently and back to me
With a breeze blown through
Pushed up above the leaves
With a breeze blowing through
My head upon your knee
Half of it's you, half is me
Half of it's you, half is me1Embed
