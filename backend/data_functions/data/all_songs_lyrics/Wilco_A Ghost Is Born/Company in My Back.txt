Company in My Back LyricsI attack with love, pure bug beauty
I curl my lips and crawl up to you
I attack with love, pure bug beauty
I curl my lips and crawl up to you
And your afternoon
And I've been puking
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
Hide your soft skin; your sorrow is sunshine
Listen to my eyes
Hide your soft skin, your sorrow is sunshine
Listen to my eyes
They are hissing radiator tunes
I move so slow from the steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
You learn so slow, old radiant beauty
I'll curve my flight
You learn so slow, old radiant beauty
I'll curve my flight
Under your bended knee
And I will always die, I will always die
I will always die, so you can remember me
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
I move so slow, steady crushing hand
Holy shit! There's a company in my back
There's a company in my back1Embed
