Remember Me LyricsDo you worry about your health
Do you watch it slowly change
And when you listen to yourself, does it feel like somebody else
And did you notice when you began to disappear
Was it slowly at first
Until there was nobody really there
Increment by increment
Increment by increment
Increment by increment
Oh remember me
Yeah remember me
Oh remember me
Yeah remember me
Oh remember me
Will you remember me?
Did half of you pass away
What about the other half
Yeah what about the other half
Whatever!
We're all part of the same old fucking regime
With someone taking it out whilst you were putting it in
Increment by increment
Increment by increment
Increment by increment
Oh remember me
Yeah remember me
Oh remember me
Yeah remember me
Oh remember me
Will you remember me?
Oh remember me
Yeah remember me
Oh remember me
From the here and now to eternity
Will you remember me?Embed
