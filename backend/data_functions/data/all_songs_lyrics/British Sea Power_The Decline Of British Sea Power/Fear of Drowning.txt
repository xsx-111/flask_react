Fear of Drowning LyricsJesus fucking Christ, oh god no!
From the moment that you realise
Most of this ain't real
To the moment that you decide
Shall we go out tonight
And we'll swim from these island shores
Till there's a fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning
Oh little England
Tonight I'll swim
From my favourite island shore
And how long has it been
Since you have seen so beautifully
(So beautifully)
Ah
And all the money in the world
Won't help you now
The only way is down
But you know from way out here
There is a little fear
A little old fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning
A little old fear of drowning
Oh little England
Tonight I'll swim
From my favourite island shores
And how long has it been
How long has it been
And how long has it been
Since you have seen so beautifully
Oh little England
Tonight I'll swim
From my favourite island shores
And how long has it been
Since you have seen so beautifullyEmbed
