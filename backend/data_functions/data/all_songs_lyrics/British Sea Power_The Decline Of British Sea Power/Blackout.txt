Blackout LyricsWelcoming the cool rain in of the astounding dawn
Watch the birds hovering over Narrow Moor
In deeper lines of deeper sleep, into the Tumuli
All the pretty machinery under the sky
Now you have drunk all your beer go drown your empty selves
For then you will have lost it all the last of this Island
As you Blackout
Blackout again
My love
So bring it down, let it fall, into a drizzling bliss
Then we'll hyperventilate in the old forest
Then I will see all those things, things that can not be seen
Now you have drunk all your beer, go drown your empty selves
For then you will have lost it all, the last of this island
As you Blackout
Blackout again
My love
Blackout again
My love.................Embed
