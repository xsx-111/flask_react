A Wooden Horse LyricsWhen wooden horses were in use
I would have built one
And left it for you
Yeah but I wanted to know
Yeah I wanted to know
How much are you?
How much are you?
How much are you?
How much are you?
Yeah I wanted to know
Yeah I wanted to know
Oh bring it in and let us see it
Oh let us see it
Oh bring it in and let us see it
Oh let us see it
Oh bring it in
And let us see it
A token heir means nowt in the hills
I swear I'm ready
Ready to kill
Yeah I wanted to know
Yeah I wanted to know
Oh bring it in and let us see it
Let us see it
Oh bring it in and let us see it
Let us see it
Oh bring it in
Oh bring it in
Bring it in
Bring it inEmbed
