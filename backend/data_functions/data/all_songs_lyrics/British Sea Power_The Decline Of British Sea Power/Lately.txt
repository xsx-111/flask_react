Lately LyricsLately you seem like another language
Are you in trouble, are you in trouble again
And you know how they say
The past is a foreign country
How can we go there
How can we go where we once went
Have I been standing here for so long
Natura's found a way of telling you that it was going wrong
So which way
Do I go to get out of here
Avoiding land mines, and all the other stuff round here
Replacing Hercules with the heroic sounds of Formby
Remove the tunics touch, stood aside from the putch
Stood aside from history
Have I been standing here for so long
Natura's found a way of telling you that it was going wrong
Through the Kattegat, maybe Outer Java
Oh did you wonder if these days will stay true
All through the years, all through the dead scenes
All through the memories, across the memories, melodies, melodies
Have I been standing here for so long
Natura's found a way of telling you that it was going wrong
Do you like my megalithic rock?
Do you like my prehistoric Rock?
Do you like my Teutonic Rock?
Do you like my hygienic rock?
Do you like my sterile rock?
Do you like my megalithic Rock?Embed
