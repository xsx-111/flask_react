Something Wicked LyricsWhere the ancient oak leaf clusters grew, the death's-head hawkmoth flew
Something wicked this way comes
The swallow is depicted there along your fuselage
Something wicked this way comes
I'm not waiting for you
It's breaking up and getting far away
I used to know what I wanted to say
Please remove your field grey coverall
Your works of nature are unnatural
Well the lake was clear as crystal, the best tea I ever had
Something wicked this way comes
It starts with love for foliage and ends in camouflage
Something wicked this way comes
I'm not waiting for you
It's breaking up and getting far away
I used to know what I wanted to say
Please remove your field grey coverall
Your works of nature are unnaturalEmbed
