The Lonely LyricsSince I find out that all of this
Is nothing more than emptiness
Filled with impermanence
A guided tour of your deepest fears
Designed to help you vision clear
We'll depart from here
And when the strangest feeling drifted over me
Oh we'll begin where you give in now baby dear
Thou art so misunderstood
I'll drink all day and play by night
Upon my casio, electric piano
Till in the darkness I see lights
No nor candelabra
But things from other stars
Just like Liberace
I will return to haunt you with peculiar piano riffs
So take it back, back to the start
Rip out your lily livered hearts
And hand them over in a vacuum sealed jar
I say I will not take half the risk
I will not walk half deceased
I believe bravery exists
And the strangest feeling drifted over me
Thou art so misunderstood
I'll drink all day and play by night
Upon my casio, electric piano
Till in the darkness I see lights
No nor candelabra
But things from other stars
I'll drink all day and play by night
Upon my casio, electric piano
Till in the darkness I see lights
No nor candelabra
But things from other stars
But things from other stars
But things from other starsEmbed
