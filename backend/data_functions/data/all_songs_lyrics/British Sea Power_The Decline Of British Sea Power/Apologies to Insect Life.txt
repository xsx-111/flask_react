Apologies to Insect Life LyricsOh Fyodor you are the most attractive man
Oh Fyodor-you-are-the-most-attractive-man-I-know
Your-heart-is-strong-and-has-been-bleeding-for-too-long
Oh my Lassie, it's like bad acid
It's getting nasty, she knows
Gymnastic-whores-down-on-all-fours-with-septic-pores-from-fucked-up-
Bores-I-would-like-to-give-you-more-my lassie
Oh my lassie, its like bad acid
It's getting nasty, she knows
She knows
Apologies to insect life, what I did was not very nice -Embed
