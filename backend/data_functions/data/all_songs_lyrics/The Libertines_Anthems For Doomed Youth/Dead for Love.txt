Dead for Love Lyrics
Your only rule: Stay alive
Just keep breathing, you’ll be fine
And now she’s pulling up out side
The car lights crawling across the curtain
So put the gun back on the wall
Take the suitcase from the wardrobe
And there’s a dead man on the floor
He’s not going anywhere
And you’re moving to the door

And everything he ever did
He only ever did for love
Everything he ever said
Was only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
His mind’s at ease
He sleeps in peace

Your reflection in her eyes
You just don’t recognise
And soon you’ll realize
This guy’s not going anywhere
And now he’s done this, he wants more
Race with the shadows to the door
A guy like this needs to be shun
No one was there when the devil rode out before
And everything he ever did
He only ever did for love
Everything he ever said
He only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
His mind’s at ease
He sleeps in peace

And in the shadows your will walk tall
And there you’ll stay until you fall
And when the final hour arrives
It's only lovers left alive
Wretched souls and gangsters’ molls
Beyond the valley of the dolls
Your story they will never tell
Because their lips are sealed

And everything you ever did
You only ever did for love
And everything you ever said
You only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
Your mind’s at ease
You sleep in peace
And everything you ever did
You only ever did for love
And everything you ever said
You only ever said for love
And now, now he lies dead
He’s dead for love
Your mind’s at ease
You sleep in peace
After a sleepless night the body weakens
It grows dear, not ones own, it's nobody's
Sluggish, the veins still retain the ache of arrows
One smiles to all with a seraph's ease
Lips glow softly, the shadow's were golden
Under sunken eyes
Night has set ablaze
The most radiant countenance
And dark nights renders
But one part of us dark - the eyesEmbed
