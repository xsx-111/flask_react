Belly of the Beast LyricsGit was lost in a sound like this
Oft times his mind told himself was bliss
Acousticalullaby with all hell going on inside
It was a trench-coat top hat shotgun dog down day
It was a sound a bit like this
Trashy and blue with a blaggard's hiss
Singing about gits love today
In a strung up hangdog head fuck quick buck way
Packed up and I headed East
Headed for the Belly of the Beast
But within a Bangkok's half hour
I was way laid by a lower power
It was a smacked up cracked up bone shot smacked down day
Don't know if I can go on
Making no sense in songs
Don't know if this is forever
It sometimes feels like forever
Forever and a dog down day
Git was found in a state like this
Sparked out on a hammock with a bloodied fist
His heart was broke but he got the gist
Git he can't carry on like this
It was a blackjack, paddy-whack, stick a brother in the back day
Back in London’s grey-scotch mist
Staring up at my therapist
He says pound for pound, blow for blow
You’re the most messed-up mother-fucker I know
It was a 12 step bus fare knock down daycare day
Makes no odds that you're there
Makes no odds that you care
Makes no odds any more
Forever and a dog down
Forever and a dog down day
Don't know if I can go own
Making no sense in songs
Forever and a dog down day
Is this failing?
Supposed to be plain sailing
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Glory Hallelujah day!
