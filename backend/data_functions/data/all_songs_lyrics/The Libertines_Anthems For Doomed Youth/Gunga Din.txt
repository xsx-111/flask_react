Gunga Din Lyrics
Woke up again to my chagrin
Getting sick and tired of feeling sick and tired again
I tried to write, because I got the right
To make it look as if I'm doing something with my life
Got to find a vein, it's always the same
And a drink to ease the panic and the suffering
I woke up again
Dreamt of Gunga Din

Oh, the road is long
If you stay strong
You're a better man than I
You've been beaten and flayed
Probably betrayed
You're a better man than I

Woke up again to my evil twin
The mirror is fucking ugly and I'm sick and tired of looking at him
Been up all night, I'll probably pick a fight
'Coz I can't help it, I'm bastard in the morning
So I try to write, I think I have the right
A little drink-y now and then to help me just to see the light
Just another day, it feels like nothing's changed
Oh fuck it, oh here I go again
Oh, the road is long
If you stay strong
You're a better man than I
You've been beaten and flayed
Probably betrayed
You're a better man than I

What's the point in me now?
I can't chase you nohow
Oh, leave me alone
I've got those Monday blues
Straight from Sunday blues

Oh, the road is long
If you stay strong
You're a better man than I
You've been beaten and flayed
Probably betrayed
You're a better man than I

La la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la la
La la-la la, la la-la la, la la-la la la
Oh what are you doing, you stupid fucking idiot?
Wake up!
