Love on the dole LyricsHow many cups of wine will I have consumed?
The people realise they have rolled past my tomb
We're drinking whisky in a brave new afternoon
The people realise they have rolled past my tomb
Strike a light
Raise your glasses
Drink a toast to the ruling classes
On the Albion-ay
Spew it out your soul
Love is on the dole
And there she will stay
All night long we were singing Northern songs
All night long we were singing Northern songs

Only you battered your broken nose on the grindstone
You wake a slave you squandered
So your soul is not your own
I run from the dust and gloom
With only my secrets to keep me warm
That's all I could do to keep them from you
And its all a pact we swore
Strike a light
Raise your glasses
Drink a toast to the ruling classes
With Albion-ay
Spew it out your soul
Love is on the dole
And there she will stay
All night long we were singing Northern songs
All night long we were singing Northern songs
And I love every inch of you
Yes I do love every single inch of you
But doesn't she get that warm glow inside?
Shoots up your spine and blows through your mind
Oh well, don't you tell me how blessed are the poor
You've always wanted one slice more
Than you and me
Love for today makes
My darling was a preacher on the Albion stage
She might have been a preacher in the good old days
We're drinking whisky in a brave new afternoon
Don't people realise they've rolled past my tomb
Oh well
Don't you tell me how blessed are the meek
You never turn the other cheek
Once in your life
Love is on the doleEmbed
