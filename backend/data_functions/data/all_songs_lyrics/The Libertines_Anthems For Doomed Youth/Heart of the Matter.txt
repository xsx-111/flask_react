Heart of the Matter Lyrics
No one can hold a light to your misery
You’re the number one
Being hard done
Hard done by
You’ll get by with your smile
Wicked smile and laughing at the misfortune of others
You gotta get your kicks
Kicking the pricks
Laughing as they pick up sticks
And old ladies walks on by
Trip up as they glide

With all the battering it’s taken
I’m surprised it’s still ticking
Yeah with all the battering it’s taken
I’m surprised it’s still ticking

Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter
So glum, it’s all on a platter
So what’s the matter, what’s the matter today?

I am no stranger to the coals
I carry them in my soul
They scorch my flesh and leave great holes
In the meaning of my life
But I get by, I get by
Just as crooked little smile
You’ll get by, you’ll get by
You’ll get by
With all the battering it’s taken
Well, I’m surprised that it’s still ticking
Yeah, with all the battering it has taken
I’m surprised it’s still ticking
Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter
So glum, it’s all on a platter
So what’s the matter, what’s the matter today?
Oh let’s get straight to the heart of the matter
Why so glum it’s all on the platter
What’s the matter tell me what’s the matter today?

So hold a light to my misery
But don’t send it up in flames
It’s only I who'd take the blame
But try me anyway
And you’ll get by you’ll get by
With your wicked little smile
You’ll get by, you’ll get by with your wicked little
Ohhhh

With the battering it’s taken
I’m surprised that it’s still ticking
Yeah with all the battering it’s taken
I’m surprised it’s still ticking
Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter
Oh why so glum, it’s all on a platter
Oh what’s the matter, what’s the matter today?
Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter
Why so glum, it’s all on a platter
Oh what’s the matter it's the glory hallelujah day
Straight to the heart of the matter
Why so glum, it’s all on a platter
Oh what’s the matter, what’s the matter today?
Let’s get straight!1Embed
