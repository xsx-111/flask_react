Iceman Lyrics
He was just a young boy in the city
Clouds of smoke he sought to find his dreams
Suedehead and his pipe he wove through the white city
The hows-your-father bookie's runner scene

She was just a young girl in the city
Struggling with life love and money
Weaving through the streets and looking so so pretty
The rummest sort Stockwell had ever seen
The rummest sort Stockwell had ever seen... seen

I've spent my days in the haze with the iceman
I've spent my nights wandering the wards
I've spent my days in the haze with the iceman
It means the iceman is always on call

She started work on the last day of November
Spilling drinks in a seedy cabaret show
He met her on the first day of December
Outside a a bookshop on the Charing Cross road

Those winter nights they'd walk along the river
He'd chain-smoke and she'd stare up at the sky
And say this life, this love, this river has to end
But just for now we have all the time
Just for now we have all the time... time
Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
Don't spend your nights wandering the wards
Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
Because it means nothing at all

Don't spend your days in the haze with iceman
(Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman)
Don't spend your nights wandering the wards
(Don't spend your nights wandering the wards)
Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
It means nothing at all

Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
Don't spend your nights wandering the wards
Don't spend your days in the haze with the iceman
It means nothing at all

Just for now we have all the time
Just for now we have all the timeEmbed
