Fame and Fortune Lyrics
Seeking fame and fortune
We walk the streets of London
Looking for the crossroads everywhere
Holed up in squats in theatre bars
There’s a slasher on the Holloway boulevard
Screaming: "Monkey, monkey, mon-key everywhere"

Like tin soldiers responding to the call
To Camden we will crawl
One and all
Oh down to Trash and Lordy Lord
By icons we were lured
One and all

Seeking fame and fortune
Old Nick says: ”come on then, I’ll meet you in the shadows by Rochester square”
The deal was done, the trade was rough
Doubloons down for a double bluff
Dip your quill in your bleeding heart
Sign there and there and there

Like tin soldiers responding to the call
To Camden we will crawl
One and all
Oh down to Trash and Lordy Lord
By icons we were lured
One and all
Oh, they were as boys, tell me what then did they know
What was it they learned and where did they go
Now listen to the voice of the city morning air
If you’re looking for something that’s never been there

If you’re seeking fame and fortune
Walking the streets of London
Looking for the crossroads everywhere
Hold on to your dreams, however bleak it seems
The world they may not listen, but the devil may care

Like tin soldiers responding to the call
To Camden we will crawl
One and all
Oh down to Trash and Lordy Lord
By icons we were lured
One and allEmbed
