Over It Again Lyrics
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, go
The day is to place your mind away
And the nights just do the same
I took a trip down a salty lane
Got a taxi from the pain
Do we have to go over it all again, again
Oh no
It’s a shame to sin the flame again like it’s all a big game
The fields of mud will flow in blood
Hold your bound and take your rein
Do we have to go over it all again, again
Oh no
Counting the cat gotta scratch your eyes out again
But if you want it we can all come and sit away
Yeah
Do we have to go over it all again, again
The dust gets like the old man’s line that your mind’s a fiery rage
Do we have to go over all that again, again
Oh noEmbed
