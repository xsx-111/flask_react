Barbarians Lyrics
This one's for your heart and for your mind
The melodies in 4/4 time
You get in right and it rings true
And now they're coming out in droves
Out of the burrows to the shows
There's nothing else to do

All I want is to scream out loud
And have it up with a mental crowd
Cause I believe somehow
The world's fucked but it won't get me down

Here's to the thug you can't cultivate
Working his scrubs by the prison gate
Your mum, your son in law and your lonely nights too
They boxed off your heart, you boxed out your mind
You collect your food in 4/4 time
To cope with your lonely life too
So great shakes to change the rhythm
Feed the monkey play the pipe
It's a given, it's a gibbon on your back
What will a better man do?
All I want is to scream out loud
And have it up with a mental crowd
Cause I believe, and how
All I want is to scream out loud
And have it up with a mental crowd
Cause I believe, somehow
The world's fucked but it won't get me down
I said, ah no
I said woo
And all your lonely nights too
All I want is to scream out loud
And have it up with a mental crowd
Cause I believe, and how
All I want is to scream out loud
And have it up with a mental crowd
Cause I believe, somehow
The world's fucked but it won't get me down
I said, ah no
