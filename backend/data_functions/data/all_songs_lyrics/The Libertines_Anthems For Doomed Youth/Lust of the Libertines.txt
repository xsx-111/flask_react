Lust of the Libertines LyricsLust of the libertines
Is really quite tame
While it rages, quiet night here beside you
And your lust for fame
Well fame is such a sinister game, I know...
It could all end this way then
And some things won't be the same
Are just a phase
And a name on a page
But I'll be soundly sleeping
I'll be soundly sleeping
I'll sleep right through that age
'Cause I can deal with all...
The blood on my shoes
And the holes in my soul
My spirit is tainted
All my tears are painted
Or just so long as you...
You don't forget to... oh oh oh
Cut me on the wall
By the graffiti, of all the things
I just couldn't say
Or shove me up the wall
Oh my darling
It was a kind of loving
But you've left me in the family way again
The dust on my tambourine
Really can be explained
I need to shake it more often
I need to shake away the blame
Oh well, fame is such a sinister game, I know...
The taste of goulash in your mouth
As you stumble offstage...
Forget-me-nots bloom on this day then
But they whither with age
Oh, I can deal with all...
The blood on my shoes
The holes in my soul
My spirit is tainted
My tears are painted
Just so long as you...
You don't forget to... oh oh oh
Cut me on the wall
By the graffiti, of all the things
I just couldn't say
Oh, won't you shove me up the wall?
Oh, you poor cow
It was a kind of loving
Now you've left me in the family way againEmbed
