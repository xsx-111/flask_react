Fury of Chonburi LyricsFury of Chonburi!
Fury of Chonburi!
Fury of Chonburi!
Well, everytime I see the Pigman
Taking sides to split
Riding jokes like Trojan horses
Of the Apocalypse
And I do wish him well
I got him under my spell
I think he'll do just fine
If he can toe the line
Fury, fury carry me merrily to hell
I'm Nagar in his sanctity
I'll rise from where I fell
Fury of Chonburi!
Fury of Chonburi!
Fury of Chonburi!
Yeah well, I felt I saw the Pigman
In a photofit
On a wanted poster
On the Sukhumvit
Oh no I don't know what he did man
But I stand by my brother
Oh yeah we're gonna make it big man
One way or the other
Fury, fury carry me too merrily to hell
Jiggers defying gravity the CPS as well
You see him lowering the tone
And bringing out the bone
Kathmandu's a steep old climb!
Fury, fury carry me merrily to hell
Like a much maligned deity
Or beloved I can't tell
Fury, fury carry me merrily to hell
And exorcise my soul for me
It doesn't serve me well
The time is not on my side
Time is nowhere left to hide
Fury of Chonburi!Embed
