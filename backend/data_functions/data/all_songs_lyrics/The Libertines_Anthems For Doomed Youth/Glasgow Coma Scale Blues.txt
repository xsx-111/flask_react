Glasgow Coma Scale Blues LyricsAnd I see me, oh you won't even see me
Yeah I see you, in fact I'm looking straight through you
And now you say you're going through me
Ain't bout a best friend who deceives me
But that don't mean that I can't free you
Cause I don't always wanna see you
The only thing that kept us apart
Was your cold unloving heart
Cold, cold heart
Back to A&E
What happened to the joy in the hearts of the boys
At the start of the part of the scene?
Came apart at the seems
A dream shared and pulled apart
One dream broken by two Libertines
You think it's easy?
Not with a best friend who deceives me, no
Oh it ain't so hard to bear
When he got Kathmandu hair, cunt
The only thing that kept it going on
Was lust for Schnapples, whiskey and song
How could it go wrong? Seriously
What happened to the joy in the hearts of the boys
At the start of the part of the scene?
Came apart at the seems
A dream shared and pulled apart
One dream broken by two Libertines
Can you go alone now
Can you go alone now?
What happened to the joy in the hearts of the boys
At the start of the part of the scene?
Came apart at the seems
A dream shared and pulled apart
One dream broken by two Libertines
What happened to the joy in the hearts of the boys
At the start of the part of the scene?
Came apart at the seems
A dream shared and pulled apart
One dream broken by two Libertines1Embed
