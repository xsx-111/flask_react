The 7 Deadly Sins LyricsThe seven deadly sins
We find them all burst
Where degenerate kings, pushy beggars
Fallen ladies of letters and verse
Pride, lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath and envy
It's all in a hard days work for me
And I, I pay no mind
And I pay mind
To a name that you will employ me
I despise all their kind
Job search and destroy me
Hand me my gun
My friend we'll have some fun
Shoot down the spies in the trees
And kick up the leaves
In the morning breeze
Pay no mind
And the old iron bells
Still ring in the old machine
And chain me to hell
Poison your soul as it seems to rebel
Its obscene stay home and get lean
Live in your mind but don't live in your dreams
No oh no pay no mindEmbed
