Purple LyricsThe night's a crazy shade of purple
The moon’s a strange kind of green
The gentle breeze, she starts to winding
You start to think about what you're seein'
Leaves of indigo and brown
Are dancing softly all around you
Your mind is flyin’, won't come down
Won't come down until the sun
Yellow clouds suspended over you
The dampness creeps, seeps through your mind
And then your eyes begin to mirror
The things you thought you left behind
But there ain't any time anymore
To forget what you think you forgot before
Emeralds of red, rubies of green
Candied colored flakes of orange tangerine
The sky is bleedin' and the air starts to scream
The spectrum's banding just for you
Phantasm fading into darkness
A simple eclipse of your mind
The greens and purples, they are running fast
Try to hold them, but you find that
You can't climb 'cause you’ve already d-d-d-d-owned your mind...
