Eternity in Between LyricsHourglass on its stand
Time has turned to sand
Things are moving too fast
Hard to make them last
Please don't ever go
No no no no no
Hands upon the clock
Watch them go tick tock
Ticking off my time
Going to lose my mind
Please don't ever go
No no no no no
La la la la la la laaaa
Dog howls at the moon
Screams its crazy tune
Dog is gone too soon
Gone to meet a new moon
Please don't ever go
No no no no no
La la la la la la laaaa
La la la la la la laaaa
People in the sun
Pass on everyone
Sun is never gone
Want to be a yellow sun
Please don't ever go
No no no no no
La la la la la la laaaa
La la la la la la laaaaEmbed
