Welcome to the Void LyricsCome take a bite of my gingerbread house
And let your troubles fade away
Let your mind get away from the fall
I say, welcome to the void
Did you know that Peter Pan can fly
He just pats himself with dust
I'll get you some if you’re a very good boy
And if in me you put your trust
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
I say, welcome to the void
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack jump over the candlestick
'Ouch' said Jack as he touched the lighted wick
My God you know that fire burns
Old woman she lives in a shoe
What a very funny thing
She’s really happy for today she received
Forty red, white and blue shoestrings
Beauty did kiss the Beast
And then much to her surprise
A handsome prince did then appear
And then the beast scratched out his eyes
If you're good and if you watch your ways
One day to heaven you will go
You will lose everything you've ever know before
Who cares, it's better than below
I say, welcome to the void
Pretty flowers and a bright yellow sky
Little squirrel gathering food
Picnic's over, it's time to go home
What's for dinner - squirrel stew
Did you hear about Sam's Uncle Joe
Got lots of heads upon his wall
He stands a hundred yards behind a cheaters glass
Oh he’s the bravest of them all
Fall Fall Fall...
Did you know that a good man died
Oh how terrible they say
But you know that’s just a part of life
It kind of happens every day
No!Embed
