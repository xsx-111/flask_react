Love LyricsI love you because I need
I want you to fill full my cavities
Please don't ever leave me
Till I grow tired of your (love)
I'm looking around
For someone to keep
My body and mind
Confined, contently
I'm up in the air
I really don't know where
And I kind of think
I'd like to come down (gently)
Hey you - over there
With the deep blue eyes
And the sun-ripened hair
With a head that can blow
Like a whistle high
And a mind that's as sharp
As a butcher's knife
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me there?
Quickly...
So I can crush you to me madly
Smother you with kisses
And wildly proclaim my (love)
Hey you - over there
With the deep blue eyes
And the sun-ripened hair
With a head that can blow
Like a whistle high
And a mind that's as sharp
As a butcher's knife
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me there?
Won't you take me there?
Quickly...
So I can crush you to me madly
Smother you with kisses
And wildly proclaim my (love)
I love you because I need
I want you to fill full my cavities
Please don't ever leave me
Till I grow tired of your...Embed
