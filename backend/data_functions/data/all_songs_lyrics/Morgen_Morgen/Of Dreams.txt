Of Dreams LyricsShe said I know you and I wanted her to know me
She said it's beautiful and I asked her to show me
We walked through gardens where the flowers sang in colors
We touched the things that are only sometimes touched by lovers
Candy colored beaches, glassy waters shown like prisms
Touched the sky with colors that so beautifully glistened
Magical music filled the air and we did listen
The sun shone down on her through clouds of pink and orange
La la la la la la la la la la
She moved so gracefully through silk and satin shadows
We knew of things that one can only know with eyes closed
Her hair caressed the air and made it sing
She knew of love, she knew of everything
The sun shone down on her through clouds of pink and orange
La la la la la la la la la la
She spoke in words that told of things that really matter
Be kind to rabbits and have pity on mad hatters
Her eyes possessed my sight as I sat looking at herEmbed
