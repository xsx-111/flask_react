Walk Away from Love LyricsMove along you're in my way
Made my mind up not to stay
And it don't matter what you do
I've had enough of you
You can talk about the good times
I can just remember bad times
There ain't nothing left for saying
'Cos there's no way that I'll be staying
You tell me to remember
When I told you that I'd never walk away
(Chorus)
Hey baby, don't walk away from love
Tell me baby, ain't my love enough
Listen to the things I say
And tell me why you walk away from love?
Leave you standing on your own
It's time I spent some time alone
Need a while to think it out
Not sure what it's all about
And it's no use to sit there crying
I can see you're only lying
Now I'll put the past behind me
Run some place where you can't find me
You tell me to remeber
When I told you that I'd never walk away
(Chorus repeat)
Bags are packed, I just can't wait
Gotta get out before it gets too late
I don't need you any more
Don't need your love for sure
You can talk about the good times
I can just remember bad times
There ain't nothing left for saying
There's no way that I'll be staying
You tell me to remember when I told you that I'd never walk away
(Chorus repeat)
Don't walk away from love
(Repeat to fade)Embed
