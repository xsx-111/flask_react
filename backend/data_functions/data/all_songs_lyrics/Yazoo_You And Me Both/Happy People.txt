Happy People Lyrics
Take no notice
'Cause I'm just the same
There's a thousand other faces
With the very same name
And we look like each other
And we all live together
We talk about the same things
And we never try and change things

We're the happy, happy people
Yeah, we're the happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
The happy, happy people

We never give opinions
And we never state views
After all, you can't be sure
That what we say is true
And if you want to join us
You can follow along behind us
You can talk about your visions
You can make some big decisions
We're the happy, happy people
Yeah, we're the happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
The happy, happy people

We believe in having fun
And smiling all the time
And sometimes we're on TV
If we're over sixty-nine
And when we have a raffle
Then it's just a big reshuffle
It's a democratic poll
But we're the ones who are in control

'Cause we're the happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
Yeah, we're the happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
We're the happy, happy people
Yeah, we're the happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
We're the hap-hap-happy people
The hap-hap-happy people
Yeah, we're the hap-hap-happy people
The hap-hap-happy people
We're the happy, happy people
Yeah, we're the happy, happy people
The happy, happy people
The happy, happy peopleEmbed
