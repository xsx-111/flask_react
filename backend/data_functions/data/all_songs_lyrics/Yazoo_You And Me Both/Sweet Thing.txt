Sweet Thing LyricsHey, hey, hey, sweet thing
I give in, I give in, sweet thing
I give in, submission
Don't you want to right it, fight it?
Oh no, if you don't think it's right
Can't change your mind if I talk all night
Don't you want to right it, fight it?
Oh no, 'cause nothing now
Can keep this a good thing
Hey, hey, hey, sweet thing
I give in, I give in, sweet thing
I give in, submission
Don't you want to right it, fight it?
Just go, I don't want to fight
Just take your things and say goodnight
Don't you want to right it, fight it?
Just go 'cause nothing now
Can keep this a good thing
Hey, hey, hey how could you be so unkind?
When you were lying to me all the time
You don't need me now, your life is fine
It's your day now but it's gonna be mine
Oh and what a sweet day
Hey, hey, hey submission
Don't you want to right it, fight it?
Oh no, if you don't think it's right
Can't change your mind if I talk all night
Don't you want to right it, fight it?
Oh no, 'cause nothing now
Can keep this a good thing
Hey, hey, hey how could you be so unkind?
When you were laughing to me all the time
You don't need me now, your life is fine
It's your day now but it's gonna be mine
Oh and what a sweet day, sweet thing
I give in, sweet thing, I give in, sweet thing
Submission, I give in, sweet thing
Submission, I give in, sweet thing, submissionEmbed
