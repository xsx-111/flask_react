Mr Blue Lyrics
Winter sounds the crying
Like an old man slowly dying
And the only sound:
The wind that fills the trees
Even colder comes the moon
And though it never seems too soon
A sudden stillness
As the rainfall starts to freeze

I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

A young girl, she is jaded
Bears the scars that never faded
Of the baby that was born
On Christmas Day
While the heavens sing their song
A child's life is never long
'Cause the food supplies will only last a day

I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too


Patriot emotion
Is the cause of the commotion
After all, there's really no one here to blame
Soldiers taking orders
'Cause we must defend the borders
Of our nation
And the other side's the same
I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too

I'll come to you at night
When all the world is sleeping tight
And lie beside you
Till the early morning dew
You can't hear me, you can't see
But you can feel me when you read
The folded letter
She left addressed to you

I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely too
I'm Mister Blue
I'm here to stay with you
And no matter what you do
When you're lonely, I'll be lonely tooEmbed
