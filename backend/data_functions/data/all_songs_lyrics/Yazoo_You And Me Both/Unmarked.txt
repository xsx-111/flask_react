Unmarked Lyrics
"Go and join the army"
Said the father to his son
"See the world around you, boy
And learn to use a gun"
Think you're something special
Well, we'll make you just the same
There's nothing wrong in dying
After all, it's just a game
It's just a game
Singing:

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

Read the morning paper
There's a picture of a cross
"We were proud in them days"
By the way, I think you lost
Trust me when I tell you, boy
That God is on our side
Even Jesus cheers us on
Against the other side
Against the other side
Singing:

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh


He who shouts the loudest
Is the one that's in control
We who never listen
Are the ones who pay the toll
Tell us that it's time at last
To make a final stand
I'm glad 'cause all I wanted
Was to kill another man
Just to kill another man
Singing:

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ohEmbed
