Ecstasy Lyrics
Now there just passed on another day
Where I really wanted to get away
From the problems that I built up
Can only see one way to make it stop
Unable - I'm too bound
I wanna get away from what I've found
Each day another rock upon my head
Each night I lie awake in bed

What shade of joy
Will hit me first
I hope it lasts
A burst in bliss
Pressure, pressure
Oh god no, pressure

Adorned in carnal ecstasy
A hazy focus blurs and sharpens sight
Now my senses are leading me
A mere blow of wind could turn me into light
Hands everywhere covering me
Feels so overwhelming I can't breathe
But bliss is momentary anyhow
Yet worth living for - take me now
What shade of joy
Will hit me first
I hope it lasts
A burst in bliss
Pressure, pressure
Oh god no, pressure
Can't take this pressure1Embed
