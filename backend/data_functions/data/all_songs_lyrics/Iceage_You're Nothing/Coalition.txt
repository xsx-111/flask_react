Coalition Lyrics
She gives me signals
She gives me signals
But our hearts are not the same
Wants me to take her
Wants me to take her
But blockades run through my veins

Somehow things are still not lost
But I sure feel alienated
Is their flesh disintegrated
These days I'm numb and faded
Somehow things are still not lost
But I sure feel alienated
Their flesh is disintegrated
Something denies coalition with you
Excess! (x2)

Am I supposed to
Am I supposed to
Give in to anything
The way I'm coded
The way I'm coded
Is like winter's change to spring
Somehow things are still not lost
But I sure feel alienated
Is their flesh disintegrated
These days I'm numb and faded
Somehow things are still not lost
But I sure feel alienated
Their flesh is disintegrated
Something denies coalition with you
Excess! (x4)Embed
