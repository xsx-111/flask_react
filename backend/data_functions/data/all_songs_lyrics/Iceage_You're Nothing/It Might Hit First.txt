It Might Hit First LyricsWaiting
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
Under this
There's a restless fear
A vicious change
Tomorrow's tears
A distant light
From an orchid's glow
Seems to be somewhere
Waiting for better times to arrive
Ever
Growing
Fever
Dreaming
Waiting for better times to arrive
Waiting for better times to arrive
A burning hunger
A hurting thirst
If I wait it might hit first
Waiting
Waiting
Waiting
