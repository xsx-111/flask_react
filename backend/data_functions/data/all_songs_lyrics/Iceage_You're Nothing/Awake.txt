Awake Lyrics
Awake by an ocean of memories
Its rise in me is so sudden
Forced to confront
Drowning in these impressions
It's coming back
So real, so near
So sad, nothing left

In pleasant cages
Through adolescence
We're out of time
It closes in
These walls are growing higher
And we're running out of time

It had always been there
A blessing and a curse
Certain mistrusts alludes
We are powerless

In pleasant cages
Through adolescence
We're out of time
It closes in
And these walls are growing higher
And we're running out of time
 (x2)
The fire broke out
We were running in the night
The air was thick with anguish
This is fear in all its might
Profanity they yelled
At this cry for justice
And as the walls began to crack
They launched the guns at their sons headsEmbed
