Wounded Hearts Lyrics
They ganged up upon us
Straitjackets and chains
When we appeared broken
They forced in their way
Nothing in their eyes but
Fear of something untamed

And why are we here now
Bounded comfort
We don't belong here
Nowhere to deport
And sometimes I wonder
If everything is lost
And sometimes I don't care
No tangible worth
 (x2)
It all comes down the same
In these times of distress
It all comes down the same
Wounded hearts can fight but

Oh, what a triumph
Society's rise
Modern civilization
Look at the size
I made no decision
They took it for me
A token you should cherish
It's thorns tear in skin
 (x2)
It all comes down the same
In these times of distress
It all comes down the same
Wounded hearts can fight butEmbed
