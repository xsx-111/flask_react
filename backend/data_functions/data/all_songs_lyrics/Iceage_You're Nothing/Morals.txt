Morals Lyrics
These arms they never reach far enough
These shoulders never strike wide enough
These teeth they never cut
Deep enough in my skin
To be someone like you
Unable to face basal demands
To be someone like you
Unable to carry
Life's weight

Broken promise
Where's your morals
In this cursed realm
Where hides Jesus

If I could leave my body
Then I would bleed into a lake
Dashing away
Disappear

Broken promise
Where's your morals
In this cursed realm
Where hides Jesus
Where's your morals?
Where's your morals?
Where's your morals?
Where's your morals?3Embed
