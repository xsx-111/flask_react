Burning Hand Lyrics
There's a guilt
Deep within
In divine soil
Blossomed into sins
A burning hand
Reaps foundations
A burning hand
Leads my fingers

I touch through skin
Damage everything
Misadventure
And I cut through time
Drifting in these crimes
Misadventure
Do you hear me?! (x2)

Don't come close
It's taking over
Grown in hope
Withered by trauma
A burning hand
Reaps foundations
A burning hand
Leads my fingers
I touch through skin
Damage everything
Misadventure
And I cut through time
Drifting in these crimes
Misadventure
Do you hear me?! (x4)
You hear me?! (x4)Embed
