In Haze Lyrics
Come aid your wounded limbs
I know that you're hurt
Don't hide your bleeding hands
You know it is overt
One barrier holds you back
Is that not the truth
Acknowledge and move on
This is for speed and youth

Her eyes, her face
Appears in haze
The distant hounds are calling
The sound of destruction

I'm a beaten heart
Over fields I chase
A war goes on
Over the lost grace
I'm a beaten heart
And over fields I chase
A war goes on
Over the lost grace
What might have held us back
Is now a dead soul
It is a barren shell
Who's writhing in its hole
One barrier to hold you back
Is that not the truth
Acknowledge and move on
This is for speed and youth

Her eyes, her face
Appears in haze
The distant hounds are calling
The sound of destruction

I'm a beaten heart
Over fields I chase
A war goes on
Over the lost grace
I'm a beaten heart
And over fields I chase
A war goes on
Over the lost grace
 (x2)
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
A war goes on
Over the lost graceEmbed
