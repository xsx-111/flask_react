Action Radar LyricsGive 'em what you got
Go give 'em all your action baby (2x)
Give 'em what you got
Go give 'em all your action Lil baby, my baby
I don't see down that radar but I don't see that i'm wrong
'cuz its a will-fire action-seeking radar baby
I don't see down that radar but I don't see that i'm wrong
'cuz you're a sure-fire action-seeking radar baby
I don't see down that radar but I don't see that i'm wrong
'cuz its a will-fire action-seeking radar baby
I don't see down that radar but I don't see that i'm wrong
'cuz you're a sure-fire action-seeking radar...
A little action is all I need (8x)
'cuz you're a sure-fire action-seeking radar baby
Go live it up, don't wanna give it up
'cuz you're a sure-fire action-seeking radar baby
Go live it up, don't wanna give it up oh
Give 'em what you got
Go give 'em all your action baby
Give 'em what you got
Go give 'em all your action Lil baby, my baby
I don't see down that radar but I don't see that i'm wrong
'cuz its a will-fire action-seeking radar baby
I don't see down that radar but I don't see that i'm wrong
'cuz you're a sure-fire action-seeking radar baby
A little action is all I need (8x)
