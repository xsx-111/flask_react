Hotride LyricsYou hear me
You hear me
You hear me
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon
Now get out
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme a ride
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme a ride
Hot ride in my air balloon
Skippin' fast right around my moon
On a bullet train outta town
Walkin' further one hill down
You hear me
You hear me
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon
Up, up and away in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon
I'll push you out
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme a ride
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme a ride
Hot ride in my air balloon
Skippin' fast right around my moon
On a bullet train outta town
Walkin' further one hill down
Hot ride in my air balloon
Skippin' fast right around my moon
Mine's right up
There's no luck when time leaves you
Hot ride in my air balloon
Skipping fast right around my moon
Time's made up
There's no luck when time leaves you
You gotta push it!
Push it!
You gotta push it!
Push it!
You gotta push it!
Push it!
You gotta push it!
My air balloon - push it!
My air balloon
You gotta push it!Embed
