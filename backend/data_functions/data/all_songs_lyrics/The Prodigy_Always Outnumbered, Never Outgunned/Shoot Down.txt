Shoot Down LyricsShoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
Shoot the gun
It’s all inside us
And also know
That I slice us
Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang
Shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
There's no fun
A sorry face
Shoot the gun
Shoot the gun to the bang, bang, bang
Too many tied to the
Too many tied to the bang, bang, bang
There's no fun
Sorry face
There's no fun
Sorry fate
Your time is running outEmbed
