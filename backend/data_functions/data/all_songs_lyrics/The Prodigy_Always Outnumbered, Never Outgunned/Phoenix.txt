Phoenix LyricsCan't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Would you believe me when I tell you
You're the king of my dreams?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Can't you hear my love buzz?
Would you believe me when I tell you
You're the king of my dreams?
You're the king of my dreamsEmbed
