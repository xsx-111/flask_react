On the Way Home (Live at Massey Hall 1971) Lyrics
When the dream came
I held my breath with my eyes closed
I went insane like a smoke ring day when the wind blows
Now, I won't be back till later on
If I do come back at all
But you know me, and I miss you now

In a strange game
I saw myself as you knew me
When the change came and you had a chance to see through me
Though the other side is just the same
You can tell my dream is real
Because I love you, can you see me now?

Though we rush ahead to save our time
We are only what we feel
And I love you
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you feel it now?
Can you?Embed
