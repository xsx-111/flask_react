Bad Fog Of Loneliness (Live At Massey Hall 1971) Lyrics
Bad fog of loneliness
Put a cloud
On my single-mindedness
I dream of sweet caress
From you

What makes tomorrow guess
What makes me take for me
And put aside the rest
I dream of sweet caress
From you
So long woman I am gone
So much pain to go through
Come back maybe I was wrong
