Down By The River (Live At Massey Hall 1971) Lyrics
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

She could drag me over the rainbow
Send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Dead

You take my hand, I'll take your hand
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today

She could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away
Down by the river
I shot my baby
Down by the river
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard for me staying here all alone
When you could be taking me for a ride

Thank you
Thank youEmbed
