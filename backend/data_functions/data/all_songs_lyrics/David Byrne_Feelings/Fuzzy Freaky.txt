Fuzzy Freaky LyricsRose is tattooed in a perfect place
She bears the burden of a pretty face
The monkey boy, the leopard girl
The strange is also beautiful
It's summer time and the grass is high
Fuzzy freaky, funny family
It's my body and I'll eat it too
To do whatever touches you
My body speaks, my tongue cannot
My belly rumbles but the words are stuck
So come out
It's summer time and the weeds are high
Fuzzy freaky, funny family
All amplified, she's scandalized
And I'm changing size
Who was it?, jump on it
He's talking trash, and he can't get back
But he's meant to last
Inspired, desired
I'm walking low, my grass has grown
And I won't stay down
Excited, delighted
I'm awfully cute, I'm awfully cold
I'm sometimes rich and I'm sometimes poor
A butterfly when I graduate
You'll have to stop me if I get too big
Stop me
It's summer time and the weeds are high
Fuzzy funny, freaky family
He's in reverse, he'll kiss himself
In perfect health
Inflated, x-rated
And I smell you now
In a haunted house
In a squeaky sound
Inspired, desired
Now I'm wide enough
And I'm almost grown
And I won't stay down
Somebody, somebody
Inspired, desired
Excited, delightedEmbed
