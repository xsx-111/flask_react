Amnesia LyricsPeace on earth, soon we will be
Where nothing worries us
Lazy days, cool is the breeze
Across the universe
Armies of soldiers are sleeping tonight
And moonlight is kissing their eyes
When you awake, you will be free
I'll be your lullaby
Alcohol, no need to feel
Rest in these fuzzy arms
Ease on down, amnesia
Baby's on Valium
Keep us from danger and safe from all harm
From the wind, and the rain, and the fire
When you awake, you will be free
I'll be your lullaby
When you awake, you will be free
And then I'll be your lullabyEmbed
