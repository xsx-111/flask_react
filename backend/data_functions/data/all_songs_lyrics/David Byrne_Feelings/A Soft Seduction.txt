A Soft Seduction LyricsThe words of love are not enough
Though sweet as wine, as thick as blood
Passionless moments and we are homeless
Out on the street
But life is cool and things aren't bad
Got what he wants, lost what he had
He's soon adjusted and got accustomed to these new ways
Blame God, how can you loose
Singing such sweet rhythm and blues
Strange days, she said to me
Being in love don't mean you're free
But night reveals what daytime hides
Who lingers on, who sleeps outside
The soft seduction, the strong attraction
Somewhere downtown
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
The laws of chance strange as it seems
Take us exactly where we most likely need to be
A junkie's song, a dancer's knees
The laws of chance strange as it seems
Take us exactly where we most likely need to beEmbed
