The Civil Wars LyricsI got a right to be out on my mind
I got a right to be who I am
Love me, love my problems
The good times and the rotten
The war is in me, the war is in you
The war is in everybody now
Shake this tone, out of control
They are fightin' with knives and forks
Demonstrating how democracy works
God's good and God is great
So I wear my happy face
The war is in you, the war is in me
The war is in everybody now
The wolf is loose, he's living in you
There'll be a celebration
Johnny comes marching home
His eyes are on the ceiling
It ain't no fashion show
A heavy situation
Does things to your skin
Although it ain't no party
Dying to get in
Sex is something if it's looking good
A ceasefire in the neighbourhood
We bleed and stain the carpet
We start our own republic
The war is in me, the war is in you
The war is in everybody now
The greatest look
In heaven above
There'll be a celebration
Johnny comes marching home
His eyes are on the ceiling
It ain't no fashion show
A heavy situation
Does things to your skin
Although it ain't no party
Dying to get inEmbed
