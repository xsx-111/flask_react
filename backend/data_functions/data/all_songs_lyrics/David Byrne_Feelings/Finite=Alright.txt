Finite=Alright LyricsThree-hundred-fifty cities in the world
Just thirty teeth inside of our heads
These are the limits to our experience
It's scary but it's alright
And everything is finite
Only one record, in this whole wide world
Where Jimi Hendrix sings "House Burning Down"
Another Elvis will not come along
He got wasted but it's alright
And everything is finite
Yeah, wasted - it's alright
Everything is finite
I'm just a baby in my daddy's arms
Who will protect me from these women's charms
I'm six foot tall but I barely speak
My - mind goes crazy when the taste is sweet
Well we've known each other, eight years and twenty days
It's - terrifying, it's beautiful too
Things have an end
But feeling is infinite
We're changing but it's alright
And everything is finite
Yeah, changing's alright
Things finiteEmbed
