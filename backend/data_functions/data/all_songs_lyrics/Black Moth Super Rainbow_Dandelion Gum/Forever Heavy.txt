Forever Heavy Lyrics
In a field forever
In the sun you're heavy
Chewing gum, forever
In a field, na-na na-na na-na

Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field

Living in a field, you are forever heavy
Lying in the sun, you are forever heavy
Chewing all the gum, you are forever heavy
Lying in a field, oh-oh-oh

In a field forever
In the sun you're heavy
Chewing gum, forever
In a field, na-na na-na na-na

Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Chewing on bubble gum, living in a field
Living in a field, you are forever heavy
Lying in the sun, you are forever heavy
Chewing all the gum, you are forever heavy
Lying in a field, oh-oh-ohEmbed
