When the Sun Grows on Your Tongue LyricsWhen the sun grows on your tongue you won't want to stop him
You're gonna die, we're all gonna die, we won't want to stop him
When the sun grows on your tongue you won't want to stop him
You're gonna die, we're all gonna die, we won't want to stop him
When the sun grows on your tongue you won't want to stop him
You're gonna die, we're all gonna die, we won't want to stop him
When the sun grows on your tongue you won't want to stop him
You're gonna die, we're all gonna die, we won't want to stop himEmbed
