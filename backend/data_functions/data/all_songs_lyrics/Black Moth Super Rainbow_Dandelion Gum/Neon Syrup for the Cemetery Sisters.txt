Neon Syrup for the Cemetery Sisters LyricsI love the sunlight, you love the flowers
I miss the sunlight, you are my flower
Your days are now gone, we're moving too slow
I can't feel the days, you're melting away
The days that are gone have moved too slow
I can't feel the days, you're melting away
I love the sunlight, you love the flowers
I miss the sunlight, you are my flower
Your days are now gone, we're moving too slow
I can't feel the days, you're melting away
The days that are gone have moved too slow
I can't feel the days, you're melting awayEmbed
