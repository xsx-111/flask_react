Sun Lips LyricsI'd love to be with you
And the sun will rise, the sun will rise
I love to be with you
And the sun will rise, the sun will rise
I'd love to be with you
And the sun will rise, the sun will rise
We wait in summertime
We miss you in summertime
We wait in summertime
We miss you in summertime
I'd love to be with you
And the sun will rise, the sun will rise
I love to be with you
And the sun will rise, the sun will rise
I'd love to be with you
And the sun will rise, the sun will rise
We wait in summertime
We miss you in summertime
We wait in summertime
We miss you in summertime1Embed
