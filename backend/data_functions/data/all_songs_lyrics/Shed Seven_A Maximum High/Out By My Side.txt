Out By My Side LyricsWhen will you come outside?
Where do you think you can hide?
And when the Sun turns to night
You keep your curtains shut tight
Where is the trust in yourself?
I don't have claims on your wealth anymore
How can you stay locked inside?
You should be out by my side
How do you think you'll survive?
When will you learn you're alive?
And when the wind blows your mine
I've made your door my shrine
Where is the trust in yourself?
I don't have claims on your wealth anymore
How can you stay locked inside?
You should be out by my side
How can you stay locked inside?
You should be out by my side
How can you stay locked inside?
You should be out as my brideEmbed
