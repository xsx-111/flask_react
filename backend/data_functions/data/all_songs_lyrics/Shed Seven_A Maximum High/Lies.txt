Lies LyricsI know tomorrow won't be the same
I've seen the future and I saw who's to blame
Left nothing here for me
I've seen the future but I can't see you
I've seen through
Everything that you said I could say you're liar
(lies and lies and lies...)
Everything that you do I could say you could try
A little bit more
Every day will be like the last
Who are you to think it will pass?
Take care of everything
I've seen the future but I can't see you
I've seen through
Everything that you said I could say you're liar
(lies and lies and lies...)
Everything that you do I could say you could try
A little bit more
She's been lying and now you're trying but you're gonna find no way out tonight
She's been lying and now you're crying but you're gonna find no way out tonight
I've got this feeling
That it won't last long
She's been lying and now you're trying but you're gonna find no way out tonight
She's been lying and now you're crying but you're gonna find no way out tonight
I've got this feeling
That it won't last long
I've got this feeling
I've got this feeling
I've got this feelingEmbed
