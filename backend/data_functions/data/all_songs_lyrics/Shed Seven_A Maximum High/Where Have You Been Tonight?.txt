Where Have You Been Tonight? Lyrics
There is nothing to do
And nowhere to go when you need to
I took to you
I took to you from you I drew
Nothing but a lonely smile

I wanna go out in the sun
But there isn't any sun
And I want the sun
I wanna change the way I look
Because I haven't any luck
And my brain is tired

Where have you been
If you hold me back I'll kick you in the shins
Until your night's on fire
It's good to be alive
Where have you been tonight
With the last cries of life
Yes we'll see
There is nothing to prove
Because no one can lose
But you will do
I took to you
I took to you from you I drew
Nothing but a lonely smile

I wanna go out in the sun
But there isn't any sun
And I want the sun
I wanna change the way I look
Because i haven't any luck
And my brain is tired

What have you seen
If you stop me now
I'll push until you scream
Until the night's on fire
It's good to be alive

Where have you been tonight
With the last cries of life
Yes, you'll soon feel the knife
With the last cries of life
Yes, we'll see
Where have you been tonight
With the last cries of life
Yes, you'll soon feel the knife
With the last cries of life
Yes, we'll see
Yes, we'll seeEmbed
