Magic Streets LyricsWe went to the darkest side of town
Where all the ladies hang around
And all the loving can be found... In town
We went to the Early Learning Centre
With the money that I'd lent ya
It's the price of an education
Won't you spur me on
To find a place to meet
And I'll hit you with the words
I've been down magic streets
'Cause I'm as big as the universe
Will you have another one in there
And toast the fact that I'm so rare
And boast the fact how I don't care
Because I'm there
So put your anorak on
And go out and find yourself some fun
It's the price of an education
Won't you spur me on
To find a place to meet
And I'll hit you with the words
I've been down magic streets
'Cause I'm as big as the universe
This could never last forever
'Cause you kept this one's left in bits
And all your magic tricks
Are magic
So put your hooded cloak on
And go out and find yourself some fun
Won't you spur me on
To find a place to meet
And I'll hit you with the words
I've been down magic streets
'Cause I'm as big as the universe
This could never last forever
'Cause you kept this one's left in bits
And all your magic tricks
And magic streets are paved with people
And you're just another oneEmbed
