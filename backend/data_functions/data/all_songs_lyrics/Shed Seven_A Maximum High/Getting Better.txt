Getting Better LyricsYou are my guiding light
And you're shining brighter
You shine like Tokyo
It's getting better all the time
And the hills are alive
With the sound of music
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
I've got my wings and I can fly
I will fly to you
You are my one ambition
Show me your recognition
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better
A nod's as good a wink
No matter what you're thinking
You are the missing link
It's getting better all the time
And the streets are alive
With the sound of music
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
I've got my wings and I can fly
I will fly to you
You are my one ambition
Show me your recognition
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better
I could take you to work
And show you some of my perks
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
I've got my wings and I can fly
I will fly to you
You are my one ambition
Show me your recognition
It's getting better all the time
It's getting betterEmbed
