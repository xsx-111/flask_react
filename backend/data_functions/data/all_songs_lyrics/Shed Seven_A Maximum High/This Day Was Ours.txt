This Day Was Ours LyricsThis day was ours
But you stay for hours everytime
But you won't be mine
It must be good in hollywood
You laugh, you walk, you scream
You're in the dark all the time
Can I say you're in your prime?
Now I will sing
Of that I must be king
I'm in the dark all the time
Of that I must be king
You're in demand
I've got plans to make you understand
But you won't be mine
I could trace the very place
You were before
And where you will next be
You mean the world to me
Now I will sing
Of that I must be king
I'm in the dark all the time
Of that I must be king
Now we can fly away
The stars are burning bright in the night
This day was ours
You've got powers of a different kind
Can I say you're in your prime?
Now I will sing
Of that I must be king
I'm in the dark all the time
Of that I must be king
Now we can fly away
The stars are burning bright in the night
Of that I must be king
We're in the dark all the time
We're in the dark all the time
This day was oursEmbed
