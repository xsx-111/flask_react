Parallel Lines LyricsSuck on this
Dropping the bits
Topping the hits
I've walked miles to be with you
Listen to me
On my hands and knees
Feeding my greed
And all the while I think it's true
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
The mirror is long
It's a way to belong
And it's keeping me strong
And all the style is showing through
It's one day of trust
Three years of lust
And it's my life or bust
And do you feel the same things too?
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
You're my queen
And you're my machine
A fine dream team
I'm feeling bright, I feel all new
Yes, that was a joke
Everytime that you spoke
Until you finally choked
And I'll be ruling my own roost
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
I could fax you at work
And pick you up in my Merc'
And dig deep in your dirt
It's the in thing to do
So suck on this
And I'm making my lists
And I'm topping the
Hits I've walked miles to be with you!
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
Shaking off me
Too high
You're a millionaire
And you've been everywhere
And you've done every dare
Can you see my point of view?
And it's looks like you know
Where you're going to go
Where you blow all your dough
And all the while I think it's true
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
Shaking off me
It's my whirlwind
And it's my last fling
It's the devil in me
And I won't set it free
'Cause it's locked in me
And all the style is showing through
It's my honeymoon
I'll take it this afternoon
Egg and spoon to the moon
I'm feeling bright, I feel all new
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
Shaking off me
It's my whirlwind
And it's my last fling
Shaking off me
Now I know it's time for a maximum high
Shaking off me
It's a maximum high
With my parallel lines
Shaking off me
It's my whirlwind
And it's my last fling
Shaking off me
Now I know it's time for a maximum high
Shaking off me
Getting better, getting better, getting better
Getting better, getting better, getting better
Getting better, getting better, getting better
Getting better, getting better, getting better
Getting better, getting better, getting betterEmbed
