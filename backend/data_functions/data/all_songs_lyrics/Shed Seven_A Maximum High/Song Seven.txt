Song Seven LyricsAre you going to watch me?
I'm going to jump off the bridge
Are you going to follow me?
Are you coming to watch?
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Are you coming out tonight?
Are you watching me tonight?
Are you coming out tonight?
Are you going to drown me
If I don't jump after you?
Are you going to follow me?
Are you coming to jump?
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Are you coming out tonight?
Are you watching me tonight?
Are you coming out tonight?
You told me you didn't want to jump
But now you've got no choice
Follow me, follow me
Follow me, follow me
Are you coming out tonight?
Are you watching me tonight?
Are you coming out tonight?
Are you coming out tonight?
Are you watching me tonight?
Are you coming out tonight?Embed
