Falling From The Sky LyricsI can't speak
When I need to tell you how it feels
I get weak
When I try to start the day without the rain
Its no fun
When I try to offer you the sun
Its too high
Will you try to shake your pride
Or stay inside and hide
Can you feel it falling with the rain
You see trough diamond in your eyes
Falling from the skies
You walk on water every time
Falling from the sky
I need sleep
But I try to keep my self on my feet
And that's sweet
Could you try to lose your self in someone else
Its no fun
When I try to offer you the sun
When I'm weird
Will you try to shake your pride
Or stay inside and hide
Can you feel it falling with the rain
You see trough diamond in your eyes
Falling from the skies
You walk on water every time
Falling from the sky
Falling from the sky
Can you feel it falling with the rain
You see trough diamond in your eyes
Falling from the skies
You walk on water every time
Falling from the sky
Can you feel it falling with the rain
You see trough diamond in your eyes
Falling from the skies
You walk on water every time
Falling from the sky
You paid in beauty every time
Falling from the sky
Falling from the sky
The skies
Theeee
TheeeeeeEmbed
