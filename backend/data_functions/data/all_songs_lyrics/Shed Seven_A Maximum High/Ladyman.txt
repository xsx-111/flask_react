Ladyman LyricsI'm a lady, I'm a man
Try to do the best I possibly
Can you feel it? Feel alive
Never had a feeling in my life
Until tomorrow
I'm afraid you're wasting your time
I'm afraid you're wasting your time
Should you prove to yourself
That you're nobody else?
It throws me every time
Lay me aside, I'd die for my pride
My bones are buried alive
I'm amazing, I can breathe
Try to find out more but I can't
Read the answers
Re-write my life
Until tomorrow
I'm afraid you're wasting your time
I'm afraid you're wasting your time
Should you prove to yourself
That you're nobody else?
It throws me every time
Lay me aside, I'd die for my pride
My bones are buried alive
My heart is broken glass
In a plaster cast
It throws me every time
I've found my place at last
Behind this mask
But I'm afraid you're wasting your time
Should you prove to yourself
That you're nobody else?
It throws me every time
Lay me aside, I'd die for my pride
My bones are buried alive
My heart is broken glass
In a plaster cast
It throws me every time
I've found my place at last
Behind this mask
But I'm afraid you're wasting your timeEmbed
