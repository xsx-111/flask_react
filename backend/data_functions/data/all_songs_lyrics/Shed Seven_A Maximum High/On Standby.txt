On Standby LyricsWould you stay here on standby
Because I need another alibi
In the wrong place at the wrong time
Could you talk a fine line
I need to know that I'll be fine
Bulletproof
It's like I've never been born
We conceive in the alleyways
It's like I've never been born
We believe in other ways
That you do and you did
And there's proof that we did wrong tonight
Could you sense a tragedy
Because I saw it on the BBC
There's a panel on that channel
Could you walk a narrow line
I need to know I'll serve my time
With some use
It's like I've never been born
We conceive in the alleyways
It's like I've never been born
We believe in other ways
That you do and you did
And there's proof that we did wrong tonight
And tonight you can cry if you want to
But it won't help you
You can cry if you want to
But it won't help you
To get you through this crime
It will plague you standby
It's like I've never been born
We conceive in the alleyways
It's like I've never been born
We believe in other ways
That you do and you did
And there's proof that we did wrong tonight
We did wrong
We did wrongEmbed
