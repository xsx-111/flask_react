Bad Ambassador LyricsI wanna chill, I wanna sit real still
I wanna sleep like the dead on a bed of roses
Me and my lovely wife
We're in the prime of life
I wanna feel real, I wanna free-wheel
I wanna steal the show from under their noses
I wanna get you off
Ain't that enough?
I'm gonna abseil down my ivory tower
And buy myself a Jaguar
I'm a bad ambassador
For that elusive place you're searching for
I wanna show you so much more
But maybe some other time
I wanna play with the big boys
I wanna ride with the tough guys on a Japanese motorbike
I wanna hold your hand
Hey, what's your favourite band?
I wanna look like they looked
I wanna shake like they shook, I wanna take what they took
I wanna get you high
Don't ask me why
It's just something I've got to do
I'll try to make it up to you
I'm a bad ambassador
For that elusive place you're searching for
I wanna show you so much more
But maybe some other time
I'm not the Pope and I don't wanna be
The Archbishop of Canterbury
I'm a bad ambassador
For that elusive place you're searching for
I wanna show you so much more
Yeah I could show you so much more
But I'm a bad ambassador
Well, maybe some other time...Embed
