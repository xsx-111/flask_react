Soul Trader LyricsSoul trader, you trade in souls
Evading tax and tolls
And we just can’t say no
Oh no
Ring master in the circus of charm
You’ve got to have her on your arm
And she just can’t say no
Oh no
Make it up to the man upstairs
I’m sure he’ll understand
Well, he’s probably your biggest fan
Soul trader, you trade in souls
With no restrictions and no controls
And we just can’t say no
Oh no
When you get where you’re going to
Write a postcard home
’Cause I don’t believe you even know
Where you’re going
Soul trader, you trade in souls
With no restriction and no controls
And we just can’t say no
No, no, no
We’ll never tell you noEmbed
