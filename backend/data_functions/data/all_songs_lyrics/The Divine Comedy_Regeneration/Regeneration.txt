Regeneration LyricsOld worlds seen through new eyes
Just you and I and the sheltering sky
The battle is over but the war's not yet won
It's only just begun
We'll walk the razor's edge
The highest ledge of the worlds highest window
The first lap is finished but the race isn't run
It's only just begun
Where will we run to?
Where will we hide?
Where will we rest our heads tonight?
Where is the party?
And who will be there?
Angels or devils, we don't care
We don't care
New forms - new formulae
X plus Y equals new life
They'll tell you it's over, just tell them they're wrong
'Cause it's only just...
It's only just begunEmbed
