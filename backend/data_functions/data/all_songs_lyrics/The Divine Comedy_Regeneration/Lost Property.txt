Lost Property LyricsPostcards and letters, T-shirts and sweaters
Passports and Parkas, mobiles and chargers
Two tennis rackets, Blue Rizla packets
A new sheep-skin jacket, I lost it all
All through my life there have been
Many rare and precious things
I have tried to call mine
But I just cannot seem
To keep hold of anything
For more than a short time
Possessions of a sentimental kind
They were mine, now they're not
Gym-kits and trainers, asthma inhalers (Lost, blown like seeds on the wind)
Silk-cuts and Bennies, ten-packs and twenties (Everything lost, tossed like ships on the ocean)
C-class narcotics, antibiotics (And dashed on the rocks,  hiding just out of reach)
The holes in my pockets, I lost it all (Waiting for me)
All that I'd like is to know
Just where do those lost things go?
When they slip from my hands
Then one night in a dream
I passed through a sheepskin screen
To a green and pleasant land
I found them all piled up into the sky
And I cried tears of joyEmbed
