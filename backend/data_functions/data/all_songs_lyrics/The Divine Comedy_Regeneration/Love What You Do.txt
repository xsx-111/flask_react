Love What You Do LyricsLiving isn't easy
No need to make it harder
Stretch yourself until you snap
Ditch your superstitions
Lose your inhibitions
Tell them you're not coming back
If you want it, you can have it
If you need it, go and get it
Whatever it is you've got to love it
Everybody's running
Round and round in circles
What is it they're trying to prove?
Exercise your freedom
Exorcise those demons
You have got to love what you do
If you want it, you can have it
If you need it, go and get it
Whatever it is you've got to love itEmbed
