Note to Self LyricsMonday, restate my assumptions
Heaven and hell do not exist
Tuesday, restate my assumptions
If you die you do so at your own risk
Into the heart of darkness
Beyond the point of no return
Wednesday, restate my assumptions
Beauty is not the same thing as youth
Thursday, restate my assumptions
Only one thing beautiful that's the truth
Into the heart of darkness
Beyond the point of no return
What the fuck is happening?
Where has everybody gone?
What the hell is going on?
There is nothing as frightening as being alone
Friday, restate my assumptions
The writer writes for himself, not for you
Saturday, restate my assumptions
A song is not a song until it's listened toEmbed
