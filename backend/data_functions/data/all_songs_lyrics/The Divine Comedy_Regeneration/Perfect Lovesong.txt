Perfect Lovesong LyricsGive me your love
And I'll give you the perfect lovesong
With a divine Beatles bassline
And a big old Beach Boys sound
I'll match you pound for pound
Like heavy-weights in the final round
We'll hold on to each other
So we don't fall down
Give me a wink
And I'll give you what I think you're after
With just one kiss I will whisk you away
To where angels often tread
We'll paint this planet red
We'll stumble back to our hotel bed
And make love to each other
'Til we're half dead
Maybe now you can see
Just what you mean to me
Give me your love
And I'll give you the perfect lovesong
Give me your word
That you'll be true to me always come what may
Forever and a day
No matter what other people may say
We'll hold on to each other
'Til we're old and greyEmbed
