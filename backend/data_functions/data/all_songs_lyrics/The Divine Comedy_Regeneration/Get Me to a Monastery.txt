Get Me to a Monastery LyricsGet
Get me to a monastery
‘Cause if this is what it means to be free
Then I don’t need it
Get
Get me to the church on time
‘Cause I’ve had enough of secular life
You can keep it
I wanna get up at the crack of dawn
And not speak to anyone
Just eat, sleep and meditate on
What we mean by God
Drop
Drop me in the wilderness
‘Cause I’d rather starve than live in a mess
That you call progress
Lock
Lock me in a padded cell
‘Cause I suddenly don’t feel very well
It all seems pointless
I wanna get up at the crack of dawn
And not speak to anyone
Just eat, sleep and meditate on
What we mean by God
Let
Let the people choose
Well, it’s heads you win and heads you lose
It’s your call now
So get
Get me to a monastery
‘Cause you’ve shown me things I don’t wanna see
And I’ve seen it all now
I’ve seen it all now
And I wanna get up at the crack of dawn
And not speak to anyone
Just eat, sleep and meditate on
What we mean by God
By God
By God
By God
