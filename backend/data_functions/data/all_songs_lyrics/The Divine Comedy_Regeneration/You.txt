You LyricsIf you’re wondering why the grass is green and the sky is blue
It’s you
If you’re wondering why the world is round and the planets too
It’s you
If you’re wondering why one plus one always makes two
It’s you, it’s you, it’s you
It’s you
You’re the reason why
I do what I do
I say what I say
I live and I die
You’re the reason why
Baby
If you’re wondering what the answer is to the question ‘who’?
It’s you
If you’re wondering why this tired old world sometimes feels brand new
It’s you
If you’re wondering why it feels as though we’re the chosen few
Well, it’s you
It’s you
You’re the reason why
I do what I do
I say what I say
I live and I die
You’re the reason why
And I wouldn’t be
Much of anything
If it weren’t for you
You complete my life
You’re my reason why
Baby
If you’re wondering why I still believe dreams can come true
Well, it’s you
If you’re wondering how I know these things
Baby I just do, I just do
It’s you
And you’re the reason why
I do what I do
I say what I say
I live and I die
You’re the reason why
And I wouldn’t be
Much of anything
If it weren’t for you
You complete my life
You’re my reason why
