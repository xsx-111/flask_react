Eye of the Needle LyricsThey say that, "You'll hear him if you're really listening"
And pray for that feeling of grace
But that's what I'm doing, why doesn't he answer?
I've prayed, 'til I'm blue in the face
The cars in the churchyard are shiny and German
Distinctly at odds with the theme of the sermon
And during communion, I study the people
Threading themselves through the eye of the needle
I know that it's wrong for the faithful to seek it
But sometimes I long for a sign, anything
Something to wake up the whole congregation
And finally make up my mind
The cars in the churchyard are shiny and German
Completely at odds with the theme of the sermon
And all through communion, I stare at the people
Squeezing themselves through the eye of the needleEmbed
