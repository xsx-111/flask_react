Funeral Fog LyricsEvery time this year
This dark fog will appear
Up from the tombs it comes
To take one more life that can be near
In the middle of Transylvania
All natural life has for a long time ago gone
It's thin and so beautiful
But also so dark and mysterious
Once again the priest is missing
May the god bless us all
The fog is here again
That will complete this funeral
From a place empty of life
Only dead trees are growing here
As it comes from afar
Only dead trees are growing here
Funeral fog
Funeral fog
Funeral fog
