Cursed in Eternity LyricsMy name was written with fire
In the place you only can see
When your time has come
When you walk down in the land of shadows for eternity
The demon flies in the blackened starless skies and
Crawls in the bottomless depths of Hell
The name which will be
A thousand times cursed in eternity
The demon flies in the blackened starless skies and
Crawls in the bottomless black depths of Hell
Condemned to wander, until it comes
To the cruelest snake that crawls
The demon flies in the blackened starless skies and
Crawls in the bottomless depths of Hell1Embed
