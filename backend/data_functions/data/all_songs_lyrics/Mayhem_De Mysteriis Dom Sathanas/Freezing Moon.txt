Freezing Moon Lyrics
Everything here is so cold
Everything here is so dark
I remember it as from a dream
In the corner of this time
Diabolic shapes float by
Out from the dark
I remember it was here I died
By following the freezing moon

Night again
Night you beautiful
I please my hunger
On living humans
Night of hunger
Follow its call
Follow the freezing moon

Darkness is growing
Eternity opens
The cemetery lights up again
As in ancient times
Fallen souls die behind my steps
By following the freezing moon19Embed
