Buried by Time and Dust LyricsVisions of that no mornings
Light ever will come
I'm too old now
The dark is so near
Will I ever reach the land beyond
This is where we go when we have to die
I've been old since the birth of time
Time buried me in earth
Centuries ago I tasted blood
Buried by time and dust
Many years have passed since the funeral
Missing the blood of human throats
So many years, ages ago
I must await, feel my body's stench
Wandering out of space
Wandering out of time
A world out of light, death at the end
Only silence can be heard
Silence of peoples tears
No one knows my grave
Buried by time and dust1Embed
