Pagan Fears LyricsThe bloody history from the past
Deceased humans now forgotten
An age of legends and fear
A time now so distant
Less numbered as they were their lives
So primitive and pagan
Superstitions were a part of the life
So unprotected in the dark nights
Pagan fears
The past is alive
The past is alive
Woeful people with pale faces
Staring obsessed at the moon
Some memories will never go away
And they will forever be here2Embed
