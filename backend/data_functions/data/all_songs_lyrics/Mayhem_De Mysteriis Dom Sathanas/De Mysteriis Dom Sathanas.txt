De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas LyricsWelcome to the elder ruins again
The wind whispers beside the deep forest
Darkness will show us the way
The sky has darkened
Thirteen as we are
We are collected woeful around a book
Made of human flesh
Heic Noenum Pax - Here is no peace
De Grandae Vus Antiquus Mulum Tristis
Arcanas Mysteria Scriptum
The books blood written pages open
Invoco Crentus Domini De Daemonium
We follow with our white eyes
The ceremonial proceeding
Rex Sacriticulus Mortifer
In the circle of stone coffins
We are standing with our black robes on
Holding the bowl with unholy water
Heic Noenum Pax - Bring us the goat
Psychomantum Et Precr Exito Annos Major
Ferus Netandus Sacerdos Magus
Mortem Animalium1Embed
