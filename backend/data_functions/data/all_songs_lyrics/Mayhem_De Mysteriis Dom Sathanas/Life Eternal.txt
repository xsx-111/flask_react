Life Eternal Lyrics
A dream of another existence, you wish to die
A dream of another world, you pray for death

To release the soul, one must die
To find peace inside, you must get eternal

I am a mortal, but am I human?
How beautiful life is now when my time has come
A human destiny, but nothing human inside
What will be left of me when I'm dead? There was nothing when I lived
What you found was eternal death, no one will ever miss you1Embed
