Kill for Love Lyrics
Everybody’s got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards
I drank the water and I felt alright
I took a pill almost every night
In my mind I was waiting for change
While the world just stayed the same
Everybody’s got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards

I can’t remember if I like what I said
I can’t remember it went straight to my head
I kept a bottle by the foot of the bed
I put a pillow right on top of my head
But I killed for love

Everybody’s got a secret to hide
Everyone is slipping backwards
You say you see it almost every time
A little number counting back to nine
I can’t remember if I like what I said
I can’t remember it went straight to my head
But I killed for love7Embed
