Candy LyricsCandy
Please don't let them in your heart
Because they'll try to put out every fire you start
Candy
You can light the match again
And as they try to run and hide
We'll burn down everything in sight
Oh, candy
Your touch is like a veil over my eyes
And when we're driving in your car
I could be anyone tonight
Oh, candy
Please don't let them in your heart
Because they'll try to steal that flame from in your eyes
Oh, candy
Oh, candyEmbed
