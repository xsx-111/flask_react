Birds of Paradise LyricsBaby, when I first saw you
I knew you held the keys to my heart
And in the setting sun we flew away
To a broken kind of paradise
Where time would stand still
You are the black sky
Always running from the sun
Paralyzed, I dug a well deep inside
I kissed the tide
You held the moon
And carried the stars
Like life was a memory
And death just a possibility
You are the black sky
Always running from the sun
You're always running from the sunEmbed
