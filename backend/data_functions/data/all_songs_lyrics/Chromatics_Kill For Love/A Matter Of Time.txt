A Matter Of Time LyricsBaby
You're crying yourself to sleep again
Baby
How could they do this to you
Baby
It's all over your face tonight
Baby
It's just a matter of time
Baby
Cry yourself to sleep again
Baby
You give it all away
Maybe
This is the way it ends tonight
Baby
We all cry alone
Baby
Cry yourself to sleep again
Baby
The past is your only friend tonight
Maybe
Your life is only a dream tonight
Baby
We all cry aloneEmbed
