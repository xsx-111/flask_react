Lady LyricsIf I could only call you my lady
Baby, I could be your man
If I could only call you my lady
Baby, I could be your man
Baby, I could be your man
Baby, I could be your man
If I could only call you my lady
Baby, I could be your man
Baby, I just want you to come back
And give us all something to do
Baby, I just want you to come back
And give us all something to do
Give us all something to do
Give us all something to do
Baby, I just want you to come back
We really need something to do
I was always looking for lady
Baby, you're so far away
I was always looking for lady
Baby, you're so far away
Baby, you're so far away
Baby, you're so far away
I was always looking for lady
Baby, you're so far awayEmbed
