Into the Black Lyrics
My, my, hey, hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
It's better to burn out, than to fade away
My, my, hey, hey

Out of the blue, into the black
They give you this but you pay for that
Once you're gone you can never come back
When you're out of the blue, into the black


The King is gone but he's not forgotten
This is the story of Johnny Rotten
It's better to burn out than it is to rust
The King is gone but he's not forgotten

Hey, hey, my, my
Rock and Roll can never die
There's more to the picture, than meets the eye
Hey, hey, my, my12Embed
