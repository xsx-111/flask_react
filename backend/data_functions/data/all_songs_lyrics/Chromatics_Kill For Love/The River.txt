The River Lyrics
I watch the moon hang in the sky
I feel the traffic rushing by
Freight train engine in the night
I'm still here, waiting for you

I watch the moon hang in the air
I feel the cold breeze in my hair
My eyes blind by headlights' glare
I'm still here, waiting for you

I take the night train to sky
Rising up, I close my eyes
The ground beneath me, dead and dry
I'm still here, waiting for you

But I won't cry another tear
For all the pain we saw last year
The river thirsts for those who fear
And I'm still here, waiting for you

We once walked these streets
In search of the unthinkable
We tried to be invisible
It only made us miserable

I once lost it all
In a game that can't be won
I took a chance and had to run
The river was the only one

Will you leave it all behind?
Water rushing through your mind
The river's thirst is so unkind
But I'm still here, waiting for youEmbed
