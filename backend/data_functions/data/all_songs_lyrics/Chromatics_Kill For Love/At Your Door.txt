At Your Door Lyrics
I don't know why
I knocked at your door
I don't know why
But I can't wait anymore
It's like we're all frozen now
Just like ice in a glass
I didn't come here for answers
I just needed a laugh

When you look deep inside yourself
Well tell me, what do you see?
Confusion of time again
Or someplace frozen with me?

You know life never turns out
The way we all plan
But the door is still open
So give me your hand
Give me your hand
Give me your hand

Time is stretching on
And it keeps on repeating
As the beat goes on
Our dreams have all vanished now
We really thought we could win
But the door is still open
So come on in
And give me your hand
Give me your hand
Give me your hand
Give me your handEmbed
