Weightlifters Lyrics
Back when I had time to dream
I dreamed of ordinary faces
Frozen unexpressed emotions
Trapped inside the wax museum
And what my mind had been curating
Scandalized my sense of station
My face burned red, then I woke up feeling like shit
When I saw my ordinary face
I should start lifting weights

Put your heart on the target
They expect you to scream
Music blasts through the market
It's the sound of machines
Of quarters crushed into pennies
One thought turned into many
My resistance is crushed
I'm just here to buy some tangerines
And maybe grapes without seeds

'Cause I believe
That thoughts can change your body
It's all on me
If thoughts can change your body
I believe
Thoughts can change my body
It dawned on me
Your body can change your mind
And maybe if I keep my mouth shut
God will answer all my prayers
Let my secret vision sprawl
Declassified and mine to share
And then I'd put my arms around you
And say, "Thank God that I've found you"
I kept my mouth shut
And hoped that this would happen to me

I see the patterns in things
I never knew this was a part of me
A wolf sings in the choir
I feel the tension
I'm afraid it will break
I should start lifting weights

'Cause I believe
That thoughts can change your body
It's all on me
If thoughts can change your body
I believe
That thoughts can change my body
It dawned on me
Your body can change your mindEmbed
