Deadlines (Hostile) Lyrics
I never see the threat too soon
The blood on the bandage, the ghost in the room
Got a canvas as white as the moon
But when I see it at night, it's a sickening blue
I was thinking people never change
But there's a new taste of dread that I cannot explain
And the thoughts that make up my life
Get reflected in others from time to time
Now I've got another question
And if we run out of time, can we make an exception?
Got a piece that needs completion
And I want to hear more from you
Here's what I'd like to do

Oh, temptation
I could be a part of you
(Can't stay connected)
Oh, completion (Can't get connected)
Come in closer, let the candle burn right through
(Can't get connected)
(Can't get connected)
If you can't get what you're after any other way

Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
Covered under your sleeve sometime
Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
I'm alright, I was really in a state tonight
I won't speak, I don't know what to say
I can see in your prayers, it's the same things we pay for
Got a currency that you accept
If you want to exchange, we can try to connect
Give me the number to your room and leave the door on the latch
There are tigers in the jungle, there's a knife in the mattress
I don't think we broke the glass, but hell if I know
I never learned to dance, what the hell do I know?

I know I won't always need you like this
I swear I'm not always falling to bits
But, but in the hallway
The moment hits and the setup clicks like a safety
Yeah, you could hear a pin drop, feel it
I feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
I feel it
You'll feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it
Feel it, feel it, feel it, two, three, four

Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like? (Can't get connected)
I was really in a state tonight (Can't stay connected)
(Can't get connected)
Am I, am I, am I, am I on your mind?
Is it, is it, is it, is it what you like?
(Can't stay connected)
I'm alright, put me up your sleeves sometime
(Can't get connected)
All the time, sometime
Other time, no time
Oh, temptation
I could take a piece from you
Oh, completion
Let it burn, let the candle burn right through2Embed
