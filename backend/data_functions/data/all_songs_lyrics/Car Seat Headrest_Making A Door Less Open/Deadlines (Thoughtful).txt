Deadlines (Thoughtful) Lyrics
I am not awake
I am not asleep
I am not so shallow
I am not that deep
Do you wanna dance?
Someone shut the door
On the losing side
Of some sort of war

He said, "I'd like to do this for a living
But I don't know how"
Wild, uncommercial
Sleeping on a leash
There was a predestined set of symbols ticking into place
A prom queen crowned in the background
Stepping out of frame
A pair of hands took me to your face
Your eyes held me

Oh, compassion
(Can't get connected)
It's transforming me into
(Can't get connected)
(Can't stay connected)
Oh, compassion
(Can't get connected)
It's transforming me into
(Can't get connected)
(Can't get connected)
No more reflection
Swearin' all I see is you
(Can't get connected)
(Can't stay connected)

Oh, compassion
It's transforming me into
(Can't get connected)
(Can't get connected)
Oh, compassion
It's transforming me into
Oh, compassion
It's transforming me into
I think I'm onto something
Oh, compassion
It's transforming me into
Shut up
Shut the fu-
Oh, compassion
It's transforming me into
Shut, shut up
