Hymn (Remix) LyricsI feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
Feel it in my heart
If I give this up, will I be saved?
Will my life be spared?
(I feel it in my heart)
What will take its place?
(Feel it in my heart)
(Feel it in my heart)
What will take its place?
(I feel it in my heart)
What will take its place?Embed
