There Must Be More Than Blood Lyrics
I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw, I saw
Saw, I saw
Saw, I saw you, I saw you

On the magazine cover, with your
Blue-white eyes
Read it from cover to cover
Looking for you
But these are not my people here
I think you know that
Nervous like a wild dog
Waiting for the attack

I was living in the delta
And wasting most of my time
You know if I could close the blinds right
I could sleep all through the night
But I've seen the tides are rising
Where once there was a shore
I can still remember houses
Stripped to the floor

There must be more than blood
That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears
When they pull back the curtain
Of this much I am certain
When you're down for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
When you're out for a while trying to get dried out
You feel the time pass by but you don't look around
You were playing your music but you got drowned out
You go back to the old house but you've been locked out
And it wasn't for love that you went back home
It was the guilt in your throat like you swallowed a bone
They had all of your life to get it right
They had all of that time just to change their minds
And you're grateful for the bus, it's a place to sit down
Like a spider in the winter trying not to be found
No use trying to heal when you're getting stepped on
No use selling your soul when you're getting passed on
How could they treat you like a forgotten card?
"Dear dad", "I'm sorry", "Thank you very much"
What difference does it make when they throw you away?
Is anybody ever gonna hear what you had to say?

I was flying on a red-eye
My hand dropped to the aisle
I could see myself clearly
For the first time in a while
There was nothing but lines
Nothing but outlines
My gut sank like a stone
But I heard another voice say
"We all walk alone"
There must be more than blood
That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears
When they pull back the curtain
There must be more than fear
Oh, there must be more than blood
That holds us together
There must be more than wind
That takes us away
There must be more than tears
When they pull back the curtain
There must be more, there must be more, there must be more

There must be more, there must be more, there must be
Must be more, there must be more, there must be
There must be more, there must be more, there must beEmbed
