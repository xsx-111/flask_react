Life Worth Missing LyricsAs if on cue
They lit a firework
The sky reeled back
And I ran fast to get to you
I think you knew
Before the war began
What loving to run towards something can do to a man
Fall over the edge
Learn to live while falling
Every laugh is a path worth following
When you put it into words
It's comfortingly bland
There's so little left to understand
When we're strung up, hanging from the knots we've allowed
We call up our angels to cut us down
"If you could be proud of anything you've done
What would it be?"
Then they disappear and we are up in the clouds
I feel the tension shock right through my body
I am wide awake
Shake a laugh from me
I thought one day
I thought I'd find a hole
In my own backyard
I'd never seen before
Follow it down
Underneath that fence
Come back up on the other side
Live another life
Break down the door, it's yours for the taking
I held it back until you stopped asking
My eyes are blurred but the clock is ticking
I'm coming up short in a life worth nothing
I hear women in my head
(Coming up short in a life worth nothing)
With ordinary names
(I'm coming up short in a life worth nothing)
That ring like magic through some malfunction in my brain
Your hands were warm, though you came in from the cold
I took one and held it
And suddenly started to shake
Shake
Shake
Shake
Shake
I feel it break
I feel the weight of anger, pain and sorrow
Breaking over me
The flags are raised
We walk with no goodbyes and no tomorrows
This is destiny
Memories of the best regrets
I play my song in every single rest
Every note of the symphony
Mend the fence with the best of grace
It's pleasantries to the bottom of the page
I'm sorry3Embed
