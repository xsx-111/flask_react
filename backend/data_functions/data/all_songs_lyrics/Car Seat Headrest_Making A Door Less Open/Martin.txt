Martin Lyrics
Justin
I will find you
In the winter
I will find you
When the world is asleep inside
I will wake my eyes to starlight
I will find you
I will

Justin
Light is falling
In the morning
Someone's calling
I will find strength in your power
I'll stop running like a coward
I will find you
I will

Just when I think I'm gone
You change the track I'm on
Just when I think I'm done
You burn me up before the dawn
Justin
There's no answer
In the end, I know
There is no answer
And when I'm high on things that bug me
The morning news and instant coffee
I'll forget, and forget, and remember
Forget, I will never forget
The way you made me feel

I turn the page
Each pen mark leaves a trace
Stars turn in place
I turn the page
Each pen mark leaves a trace
Stars turn in place
I still can see your face4Embed
