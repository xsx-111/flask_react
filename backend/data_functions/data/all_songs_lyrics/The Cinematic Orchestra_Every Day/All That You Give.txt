All That You Give LyricsAll that you are
All that you are
All that you have
All that you give
Mmmm
You hear me ravin'
You hear me ravin'
Ravin', ravin'
You see me cryin'
I'm grieving from my hat down to my shoes
Mmmm-hmm
All that you are
All that you are
All that you have
All that you give
All that you giveEmbed
