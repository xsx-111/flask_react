All Things to All Men Lyrics
And now it seems as if we're used to the chagrin
We made our beds, and now we hate where these beds be
Took nothing at all to part this red sea
I'm a shackled child singing the good song of freedom
They've got no pride, they interrupt our grieving
Teardrops dropping for the pain of the world
My best friend dies when she was just a young girl
Left me here, to fend for myself
Now the pain never leaves, we just learn to cope
So when the devil needs hanging, will you tie up the rope
And shout pull? Let's put an end to this bull
Zen thing. How many years before we practice what we preach?
How many tears before we truly clinch the peak?
Only to find that there is no honey on the moon
Official goon with the unofficial croon

I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest?, who's the hardest?
I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest?, who's the hardest?
Sixteen bar cycles, heart felt recital
From the wacky blacky man, they should have called me Michael
Look at the monster you make, look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
Cause it's each to his self in these times that we live
Does God have a sense of humour? Then the joke's on us
Cause we're chasing our tails for how long
The tussle makes us how strong
Vintage poor people fun
If we could ease up on these booze and fags
Then, just maybe life wouldn't seem so mad
"Be a man", my dad said, but what the hell he know
He lost his dreams, he lost his flow
And I don't wanna be alone
I'm born king, so where's my throne
I'm too intense, I'm too deep
I'm too nice for life
So what makes this place so nervous?

I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest?, who's the hardest?
I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest?, who's the hardest?
I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest?, who's the hardest?
I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest?, who's the hardest?
Look at the monster you make, look at the monster you pay
But you claim no responsibility
But you claim not
We're searching for Jesus
But I’ll be damned
If I’ll be crucified by ten thousand spies
Compulsive lies
They hate me
They love me
They hate me

'Cause I'm all things to all men
All of the women, all the children
Just say when and I’ll take you to my TARDIS
Who's the hardest, who's the hardest4Embed
