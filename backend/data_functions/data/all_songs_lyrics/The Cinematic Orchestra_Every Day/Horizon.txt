Horizon Lyrics
So far I see
That I hold the key to an
Ever may be
In this life for me
I know I'm strong
And I will make it through
I'll make it through
All I can say is keep looking forward don't look back
Take time to understand in this life just where you're at
You got so much precious time to yourself
Just be true, be true to you

You know your beauty shines within
You know your soul will always win
Waiting for motion to begin
Rising

In storm this day
There's a new horizon
Be you, be free
And set your life to motion
Don't be afraid of who you are
Just keep on rising
'Cause all you can do is keep moving forward don't stand back
Make the most of what you got and forget what's in your past
So difficult to see, just open up your eyes
And realize

You know your beauty shines within
You know your soul always wins
Waiting for motion to begin
Rising
You know your beauty shines within
You know your soul always wins
Waiting for the motion to begin
RisingEmbed
