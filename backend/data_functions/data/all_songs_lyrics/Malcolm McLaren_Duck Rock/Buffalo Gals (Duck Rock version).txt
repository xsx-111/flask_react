Buffalo Gals (Duck Rock version) Lyrics
You're listening to the World's Famous Supreme Team show
WHBI 105.9 FM
Chicago, by the name of Harvey, Andy, and 
And they're some very good friends of mine
And my name is Just Allah the Superstar, See
And I have something here, the first caller of the night goes by the name of  from Soundview projects
With Kareem Everlasting,  Allah, and that's Rahkim,  Allah from South Shore Highschool
They always make dedications with World Famous
Michell from  checking us out
 checking us out
 from Brownsville
All that scratchin' is makin' me itch
Duck-duck-duck
Duck-duck-duck
Duck-duck-duck
Duck-duck-duck
Duck-duck-duck
Duck-duck-duck
Duck-duck-duck

First buffalo gal go around the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside (You know it)
Two buffalo gals go around the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside
Three buffalo gals (Wahhh) go around the outside
(Wahhh, wah wah, wahhh)
Four buffalo gals (Wahhh) go around the outside
'Round the outside (Wahhh), 'round the outside (Wahhh)
Four buffalo gals go around the outside
And do-si-do your partners (wahhh)

Three buffalo gals (Wah), gals-gals, buffalo, buffalo, (Wah)

Wooh, girl, it's a pity that you're so dirty
You’re only dancin' just to be friendly (Wahhh)
So pretty you drive me loco
And so silly you make me blush so-o-o (Wahhh)
Yeah, huh, you're my buffalo girl, yeah-heah-eah
It's a pity that you're so dirty
You're dancin' just to be friendly
So pretty, you drive me loco
You're so pretty, you make me (wahhh) blush so-o-o
(She’s lookin' like a hobo)
Promenade, promenade, promenade, promenade, promenade

First buffalo boy go around the outside
'Round the outside, 'round the outside (Ah ha)
Two buffalo boys go around the outside
