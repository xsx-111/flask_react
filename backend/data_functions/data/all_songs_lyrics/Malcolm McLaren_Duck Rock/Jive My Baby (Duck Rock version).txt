Jive My Baby (Duck Rock version) Lyrics
Tina, Tina says you can dress her
She loves you, she loves to jive my baby
Tina, Tina says you can dress her
She loves to, she loves to change my baby

Watch how slow, we dress up Tina
She's dressed to kill, to steal away
Come back later, she'll shake 'n' jive you
Set alight the lights, jive my baby
Oh jive my baby
Watch how slow, we dress up Tina
She's dressed to kill, to steal away
Come back later, she'll shake 'n' jive you
Set alight the lights, jive my baby
Oh jive my baby

Jive my baby
Jive my baby, jive
Jive my baby
Jive my baby, jive
Jive my baby
Jive my baby, jive
(Jive)
Can't wait for payday to be sure
Nobody catch you because you are so very sexy
