Soweto LyricsAll you got to do is start
Forget about pushing your cart
I will make you step out
All the men shall Boogie and Bark
Never be afraid of the dark
All the men shall Boogie and Bark
Never be afraid of the dark
Believe me Babe
All the men shall Boogie and Bark
Never be afraid of the dark
All the men shall Boogie and Bark
Never be afraid of the dark

Say Shangaan Boogie Beater
All Xhosa Zulu Sangoma, Witchdoctor
Say Shangaan the Boogie Beater
All Xhosa Zulu Sangoma, Witchdoctor
Say Shangaans the Boogie Beater
All the men do the Boogie
Don’t fear
Living on the road in Soweto
All the men do the Boogie
Don’t fear
Living on the road in Soweto
All the men do the Boogie
Don’t fear
Living on the road in Soweto
All the men do the Boogie
Don’t fear
Living on the road in Soweto
All you got to do is break and fall
Head over heels, move backwards
Get down, on your hands and knees go forward
Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!
Move your legs from side to side
Like an animal with nowhere to hide
Roll over, with your back on the ground
Let your seat bump, up and down
Stand up, with your knees bent and hands down
Gallop like a horse across the ground
Hands on your hips, up and down, up and down
And with your legs lift up and down
And then go twisting round and round
Shtwela Shtwela

All dressed up magic in my head, in my head
Sounds that make you dance til you’re dead
All dressed up magic in my head, in my head
Living on the road in Soweto
Living on the Road in Soweto
Living on the Road in Soweto
All the men do the Boogie
Don’t fear

All the men do the Boogie
Don’t fear
