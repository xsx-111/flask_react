Double Dutch LyricsAll over the world high school girls
Take to the ropes and turn them slow
Starts a beat and a loop
They skip and jump thru the hoop
They might break and they might fall
About the gals from New York City don't
They just start again
Start again
Heh ebo ebonettes
Heh
Ebo ebonettes
Heh ebo
Ebo ebo ebonettes
Heh ebo
Ebo ebo ebonettes
Heh ebo
Ebo ebo ebonettes
Hmm
The Green and Golden Angels
Oh, the Fort Greene Angels
The Five Town Diamond skippers
The Pleasure of Rope Rippers
Those Dark and Lovely Skippers
Those Five Town Diamond Skippers
Skip they do's the double dutch
That's them dancing
Skip they do's the double dutch
That's them dancing
Skip they do's the double dutch
That's them dancing
Skip they do's the double dutch
That's them dancing
Swing those ropes round and around
All the teams change your partners now
Somersault thru the hoop leap to beat the clicks
That keep on coming
Heh
Watch your feet to win the double dutch - stay jumping
Heh ebo ebonettes
Heh
Ebo ebo ebonettes
The Mighty Motion Skippers
The Pleasure of Rope Rippers
Aah
The Dark and Lovely Skippers
Hmm
Mighty Motion skippers
The skip they do's the double dutch
That's them dancing
The skip they do's the double dutch
That's them dancing
Heh girls
How many skips can you do?Embed
