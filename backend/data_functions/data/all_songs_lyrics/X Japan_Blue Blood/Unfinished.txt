Unfinished LyricsOh, I'm looking at you
Can't control myself
Nothing but pain for me
Wipe your tears from your eyes
Just leave and forget me
No need to be hurt anymore
Go away from me now
I don't know what is love?
No need to be hurt anymore
You said, "I miss you so much
Every night thinking of you and facing loneliness."
But then you feel sadness
Never can I stay with you
I'm not the one you need
Close your eyes and forget me
There's nothing I can do anymore
I live for you in the night of tears
There I found someone was holding you
As the night was all falling down
With my love also vanished my vision of you
My heart is cold now
Wipe your tears from your eyes
Just leave and forget me
No need to be hurt anymore
You said, "I need you always
Everyday thinking of you and living loneliness."
But then you feel sadness
Never can I stay with you
Go away from me now
I don't know what is love?
No need to be hurt anymore
Can't find my way1Embed
