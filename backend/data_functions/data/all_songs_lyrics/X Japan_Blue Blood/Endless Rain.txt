Endless Rain LyricsI'm walking in the rain, yuku ate mo naku
Kizutsuita karada nurashi
Karamitsuku koori no zawameki
Koroshi tsuzukete samayou itsu made mo
Until I can forget your love
Nemuri wa mayaku tohou ni kureta
Kokoro o shizuka ni tokasu
Mai agaru ai o odorasete
Furueru karada o kioku no bara ni tsutsumu
I keep my love for you to myself
Endless rain fall on my heart
Kokoro no kizu ni
Let me forget all of the hate
All of the sadness
Days of joy, days of sadness slowly pass me by
As I try to hold you, you are vanishing before me
You're just an illusion
When I'm awaken, my tears have dried in the sand of sleep
I'm a rose blooming in the desert
It's a dream, I'm in love with you
Madoromi dakishimete
Endless rain fall on my heart
Kokoro no kizu ni
Let me forget all of the hate
All of the sadness
I awake from my dream
I can't find my way without you
The dream is over
Koe ni naranai kotoba o kurikaeshite mo
Takasugiru hai iro no kabe wasugi satta hi no
Omoi o yume ni utsusu
Until I can forget your love
Endless rain fall on my heart
Kokoro no kizu ni
Let me forget all of the hate
All of the sadness
Endless rain
Let me stay ever more in your heart
Let my heart take in your tears
Take in your memories
Endless rain fall on my heart
Kokoro no kizu ni
Let me forget all of the hate
All of the sadness
