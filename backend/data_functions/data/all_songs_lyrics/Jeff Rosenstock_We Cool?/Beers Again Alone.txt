Beers Again Alone Lyrics
Spent the whole weekend in bed
Summoning all of the garbage within
To skate figure eights in my head
Shit-smearing the ice ‘til I’d rather be dead

So don’t wait for me
You’re better
You’re fine when I’m alone

The loneliness starts around five
I know they’re all heading out to the dives
To sprinkle some red in their eyes
Everyone’s there
They’re all having great times


So I wait a few hours
For someone I love to come home
To stay awake for three hours at most
Then I’m drinking beers again alone, all alone
Yeah I’m drinking beers again alone
So don’t wait for me
You’re better
You’re fine when I’m alone
I can’t wait forever
So I’m drinking beers again alone, all alone
Yeah, I’m drinking beers again aloneEmbed
