Get Old Forever Lyrics
When your friends are buying starter homes with their accomplishments
Drinking at a house show can feel childish and embarrassing
With people glaring because despite what the advertisements said:
Malt liquor doesn’t make you young

On a fancy thing into the future
Thumbing through a raincloud of reminders
And “it’s a death trap” so I wanna get smashed before we get an inch off the ground
I’m not so sure you want me around

But we stepped outside and I realize it’s been a while
Since I’ve seen those eyes
And it felt so nice to see you smile

Breathe in deep and debride your life
Stale regrets are a waste of time
Only one thing remains secure
That we all get old together
And we all get old forever

Yeah, I’ve got dreams
Big stupid dreams
Dumb fucking dreams
But Little Chris is getting married Saturday
I need to get unstuck on the things I won’t achieve
I need to let it go and just
Breathe in deep and debride my life
Stale regrets are a waste of time
Only one thing remains secure
That we all get old together
And we all get old forever
That we all get old together
And we all get old forever

We had the time so we watched the ocean for a while
And it felt alright
Was it kind of nice to see me smile?1Embed
