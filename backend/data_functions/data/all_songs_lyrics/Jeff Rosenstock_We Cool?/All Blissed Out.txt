All Blissed Out Lyrics
Teach you a lesson...
In bed!
You...
Always go for it
Always... make it happen
Hold one, so you're saying the answer is.... always say yes?

I’ve been trapped inside a sharp
Mental picture of your heart
Waiting for me to come home
But I can’t get home

I’ve been trapped inside a sharp
Mental picture of your heart
Waiting for me to come home
But I can’t get home

Oh... ooohhh... ooohhh...
Oh... ooohhh... ooohhh...
Oh... ooohhh... ooohhh... (HAVE A FUCKIN' BALL!)
Oh... ooohhh... OOOHHH...
Oh... ooohhh... ooohhh...
Might as... well be...
No one... no one
Might as... well be...
No one... no one

MIGHT AS... (MIGHT AS) WELL BE... (WELL BE)
NO ONE! (NO ONE)  NO ONE! (NO ONE)
MIGHT AS... (MIGHT AS) WELL BE... (WELL BE)
NO ONE! (NO ONE)  NO ONE! (NO ONE)

No one...3Embed
