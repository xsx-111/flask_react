Nausea Lyrics
Held in a bong hit, sitting in a
Hot tub in south Wisconsin, I feel
Amazing when I’m all alone
Switching between porn and RoboCop
Turned off my cell phone, drank a bottle
Of wine and read a Cometbus and
Passed out naked, shriveling, stumbled
To bed in a fucked up sleepwalk

I got so tired of discussing my future
I started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea

I read the worst thing ever in a
Bathrobe of off-white terry cloth
Translated by technology from
Your voice extremely inaccurately

I got so tired of discussing my future
I started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can’t throw up
I got so tired of discussing my future
That I walk through my life like I’m the only one
With evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can’t throw up, oh no!
Cleaned up the empty bottles, let the
Smoke out through chilly windows
I used the stationary bike
And I watched the end of The Price Is Right
Ordered an egg-white sandwich and I
Drove south through mid-day traffic and I
Called up some folks I truly love and
Hung up after they said hello

I got so tired of discussing my future
I started avoiding the people I love
Evenings of silence and mornings of nausea
Shake and sweat and I can’t throw up
I got so tired of discussing my future
That I walk through my life like I’m the only one
With evenings of silence and mornings of nausea5Embed
