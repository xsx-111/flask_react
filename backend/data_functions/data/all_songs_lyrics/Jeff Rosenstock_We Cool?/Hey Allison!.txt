Hey Allison! Lyrics
She’s on the western side looking at the Jersey skyline
She’s in a real bad mood so she couldn’t write back to you
She’s had the longest day and it’s a gridlocked highway
She’s in a real bad mood so she couldn’t write back to you

“Hey Allison! Hey Allison! Hey Allison!
This city’s a total disaster without you around.”
“Hey Allison! Hey Allison! Hey Allison!
This city’s a total disaster without you around.”

You spent the days inside avoiding social landmines
That poke at every bruise
Is she gonna write back to you?
You’re an exhausted kid of fractured relationships
You wanna crush that gloom
Is she gonna write back to you?

“Hey Allison! Hey Allison! Hey Allison!
This sudden detachment from friendship is making me ache.”
“Hey Allison! Hey Allison! Hey Allison!
This sudden detachment from friendship is making me ache.”1Embed
