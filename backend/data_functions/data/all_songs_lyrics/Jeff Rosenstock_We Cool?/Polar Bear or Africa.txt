Polar Bear or Africa Lyrics
As I desaturate the fertile greens, I wanna tell you I
Don’t perpetuate these western schemes but I can’t stop laughing at
The shortsightedness of childhood dreams where we’re all young astronauts
The truth is it sucks being young and in love
When you’re old you’re just bummed that you’ll never be happy enough

Swim in waterfalls while parents sleep; emerge with spider bites
Fearlessly exploring new countries, I crashed my motorbike
I wanted to outline the scar in tattoo ink
It looked like a polar bear or Africa
But the scar went away and my memories changed
No, it wouldn’t be great to be back in 1998

I’ve been treating my body
Like I never worry that I’m gonna die
Because you would forgive me
I’ve been treating my body
Like I, Like I’m worried
That I’m gonna die and you’re gonna forget my name

So what do we get for the friends we’ve met and the ones we love at home?
Yeah, what do we get for the friends we’ve met and the one we’ve left alone?
We’re gonna give ‘em a trip to the hospital
We’re gonna give ‘em the bill for the funeral
We’re gonna give ‘em the debt from our student loans
We’re gonna give ‘em what’s left of the shit we owned
We’re gonna give ‘em a trip to the hospital
We’re gonna give ‘em the bill for the funeral
We’re gonna give ‘em the debt from our student loans
We’re gonna give ‘em what’s left of the shit we owned
We’re gonna give ‘em a trip to the hospital
We’re gonna give ‘em the bill for the funeral
We’re gonna give ‘em the debt from our student loans
We’re gonna give ‘em what’s left of the shit we owned
I’ve been treating my body
Like I never worry that I’m gonna die
Because you would forgive me
I’ve been treating my body
Like I, Like I’m worried
That I’m gonna die and you’re gonna forget my name
That I’m gonna die and you’re gonna forget my name
That I’m gonna die and you’re gonna forget my name

So what do we get for the friends we’ve met and the ones we love at home?
Yeah, what do we get for the friends we’ve met and the one we’ve left alone?2Embed
