Novelty Sweater Lyrics
Stuck in a room, clutched to an aching womb
My mind like a trap
In the same state I was in ‘88
Lept up, falling back

I’ve been daydreaming under a novelty sweater
Stinking of fear

Starting again, starting it all again
My life like a trap

I’ve been daydreaming under a novelty sweater
Stinking of fear

I’ve been accusing self-medication
For all of my overcompensation
For all of these faults that no one would notice
If I could shut my mouth

I’ve been daydreaming under a novelty sweaterEmbed
