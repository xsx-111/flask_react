When in Rome LyricsWell I see you in the morning
Putting on your pretty clothes
And I watch you do your makeup
Like they do in all those fashion shows
Then you turn to me so that I can see
If you put yourself together right
Then you go away and you're gone all day
But I know you're coming home tonight
And when you're home
Darling all you've got to be is you
But when in Rome do as the Romans do
Well it's alright if you're tired
When your day is done
You can see when you look at me
You're not the only one
It's a cold, cruel world for a working girl
But you can't let them see you cry
It's a fact of life, how a man and wife
Work full time to just get by
And when we're home
All it's gonna be is me and you
But when in Rome do as the Romans do
I've done some strange things I never thought I'd do before
But if the strain brings happiness
More or less
Then I don't mind masquerading
With all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing
Because I've learned the rules
And when times are tough, I've got just enough
If you're standing right by my side
Darling more and more, I get hungry for
All the ways you keep me satisfied
Out on our own
There ain't nothing we can't get through
But when in Rome do as the Romans do
So I don't mind masquerading
With all those other fools
I don't mind the games I'm playing
Because I've learned the rules
It doesn't matter when we're home, all alone
All we've got to be is me and you
Out on our own, there ain't nothing that we can't get through
But when in Rome do as the Romans do
Swing that hammer and break that stone
(Like the Romans do)
Push those buttons and answer that phone
(Like the Romans do)
Coffee in the morning and martinis at night
(Like the Romans do)
Everybody's working up a big appetite
(Like the Romans do)
When in Rome do like the Romans do
(Like the Romans do)
When in Rome do like the Romans do
(Like the Romans do)
When in Rome do like the Romans do
(Like the Romans do)1Embed
