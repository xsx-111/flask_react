Life Is a Minestrone Lyrics
I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging 'round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up (Come on, Pluto!)
She gets more fan mail than the Pope (Own up, own up)
She takes the Mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze

I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging 'round the gardens of Madison
The seat of learning and the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne (Baby)
Suspended in deep freeze
Love is the fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crêpe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne (Baby)
Suspended in deep freeze

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne (Baby)
Suspended in deep freeze

Love is the fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crêpe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne (Baby)
Suspended in deep freeze
Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold lasagne (Baby)
Suspended in deep freeze
(C'mon, serve it up boys)
