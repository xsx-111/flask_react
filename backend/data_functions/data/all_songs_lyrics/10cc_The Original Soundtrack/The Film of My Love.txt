The Film of My Love Lyrics
Co-starring you and co-starring me
Starring us both together
The film of my love will travel the world
Forever and ever and ever
A back lot romance a scripted affair
The screenplay a blessing from heaven
We're gone with the wind on the Orient Express
To join the Magnificent Seven

The film of my love will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over

A close-up of yours a long shot of mine
Superimposed together
I'll zoom in on you with a love that is true
In cinemascope forever
A clapper board kiss, there's an Oscar in this
A hit or a miss, whatever!
A box office wedding, a premier for two
We'll be on location forever

When Pathe recall the thrill of it all
They'll edit us both together
A legend a classic, an epic of love
Captured on film forever
A lasting embrace that time can't erase
Let them censor the wind, or the weather
The film of my love will conquer the world
Forever and ever and ever

The film of my love will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
Over and over and overEmbed
