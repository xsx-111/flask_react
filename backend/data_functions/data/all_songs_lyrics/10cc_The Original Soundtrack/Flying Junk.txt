Flying Junk Lyrics
Ooh, he's a sly one
He's a razamataz man
He flew in from Singapore
On a flying junk man
Ooh, he's a devil
Ooh, and the devil's gonna bring you down

Ooh, he's a stalwart
With a heavy load on
He's got a finger in everyone's pie
And he's got what you want
Ooh, he's a salesman
Ooh, and his goods are gonna bring you down

He's never got the stuff
If you ever come to him without money
He hasn't got the time
For the people who are down on their knees
But if the price is right
You won't be asking him where it came from

Ooh, he's a remnant
From the swingin' sixties
He pushed his load down the Kings Road
To the Chelsea Potter
Ooh, he's a snow job
Ooh, and his shovels gonna cover youEmbed
