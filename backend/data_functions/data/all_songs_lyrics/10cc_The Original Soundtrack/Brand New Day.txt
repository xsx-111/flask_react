Brand New Day Lyrics
When you open your eyes
To a brand new morning
And the sun shines
Above you
You pull on your breeches and say
Oh well
It's the start of a brand new day (Yes it is)
It's the start of a brand new day

For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below, your body must go
Against the grain
Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the...

Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy
Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere
But there below your body will go

You work all day
You sweat & strain
It's getting late
And early days (???)
Here boy, there boy
The devil got you runnin' everywhere boy
I smell cookin' and it might be you
You sure ain't goin' nowhere
Here boy, there boy
You're bait for the devil I swear, boy
Something's cookin' and it might be you

At the end of the day
When you look around you
And the sun sets
Deep inside you
Dust off your breeches and say
'Oh well'
Say goodnight to the man in the moon
The sandman's on his wayEmbed
