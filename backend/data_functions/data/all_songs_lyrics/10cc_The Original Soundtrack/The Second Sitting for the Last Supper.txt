The Second Sitting for the Last Supper Lyrics
Another fish head in the dustbin
Another loser in the queue for the soup kitchen
Another reason for a visit
We think you'd better come down
Another nigga on the woodpile
Another honky on the dole
Another trip from off the 15th floor
The greatest story ever told
Was so wrong, so wrong

'Cause you promised milk and honey
With an everlasting life
And we listened with our ears closed
And a blindness in our eyes
But we heard them as they nailed you
And we saw you crucified

The second coming of the Holy Ghost
We need a pocketful of miracles
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last
Supper (Supper, Supper)
Another Guru in the money
Another mantra in the mail
An easy way from rags to riches
God's little acre's up for sale
The time is right for resurrection
We think you'd better come down
The church don't ring with hallelujahs
You haven't been for so long
So long, so long

Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last
Supper (Supper, Supper)Embed
