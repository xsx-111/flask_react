Laser Show LyricsOh yeah we're going to the laser show
Oh yeah we're going to the laser show
Come on baby now don't you know
We're going down to the laser show
They come from Bridgeport, Westport, Darien
Down to the Hayden Planetarium
We're gonna space out to our favorite tunes
We're going straight to the dark side of the moon
Oh yeah we're going to the laser show
Oh yeah we're going to the laser show
Come on baby now don't you know
We're going down to the laser show
We're gonna sit back, relax, watch the stars
James and Jason, Kirk and Lars
We're gonna make our way across the galaxy
And then we'll head back on the L.I.EEmbed
