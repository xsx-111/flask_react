Troubled Times LyricsWhen you think you've found
Something worth holding onto
Were you reaching for attention
Hoping she would notice you?
Collecting bottles and
Thrown-away cans
Like she was returnable
One day would fill your hands
How she loved you
All you imagined
Fit so well into your plans
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled times
Pining away
Every hour in your room
Rolling with the motion
Waiting 'til it's opportune
Sitting there
Watching time fly past you
Why do tomorrow
What you could never do?
How she loved you
All you imagined
All the shit you put her through
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled times
And it takes a lot of nerve
To ask how she is doing
Start with a weak foundation
You will end in ruins
The way the days and hours pass
You'll never understand
Falling like rain through your hands
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled times
Maybe one day soon
It will all come out
How you dream about
Each other sometimes
With the memory of
How you once gave up
But you made it through
The troubled timesEmbed
