The Valley of Malls LyricsThe King of Araby is coming home today
It's bumper touching bumper on the motorway
The sun is in the sky just now
But the road is grey
They drive in Winnebagos from the Everglades
Pulled over by the troopers in the mirror shades
The Caravan is sorry
The driver has a twenty and change
And we're leaving all the road for dead
We're getting tired of the twists and turns
You gotta go when human nature calls
We're driving, we're driving
Through the valley of malls
And God forgive the passengers if we should fail
To find a penny fountain or a half-off sale
I need a merchant
I just started searching for a holy grail
Fighting for the freedom from a common band
To be a barracuda in the guppy pond
So little time for so many things to try on
And we're leaving all the road for dead
We're getting tired of the twists and turns
You gotta go when human nature calls
We're driving, we're driving
Through the valley of malls
And we're leaving all the road for dead
We're getting tired of the twists and turns
You gotta go when human nature calls
We're driving, we're driving
Through the valley of mallsEmbed
