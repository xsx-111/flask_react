Go, Hippie LyricsGo, hippie
Skip down the old road
Don't even see me, do you at all
Some days you get so tired of hanging
Trying to deep-fry all your boredom
Big hippie
The day was so slow
And I can see you feel it too
Sometimes you wish you knew karate
Oh, the things that you could, like
Crossing in between greens
Just because you want to
Not because you ought to
Oh, how can you ever explain
They can never feel your pain
Neither can you
Mr. Crabtree
Sits in the window
He sees a lot, but he don't know
That was you across the yard
Throwing brownies at his car
Sweet hippie
Keeping your head low
Around the car park you swing low
Some days it all falls down around you
Some days you fall down in the snow, while
Crossing in between greens
Just because you want to
Not because you ought to
Oh, how can you ever explain
They can never feel your pain
Neither can youEmbed
