Red Dragon Tattoo LyricsMonday gonna take a ride
On the N train down to Coney Island
With the money I saved
Gonna get me engraved
Drink down a lot of Basil Hayden
Get kicked out when I can't see straight and
What an island to be on
Under the neon
Red dragon tattoo
Is just about on me
I got it for you
So now do you want me
With nothing to prove
Will you be my honey
Oh yeah
In you I confide
Red dragon tattoo
I'm fit to be dyed
Am I fit to have you
I hear the man say "you want to see the others"
A mermaid and a heart that says mother
But I don't know from maritime
And I never did hard time
I brought a .38 Special CD collection
Some Bactine to prevent infection
And in case I get queasy
A photo of Easy
Rider
Red dragon tattoo
Is just about on me
I got it for you
So now do you want me
With nothing to prove
Will you be my honey
Oh yeah
In you I confide
Red dragon tattoo
I'm fit to be dyed
Am I fit to have you
Will you stop pretending I've never been born
Now I look a little more like that guy from KorN
If you came a little bit closer
You'd see it isn't painted on
Oh, no, no
Red dragon tattoo
Is just about on me
I got it for you
So now do you want me
With nothing to prove
Will you be my honey
Oh yeah
In you I confide
Red dragon tattoo
I'm fit to be dyed
Am I fit to have you
In you I confide
Red dragon tattoo
I'm fit to be dyed
Am I fit to have youEmbed
