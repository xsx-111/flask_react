Denise LyricsI know this girl named Denise
She makes me weak at the knees
She drives a lavender Lexus
She lives in Queens
But her dad lives in Texas
When she holds me
I can't help myself
Won't you tell me
Do you love me Denise?
Do you love me Denise?
Oh baby tell me please
I heard she used to be married
She listens to Puff Daddy
She works at Liberty Travel
She has a heart made of gravel
She controls me
She can't help herself
Won't you tell me
Do you love me Denise?
Do you love me Denise?
Oh baby tell me pleaseEmbed
