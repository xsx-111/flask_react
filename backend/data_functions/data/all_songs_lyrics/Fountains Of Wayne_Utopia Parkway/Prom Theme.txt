Prom Theme LyricsHere we are at last
The moment soon will pass
We'll go our separate ways
We'll vanish in the haze
We'll never be the same
We'll forget each other's names
We'll grow old and lose our hair
It's all downhill from there
But tonight we'll reach for the stars
We'll rent expensive cars
And dream our dreams
Of a perfect night
And we'll sing our prom theme
Here we are at last
We're running out of gas
The air is getting thick
The girls are feeling sick
We'll pass out on the beach
Our keys just out of reach
Soon we'll say good bye
Then we'll work until we die
But tonight we feel like stars
We'll play our air guitars
Cause we're 18
It's a perfect night
To sing our prom themeEmbed
