Amity Gardens LyricsAngel broke her wing
Oh, you poor thing
The hum of the motor gave way to
The tick tick ticking of the clock
And the rattle of springs
The Buick's in the drive
It's good to be alive
And if you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go home
Wouldn't want to go
If you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go to Amity Gardens again
It isn't very much, but
For now it's home
A room in the shadow of a funny-looking man
On the phone to the bank about a default loan
I thank you very much
Ta ta we'll be in touch
And if you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go home
Wouldn't want to go
If you knew now what you knew then
You wouldn't want to go to Amity Gardens again
Where you came from
And act like you tried
Cause somethings are better kept
Deep down inside
But you're not driving
You're along for the ride
Just checking out the scene
And taking in the greenEmbed
