Hat and Feet LyricsI'm just a hat and feet
That's all that's left of me
A spot on the sidewalk
A mark on the street
I'm just a hat and feet
I'm just a hat and feet
You dropped a bomb on me
I didn't even see
Like a falling piano
From out of a window
I'm just a hat and feet
I'm just a hat and feet
I'm just a sitting duck
That ran out of luck
I'm the unhappy guy
That didn't look up high
I started runnin'
When I saw it comin'
It got faster and louder
'til I took a powder
And now
I'm just a hat and feet
That's what's become of me
Flat on the sidewalk
Stuck to the street--
Now I'm just a hat and feet
I'm just a hat and feet
I'm just a sitting duck
That ran out of luck
I'm the unhappy guy
That didn't look up high
I started runnin'
When i saw it comin'
It got faster and louder
'til I took a powder
And now
I'm just a hat and feet
That's all that's left of me
A spot on the sidewalk
A mark on the street
I'm just a hat and feet
I'm just a hat andEmbed
