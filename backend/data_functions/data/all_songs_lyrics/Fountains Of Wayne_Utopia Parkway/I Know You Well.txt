I Know You Well LyricsThis morning under awaking glow
The sun filled our room like December snow
Like morning through an old window
There's a place in your head I will always know
To the same world born two of a kind
If it's on your mind, it'll be on mine 'cause
I know you well
Like the soil in the ground
Grass grown in the shadow of a bell
And if the bell will never toll
You and me grow old
I hope we'll live to tell
How you know I know you knew I know you well
Down under, beneath the softened skin
Where the words we whisper sink in
It's no wonder the way the words still ring
Sure as sin, it's not a secret thing
To the same world born two of a kind
If it's on your mind, it'll be on mine 'cause
I know you well
Like the soil in the ground
Grass grown in the shadow of a bell
And if the bell will never toll
You and me grow old
I hope we'll live to tell
How you know I know you knew I know New York 1991
Here in the same room for so long
Out of the cold november
Still as a passport picture
Still as a passport picture
To the same world born two of a kind
If it's on your mind, it'll be on mine 'cause
I know you well
Like the soil in the ground
Grass grown in the shadow of a bell
And if the bell will never toll
You and me grow old
I hope we'll live to tell
How you know I know you knew I know you wellEmbed
