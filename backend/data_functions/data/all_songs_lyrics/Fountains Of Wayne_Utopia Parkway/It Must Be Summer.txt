It Must Be Summer LyricsIt must be summer, 'cause the days are long
And I dial your number, but you're gone, gone, gone
I'd set out searching, but the car won't start
And it must be summer, 'cause I'm falling apart
I try your sister on the Jersey shore
She said you might be stopping by, but she's just not sure
So I call your mother on Long Island Sound
She said it must be summer, 'cause you're never around
And the sun is beating me senseless
I feel defenseless like a dying lamb
I don't want to lie by the oceanside
Don't want to play in the sand
Can't you understand?
Can't you understand?
It must be summer, 'cause the streets are bare
And I try your number, but you're just not there
And the sun keeps shining 'til it's dead and gone
And it must be summer, 'cause I can't go on
And the sun is beating me senseless
I feel defenseless like a dying lamb
I don't want to lie by the oceanside
Don't want to play in the sand
Can't you understand?
Can't you understand?
It must be summer
It must be summer
It must be summer
