Cosmic Power of the Infinite Shred Machine LyricsFuture worlds of magic and mystery
Our  eternal path to search and find out new horizons
Far  and wide, to the end of the galaxy
But forevermore we spend our lifetime searching
Onwards through time, striving to find
Answers  to all of our dreams
Find  the path through the universe
Under the sign of our true star fleet
A  brave new world, a brand new hope
A shining star so far from home
A brighter place, the terra prime
Under power of cosmic light
Here  we stand alone at the frontier
The future of mankind
A brave new world, a brand new hope
A shining star to save our souls tonight
Realms of fear when our two worlds collide
Someone help us now to find our way out of this black hole
Zero hour to defend what we left behind
Armageddon's near but still we answer the call
Lost and alone in the neutral zone
Fear of the doomsday machine
Set the path through the stratosphere
Blazing like fire through the galaxy
A brave new world, a brand new hope
A shining star so far from home
A brighter place, the terra prime
Under power of cosmic light
Here we stand alone at the frontier
The future of mankind
A brave new world, a brand new hope
A shining star to save our souls tonight
Lost in the abyss out here in the void
The last solar flare, a system destroyed
By light of the dark inferno our starship will burn
Where no man has gone before us and none shall return
A brave new world, a brand new hope
A shining star so far from home
A brighter place, the terra prime
Under power of cosmic light
Here we stand alone at the frontier
The future of mankind
A brave new world, a brand new hope
A shining star to save our souls tonight
To save our souls tonightEmbed
