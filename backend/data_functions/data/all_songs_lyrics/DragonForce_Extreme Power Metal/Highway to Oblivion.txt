Highway to Oblivion Lyrics
When the lights have turned to grey
On the dawning final day
See the sun now fade away
Can we find the words to say
All the times we fought in vain
Though the years and seasons change
But we all still feel the same
As we stand before the world

Feel the engines fire
Feel the thunder rise
Now touch the path of glory
Power to the turbo drive
Hot wheels of fire burn strong
Flash lightning fries the brain
On a course to no tomorrow
Driving all of us insane
City lights laid out before us
Go forth for now your time has come
Now your time has come

In a flash of blue steel, to the far horizons
Supersonic power, on the wings of a dream
Down the roads so far, with nowhere to hide
Like a star shooting right from the sky
Slow down for no one, never look back now tonight
Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion

500 miles an hour
All gravity defied
We touched the taste of glory
So close the finish line
Bright lights still glare before us
Give it up for now your time has come
Now your time has come

Like a demon on wheels, through the cursed blue mountains
Donâ€™t let a minute go by, give it all till the end
On a one way street living in the fast lane
Feel the passion that runs through your veins
Faster with fury to the end of all our days

Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion
We live for the night
We long for the day
The glory forever
Forever we fight
A sign from the night
Lost out in space, hey


A lifetime of dreaming
But don't ever stop believing
The passion, the fight deep inside
The power before me
Ascend to the edge of glory
Tonight, shooting far across the sky

Feel the power beyond redline
Lost forever in space and time
Higher and higher adrenaline surging
Wheels of fire will burn tonight
Leave the trials of life behind
Blasting on at the speed of light
Tearing up the highway to oblivion
Oblivion
Woah, woah, woah1Embed
