Behind the Mirror of Death LyricsComing from a realm where nothing dwells but hatred
Creatures of Nar, the evil God of Darkness
Running from the west, through wasted lands, they're coming
To annihilate the disciples of the Sun
Trapped in destiny beneath the ruins of your monastery
Rising from this war, you're the last one of a kind
Searching for revenge, you left a shadow on the sand
You are the true savior of mankind
Fly from the dark, you'll make them understand
A new warrior will begin again
Behind the mirror of death
Behind the mirror of death
Fight for our freedom and day brings the fury within your heart
Behind the mirror of death
Feel the prophecy, a quest to find the seven orbs
Far the soaring eagle, through seven kingdoms of pain
Deep into a void, you're trapped within the astral planes beyond
You found a betrayer, the time for vengeance has come
Prisoners in time, you will destroy the leader
Through the night, deep in the eyes of the night
Escape from the fire
Behind the mirror of death
Behind the mirror of death
Fight for our freedom and day brings the fury within your heart
Behind the mirror of death
If you die like a hero
Try and try again
Behind the mirror of death
Behind the mirror of death
Behind the mirror of death
Fight for our freedom and day brings the fury within your heart
Behind the mirror of death
Behind the mirror of death
Behind the mirror of deathEmbed
