Heart Demolition LyricsSometimes I wonder
If love has a meaning
Feels like the sadness won't end
Sometimes I wonder, why do we try?
We're looking for answers in vain
Every step I've taken
Led me closer to the edge
And I've fallen, I've fallen
And there's no way to return
Lost and mistreated
By your words and by your promises
The lies were ephemeral
But the truth won't fade away
Live it up (Live it up)
And I know I'll find the courage to be free again
The sun comes after rain
Live it up (Live it up)
The struggle has been real
But now I've gotta break these chains
Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
No knife through my heart
Why don't you let me go?
Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
I've done it times before
I won't get fooled again and again
How many hours
Have we both wasted?
Our life was written in sand
We took our chances
But love turned into hate
Nothing left but anger and pain
Our story turned to poison
And we just drank it all
It was burning down our throat
And flowing through our veins
The passion, the fury
Nothing was like it was meant to be
The truth is hard to face
But I'm done looking away
Live it up (Live it up)
And I know I'll find the courage to be free again
The sun comes after rain
Live it up (Live it up)
The struggle has been real
And I'm done playing games
And I'm done being the one to blame
Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
No knife through my heart
Why don't you let me go?
Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
I've done it times before
I won't get fooled again (And again)
And I know it will be fine (It will be fine)
And I know that time will heal it all (Heal it all)
And one day, you will believe again (Believe again)
'Cause I know, yes, I know
So for now, let it go

Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
No knife through my heart
Why don't you let me go?
Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
I've done it times before
I won't get fooled again
Don't wanna be
Another victim of love
I've done it times before
I won't get fooled againEmbed
