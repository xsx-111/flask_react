Strangers LyricsCruising down the streets, I'm hiding
Hiding from the danger zone
Underneath the blinding city lights
Lost and far away from home
Deep inside, I got a burning fire
No one here to set me free
Wasted times, I've been longing for more
But we were
Strangers in a city burning
Strangers in the night
Danger, can you hear it calling?
Time and time again, I have to
Understand a reason why
Raise my hands up to the sky
Hide away my tears
Hold on (Hold on)
Hold on to my dreams
I know this pain inside, it's growing
A thousand times I've had to stray
But tonight, I won't, I'll face it
Instead of trying to hide it away
And far beyond the senses
I'll find the power to set me free
Wasted times, I've been longing for more
But we were
Strangers in a city burning
Strangers in the night
Danger, can you hear it calling?
Time and time again, I have to
Understand a reason why
Raise my hands up to the sky
Hide away my tears
Hold on to my dreams
Understand a reason why
Raise my hands up to the sky
All the tears the wind blew high
Are falling down, down on this city tonight
Strangers in a city burning
Strangers in the night
Danger, can you hear it calling?
Time and time again, I have to
Understand a reason why
Raise my hands up to the sky
Hide away my tears
Hold on to my dreams
Understand a reason why
Raise my hands up to the sky
All the tears the wind blew high
Are falling down, down on this city tonightEmbed
