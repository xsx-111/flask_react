Trouble Lyrics
Feel it in my feet, feel it in the heat
There’s trouble on the street
And the trouble starts to move your way now
Feel it in the heat, feel it in my feet
There’s trouble on the street
It’s not gonna work, so move away now
Feel the heat
Feel the heat on the street

Well, there I might lay low
Well, I guess we'll wait and see
Wherever it is I go
Seems there's trouble finding me
I know I got time to run
But I know I got time to breathe
There’s no time like the present
To make this trouble stand up and leave

So say doo, dah-doo, doo-do the trouble
Dig up the down and burst up the bubble
I'mma shoot, dilute, toot where there's trouble
Do the boogie down and move on the double
I'mma doo, dah-doo, doo-do the trouble
Pick up the shovel you got down the rubble
I'mma doo, dah-doo, do where there's trouble
Do the boogie down and move on the double
So hold on to what you got
You can lose it fast in the dark days
So hold on to what you got
You can lose it fast in the rat race

Feel it in my feet, feel it in the heat
There’s trouble on the street
And the trouble starts to move your way now
Feel it in the heat, feel it in my feet
There’s trouble on the street
It’s not gonna work, so move away now

Doo, dah-doo, doo-do the trouble
Dig up the down and burst up the bubble
I'mma shoot, dilute, toot where there's trouble
Do the boogie down and move on the double
I'mma doo, dah-doo, doo-do the trouble
Pick up the shovel you got down the rubble
I'mma doo, dah-doo, do where there's trouble
Do the boogie down and move on the double
Shoot, shoot, shoot, the man's trouble
Too, too, too many boots on the level
Shoot, shoot, shoot and there's trouble
Just seen too many boots on the rubble
Shoot, shoot, shoot, the man's trouble
Too, too, too many boots on the level
Shoot, shoot, shoot and there's trouble
Just seen too many boots on the rubble
So hold on to what you got
You can lose it fast in the dark days
So hold on to what you got
You can lose it fast in the rat race
So hold on to what you got
You can lose it fast in the dark days
So hold on to what you got
You can lose it fast in the rat race

Shoot, shoot, shoot, the man's trouble
Too, too, too many boots on the level
Shoot, shoot, shoot and there's trouble
Just seen too many boots on the rubble
Shoot, shoot, shoot, the man's trouble
Too, too, too many boots on the level
Shoot, shoot, shoot and there's trouble
Just seen too many boots on the rubble1Embed
