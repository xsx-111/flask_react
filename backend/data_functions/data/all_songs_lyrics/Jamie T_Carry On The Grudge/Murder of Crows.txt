Murder of Crows Lyrics
Born of the green, pray to the love
It's hot in the guts, I'm gonna grip to the rail
I'm hung and I'm hooked, fixing a snare
She sticks a root down on her meagre frame
One is there with and one is without
Perceiving a ghost, I'm gonna stick to the trail
I wanna get in, I wanna get out
She sticks a root down on her meagre frame

How can we love like this?
Guess life is like a roller coaster
In life, love gnawed at my skin
Guess nothing, I should never trust her
I don't know where I've been
Think nothing of her, love and leave her
Don't know nothing about him
But I know that you've been seen out together

Born of the green, pray to the love
It's hot in the guts, I'm gonna grip to the rail
I'm hung and I'm hooked, fixing a snare
She sticks a root down on her meagre frame
Am I strong enough, baby, to hate?
Set fire to the revelator
The shogun turned up late
On a runaway train, trying to set a wager
And there's a light twice shining bright in my eyes
It's an oncoming train to take you
Out of my life and into his wife
I'll be waiting, hope I'll see you later

Born of the green, pray to the love
It's hot in the guts, I'm gonna grip to the rail
I'm hung and I'm hooked, fixing a snare
She sticks a root down on her meagre frame
One is there with and one is without
Perceiving a ghost, I'm gonna stick to the trail
I wanna get in, I wanna get out
She sticks a root down on her meagre frame

The combination so slow, walking on old eggshells
Singing with a murder of crows, walking on old eggshells
The combination so slow, walking on old eggshells
Singing with a murder of crows, walking on old eggshells
The combination so slow, walking on old eggshells
Singing with a murder of crows, walking on old eggshells
The combination so slow, walking on old eggshells
Singing with a murder of crows, walking on old eggshells
Born of the green, pray to the love
It's hot in the guts, I'm gonna grip to the rail
I'm hung and I'm hooked, fixing a snare
She sticks a root down on her meagre frame
One is there with and one is without
Perceiving a ghost, I'm gonna stick to the trail
I wanna get in, I wanna get out
She sticks a root down on her meagre frameEmbed
