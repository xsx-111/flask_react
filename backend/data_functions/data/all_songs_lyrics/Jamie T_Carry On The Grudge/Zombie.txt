Zombie Lyrics
Lo, she's seas apart from me
Possessed behind the eyes
Well, apart from the frightening, the moaning, the biting
He seemed to be a nice guy
And I know what she thinks when she looks at me
When she looks with such despair
Well, you're not the only one around here
That needs a bit of fresh air
'Cause I'm a sad sack post-teen
Caught up in the love machine
No dream, come clean, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie
And I'm a coal train, fast lane
Caught up in the dirty rain
No pain, no gain, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie

Well, this old place here, man, it's falling apart
She's on the road, there she goes, but she won't get far
I'm on a show to parole to the toad in the hole
I gotta grow some roots, gotta prop up the bar
I got bloodshot eyes and there's blood in my teeth
I got a ripped-up jacket and a friend who's a thief
Well, I'ma coughing out my mouth, trying to pull it out
But the fire inside keeps burning, burning out
'Cause I'm a sad sack post-teen
Caught up in the love machine
No dream, come clean, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie
And I'm a coal train, fast lane
Caught up in the dirty rain
No pain, no gain, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie

Hold your own in the situation
Don't be afraid to be a friend
'Cause I won't hurt you, girl, or leave you a loose end
You make me alive enough to love again

'Cause I'm a sad sack post-teen
Caught up in the love machine
No dream, come clean, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie
And I'm a coal train, fast lane
Caught up in the dirty rain
No pain, no gain, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie
'Cause I'm a sad sack post-teen
Caught up in the love machine
No dream, come clean, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie
And I'm a coal train, fast lane
Caught up in the dirty rain
No pain, no gain, walking like a zombie
Like a zombie
But she's a howler
Or even got signed before my father
Losing her love without a light on
Losing it all another way6Embed
