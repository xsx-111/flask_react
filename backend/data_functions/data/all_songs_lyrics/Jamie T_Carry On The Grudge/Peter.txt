Peter Lyrics
Sometimes I feel like there's someone in my head
Sometimes I feel like there's someone in my head
Sometimes I feel like that someone has a name
Sometimes I feel that he wants me dead
(Peter, Peter)

Peter don't believe in love
Peter doesn't like this song
Peter piss electric fence
Peter doesn't like my friends
Peter doesn't believe in God
Peter just falls apart
Every time he hears you say, hears you say
"Jamie, what you on about?"

Last them shake, retake, retake
Hey, wilin' up, Peter isn't going nowhere
Juice in, juice out, sniffs it out
Shoots about town with a rocky, such a cool hair
Shouts for the sister, for the backbone gutter
Look him up, down, or someone better go and get her
Used it up, Peter's gonna rock this summer
If no one else do it then Peter's gonna
Peter don't believe in love
Peter doesn't like this song
Peter piss electric fence
Peter doesn't like my friends
Peter doesn't like your band
Peter says you all sound bland
Peter wants to fuck your girl
Peter wants to fuck the world

(I warned you all, I warned you all, I warned you all)

Peter doesn't like the numpties making lots of money
Off my ideas, then calling them their own
Peter doesn't say he's pretty, in fact, damn, he's ugly
He doesn't like company, he's drinking alone
Screams at the telly to the jukebox fodder
Someone come and get me when you need your going under
And I, life saver, live forever, up a level
Peter's coming for you, gonna hide in the treble

Peter don't believe in love
Peter doesn't like this song
Peter piss electric fence
Peter doesn't like my friends
Peter doesn't believe in God
Peter just falls apart
Every time he hears you say, hears you say
"Jamie, what you on about?"
(I warned you all, I warned you all, I warned you all
I warned you all, I warned you all, I warned you all
I warned you all)3Embed
