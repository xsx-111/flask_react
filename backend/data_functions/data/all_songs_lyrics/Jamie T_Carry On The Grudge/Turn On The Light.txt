Turn On The Light Lyrics
You run down the strip, down the strip right through me
The rain on the windscreen, blistering a stop sign
Turn in the rubies your mother did buy you
Through this land I roar
You make me bold like a whore, wish I'd never been born
Got a good-looking corpse hanging on to me tightly
Bless this strip as it runs right through me
Bless this strip as it runs right through me

She fades to the background, proofreads a story
Kills all the characters and crosses out the heroine
Kissing an American she told me she bought me
Through this land I roar
She make me bold like a whore, wish I'd never been born
Got a good-looking corpse hanging on to me tightly
Bless this strip as it runs right through me
Bless this strip as it runs right through me

Love, turn on the light
It's so dark in there, inside the life
And I know what it's like
To feel loved and to not like yourself
She dragged all the blood to the back of my brain
Peel to the light, smoked on an elephant's tusk
Punch-drunk, bitten and bleeding
I became tame, feral in the herald, one of us
And I hear mutants screaming out
Ride on the crest of waves
And I stopped as a joker's feeling
And I still hear demons breathing, and

Love, turn on the light
It's so dark in there, inside the life
And I know what it's like
To feel loved and to not like yourself

The sun had dropped, I'm sweating in a carcass
I've given up on me, I've given up on Marcus
I'm carrying my casket, looking for the enemy
I'm down on my knees, surrendering to Valerie
And all I feel my head is racing
I feel my shoulder's bracing
I know I'm sick to my bones and
I know can't get back home and
Love, turn on the light
It's so dark in there, inside the life
And I know what it's like
To feel loved and to not like yourself

Take me far from this sweet city stench
Where friends all betray each other
And I'm just another lover to a
Take me far from this sweet city stench
Where friends all betray each other
And I'm just another lover to a friend, to a friend
To a friend, to a friend

Oh, take me far, oh, take me far
Oh, take me far, oh, take me far2Embed
