They Told Me It Rained Lyrics
Between a birth cry and a death wail
There's just houses, so lavish in your anguish
I can tell you're chasing your tail
Soaked through sheets, she didn't die quite right
So light up the leader, so light up the leader
So light a believer to the juggernaut days

I give up, I give in
Just show me love, just show me love
You're never lost, I'll never win
Just show me love, just show me love
And ask the boy who would be king
Just show me love, just show me love
I'll never ask for anything
Just show me love, just show me love

I can't breathe, feed the black dog
Refuse to breathe, refuse to fuck
And oh, my love, she played a cool pinball
They told me it rained, yeah, they told me it rained

I give up, I give in
Just show me love, just show me love
You're never lost, I'll never win
Just show me love, just show me love
And ask the boy who would be king
Just show me love, just show me love
I'll never ask for anything
Just show me love, just show me love
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound
Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy monster sound

I give up, I give in
Just show me love, just show me love
You're never lost, I'll never win
Just show me love, just show me love
And ask the boy who would be king
Just show me love, just show me love
I'll never ask for anything
Just show me love, just show me love
I give up, I give in
Just show me love, just show me love
You're never lost, I'll never win
Just show me love, just show me love
And ask the boy who would be king
Just show me love, just show me love
I'll never ask for anything
Just show me love, just show me love
Just show me love, just show me love
Just show me love, just show me love
Just show me love, just show me love
Just show me love, just show me love
Just show me love, just show me love
Just show me love, just show me love3Embed
