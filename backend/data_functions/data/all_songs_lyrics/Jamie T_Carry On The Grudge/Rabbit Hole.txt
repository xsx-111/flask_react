Rabbit Hole Lyrics
Sold to a bid then hit by a buyer
Lift the lid on a kids, took the piss then retire
Paris said she get underhand
She'll always let you down when she knows that she can, well, ah
Like a SA80, my baby save me
Even played me and jammed in a sand, well, ah
Like a essay, she tried to correct me
She meant to protect me but only betrayed me now

You're too proud to call
Guess I never knew you at all
You stoop low
I got high tonight

La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
Still know you can call me whenever
I'm always 'round town, man, I'll be around forever
I'll take the blame and I'll take the weather
I'll travel overseas, sell the snow back to the favelas
A magnanimous life's gesture
Only for the sake of posterity
It's unanimous, I'll arrest her
Four days in the cells of the Bailey now

You're too proud to call
Guess I never knew you at all
You stoop low
I got high tonight

La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
Who noticed the problems
In Jennifer Bennett's head?
I swear, she's not the same person that I grew up with
She's not the same person I met
I said, who noticed the problems
In Jennifer Bennett's head?
I swear, she's not the same person that I grew up with
She's not the same person I left
I said who noticed the problems
In Jennifer Bennett's head?
I swear, she's not the same person that I grew up with
She's not the same person I left

La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah
La-di-da, she trips and stumbles
Go see Alice in the palace to crumble
La-di-da, she trips to tumble
Go and roll down a rabbit hole, and ah8Embed
