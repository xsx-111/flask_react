Love Is Only a Heartbeat Away Lyrics
So roll, roll down, rob a railroad train
Look like Robert Ford did Jessie James
Heart full of love but I'm only here to kill her
Fear that the devil may have spoke too soon
And ran through the room with a bottle of you
Fell down in a chair, that was where I heard him sing

And he sang, love is only a heartbeat away
Better save it for the darkest of your days
And he sang, love is only a heartbeat away
Better save it for the darkest of your days

So I raised my glass to the Holy Ghost
Father and Son that she loved the most
St. Peter, won't you please forgive her?
Turn yourself an old blind eye
Damn, heaven knows we tried
And now he's never heard Ma sing

And she sang, love is only a heartbeat away
Better save it for the darkest of your days
And she sang, love is only a heartbeat away
Better save it for the darkest of your days
And I know I wasn't around half as much as I couldâ€™ve
And I never let you say half as much as you would've
As you would've

So roll, roll down, rob a railroad train
Look like Robert Ford did Jessie James
Heart full of love but I'm only here to kill her
Remember me for mistakes I've made
I always did leave when I should've stayed
And oh, my sins taught me how to sing

And I sang, love is only a heartbeat away
Better save it for the darkest of your days
And I sang, love is only a heartbeat away
Better save it for the darkest of your days1Embed
