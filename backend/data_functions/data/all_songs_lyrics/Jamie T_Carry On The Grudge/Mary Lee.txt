Mary Lee Lyrics
Whenever I look out the window, I see her leave
Whenever I sleep on the pillow, I hear her breathe
Whenever I look back, I can't believe
What a stupid, drunk boy I was to let Mary leave

Trade blows with the foes, too young to grow
This skin just doesn't fit me
Too many souls have lost their hold
On reality wearing these
So I took a pinch of my Ma, pinch of my Pa
And measured my own body
And now I got a suit of class made to last
Off a man off New Bond Street

La-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
La-la, la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la

We're thick as thieves, hearts on sleeves
Searching for memories
Blowing off steam, just seventeen
Forgetting where we've been
So I took a tip from my Ma, tip from my Pa
And walked around my dreams
Found me in a car, driving far
Away from the places that I've seen

Whenever I look out the window, I see her leave
Whenever I sleep on the pillow, I hear her breathe
Whenever I look back, I can't believe
What a stupid, drunk boy I was to let Mary leave
Mary Lee, Mary Lee
Mary Lee, Mary LeeEmbed
