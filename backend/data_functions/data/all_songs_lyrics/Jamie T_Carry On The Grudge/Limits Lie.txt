Limits Lie Lyrics
It's flooding over you now, keep your chin up
I'm a hurricane
Came through the thunder, to drag you under
Make you take the blame
Remember me forever, I'm the weather
My tears are the rain
You're drowning together, I hope you're happy
Remember my name

Who knows where your limit, where your limit lies?
You're given what you're given and now the giver must die

I'm running, catching up, girl, keep your feet up
I'm straight to the vein
You fall through the floors, and you take it all, and
Now you feel the rain
Rolling down your cheeks, bleeding
Dripping to your feet, keep breathing
Stay with me

Who knows where your limit, where your limit lies?
You're given what you're given and now the giver must die
And the women you've forgiven who left you behind
Know your limit, where your limit, where your limit lies
Lump in a throat, too hard to swallow
I go down cold for coming up tomorrow
I will leave tracks, the footsteps back
From the attack where I trapped the love that I had
Said, lump in a throat, too hard to swallow
I go down cold for coming up tomorrow
I will leave tracks, the footsteps back
From the attack where I trapped the love that I had
Said, lump in a throat, too hard to swallow
I go down cold for coming up tomorrow
I will leave tracks, the footsteps back
From the attack where I trapped the love that I had, hey2Embed
