No Sense Lyrics
Do you remember?
Do you remember
That night at context?
Making up shit
Like we were animals

We made no sense
No sense
We had no sex

Can you see, can you see, can you see?
Can you see, can you see, can you see?
The moon is so hollow
What's the use?
When I can see right through you
What's the use?

All the hearts that touch your cheek
How they jump, they move, they embarrass
All the hearts that touch your cheek
How they jump, they move, they embarrass
They make no sense
No sense, no sense, no sense
We had no sex1Embed
