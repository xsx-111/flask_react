Colors and the Kids LyricsIt must be the colors and the kids
That keep me alive
'Cause the music is boring me to death
It must just be the colors and the kids
That keep me alive
'Cause I wanna go ride away
To a January night
I built a shack with an old friend
He was someone I could learn from
Someone I could become
Will you meet me down on a sandy beach?
We can roll up our jeans
So the tide won't get us below the knees
Yellow hair, you are a funny bear
Yellow hair, you are such a funny bear
Slender fingers would hold me
Slender limbs would hold me
And you could say my name
Like you knew my name
I could stay here
Become someone different
I could stay here
Become someone better
It's so hard to go in the city
'Cause you wanna say hello to everybody
It's so hard to go into the city
'Cause you wanna say "hey, I love you" to everybody
When we were teenagers, we wanted to be the sky
Now all we wanna do is go to red places
And try to stay out of hell
It must be the colors
And the kids that keep me alive
'Cause the music is boring me to death
It must just be the colors
And it must just be the kids
That keep me alive on this January night
Yellow hair, you are a funny bear
Yellow hair, you are such a funny bear6Embed
