Peking Saint LyricsIn Peking there
Is a son who
Is much greater
Than you want to be
Carnival arms have
A medical wonder
Who would have guessed that
It was not a real body part?
In Peking there
Is a mother
Who is laden
With who she has to be
Carnival arms have
A medical wonder
Who would have guessed that
Was not a real body part?
In Peking there
Is someone who
Is who they should exactly beEmbed
