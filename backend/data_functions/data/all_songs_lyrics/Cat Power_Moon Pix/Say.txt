Say LyricsLearn to say the same thing
Let us hold fast to saying the same thing
I hope all is well with you
I wish the best for you
When no one is around love will always love you
Learn to say the same thing
What defeats people is a double confession
One time they will confess one thing
And the next they will confess something else
Talk to them, they will say
Learn to say the same thing
Let us hold fast to saying the same thing
Never give up, no, never give up
If you're looking for something easy
You might as well give it up
Never give up, no, never give up
If you're looking for something easy
You might as well give it up
One time they will confess one thing
And the next they will confess the next
You talk to them, they will say
Learn to say the same thing
Let us hold fast to saying the same thingEmbed
