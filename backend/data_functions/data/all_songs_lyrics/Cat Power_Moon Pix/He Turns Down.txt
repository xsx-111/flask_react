He Turns Down Lyrics
Have you ever seen the face?
You know the one I'm talking about
Have you ever been to that place?
You know I'm not supposed to say

Have you ever seen the face?
You know the one I'm talking about
Have you ever been to that place?
You know the one I'm not supposed to say

Holding on for something
Have you ever held on?
Holding on for someone
Feels like holding on too long
Have you ever held on?

It's not me, I am pretending
I'm not saved, he turned me down
He turns down

It is so nice to meet you
Who's gonna look out for you?
It's not me, I am pretending
I'm not saved, he turned me down
He turns down

Have you ever seen the face?
You know the one I'm talking about
Have you ever been to that place?
You know the one I'm not supposed to say

Holding on for something
Have you ever held on?
Holding on for someone
Feels like holding on too long
Have you ever held on?

It's not me, I am pretending
I'm not saved, he turned me down
He turns downEmbed
