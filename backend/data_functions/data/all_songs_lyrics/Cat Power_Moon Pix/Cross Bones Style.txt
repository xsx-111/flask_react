Cross Bones Style LyricsOh, how time flies
With crystal clear eyes
And cold as coal
When you're ending with diamond eyes
Oh, come child
In a cross bones style
Oh, come child
Come and rescue me
Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds
And still
Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds
Oh, come child
In a cross bones style
Oh, come child
Come and rescue me
Cause you have seen some unbelievable things
Hater, I have your diamonds
And still, so still
Oh, how time flies
With crystal clear eyes
And cold as coal
When you're ending with diamond eyes
Oh, come child
In a cross bones style
Oh, come child
Come and rescue me
Cause you have seen some unbelievable thingsEmbed
