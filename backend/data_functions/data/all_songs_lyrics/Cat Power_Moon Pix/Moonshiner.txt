Moonshiner LyricsI've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I spent all my money
On whisky and beer
I go to some hollow
And set up my holy holy still
If drinking do not kill me
Then I don't know what will
I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Say if women and men would come to follow
To see what I might spend
God bless them handsome men
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet as
The dew on the holy holy vine
You're already in hell
You're already in hell
I wish we could go to hell
When the bottle gets empty
Then life ain't worth the drownEmbed
