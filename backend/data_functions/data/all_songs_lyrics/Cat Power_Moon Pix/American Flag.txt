American Flag Lyrics
My friend
Sits at the drum
His magic hand
Feels enough
Time, nothing but time

My old friend
Sits at the drum
His magic mind
Doesn't feel anything
American flag is behind
If I could stand
To be less difficult

My new friend
Plays drums all the time
Her magic heart
Feels everything
She plays the difficult parts
And I play difficult
She goes shoop shoop eh doo shoop eh doop
Shoop eh doop eh doop eh doo
We go shoop shoop eh doo shoop eh doo shoop eh
Doop eh doo
If I could stand
To be less difficultEmbed
