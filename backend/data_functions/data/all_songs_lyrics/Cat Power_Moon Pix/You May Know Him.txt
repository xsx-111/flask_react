You May Know Him LyricsOh Lord, heaven is the name that you sent me
Oh Lord, heaven is the name that you gave him
And then he came to life and he lived
All others strange because
Who could of thought that you
Meant so much to me?
Oh Lord, heaven is the name that you gave him
Surprised by the rise in sin
And you came through over and over again
Oh Lord, heaven is the place that you sent him
And you may know him
And you may know him, only you
Oh Lord I've never doubted for an instant
If we did what you say
And we'd do it everyday
If we did what you say
And we'd do it everyday
Oh Lord, heaven is the place he believed in
That's all you can do
Oh Lord, heaven is the name that you sent me
Oh Lord, surprised by the rise in sin, you came through
You came throughEmbed
