Back of Your Head LyricsBig monster
Big monster lover, bigger pusher over
Stands alone through most parts of life
Walks alone through most walks of life
See you looking through me
Like you unzipped a zipper
You hold the big picture so well
Can't you see that we're going to hell?
Couldn't park that fucking car
Couldn't part from you
Saw the back of your sweet mother's head
Now I know that she thinks I am dead
Burnt flavor
You hold the big picture so well
Can't you see that we're going to hell?
Big monster lover, bigger pusher over
Stands apart through most walks of life
Walks alone in most walks of lifeEmbed
