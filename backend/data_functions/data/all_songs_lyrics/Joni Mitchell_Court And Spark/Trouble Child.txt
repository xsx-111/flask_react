Trouble Child Lyrics
Up in a sterilized room
Where they let you be lazy
Knowing your attitude's all wrong
And you got to change and that's not easy
Dragon shining with all values known
Dazzling you, keeping you from your own
Where is the lion in you to defy him
When you're this weak and this spacey?

So what are you going to do about it?
You can't live life and you can't leave it
Advice and religion, you can't take it
You can't seem to believe it
The peacock is afraid to parade
You're under the thumb of the maid
You really can't give love in this condition
Still you know how you need it

They open and close you
Then they talk like they know you
They don't know you
They're friends and they're foes too
Trouble child, breaking like the waves at Malibu
So why does it come as such a shock
To know you really have no one
Only a river of changing faces
Looking for an ocean
They trickle through your leaky plans
Another dream over the dam
And you're lying in some room
Feeling like your right to be human is going over too

Well, some are gonna knock you
And some'll try and clock you
You know it's really hard to talk sense to you
Trouble child, breaking like the waves at Malibu2Embed
