All Hell Breaks Loose Lyrics
Walls start closing in around you
My twins of evil
They shake you by the collarbone
They snap your ribcage
And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall
Please be my partner
Eyeballs pop, accelerated blood beat
Veins a-shaking

And all hell breaks loose
Yeah, evil is as evil does, and who
Yeah, who but me could write this book of cruel

I send my murdergram
To all these monster kids
It comes right back to me and it's
Signed in their parents' blood

And all hell breaks loose
And my heart is a-breaking loose
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose
Yeah, and evil is as evil does and who
Yeah, but who but me could write this book of cruel
I send my murdergram
To all these monster kids
It comes right back to me and it's
Signed in their parents' blood
And broken bodies in a death rock dance hall
Please be my partner
And eyeballs pop, accelerated blood beat
Veins a-shaking

And all hell breaks loose
Yeah, my heart is a-breaking loose
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose
Well, evil is as evil does, and who
Yeah, but who but me could write this book of cruel

I said my whole world's breaking loose
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose
Yeah, my whole world's breaking loose
Yeah, my whole world's breaking
All hell breaks looseEmbed
