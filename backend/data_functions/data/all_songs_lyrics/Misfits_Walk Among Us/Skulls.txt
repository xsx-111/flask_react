Skulls Lyrics
Corpes all hanging headless and limp
Bodies with no surprises
And the blood drains down like the devil's rain
We'll bathe tonight

I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull

Demon, I am, and face, I peel
See your skin turned inside out, 'cause
Gotta have you on my wall
Gotta have you on my wall, 'cause

I want your skull
I need your skull
I want your skull
I need your skull, skull!

Collect the heads of little girls and
Put 'em on my wall
Hack the heads off little girls and
Put 'em on my wall
Hey! Hello!
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls
I want your skulls
I need your skulls, hey!2Embed
