Mommy, Can I Go Out and Kill Tonight? (Live) Lyrics
Yeah... Mommy!
One, two, three, four!
Singled out the kids who are mean to me
Gettin' straight A's but, they still make fun
I don't give a, I'll laugh last
Stayed in every night
Do my homework so I'll be smart
Girls all say I'm a little fucked
Mommy, I'm a good boy
Mommy, I'm a fuckin' savior
Mommy, I'm alive
Mommy, can I go out and kill tonight?

Rip the veins from human necks until they're wet with life
Razor-blades love teenage flesh, an epidermoty
I'll bring back a souvenir, for it's my mommy's dream

Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight?

Killed a girl on Lovers' Lane, I kept her toes and teeth
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep
I'll bring back a souvenir, for it's my mommy's dream
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight?

Killed a girl on Lovers' Lane, I kept her toes and teeth
Every night I stalk around until I find my keep, Mommy
I'll bring back a souvenir, for it's my mommy's dream

Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight?
Kill tonight, kill tonight?
Kill tonight, kill tonight?
Kill tonight, kill tonight?
Can I go out and kill tonight, kill tonight?
Kill tonight, kill tonight?
Kill tonight, kill tonight?
Kill tonight, kill tonight?

Yeah!Embed
