I Turned into a Martian Lyrics
One, two!

Possession of the mind is a terrible thing
It's a transformation with an urge to kill
Not the body of a man from Earth
Not the face of the one you love, 'cause

Well, I turned into a Martian (Woah-oh-oh)
I can't even recall my name (Woah-oh-oh)
Sometimes, I never hardly sleep at night (Woah-oh-oh)
Well, I turned into a Martian today

I walk down the city streets
On an unsuspecting human world
Inhuman in your midst
This world is mine to own, 'cause

Well, I turned into a Martian (Woah-oh-oh)
Well, I can't even recall my name (Woah-oh-oh)
Sometimes, I never hardly sleep at night (Woah-oh-oh)
Well, I turned into a Martian today!
Go!
Go!

Well, I turned into a Martian (Woah-oh-oh)
Well, I can't even recall my name (Woah-oh-oh)
Sometimes I never hardly sleep at night (Woah-oh-oh)
Turned into a Martian (Woah-oh-oh)
Can't even recall my name (Woah-oh-oh)
Oh won't you tell me, what the fuck is my name?
Martian (Woah-oh-oh)
(Woah-oh-oh)

(Whoo!)Embed
