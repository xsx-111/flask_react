Nike-A-Go-Go Lyrics
Go!
It's a missile girl (Missile girl)
In a missile world (Missile world)

Human tongue feels aluminum-plate
It's a missile boy, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Death machine and man in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Tracking system checks out pulse
All systems go, go go go go go
Rocket-blast fury with a manual sex-drive
Go go go go go

It's a missile girl
With a long white face
A missile girl, well

Nike is her name
You remember it, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Deadlier than any girl on any world
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Nike be good
Nike be everything woman's not
A go go go go go
Nike take my life along with yours
A go go go go go
It's a missile girl
With a long white face
It's a missile girl, well

Nike is the her name remember it
So pretty, go go
Nike take my life along with yours
So oretty, go go
Go
Go!

There I go and it's over
There I go and then it's over
There I go and then it's over
There I go and then it's over
There I go and then it's over
There I go and then it's over
There I go and then it's over
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go
There I go and then it's a go go, a go go
There I go and then it's overEmbed
