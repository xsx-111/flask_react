Vampira Lyrics
Two! One, two!
Hey!

Black dress moves in a blue movie
Graverobbers from outer space
Well, your pulmonary trembles in your outstretched arm
Tremble so wicked
Two inch nails
Micro waist
With a pale white feline face
Inclination eyebrows to there
Mistress to the horror kid
Cemetary of the white love ghoul, well
Take off your shabby dress
Come and lay beside me

Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer
Come a little bit closer to this

Vampira

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!1Embed
