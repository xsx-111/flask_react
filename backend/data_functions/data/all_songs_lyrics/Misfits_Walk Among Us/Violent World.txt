Violent World Lyrics
Hey!

Pregnant mothers in Mexico
Give birth to still-born monster babies
Hideous deformed two-headed monsters
Vivisected for your magazine essay

Come on, come on
Come on to the violent world with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the violent world with me

Nazi demons, Nazi youth
Wolverines in dark brown suits
Yeah, they shove it in an oven and it starts to cook
Blame it all on Nazi youth

But come on, come on
Come on to the violent world with me
Come on, come on
Come on to the violent world with me
Any opportunity comes
Can't afford to rot, so you move on
Any opportunity comes
Can't afford the Nazi movement

Come on
Come on
Come on

Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
Violent world
