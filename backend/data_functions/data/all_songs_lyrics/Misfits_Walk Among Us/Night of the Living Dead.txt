Night of the Living Dead Lyrics
No, oh-oh, whoa-oh
No
No

Stumble in somnambulance, so
Pre-dawn corpses come to life
Armies of the dead survivin'
Armies of the hungry ones
Only ones, lonely ones
Ripped up like shredded wheat
Only ones, lonely ones
Be a sort of human picnic

This ain’t no lovin'
This ain’t no happenin'
This ain't no feelin' in my arm

Oh
No
Oh
Oh
You think you're a zombie, you think it's a scene
Some monster magazine, well
Open your eyes too late
This ain't no fantasy for

This ain't no lovin'
This ain't no happenin'
This ain't no feeling in my arm

Oh
Oh
No
No
