End Times LyricsCrazy guy with a matted beard
Standing on the corner
Shouting out "end times are near"
And nobody noticed him
But I can hear him loud and clear
She is gone now, and nowhere near
Seems like end times are here
I walk around a puddle in the street
And head on home
Outside my window there's a cat in heat
Shut up, cat, and leave me alone
There ain't no heat on round here
I don't feel nothing now
Not even fear
Now that end times are here
Now everyone's crazy, they've lost their minds
Just look at the world
It could all be over at any old time
And I can hear it loud and clear
The world is ending, and what do I care?
She's gone, end times are hereEmbed
