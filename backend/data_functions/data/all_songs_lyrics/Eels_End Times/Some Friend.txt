Some Friend LyricsLoyalty is easy when you're king
Doesn't matter who's around to bring
Some friend you turned out to be
Looking cool but anyone can see
That you don't know where you're going to
But I have some idea
Count out (?) of everybody's wins
That's what'll finally do you in
Some friend you turned out to be
Looking cool but anyone can see
That you don't know where you're going to
But I have some idea
Sorry but I've got a train to catch
Gonna leave you and your schemes to hatch
Some friend you turned out to be
Looking cool but anyone can see
That you don't know where you're going to
But I have some ideaEmbed
