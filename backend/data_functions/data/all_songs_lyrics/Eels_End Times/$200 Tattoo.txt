$200 Tattoo LyricsIt was late, had some drinks
It was only our second date
She looked good, real, real good
I wanted to do what I could
I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking
How deep the water may be
But I knew this was it, we each said to get
A $200 Tattoo
It hurt a little, hell, it hurt a lot
But a man who won't commit is something I'm not
A little tear rolled down her face
When it was done we went back to her place
I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking
How deep the water may be
But I knew she's the one, and I'm telling you, son
I got a $200 Tattoo, she did too
