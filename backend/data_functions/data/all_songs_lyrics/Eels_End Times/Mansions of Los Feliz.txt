Mansions of Los Feliz LyricsWell, it's a pretty bad place outside this door
I could go out there, but I don't see what for
And I'm happy living here in the dark
On the edge of my mind
And it's nobody else's business
Now it's just me, myself
And the secrets that live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz
Well, the city's on fire you can smell the flesh
And the screams like dogs in the wilderness
And where all the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Like it's everyone else's business
And at best they'll find the secret
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz
Well, he's gone out again and left you all alone
Come on over, I'm always home
And where do the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Well, I do mean to make it my business
And it's just me, myself and the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los FelizEmbed
