In My Younger Days LyricsIn my younger days
This wouldn't have been so hard
I would've just shrugged it off
But now it's tough
I'm not so rough
I've got a little ways to go
It's not over yet, I know
But it feels
Not so far away
In my younger days
This still would've knocked me down
But I would've just bounced right back, you know
Now I'm a statistic
But I'm not fatalistic
I'm not yet resigned to fate
And I'm not gonna be ruled by hate
But it's strong
And it's filling up my days
In my younger days
I would've just chalked it up
As part of my ongoing education
But I've had enough
Been through some stuff
And I don't need any more misery
To teach me what I should be
I just need you backEmbed
