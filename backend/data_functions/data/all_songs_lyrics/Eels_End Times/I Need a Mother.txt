I Need a Mother LyricsI need a mother
I'm sorry but it's true
I need a lover
Not someone like you
I been your daddy for too long of a time
Need a little mothering just once in a while
I need a mother
I'm sorry but it's true
It's undercover, the way it's always been
I should have said something
But I didn't know where to begin
You've been taking everything I have to give
But I don't have no more
This ain't no way for me to live
I need a mother
I'm sorry, that's just how it is
I need a mother
It's really nothing new
A little help sometimes
That's just what you do
I been your daddy for too long of a time
Need a little help, you know
Just once in a while
I need a mother
I'm sorry, but it's trueEmbed
