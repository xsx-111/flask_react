Gone Man LyricsShe used to love me but it's
Over now
That was a good thing that's
Gone man, gone
I pass the hours
Just to get me by
Talk to the dog
So I know that I'm alive
I never thought that I should quit
All the stupid crazy shit that I do
In the name of
Keepin' good things away
Some things you can
Fuck right up
Other things
Well, you better not screw up
My problem was
That I could not see
What was important
Right in front of me
I never thought that I should quit
All the stupid crazy shit that I do
In the name of
Keepin' good things away
How much longer, man
For this Earth?
It's here today
But soon gone man, gone
The epitaph scratched upon my stone:
"Here lies a man who just wanted to be alone"
She used to love me but it's
Over now
That was a good thing that's
Gone man, gone
I take small comfort in a dying world
I'm not the only one who's
Feeling this painEmbed
