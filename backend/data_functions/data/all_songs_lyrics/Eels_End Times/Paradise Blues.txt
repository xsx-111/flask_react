Paradise Blues LyricsScary little suicide bomber
On the way to paradise
Gonna take yourself and be with her
Killin' once and killin' twice
Well it's a real hard time
Singin' the paradise blues
Kinda hard to blame somebody
For goin' to a better place
For thinkin' there's some kinda magic
Up there past outer space
Well that's some crazy-ass shit
Singin' the paradise blues
I'm gonna walk these filthy streets
I'm gonna raise my head
I may not be in paradise
Woo, but I'm not dead
Ain't gonna fly blind
Singin' these paradise blues
Your contempt and your sarcasm
It's all so transparent
Why don't you give up the act now, kid
Woo, and let some love in?
Cause that's all that we got
Singin' these paradise bluesEmbed
