Nowadays Lyrics(Something's not right, I don't understand)
Nowadays I keep to myself
Everybody else can look some other way
Things I say seem to get me into trouble
That I've been through for too many days
And trouble is a friend of mine
I'd like to leave behind
I like my friends more refined
Things I lose
Weighing on my heart
Every time I start to think
Maybe it's through
A little lie
Goes a long way when you can't say
Quite for sure what's the truth
The truth is something no one really
Wants to hear you say
Just how you doin and have a nice day
Nowadays you go for a walk
Better not stop and wave or say hello
Just this song
People will spit, give you shit
Just for looking at them
And for walking too slow
Slowly and methodically
I'll lock the world away
Haunted by my better daysEmbed
