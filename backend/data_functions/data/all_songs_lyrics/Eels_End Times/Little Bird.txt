Little Bird LyricsLittle bird
Hoppin' 'long my porch
I know it sounds kinda sad
But what's it all for
Right now you're the only friend I have in the world
And I just can't take how very much
Goddamn
I miss that girl
Little bird
You look alright
I'm sure its not easy
Getting through your night
So tell me this can't be how its gonna end
Tell me my heart somehow
Dear God
It's gonna mend
Little bird
I guess you're right
I can't let it take me out
Without a fight
Right now I can't see makin' sense of this world
I just can't take how very much
Goddamn
I miss that girlEmbed
