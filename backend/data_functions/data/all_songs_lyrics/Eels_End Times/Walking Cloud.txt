Walking Cloud LyricsWell I just heard it the other day
My little lady got things she don't say
In front of me and I'm not to proud
She tells her friends my name is walking cloud
Well it sounds to me like an indian name
And I'm not so sure that I want my fame
To hinge on the fact that I'm a bad egg
She says I'm like a big black cloud on legs
Well I'm not so bad I must defend myself
I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf
Well it's a crazy mixed up life
When it's hard for man and wife
To get along in a crowd
When you're walking cloud
Well I guess I can be such a bitter old fuck
And it's true that I've fallen on some pretty hard luck
But I think she's forgetting all the things we vowed
Ain't it wrong to call your man a walking cloud?
Cause I'm not so bad I must defend myself
I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf
Well it's a crazy mixed up life
When it's hard for man and wife
To get along in a crowd
When you're walking cloud
Well I just heard it the other day
My little lady got things she don't say
In front of me and I'm not to proud
She tells her friends my name is walking cloudEmbed
