Unhinged LyricsYou need help, baby, you've come unhinged
It's clear to everybody, you're on the fringe
Thought I'd stay until I died
But the twinkle in your eye is gone
And now all that's left is a mean old girl
Behind her crazy eyes
We were good together, as good as it gets
I only wanted to help you from the day we met
And I'm sleeping on the couch for months on end
You were more than my girl
You were my best friend
All that's left is a mean old girl
Behind her crazy eyes
I defy you to defy me
In your crazy state
You don't which way is up
And it's way too late
To ever fix all of the things
That you did break
Not least of which
Is my heartEmbed
