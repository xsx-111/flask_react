On My Feet LyricsOne, two, three
Two, two, three
I am a man
In great pain over
Great beauty
It's not easy
Standing on my feet
These days
But you know I'm pretty sure that
I've been through worse
And I'm sure I can take the hit
I pushed the bed against the window today
So there'd only be one side
Well, it's a little less lonely that way
But I'm still dying inside
When I wake up
In the middle of the night
No one's gonna tell me
I'll be all right
So many thousands
Of days in my life
That I don't remember
And a small handful
Of days that I do
Hold near to my heart
And one of those days
That I remember well
Is about me and you
When it's time
To look back on my life
Most of it won't seem so important
The shit that matters
And what I'll really miss
Is falling asleep with your arms around me
Waking up knowing that you're there
Making everything feel right in the world
People sleeping
In Hazmat suits
Taping up their windows
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world
And it's hard to make any sense of it
But one thing I know that is true in this world
Is the love that I felt for you
Being on my feet these days
Well, it's a wonder I survive
No one taught me how to live on my own
I'm running scared
One sweet day I'll be back on my feet
And I'll be all right
I just gotta get
Back on my feetEmbed
