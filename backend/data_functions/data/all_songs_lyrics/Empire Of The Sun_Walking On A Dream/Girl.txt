Girl LyricsI'm looking on the streets just to know your name
One million beats but they're not the same
Morning light streaming through my window pane
Being true just hold me close, like it was, just like it was
Three minutes since I've been at your door
All the dust has settled, so has the score
Still long for your touch
The feelings are my fault and not enough believe me now
Girl don't you pretend, girl can make amens
The desire, give a sign, that you are still mine
Girl don't you pretend, girl can make amens
The desire, give a sign, that you are still mineEmbed
