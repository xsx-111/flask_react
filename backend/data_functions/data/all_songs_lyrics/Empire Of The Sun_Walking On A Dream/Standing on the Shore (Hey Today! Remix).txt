Standing on the Shore (Hey Today! Remix) LyricsNoise, talk, noise, talk
Noise, talk, noise, talk
Standing on the shore
Waiting for the ship in call
There's something in the way I move that keeps them on their own
The stars explodes a storm
A billion seasons born
A shock to the waves I know, breaking far from shore
Noise, talk, noise, talk
The future's in my hands
I hold it in my palms
Engrave it the leylines running right down her arms
Speak in silent tongues
Lies reflect the times
The ghosts and the shadows fill the living scene
