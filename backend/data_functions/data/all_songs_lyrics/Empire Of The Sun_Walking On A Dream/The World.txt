The World LyricsI asked the world a question
When did you begin?
I asked him of his problems
When did you go wrong?
My singing cells have power
An army by my side
You so want my mind
You trick my time
And I run around and you're on your own
Without with without you say at home at home
How hard do you make it go?
No mothers and fathers to make us anymore
No arms or eyes to shape us
Like life itself
Then a thousand red coats scorn me
You so want my mind
You trick my time
And I run around and you're on your own
Without with without you say at home at home
How hard do you make it go?
You so want my mind
You trick my time
And I run around and you're on your own
Without with without you say at home at home
How hard do you make it go?
It's just a memory
Billions and billions of lights and hearts
Befalling to embers through to coal
Save from dust to dust
To wind to desert to death
I asked the world a question
When did you begin?
I asked him of his problems
When did you go wrong?
Those lead you who wake from the dreams which lies and shapes the farm in their eyesEmbed
