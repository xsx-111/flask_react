Romance to Me LyricsI haven't seen you in ages
But it's not as bleak as it seems
The tears have stained all the pages
It is all a romance to be
Since you've been gone, I've faded
But I reach out and you go forth
My ears have gone in phases
It is all a romance to me
Romance to me
Romance I see
There's a joy in my eyes, I can't deny
But only to those who knows me
Replaced by the sadness and longing
Is the romance you'd given to me
I still hear the bells when I walk
But the movie has changed its key
I'm touched by your breath as I sleep
It is all a romance to me
Romance to me
Romance I see
Romance to me
