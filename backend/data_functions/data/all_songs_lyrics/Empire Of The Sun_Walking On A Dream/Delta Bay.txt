Delta Bay Lyrics
When about midnight roosters at the hip tight
Played the blues with Cool Kite
Shot a round with Heather Smite
Mixed my drinks with Mia Town
Smoked hip hop with Roger Down
Dulled the lights from 5th Ave
Played the colours Jonny Par

Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay

Chord a light, paralight abyss
New tricks, moonlight
Sad sumo, silly sea

Counting truth death in a Hollywood scene
Rimmed shot, joked lot, heard the point of towns...

Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
Down at Delta Bay
Then I got a phone call
I saw you on the new shore
Tapping teeth in lifestyle
Moving guards like Tim Know
When I got a phone call
I saw you on new show
Tapping teeth in lifestyle
Tapping teeth in lifestyle

Chord a light, paralight abyss
New tricks, moonlight
Sad sumo, silly sea

Counting truth death in a Hollywood scene
Rimmed shot, joked lot, heard the point of towns cup
Leant back, flipped up, met the mayor, drinks up
Had a smoke, angry yoke, who spoke in tongues and dreamed a lot

Chord a light, paralight abyss
New tricks, moonlight
Sad sumo, silly sea
Counting truth death in a Hollywood scene
Rimmed shot, joked lot, heard the point of towns cup
Leant back, flipped up, met the mayor, drinks up
Had a smoke, angry yoke, who spoke in tongues and dreamed a lot
Never been to nowhere town, always knew the mind in dockEmbed
