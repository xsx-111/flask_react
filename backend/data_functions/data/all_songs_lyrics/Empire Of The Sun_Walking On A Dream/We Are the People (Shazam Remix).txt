We Are the People (Shazam Remix) Lyrics(We are the people...)
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
(We are the people...)
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
(We are the people...)
I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us
I know everything about you
You know everything about me
Know everything about us
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
I can't do well when I think
You're gonna leave, but I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can't you be believing now?
(We are the people...)Embed
