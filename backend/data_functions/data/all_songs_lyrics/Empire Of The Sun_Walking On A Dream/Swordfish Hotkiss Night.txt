Swordfish Hotkiss Night LyricsGot you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it

Swordfish hotkiss night
Breathing to the beat
Push it in the wind
Calling all the life forms
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Kings Cross hot shot
Jesus Christ on web blog
Cowboy at a cop shop
Tiger in a drug store
Days go by days
All we do is roll on
Days show my ways
When I when I when I when I
Hotdog belt donut melt
Magpie knelt by itself
Monster goons magnet moves
Diamonds in a harlot douche
Days go by days
All we do is roll on
Days show my ways
When I when I when I when I
Dream
Mansion in my mouth
Money's gone south
Sherbet in my shout
Tongue lashed out
Mansion in my mouth
Money's gone south
Sherbet in my shout
Tongue lashed out

Dream
Days go by days
All we do is roll on
Days show my ways
When I when I when I when I when I
Days go by days
All we do is roll on
Days show my ways
When I when I when I when I when I

Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Money's gone south
Sherbet in my shout
Jesus Christ on web blog
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Money's gone south
Sherbet in my shout
Tiger in a drug store
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Money's gone south
Sherbet in my shout
Jesus Christ on web blog
Got you everything I wanted when I wasn't sitting on it
Money's gone south
Sherbet in my shout
Tiger in a drug store1Embed
