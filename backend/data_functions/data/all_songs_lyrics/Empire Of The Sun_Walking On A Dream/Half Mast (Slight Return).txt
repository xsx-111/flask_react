Half Mast (Slight Return) LyricsCome on now can we talk about it like we used to talk about
Hotel in the hills with a carousel
Farmhouse in the front a tractor in the lounge
Oh oh oh honey I need you round I know I know
Listen now can we talk in love and walk the town
Be easy now, go hiking through the hills in a summer gown
Raise the kids, peace within and make our sound
Hear me now, I'm down on knees and praying
Though my faith is weak
Without you so please baby please give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand until the end
A million times a trillion more
Oh oh oh honey I need you round I know I know
Smile baby don't cry
I will only fly with you by my side
Baby I'm cornered now
Baby don't push me out
Lately I walk in doubt
Maybe it's crashing down
Baby can you save it now
Oh oh oh honey I need you round I know I know
Oh oh oh honey I need you round I know I know
Baby I'm cornered now
Baby don't push me out
Lately I walk in doubt
Maybe it's crashing down
Baby I'm cornered now
Baby don't push me out
Lately I walk in doubt
Maybe it's crashing down4Embed
