Breakdown LyricsYou gotta let up
Hallucinate, dream space
An effigy, shadow play
Harmonize, no escape
Pressurize, everybody now 'til they say
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
She's gone crazy
For real, or just me?
She's addressed, but can she sing?
Where's the truth - in the tongue?
Pressurize, everybody now 'til they say
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
Sound it out
She's gone crazy
You gotta let up
Or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up
Or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up
Or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up
Or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up
Or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let up
Or you're headed for a breakdown
You gotta let upEmbed
