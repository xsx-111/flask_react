Visionaire LyricsWith a solar knife I split the sky
And walk right in between
To search the answers to every "why?"
Where I have seen the unseen
I stole the colour of the night
To get out of your sight
I am the Visionaire
Follow me if you dare...
I count the stars in my hands
And dream myself strong
To watch them twinkle on my command
As once a year in midwinter songs
I stole the colour of the night
To get out of your sight
I am the Visionaire
Follow me if you dare...Embed
