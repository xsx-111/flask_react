The Ar Lyrics
Within the heart of every man
This symbol is its deep
A truly all-descending power

You may put your hands before your eyes
But its gleam it's neverending
How much you turn it inside out
It conceals just understanding

"The five pointed grey star carven
The sign of the Aryan Race
The five pointed grey star carven
On the forehand of an evil face"Embed
