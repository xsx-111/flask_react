Dice Behind Your Shades LyricsDice behind your shades
Roll the dice behind your shades
Everybody's trying to make you feel stupid
And you know they're lyin'
'Cause their lips are moving
Bet this one is twice your age
Come on
Roll the dice behind your shades
Roll the dice behind your shades
Safer way to be strange
Roll the dice behind your shades
The avant garde unlock the door
You're takin' notes and nothing more
A guy snaps your picture on roller blades
Come on roll the dice behind your shades
Roll the dice behind your shades
Safest way to be strange
Roll the dice behind your shades
Take it to a higher place
Where this world ain't in your face
You and me, Carson McCullers
Take it to a higher plane
Take me where the action ain't
Open windows
Open shutters
Bet this one is twice your age
Ohhhh...
The avante gardes unlock your cage
And you're sick to death of the latest rage
Afraid of love it always fades
Come on
Roll the dice behind your shadesEmbed
