Even Here We Are LyricsBeautiful flowers in your garden
But the most beautiful by far
The one growing wild in the garbage dump
Even here even here we are
Song of the bird lives in the sky
But the most beautiful by far
Scream of the man who never learned to fly
Even here even here we are
Sun shines bright, it's a beautiful sight
But the most beautiful by far
Is the blind girl alone with the angel of the night
Even here even here we areEmbed
