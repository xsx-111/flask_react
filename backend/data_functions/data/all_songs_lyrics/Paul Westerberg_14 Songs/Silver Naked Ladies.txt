Silver Naked Ladies Lyrics1-2-3-4
Road maps and bra staps
8 tracks and mud flaps
I don't give a damn
Cause I'm a free old man
Pulled it right up
Shoot her the shadey
All that I want
Is silver naked lady
I sink and I swim
Down the road again
I hook; I cook
What you doing tonight
Pulled it right up
Pulled her nice caddie
All that I want
Is silver naked lady
Lets please please please please
Silver naked lady
Road maps and bra staps
8 tracks and mud flaps
Don't give a damn
Cause I'm a free I'm a free I'm a free old man
Pull her right here
Put her nice caddie
All that I want
Is silver naked ladyEmbed
