Black Eyed Susan LyricsTwo
Beads of sweat glimmer to the ground
Golden tears shimmer soft and round
Throwing small shadows
I catch those that fall at my feet
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
See your slight body relax
Soon your young veins will collapse
Still throwing small shadows
Catch those that fall at my feet
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
Painted your curb, they know where to park
Painted your face, can't find you in the dark
Goodnight girl come on dance with me
See the bright pearls sink in the sky of ebony
Throwing small shadows
I catch those that fall at my feet
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
Throwing small shadows
God knows you move with ease
Throwing small shadows
Catch those that fall at my feet
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
Black-Eyed Susan dancing just for me
Black-Eyed Susan dancing in the breeze
Mmm just for me
Mmm just for meEmbed
