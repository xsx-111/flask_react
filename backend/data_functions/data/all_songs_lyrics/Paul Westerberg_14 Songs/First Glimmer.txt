First Glimmer LyricsDo you remember me long ago
Used to wear my heart on my sleeve
I guess it still shows
We watched the sun fall down and
I hop on my bike, still that night
You're my first glimmer of light
You were my...You was my first
Glimmer of light
And the leaves were burning up in the street
I guess they tore that bridge out
Where we used to meet
And no one can see there
You're my first glimmer of light
You were my...You was my first
Glimmer of light
Wore my jacket and I wore your sweater
Underneath the bridge was an Indian summer
Purple mascara, safety pins kickin' the dirt
Took off your jacket, took off my sweater
And we made a wish things would never be better
Train whistle blew, my wish was heard
You were the first glimmer of light
You was my first glimmer of light
You're my first glimmer of light
You was my first
You was my first
Wore my jacket and I wore your sweater
Underneath the bridge was an Indian summer
Purple mascara, safety pins God did it hurt
Took off my jacket, took off your sweater
And we made a wish things would never be better
Train whistle blew, my wish came true
You was my first glimmer of light
You was my first glimmer of light
You was my first glimmer of light
You was my first glimmer of light
Oh baby now
Yes you were
Oh baby now
Yes you wereEmbed
