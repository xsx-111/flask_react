Someone I Once Knew LyricsI was smoking a roundie
Thank God you found me
All by myself
And then you bounced through the door like nobody else
Hey you someone I once knew, sit your butt down
Hey you someone I once knew, sit your butt down
Watchin' my Japanese TV
With my six string buddy
I was barely tickin'
And then you bounced through the door come alive and kickin'
Hey you someone I once knew, sit your butt down
Hey you someone I once knew, sit your butt down
You got brains, all the way down
You never changed
I just never got past
The ones you sit on
Hey you someone I once knew, sit your butt down
You got brains all the way down
You've never changed
I just never got past
Your little rock & roll ass
Shot bolt upright
When you mention the whole night
I was on the mend when
You let a smile crack
And it all came back
Hey you someone I once knew
Hey you someone I once knew, sit your butt downEmbed
