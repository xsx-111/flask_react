Mannequin Shop LyricsYou look fine a little strange. been working out? losing weight?
You got that hunger and I can see
You're looking younger than you're supposed to be
One little nip, one little tuck ohhh you're looking hip
You never never stop
Chop chop mannequin shop
The mannequin shop
You look bitching you look taut
I'm a itchin to know what was bought?
Are those yours? Are those mine?
Are they paid for? Its a lie
One little nip, one little tuck ohhh you're looking hip
You never never stop
Chop chop mannequin shop
The mannequin shop
You're looking great
You're losing face
You're looking fine
My little Frankenstein
Mannequin shop
Chop chop mannequin shop
You've got the face that you chose
Honey, can you spare a nose?
You're looking great
You're losing face
You look fine a little strange. been working out? losing weight?
Are those yours? Are those mine?
Are they paid for? Its a lie
One little nip one little tuck ohhh you're looking hip
Good enough to.......
