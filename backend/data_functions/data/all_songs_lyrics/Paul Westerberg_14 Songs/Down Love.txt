Down Love LyricsI'd love to turn you way way down
I've got to turn you way way down
If I could only find your volume
If I could only find your volume knob
You're always up to no damn good
Up to my neck in Hollywood
I'd love to turn you way way on
Only find your volume knob
Keep it down down down love down
Keep it down love I hear ya
Keep it down love down down love
Keep it down love I hear ya
Oh yeah
Beat me on the top
Keep it down love down down down
Keep it down love I hear ya
Keep it down love down down love
Keep it down love I hear ya
When its free, is it all right if I left
Don't ask me
Love is deaf
Love is deaf
Love is deaf
If I could only find your volume knob
Love to turn turn you back down
Keep it down love down down love
Keep it down love I hear ya
Keep it down love down down love
Keep it down love I hear yaEmbed
