Something Is Me LyricsYou've gotta get something off of your chest
Well Something is me and let me guess
Something always changes eventually
Well something is me (something is me)
Now something is me (something is me)
Through the top of the porch, through the top of the wall
Something went wrong, my name is Paul
Something always happens eventually
Well something is me (something is me)
Something is me (something is me)
Something something something something
Something something something something
Eventually Something is me (something is me)
Woe is me (something is me)
Something something something something
Something something something something
Whose suicide are you on?
Take a left turn, you hop on my lawn
Something's got to grow eventually
I know something is me (something is me)
Something is me (something is me)
Something something something something
Something something something something
Gotta take something to make you feel good
Something ain't me but I wish it could
Finally find something to believe
Something is me (something is me)
Something is me (something is me)
Something is me (something is me)Embed
