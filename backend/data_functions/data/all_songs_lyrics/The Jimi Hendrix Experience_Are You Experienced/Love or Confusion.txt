Love or Confusion Lyrics
Is that the stars in the sky, or is it
Rain falling down
Will it burn me if I touch the sun, yeah
So big, so round
Would I be truthful, yeah, in
Choosing you as the one for me?
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?

My mind is so messed up
Going round and round
Must there be all these colours
Without names, without sound, baby?
My heart burns with feeling, but
Whoa my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?


Oh my head is pounding, pounding
Going round and round and round and round
Must there always be these colours
Without names, without sound?
My heart burns with feeling
Oh but my mind, it's cold and reeling
Is this love, baby
Or is it just confusion?
Oh, tell me baby
Is this love or confusion?
Mama, we must get together and find out
Exactly what we're trying to do
Love or confusion?
