Once or Twice Lyrics
Oh girl, I looked you over once or twice
I think that you are very nice
And you're just meant for me
Hey girl, I think you got a messed up mind
But if you will take some time
Baby, I can set you free, oh

Well I'm not trying to be
What I am not
But I think what you need
Is what I got
Hey honey, won't you give me the time
To  with me?

Girl, I'm no philosopher
But I can offer you that cure
To mend your broken heart, hey
I know that you are not blind
I know you see my messed up mind
Yes, you see my broken heart too

So won't you bring your heart
And your mind that's out on the run?
Fuse them with my broken heart
In my mind we'll be one
Hey honey, won't you give me all your loving
Loving, loving, loving? Oh girl
Loving, loving, one more time
I miss you, my baby

So won't you bring your heart
And your mind that's out on the run?
Fuse them with my broken heart
In my mind we'll be one

Girl, I looked you over once or twice
I think that you are very nice
And you're just meant for me
Hey girl, yes, I think you got a messed up mind
And now that you know yours is
Just like mine
Baby, won't you set me free?
Oh, just because  your loving  could do 
Don't you notice little  in this song?Embed
