Together Again Lyrics
The lonely days I spend away from you
Sometimes seem like they will never end
But then I picture the glow of your smiling face
And I can make it through the lonely days and nights
Until I'm home

With you
Where we
Can see
And feel
Our love
Together again
My friend


The lonely nights I spend away from you
Are filled with memories of your dancing eyes
I feel I can make it through another day, yeah, yeah, yeah
Knowing that you'll be waiting to kiss me
Tenderly when I get home

With you
Where we
Can see
And feel
Our love
Together again
Together
My friend
Ooh, together, love
Together
Together, my friend, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Together, my friend
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I miss you, my friendEmbed
