Scrapbook Lyrics
Hey Pete
C'mon, you got your name on the album
Everybody ready?
Are you ready?
Let's go
Let's play it
What happened to that part?
What happened to that part?
One, two, three, four
Here we go

Six sets smoked on Saturdays
At Barnaby's on State
Countless California calls
We could not stand the wait
We played the pier on Venice beach
The crowd called out for more
Zappa and the Mothers next
We finished with a roar
Jimi was so kind to us
Had us on the tour
We got some education
Like we never got before
Around the world in twenty days
We played most every night
Jet-lag, girls, strange languages
Everyone began to fight
Lowdown at the Caribou
All rumors aside
Was we could never get together
Not unless we tried
Summer with the Beach Boys
We got sand all in our shoes
Made some special music
Everybody sang the bluesEmbed
