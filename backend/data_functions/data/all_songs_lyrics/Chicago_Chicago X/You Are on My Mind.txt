You Are on My Mind Lyrics
You are on my mind
The echo of your laughter flowing through me
Sitting by a mountain fire
And wishing you were in my arms
And loving me completely
Nah, nah, no
Rocky mountain highs are very nice
But you are gone and nothing's quite the same, no, no
L.A. is so far away and I can't
Stand another day
Without you by my side
Though I've tried, tried, tried

You are on my mind
You are everything a woman could be
Consequently I believe that no one
Else could take your place
If you should ever leave me
I'll be coming home again to you
And look upon the woman that I love, love, love
There is nothing I can say
That celebrates the special way
You keep me satisfied, pretty girl
Yeah, yeah
Feeling just a little lonely
Wishing you were in my arms, yeah

You are on my mind
The echo of your laughter flowing through me
Sitting by a mountain fire (Ooh)
And wishing you were in my arms
And loving me completely
Rocky mountain highs are very nice
But you are gone and nothing's quite the same, no, no
L.A. is so far away and I can't
Stand another day
Without you by my side
Keep the fires burning

Keep the fire burning, oh
Keep the fire burning, oh
Keep the fire burning, oh
Keep the fire burning, ohEmbed
