Mama Mama Lyrics
I can feel the magic
Suddenly it's all around
I can see it clearly
And I can even hear the sound

It's all so new to me
I'm not the same
If this is love
Then you're to blame, ooh baby

Mama, mama when you look at me
I see love in your eyes
Mama, mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes

You are all I live for
Maybe that's enough to say
And you're the one I wrote this song for
Everywhere and every way

It's all so new to me
I'm not the same
It's words I feel
But can't explain, ooh mama
Mama, mama when you look at me
I see love in your eyes
Mama, mama softly sweet tender love in your eyes

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mama mama, mama mama
I really love you
I really I need you
Mama mama, mama mama
I really need you, mama
I really love you, mamaEmbed
