Skin Tight Lyrics
Skin tight
Fits me like a glove
Your love is
Skin tight
Yes, indeed it is
Your love is
Alright
Anytime of day or night
Is alright
Baby, you're
Skin tight

Skin tight
Fits me like a glove
Your love is
Skin tight
Only you can keep me going
All night (All night)
Love me till the cows come home
It's alright (It's alright)
Skin tight

Skin tight
Fits me like a glove
Your love is
Skin tight
Mhm, yes, indeed it is
Your love is
Alright (It's alright)
Any time of day or night
Is alright
Your body is
Skin tightEmbed
