Juke Box Fury LyricsPolly and I went to the circus
Polly got hit with a rolling pin
We got even with the circus
We bought tickets but we didn't go in...
You won't like it here
When I first take you
He's in the back doing his Father O'Riley for the cops
But you'll like Woody
(He's hiding in the shed)
And we're going with him
I told my brother...
When the Police come
Don't say nothing
Don't say nothing
And the Police will go
Cuz they don't like it
When you beat them to the punch
They don't like it
When you come in on a hunch
And I've seen more dreams
Riding on his eyes
Than a sure thing like
The Starry Skies
And you'll like it when you find out what he's got
In the backyard
By the parking lot
Hey Baby, you're my favorite boy
I think about you all the time
And this garbage that you still employ
Do they really pay for every line?
For the Juke Box Fury
Pounding in your soul
Juke Box Fury tells them where to go
Juke Box Fury pounding in your head
Juke Box Fury every vvord we said when
We were younger
And they hurt us so
But you never know...
You got a Juke Box
You can make it even
Look, I don't like it here
This is trouble
That guy keeps gettin'up
That girl keeps goin'over to the phone
I'm going to talk to them
(You just watch me)
I'm going to tell them;
"I think you two look like you're ready to go.."
Put your foot right here
D'you get it down all right, dear?
Well, put your foot right here...
Here, baby
You're the one for me
This must be Paradise
She's never where you think she'll be
But don't worry about it
Cuz the Juke Box Fury's
Pounding in your soul
Juke Box Fury knows where to go
Juke Box Fury pounding in vour head
Juke Box Fury every word we said
When we vvere younger
And they hurt us so
But you never knovv...
You don't knovv vvhat you've got
You can make it even!
You got a Juke Box!
You can make it even...
