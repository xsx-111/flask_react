Rorschachs (The Unsigned Painting / The Weird Beast) Lyrics

There must be a golden frame
Coming to me
‘Cause where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

The day where you first heard
Your heart beat listens for you still
So I think it’s not so much the painting
As it is what you give yourself by what you leave
Your signature

On Sundays the ladies took off their wiry, old hats
And made donuts in the back of the church
I could always smell them cooking
In the middle of Mass

Cakes were prizes at carnivals
And holding hands
Was a gift of our landscapes
Because the heart is always
That one summer night
And you stretch it from face to face
Like chewing gum
You can rig it up and hear each other through a tin can
But now it bakes and hardens like an old dream
Under the front porch
Where the air is talcum
And my Mamma’s eyes are blue
And Father took the Weird Beast
And we’re walking next to you
That is the picture I see
That is the picture I see


I brought the Weird Beast here
From Van Nuys Boulevard
So I would not be without a man
(Someday you’ll meet a stranger)
When the Tartars reign
(Locations everywhere you go)
Flooded the empty streets of Paris
(All of the science you’ve kept in bottles)
Because (Someday this dream is going to end)
I have this feeling
And on one of these
Passing boats I thought
(A Weird Beast is going to come our way)
I saw the Weird Beast
Speaking in the Russian tongue
Will he kill the Czar?
Will he kill the Czar?

Draw the Weird Beast
Draw the Weird Beast everywhere you go
Death speaks the foreign language so
Make sure they hear him breathingEmbed
