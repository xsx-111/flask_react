Deep Space LyricsThese stars
No one else can see
Trapeze the height of thee
Vanish as they call
These blues
No one else can hear
No one else can sing
This one for you
Can they, dear?
Things that you do are always with me
When you're laughing
You're always here
What's the use in crying?
It won't matter when we're old
This tear will
Finally fall
Keep your eyes here
When there's no net at all
Where the Lord's face
Is an all-night cafe
There's a woman who will wait on
What you have to say
And your dreams are like marbles
In the pocket of a little boy
And they whisper when you hold them
Like a beautiful girl
Beautiful girlEmbed
