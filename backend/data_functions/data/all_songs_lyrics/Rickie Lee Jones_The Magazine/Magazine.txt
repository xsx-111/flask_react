Magazine LyricsHomeboys
Calling from the corners
Station to station
For the magazine
But her pages are turning
Out the lights in the windows
And all that you're reading
Is the braille night
I can't come out
And play Paddy with
The Precinct boys no more
But you and me baby
We'll be lovers again
But she's walking to the A
Walking to the B
Walking to the C now
Where are you going?
I'm just going with him...
He could be anywhere
I don't know where he is
I know he's coming
I know he's coming to me
It could be anyday
I will know right away
I'll know he's Coming
I'll know he's Coming to me
I'll know he's Coming
I'll know he's Coming to me now...
I don't think you know
What you're doing
I don't think you know
That she'll make him cry
Make my baby cry
Cuz you'll break my heart
Carol, Carol, Carol
There's a flagboy
Calling danger
Watch you're back now
Hey you. Flagboy
Let'em come, let'em come
Cuz I can see them there
I can see them coming
I can see it all now
Hey you, Flagboy
Let'em come
They don't know where I am
I could be anywhere
I know they're coming
I know they're coming to me
It could be anyday
I will know right away
I know they're coming...
I know they're coming to me
I know they're coming
Everything's Coming
Everything's Coming to me
Everything's Coming
