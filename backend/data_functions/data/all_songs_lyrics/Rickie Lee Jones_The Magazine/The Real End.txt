The Real End LyricsOnce I had a sweet love
Always followed me around
The way I treated my little lamb was like
The Marquis D. Sade and Her new clown
I guess I hurt him
I guess I hung up
I guess I should have called him back
I guess I didn't care
Maybe I left him there
Maybe a woman just acts like that
What's a matter?
Hey baby, baby
What's a matter?
Don't you want me?
What's a matter?
Now Baby, baby
What's a matter?
Is this The Real End?
Well, I had some dough
I had a big car
I turned around and all the money was spent
I don't know wherever it goes but
That's probably where my baby went
So you got a New boy
He's so fine
He wants to be with you
All the time
Don't tell him he's the only one
Or your New boy becomes a Hard to find
What's a matter?
Hey baby, baby
What's a matter?
Don't you want me?
What's a matter?
Now Baby, baby
What's a matter?
Is this The Real End?
Can I tell you about it?
Once you find yourself
A Better man
Treat him special all of the time
Make him some catfish
Fry it up in bed
Don't leave him hangin' on the telephone line
But keep him guessing
Don't tell him where you are
Keep your old linen to yourself
Keep your bank account
And what you don't worry about
If you can give
Well, it i'ust might work out
What's a matter?
Hey baby, baby
What's a matter?
You look so funny
What's a matter?
Now Baby, baby
What's a matter?
Is this the real
Real End?Embed
