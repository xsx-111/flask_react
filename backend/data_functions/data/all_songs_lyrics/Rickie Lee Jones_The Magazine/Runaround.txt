Runaround LyricsMy baby's alvvays crying
My baby wants to see me cry, too
Chain on my heart is going to break
Cuz every tear that falls in here
Is a dime for the Juke Box Fury
So punch it in
Shake the chain
And listen to the song you're playing
Shake the chain, Shake the chain
At everything I do
Just enough
Everything I wanted to
Just enough
Everything I put you through
Just enough to know
He don't want me
Oh, I think he's polorized
He don't know which way to go
Where would vou be otherwise?
Otherwise? Well, you know we could
Runaround
Because I can get this anyway
Runaround
I can get this anyway
Runaround
L can get this anyway
Light goes down
Somebody could break your heart
Light goes on
You could break somebody's heart
Chain on mv heart is going to break
Every time you try to make me cry
Listen to it now
Punch it in
Shake the chain
I can't take the tears
I can't take the tears
Shake the chain, shake the chain
At everything I do
Just enough
And everything I wanted to
Just enough
And everything I put you through
Just enough to know
He don't want me
Oh, you better wise up girl
You better get smart
You better hide your heart
He's a Runaround
And I could get this anyway
Runaround
I can get this anyway
Runaround
I can get it anyway
Take a deep breath
And break the chainEmbed
