Automatic Lyrics
Au-to-matic

Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Repeat above

I remember when I fell for you
It wasn't when I wanted to
But you were acting so into me (Au-to-matic)
Went real good for a month or two
Just like every relationship
We got off on the trust tip
And can't get it, baby (Au-to-matic)

I knew when you start to change
We could never be the same
I could do it when you do it to me (Au-to-matic)
I knew if it came to be
We would get a chance to see
A side of each other
That we both didn't know(Au-to-matic)
(What do you do?)
To make me feel so good for so long
(Then take it back)
And expect me to be alone
(I can be cool)
But if you're gonna do me wrong
(I'll get you back)
Baby that's just, just automatic (Au-to-matic)

I remember when I met
The man with all the confidence
Every day was promises to me (Au-to-matic)
Then you stepped way out of line
Cheat on me too many times
I'm tryin' put you down
On what comes around goes back around, yeah (Au-to-matic)

I knew when you start to change
We could never be the same
I could do it when you do it to me (Au-to-matic)
I knew if it came to be
We would get a chance to see
A side of each other
That we both didn't know(Au-to-matic)
(What do you do?)
To make me feel so good for so long
(Then take it back)
And expect me to be alone
(I can be cool)
But if you're gonna do me wrong
(I'll get you back)
Baby that's just, just automatic (Au-to-matic)

(What do you do?)
To make it feel so good, baby
(Then take it back) (Au-to-matic)
And I wanted to be your lady
(I can be cool)
But if you're gonna act crazy
(I'll get you back)
Baby that's just, just automatic (Au-to-matic)

Oooh ooh
Ooooh ooh
That's..Just...Au-to-matic
Oooh ooh
Ohh ohh
(What do you do)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just
(Then take it back)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just oh
(I can be cool)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just
(I'll get you back)
That's just, just automatic
That's just, just baby (Au-to-matic)
(What do you do)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
(Then take it back) (Au-to-matic)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
(I can be cool)
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
(I'll get you back)

Baby that's just, just automatic
