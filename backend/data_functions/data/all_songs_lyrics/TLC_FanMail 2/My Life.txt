My Life Lyrics
Hah, ha, ha, ha (T-L-C)
Whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whooa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (oww!)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (T-L-C)
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me

Y'all been telling me what to do
Since I was old enough to walk
Old enough to talk
Never let me speak or move
Do my own thang
But now I've grown wiser now
Brighter now
A little bit tighter now
And y'all can't hold me down
I know you hate to hear
But things have changed in

My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me
I'm getting sick and tired of folks who wanna come around
Claim they gon' get down
But all they wanna do is see me make a wrong move, yeah
I don't care what you hear in the news
Or see who I choose to do the late night creep with
I'm gonna do just what I wanna do
It's my life

My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me

Whoa whoa whoa (Ohh hoo)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (Ohhh)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (Ooohh)
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa no (Ooh ooh)
And I believe it don't affect nobody else but me
Sometimes I might get a little crazy
And sometimes I might seem out of hand
But I'm sayin' life's too short for me to let you dictate
What I say and the moves I make
I'm sick of people tryna tell me what to do
It's my life and I'mma live it like I want to!

Check it
Another day another dollar
Is the reality of my mentality
Otherwise don't even botha (Uh huh)
You see my father was a wise old man
Always creatin' a plan for me to conquer this land (T-L-C)
He said I am what I am
So be the best that I can
And if them others don't like it
Then why should I give a damn (huh)
Maybe so cause when his life wasn't right (T-L-C)
My mother picked up them pieces
Continued on with the fight
So now it's plain to me
It ain't no game to me
See mom and dad corrected math, 1 and 1 equal 3
4 and 5 I count my sister and brother
Stay alive till we die
And don't you ever be worried
Cause I'm down with the ride
Through peaks and valleys, no Crescent Hills
Tumble down, I'll set a new ground for Jack and Jill's
Ever wonder what put the thunder deeply in my eyes?
Take a look and you'll find the sunshine
My life, my life, my life
My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me
My life
It's kinda wild but, me and my style stuck
Now everybody and they momma tryin' do it
My life
I've done that, been through that
So there ain't nothin' that you can tell me
My life
On a good night, if I feel like
Me and the girls hit the club and tear it up
It's my life, it's my life
And I believe it don't effect nobody else but me, me, me, me4Embed
