Stench of the Unburied Lyrics
Incoherent but functional
Speeding like a dead comet
Purple crushed velvet waistcoat
Flecked with Maalox and bits of dried vomit
Say what you will for the effort
You can't fault the technique
Still conscious at sunrise
For the third time this week
But when the blue lights flash
I know we're going to crash

And outside it's ninety-two degrees
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Blaupunkt in the dashboard
Cracks in the cylinder block
Heading up the Golden State freeway
Toward Eagle Rock
Ice chest full of Corona
And Pineapple Crush
It'll take twenty years for the toxins to flush
And when the sirens wail
I know we're going to jail
And outside it's ninety two degrees
And KROQ is playing Siouxsie and the Banshees

Follow the flame to freedom
The flickering lights of armageddon
Find the foot of the land way down in the pit
Keep climbing forever
Trying to keep the torch lit

And outside it's ninety two degrees
And KROQ ("The Roq of the Eighties") is playing Siouxsie and the BansheesEmbed
