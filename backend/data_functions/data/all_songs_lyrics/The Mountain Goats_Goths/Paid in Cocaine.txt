Paid in Cocaine Lyrics
Crusty boots in the corner of the closet
By the tackle box
Once proud shining silver buckles
Safe behind the normalcy locks
Baubles and bangles
A lost age
Still all aglow with the radiance of the stage
That's who I was (that's who I was)
This is who I am (this is who I am)
Work to pay down the interest
On the mortgage
Used to get paid by the gram

Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?
Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?

Master tape from the show we did at Fender's
Back in '85
Dark paisley from Retail Slut
All four of us still fresh and alive
Flashes and phosphenes
It's hard to believe that's me
Strapped in and visibly sweating
As happy as I'm ever gonna be
You're by my side (you're by my side)
Five years left on your collar (five years on your collar)
You're cashing out
All dressed up
For your date with the emergency ward

Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?
Long Beach
Long Beach can you hear me?
Can you hear me Long Beach?Embed
