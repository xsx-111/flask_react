We Do It Different on the West Coast Lyrics
The papers write about it back in England
It's practically a lifestyle in Berlin
There's probably some pockets in Ohio
Almost always something happening in Ohio
I heard some bad reports about Long Island
I don't trust what people say about Long Island
I heard some good things from some friends about Chicago
I gotta see with my own eyes about Chicago

We do it different on the West Coast
We do it different on the West Coast
We do it different on the West Coast
We do it different on the West Coast

I heard they had a problem with some skinheads
At a show in a machine shop in Pomona
I feel like half my friends have moved to San Francisco
I think I'm gonna bleach my hair this weekend
And Dave went to New York -- I don't care
You can't shut people up once they get back from their Christmas out there
Skim through such magazines as I can get my hands on
Glue circuit boards to plywood on the weekend
Trellis modulation for the children
There's a whole new world just up around the corner
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast

We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coast
We do it different on the west coastEmbed
