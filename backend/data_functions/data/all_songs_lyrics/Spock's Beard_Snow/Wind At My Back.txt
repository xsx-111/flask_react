Wind At My Back LyricsTHE HOMELESS:
How can you be
Like a sky stretched out before me
And the world is turning your way
Even darkness is better this way
Can it be true
That it all comes rushing from you
When my resistance is gone
And there's nothing that I can lean on
You are the wind at my back
You give what I lack
You're the jewel in my hand
You're like rain on dry land
You're the focus the beam
You're realities dream
You're the blue in my black
You're the wind at my back
All of the above
I'II have the lot for my love
And as we're becoming somehow
As we're changing the future to now, oh
I just want to live
In the place that you have to give
I'll let the heat beat me down
Until the water comes down, oh
You are the wind at my back
You give what I lack
You're the jewel in my hand
You're like rain on dry land
Yon're the focus the beam
You're realities dream
You're the blue in my black
You're the wind at my back
You are the wind at my back
You give what I lack
You're the jewel in my hand
You're like rain on dry land
And my soul has been kissed
Just because you exist
You're the dream that's a fact
You're the wind at my back
You're the wish that I make
You're the prize I might take
You're the gold that is free
You're the groom on one knee
You're the focus the beam
You're realities dream
You're the blue in my black
You're the wind at my backEmbed
