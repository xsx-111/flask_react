4th Of July Lyrics
Another 4th of July
Another pie in the sky
Another man hears the call
Another snake in the grass
Another tire's been slashed
Another man takes the fall
And like a dream dressed in white
Fast as a trick of the light
You see the vision of every man
You've known it since you were small
Even before you could crawl
You had the vision of every man
Another 4th of July
Another shot hits the sky
Another man has to pay
We wish our boy would stay sane
We wish he'd change his name
But life just isn't that way
And like a dream dressed in white
Fast as a trick of the light
You see the vision of every man
You've known it since you were small
Even before you could crawl
You had the vision of every man
Another 4th of July
Another shot hits the sky
Another ego exalts the man
Another 4th of July
Another shot hits the sky
Another ego exalts the manEmbed
