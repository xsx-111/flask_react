Solitary Soul Lyrics
I've been here since long ago waiting for the end
I don't need to have a home but I could use a friend
So many people they don't give a damn
They look away when they see what I am
I've been like half a man but I could be whole
Won't you befriend this solitary soul
Got a lot of breezes left to blow
Where I'm going I don't know
Got a lot of heartache I don't show
What it's like you'll never know
To be the solitary soul
I've been here since long ago buried in my tears
Feels like I've walked alone for a thousand years
So many people they don't give a damn
They look away when they see what I am
I've been like half a man but I could be whole
Won't you befriend this solitary soul
Got a lot of breezes left to blow
Where I'm going I don't know
Got a lot of heartache I don't show
What it's like you'll never know
Got a lot of breezes left to blow
Where I'm going I don't know
Got a lot of heartache I don't show
What it's like you'll never know
To be the solitary soul

I see your heart
I know what you've been through
I know you
Come be a part
You know you belong here
So dry your tears because
Love beyond words - Can fill your heart
Love beyond words - You'll feel a part
Love beyond words - You won't be alone anymore
I see your heart
I know what you've been through
I know you
Come be a part
You know you belong here
So dry your tears because
Love beyond words - Can fill your heart
Love beyond words - You'll feel a part
Love beyond words - You won't be alone anymoreEmbed
