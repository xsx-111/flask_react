Made Alive Again / Wind At My Back Lyrics
From a world that's never ending
From a sky beyond the skies
A child is born
And love is made alive
Like a flaw that seeks perfection
With a will that will survive
A child is born
And love is made alive
Wind At My Back

And you are the wind at my back
You give what I lack
You're the jewel in my hand
You're like rain, you're like rain
You're like rain now
And my soul has been kissed
Just because you exist
You're the gold that is free
You're the groom on one knee
You're the wind at my back
You give what I lack
You're the jewel in my hand
You're like rain on dry land
You're the focus the beam
You're realities dream
You're the blue in my black
You're the wind at my back
You are the wind at my back
You give what I lack
You're the jewel in my hand
You're like rain on dry land
You're the flow that I feel
The illusion so real
You're the ocean the tide
You're the door open wide
And my soul has been kissed
Just because you exist
You're the gold that is free
You're the groom on one knee
You're the focus the beam
You're realities dream
You're the blue in my black
You're the wind at my back
You're the wish that I make
You're the prize I might take
You're the dream that's a fact
You're the wind at my back
You're the flow that I feel
The illusion so real
You're the ocean the tide
You're the door open wide
And my soul has been kissed
Just because you exist
You're the blue in my black
You're the wind at my backEmbed
