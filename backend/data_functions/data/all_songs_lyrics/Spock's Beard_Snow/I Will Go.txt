I Will Go Lyrics
Help me I'm dying
Help me I'm dying now
And as the whirlwinds disappeared
I looked around and I was here
The clouds were clearing from my eyes
My life stood still and began to rise
And all the faces round about
Began to smile and call me out
No time to think; nothing to know
Just one tremendous letting go
And God was there behind the veil
And everyone I'd helped or failed
These words escaped inside my soul
There's no denying
I will go
(Go before the gate goes down
When you hear the calling sound)
I will go
(You will not be turned away
Bring your weakness with your strength)
I will go
(Where the river meets the sea
Where the sky is holding me)
I will go
(Love will be your ministry
Let it fly when you open up the flood line now)
And when I finally came around
Propped in a bed my head bound
I saw my friends they all were there
Some eyes were wet some eyes were clear
They gathered round and touched my hand
And I began to understand
I saw a future yet unknown
I saw a child returning home
And The One said "Welcome back my friend"
He brought me back to life again
And when He calls me down the road
I will be going
I will go
(Go before the gate goes down
When you hear the calling sound)
I will go
(You will not be turned away
Bring your weakness with your strength)
I will go
(Where the river meets the sea
Where the sky is holding me)
I will go
(Love will be your ministry
Let it fly when you open up the flood line)Embed
