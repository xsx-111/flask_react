Open Wide The Flood Gates Lyrics
Red forest green
As you stand at the waterfall
And there's no in between
You go back or you trust the fall
And the man says that'll be forty-five
And the best of your mind's crying 'take the dive'
Open wide the floodgates
And let love take your soul
Open wide the floodgates
'Til there's so much you overflow
Out of the blue
And into uncertainty
And since you are a child
You just want some kind of security
But the desert will always be hot and dry
Until the cool water comes rushing by
Open wide the floodgates
And let love fill your soul
Open wide the floodgates
'Til there's so much you overflow
Open wide the floodgates
Sprinkle this soul around
Open wide the floodgates
You spent your life running away
You run but you're not far away
Open wide the floodgates
And let love take your soul
Open wide the floodgates
'Til there's so much you overflow
Open wide the floodgates
Sprinkle this soul around
Open wide the floodgates
Let this Love come down
Open wide the floodgates

Open wide the floodgates - And let love move your soul
Open wide the floodgates - 'Til there's so much you overflow
Open wide the floodgates - Let it wash away the past
Open wide the floodgates - Man, you'll feel you're home at last
Open wide the floodgates - Yeah, Yeah, YeahEmbed
