Freak Boy Lyrics
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
How could you think I'd love you
You're a toothpick
So pathetic
You make me sick
I barely even know you
I took my turn in your prayer line
I felt something more like a warning
They all saw you secretly looking
Now you're here at two in the morning
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
How could you think I'd love you
You're a magnet
For the pathetic
I can't tell you
How much your face revolts me
In a way you are the worst kind
Think you know so much about people
So how come you never saw me
Open my church and smell all the people now
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
How could you think I'd love you
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak Boy
You're a Freak BoyEmbed
