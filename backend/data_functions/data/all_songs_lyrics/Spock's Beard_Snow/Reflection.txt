Reflection Lyrics
Behold the man, the stranger, the working man's son
He reflected the mountain
Now all souls can see what's been done
And the word spread fast as wildfire
But the people changed as the wind swept higher
And the crowd's got huge, man, you should've seen the choir
And in two years he made the cover of Time
The albino priest with the psychic mind
"You wanna see Mr. Snow you better get in line"
He might've been fine - He might've got through it OK
If not for the girl, when he saw her I guess everything changed
And the loose in him wound up tight
And the flanks all faded in the failing light
And the needy people seemed an oversight
He knew about things he couldn't know
He knew about people and he told them so
But until he touched her he didn't know - She let him knowEmbed
