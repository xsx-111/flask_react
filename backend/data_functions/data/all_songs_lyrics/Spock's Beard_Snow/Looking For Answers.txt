Looking For Answers Lyrics
I think I'II give her a call to see if she's up
It's kinda late but you know it wouldn't surprise me
If I get her machine again
You see there's a problem I have
And have had for a long, long time
I wish I was blind as a bat
Cause no matter where I'm at
I can see her standing there
I'm still looking for answers
Maybe I can do better
Or maybe this is where I'll be for all eternity
This is a torture of sorts
I've seen the reports of my demise
But don't feel sorry for me
It's not like I can see at all
She's the best thing I've had
And have had for a long, long time
But I'm just a freak with a gift
Living in a paradigm shift
My world is changing everywhere
I'm still looking for answers
Maybe I can do better
Or maybe this is where I'll be for all eternity
I'm still looking for answers
Maybe I can do better
Or maybe this is it for me
This is where I'll be for all eternity
I'm not opposed to being alone, the needle is stuck
My penance was made by my run out of luck
And I don't suppose you'd consider changing your mind
I promise you it will be different this time
And I don't have nothin' to bring to the table
Oh no matter what I say
I'll be here forever - Forever will be today
I'm still looking for answers
Maybe I can do better
Or maybe this is where I'll be for all eternity
I'm still looking for answers
Maybe I can do better
Or maybe this is it for me
This is where I'll be for all eternity
I'm still looking for answers
I'm still looking for answers
I'm still looking for answers1Embed
