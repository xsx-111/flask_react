Open The Gates Part 2 Lyrics
Open up the flood gates in your mind that you might be set free
Open up the windows left behind and stand in what could be
When something shifts the bulb will light and you may understand
Something beyond your sense of sight far from the world of man
(Glass is all breaking - Everything's changing NOW)
Open up the window feel the calm of the first cool breeze
Feel how the wind blows you can see the forest through the trees
When you flip the switch you may deny what you once held as true
All will be revealed; seek and you'll find that you can
Open up the flood line - we got separated by time
Lifting up the gate now - we got separated somehow
Let's come together now
Open up the flood gates and believe that all will come to pass
Release the dream and let your woodwinds be all turned to brass
When something shifts you may belie your former way of life
Don't you want to be out of your mind; come on and
Open up the flood line - we got separated by time
Lifting up the gate now - we got separated somehow
Let's come together now
Go before the gafe goes down when you hear the calling sound (I will go)
You will not be turned away bring your weakness with your strength (I will go)
Where the river meets the sea - Where the sky is holding me (I will go)
Love will be your ministry - Let it fly when you open up the flood lineEmbed
