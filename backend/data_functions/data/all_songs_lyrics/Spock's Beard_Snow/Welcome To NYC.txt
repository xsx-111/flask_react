Welcome To NYC LyricsTHE KNIGHT:
Hey, hey, hey - Welcome to New York City
We got the hottest girls and they'll do anything you want
Hey there whitey, so white you're kinda pretty
Why don't you come on in, depending on how much cash you got
I LIKE IT!
Look, boy, where you from?
I love ya now - Walk boy don't you run
It's hotter than the sun, walk, boy don't you run
You better get a gun, where you from Ohio or somethin'?
Don't you gimme the eye or my friends just might stop by
We'll have ourselves a time, you won't look so happy about it
I LIKE IT!
You better find your Mama to protect you now
You look like the wind might blow you down
I LIKE IT!
Don't touch me now
You better find your Mama to protect you now
She'll protect you now - She'll protect you now
She'll protect you now - Don't touch me now...Embed
