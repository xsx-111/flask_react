Freak Boy - Part 2 Lyrics
I'm a Freak boy
I'm a Freak boy
I'm the milk left out until morning
I'm a Freak boy
Everlasting
I'm a bomb set off without warning now
I'm a Freak boy
I'm a Freak boy now
On the street now
Barely breathing
They don't call me Snow it's too charming
Somehow I still
Have some feeling
Like a dog you best not alarm me now
I'm a Freak boy now
I'm a Freak boy now
I'm a Freak boy nowEmbed
