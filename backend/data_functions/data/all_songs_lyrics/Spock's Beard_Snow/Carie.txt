Carie Lyrics
Carie
Won't you come and see me, the clouds have bid the sun
Let's take a chance and run with just what we can carry
Carie
Won't you come and save me, I am of the earth
But you are like a church with one hand in the sky
And a face that answers why
Won't you please just hear me
Everywhere I hear you - Everywhere you call
Everyday I feel the need to fall into you
I need to be behind your castle walls
Carie
I see it all so clearly, the window's open now
Let's take what fate's allowed, time may never come
Let's take a chance and run with just what we can carryEmbed
