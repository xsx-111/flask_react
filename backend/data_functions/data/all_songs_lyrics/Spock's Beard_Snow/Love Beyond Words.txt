Love Beyond Words LyricsSNOW:
I see a boy who watched his father
Be beat to death right on the living room floor
As he watched through the door - You watched through the door
Now you're a young man filled with anger
You know your life on earth could mean so much more
Don't you know what it's for, I think you know what it's for
To love beyond words - (Love beyond all words) - Love beyond words
THE KNIGHT:
Now I somehow have understanding
Like I've never had before in my life
Do you know what that's like, I think you know what it's like
To love beyond words - (Love beyond all words) - Love beyond words
To love beyond words - (Love beyond all words) - Love beyond words
To love beyond words - (Love beyond all words) - Love beyond wordsEmbed
