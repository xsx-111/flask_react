Free Lyrics
I fell asleep in the silence
Before the street fights, the fire
Free in the world that you've given
Lay in the sound, the water still calls
Still calls

Afraid of the dark that surrounds you
Hide in the dirt of the ground
Free in the wind that surrounds me
I'm not afraid to sleep in the night
Not afraid
To sleep in the night

Free like a bird of the holders
Holding the wake of the sun
I know the road that you send me
I know the way it leads to home

Real like the bones in my body
Real like the flesh that covers the grave
It's real like the flesh
That covers the grave
Wait for the guards that you send me
Before I'll show myself
Wait for the storm that comes to me
Maybe I'll just change my mind

Plea for the will of forgiveness
I'm not afraid to say I was wrong
I was wrong
Maybe I won't
So wrong...
So wrong...3Embed
