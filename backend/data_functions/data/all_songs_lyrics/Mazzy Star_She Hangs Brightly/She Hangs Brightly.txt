She Hangs Brightly Lyrics
She hangs brightly from the tree
Wonders what she's done to me

I'm aware of your game
Come and watch me
Watch me come down


Takes me down deep and wide
Pulls me through to the other side

She's the winner of her game
Come and watch her
Watch her come down


It stays down, sour in truth
Lies of lovin', the story's cheap
She's the winner of her game
Come and watch her
Watch her come down

Takes you down...
Deep and wide...
Pulls me through...
The other side...

Takes you down...
Deep and wide...
Pulls me through...
The other side...
