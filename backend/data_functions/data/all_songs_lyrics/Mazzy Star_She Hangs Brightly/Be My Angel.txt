Be My Angel LyricsThey say it's me
That makes you do things
You might not have done
If I was away
And that it's me
That likes to talk to you
And watches you
As you walk away
Don't say it's useless
Don't say forget it
Don't bring me wishes
Of silly dreams
Just say it's all
From too much freedom
Too many fingers
And too many things
They say it's you
That washes the weary
And brings the night
Into the day
If you won't notice
How can I show you
All of your worries
Have all gone away
Don't leave me lonely
Don't leave me unhappy
Just bring me up
Into your fate
If you don't need me
Then don't deceive me
Letting my freedom
Turn into stone
Just be my angel if you love me
Be my angel in the night
Be my angel cuz you need me
Be my angel and treat me right
Don't say you love me
If you don't need me
Don't send me roses
On your behalf
Just take me down
And walk through your river
Down through the middle
And make it last
Holding on to you
Holding on to me
Holding on tight
'till my love is crossed
Don't say it's useless
And don't say forget it
You are my spirit
Now you are gone4Embed
