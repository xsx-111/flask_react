Give You My Lovin LyricsGive you my lovin'
Seven days a week
I'll be your honey
If you'll be sweet
I know I'm the only one for you
I know that you think this is not true
Man says it's raining, raining outside
I'll be out there in a little while
Cause you see, rain reminds me of you
And everything has turned to you
See you in the places I'm following you
You'll be upstairs and I'll be there too
Everywhere you go I will follow
I know it won't be the same tomorrow
People give me warnings
Stay away from you
They say you'll hurt me
I don't think that's true
Discomfort arrouses when I speak of you
As if you've been saying something bad about me
When I see you, I want to kiss you
But I know that ain't right so I ask if I can hold you
Oh babe I need you so bad
Oh babe I only want to make you gladEmbed
