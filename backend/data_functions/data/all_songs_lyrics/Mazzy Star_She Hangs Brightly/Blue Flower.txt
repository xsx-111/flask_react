Blue Flower LyricsWaitin' for a sign from you
Waitin' for a signal to change
Have you forgotten what your love can do?
Is this the end?
Walkin' through the city
Your boots are high-heeled and are shinin' bright
The sunlight sparklin' on the shaft of your knife
Flower in morning rain
Dying in my hand
Was it all in vain?
Superstar in your own private movie
I wanted just a minor part
But I'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart
You're keeper of the key
Nothing seems to bring you down
It's not that cool when I'm around
Flower in morning rain
Dying in my hand
Was it all in vain?
Superstar in your own private movie
I wanted just a minor part
But I'm no fool
I know you're cool
I never really wanted your heart3Embed
