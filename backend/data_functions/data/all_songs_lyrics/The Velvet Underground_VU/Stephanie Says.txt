Stephanie Says Lyrics
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why she's given half her life
To people she hates now
Stephanie says when answering the phone (Stephanie says)
What country shall I say is calling (Me)
From across the world

But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind

Stephanie says that she wants to know (Stephanie says, she wants to know)
Why it is though she's the door (door)
She can't be the room
Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone (Stephanie says)
What sea shell sea is calling (Me)
From across her world
But she's not afraid to die
The people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her
'Cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind
They're asking is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)
It's so cold in Alaska (Stephanie says)3Embed
