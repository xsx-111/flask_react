Just Another Nervous Wreck Lyrics
I'm feeling so alone now
They cut the telephone uh huh
Yeah my life is just a mess
I threw it all away now
I could have made a fortune
I lost the craving for success

And as the acrobats they tumble
So the corn begins to crumble
While in the mirror she admires a brand new dress

Live on the second floor now
They're trying to bust the door down
Soon I'll have a new address
So much for liberation
They'll have a celebration
Yeah I've been under too much stress

And as the clouds begin to rumble
So the juggler makes his fumble
And the sun upon my wall is getting less
Don't! Give a damn
Fight! While you can
Kill! Shoot 'em up
They'll! They'll run amuck
Shout! Judas
Loud! They'll hear us
Soldier! Sailor
Whose your! Tailor
They'll run for cover
When they discover
Everyone's a nervous wreck now

I used to think she was so nimble
I would have bought her as a symbol
But now I can't afford the pen to sign her checks

That don't! Give a damn
Fight! While you can
Kill! Shoot 'em up
They'll! Yeah they'll run amuck
Shout! Judas
Loud! They'll hear us
Soldier! Sailor
Whose your! Tailor
They'll run for cover
When they discover
Everyone's a nervous wreck now
Life's just a bummer
They got your number
We'll give as good as we get now
Rise from the gutter
Stick with each other
We'll drive 'em over the edge now
They're gonna bleed
That's what they need
We'll get together and blow their cover

Are we ready (Are we ready)
Are we ready (Are we ready)
Are we ready (Are we ready)
Yeah we're ready
Are we ready (Are we ready)
Are we ready (Are we ready)
Yeah. yeah
Are we ready (Are we ready)Embed
