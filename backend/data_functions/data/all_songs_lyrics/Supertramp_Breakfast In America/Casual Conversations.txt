Casual Conversations LyricsIt doesn't matter what I say
You never listen anyway
Just don't know
What you're looking for
Imagination's all I have
But even then you say it's bad
Just can't see
Why we disagree
In casual conversations and how they bore me
Yeah, they go on and on, endlessly
No matter what I say, you'll ignore me anyway
I might as well talk in my sleep
I could weep
You try to make me feel so small
Until there's nothing left at all
Why go on?
Just hoping that we'll get along
There's no communication left between us
But is it me or you who's to blame?
There's nothing I can do, yes you're fading out of view
Don't know if I feel joy or pain
It's such a shame
And now it seems it's all been said
If you must leave then go ahead
Should feel sad
But I really believe that I'm glad
I really believe that I'm glad
I really believe that I'm gladEmbed
