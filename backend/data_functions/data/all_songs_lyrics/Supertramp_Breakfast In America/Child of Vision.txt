Child of Vision Lyrics
Well who do you think you're foolin'?
You say you're having fun
But you're busy going nowhere
Just lying in the sun
You tried to be a hero
Commit the perfect crime
But the dollar got you dancing
And you're running out of time

You're messin' up the water
You rolling in the wine
You're poisoning your body
You're poisoning your mind
And you gave me Coca-Cola
You just said it tasted good
Then you watch the television
And to tell that just you should

How can you live in this way?
(Why do you think it's so strange?)
You must have something to say
(You tell me why should I change)
There must be more to this life
It's time we did something right
Child of Vision, won't you listen?
Find yourself a new ambition

I've heard it all before
You're saying nothing new
I thought I saw a rainbow
But I guess it wasn't true
You cannot make me listen
And I cannot make you hear
So you'll find your way to heaven
And I'll meet you when you're there

How can you live in this way?
(Why do you think it's so strange?)
You must have something to say
(You tell me why should I change)

We have no reason to fight
'cos we both know that we're right
Child of Vision, won't you listen?
Find yourself a new ambition1Embed
