Oh Darling Lyrics
Oh darling
Will you ever change your mind
Yeah, I've been feeling left behind
Like a shadow in your light
Ah honey
Won't you say that I'm the one
And if you think you're gonna run
Well you know

I'm gonna be around you
All about you
Always by your side
I'm gonna dream about you
Scheme about you
Love you all the time
I'm gonna catch you lady
Catch you lady
Yeah...

The news is all over town
You better not let me down
Keep telling me you're feeling good
As good as you ever could
Please tell me that you'll never go
Ah, aaah, no no
Tell me that you'll never go, never go, no
Ah lately, I'm like a watch that's overwound
And I've got both feet off the ground
Because you see

I'm gonna be so busy, oh my pretty
Love you night and day
And through the rain and shine
I'll make you mine
I'll love you come what may
I'm gonna
Catch you lady
Catch you lady
Catch you lady uh huh
I'm gonna
Catch you lady
Catch you lady
Catch you lady uh huh

I'm gonna (I'm gonna)
I'm gonna (I'm gonna)
I'm gonna (I'm gonna)
I'm gonna catch you lady
(I'm gonna) I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) I'm gonna
I'm gonna catch you lady
I'm gonna (I'm gonna)
I'm gonna (I'm gonna)
I'm gonna (I'm gonna)
I'm gonna catch you lady
(I'm gonna) I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) I'm gonna
(I'm gonna) I'm gonna
I'm gonna catch you lady1Embed
