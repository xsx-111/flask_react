One Country LyricsWho'd like to change the world?
Who wants to shoot the curl?
Who wants to work for bread?
Who wants to get ahead?
Who hands out equal rights?
Who starts and ends that fight?
And not rant and rave
Or end up a slave
Who can make hard-won gains?
Fall, like the summer rain?
Every man must be
What his life can be
So don't, call, me
The tune I will walk away
Who wants to please everyone?
Who says it all can be done?
Still sit up on that fence
No one I've heard of yet
Don't call me baby
Don't talk in maybes
Don't talk like has-beens
Sing it like it should be
Who laughs at a nagging doubts?
Lying on a neon shroud, running around, yeah
You've gotta touch someone
Yeah, I wanna be.......
So don't, call, me
The tune, I will walk away
So don't, call, me
The tune, I will walk away
So don't, call, me
The tune, I will walk away
So don't, call, me
The tune, I will walk away
One country
One, country
One, country
One, country
One
Who wants to sit around? (country, one)
Turn it up, turn it down? (country,one)
Only a man can be (country one)
What his life can be!
(Country one) One vision
(Country one) One people
(Country one) One landmass
(Country one) Be our defences
(Country one) We have a lifeline
One ocean, one policy, see bad light
One passion, one movement, one instant, one difference
One life time and one understanding
(Country one) Yeahhhhhh, one country
(Country one) Yeahhhhhh, one country
(Country one) I..... tell you, it's one country
(Country one) Heyyyyyyyy (country one)
Yeah one, one, one (one country)
One, one, one, one country
One (country one)
One understanding
Transgression, redemption
One island blue, our place magic
One firmament, one element
One moment, one fusion
Is so on timeEmbed
