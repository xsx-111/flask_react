King of the Mountain LyricsWalking through the high dry grass
Pushing my way through slow
Yellow belly black snake
Sleeping on a red rock
Waiting for the stranger to go
Sugar train stops at the crossing
Cane cockies cursing below
Bad storm coming
Better run to the top of the mountain
Mountain in the shadow of light
(Rain in the valley below)
Mountain in the shadow of light
(Rain in the valley...)
Well, you can say you're Peter
Say you're Paul
Don't put me up on your bedroom wall
Call me, king of the mountain
Blacksmith fires up the bellows
Cane cutters burning the load
Workers of the world
Run to the top of the mountain
Mountain in the shadow of light
(Rain in the valley below)
Mountain in the shadow of light
(Rain in the valley...)
Well, you can say you're Peter
Say you're Paul
Don't put me up on your bedroom wall
Call me, king of the mountain
I can't take the hands from my face
There are some things we can't replace
Mountain in the shadow of light
(Rain in the valley below)
Mountain in the shadow of light
Well, you can say you're Peter
Say you're Paul
Don't put me up on your bedroom wall
Call me, king of the mountain
Over liquid tarmac wastelands of cactus and heat
Down cobblestone alleyways of washing day sheets
Up ghost prairie mountains of sunset and space
Down the road a familiar face
Across the wilderness
Out further than the bush
I will follow you, I will follow you
I will follow youEmbed
