Stars Of Warburton LyricsI, I was, I was shaken down in a toy town
He, He's out there
You know it's Kennedy's shadow from White Cross to Michigan
ATM's, are in the air, oh yeah machines they are spinning out everywhere
The speaker is speaking
Can you hear the sound
The listener is listening as he hits the ground
The medium or the message but there's no one around
I couldn't believe
I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were waiting for me
We were dancing, we were dancing on the plain
We're looking through the window didn't see any buffalo there
We got our pipe dreams, they went up in smoke dreams
Burn it clean in the climate control, of your hypermark malls
Don't wanna talk about Elvis Presley
Don't wanna see his white shoes walking around
And around and around over here
The press baron's acting up the mainframes are down
Newspapers crawling around on the ground
The medium or the message still there's no one around
I couldn't believe
I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were waiting for me
Over the hills and mountains we go, so far, so far away
For the ring of the axe on the ironbark, for the smell of the wallaby stew
From the golden reefs to the sandstone cliffs
Came the sheep of the Mallee plain
The wind blew the soil to the Orient, we'll be shouting to the skies again
I couldn't believe
I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were waiting for me
I couldn't believe
I couldn't believe the stars of Warburton were living in me
Raining down on me, were washing down on meEmbed
