You May Not Be Released (Bonus Track) LyricsI understand things aren't often planned
Under the bridge
Pushed to the edge
That's the way the story often ends
There's always love
You must understand
You may not be released
You must understand
You may not be released
Do you believe it
So many things are talked about
But not much is done
Living in these times
The rock is a heart
Yeah, the rock ain't no stone
Stones 'll be thrown
You can't guess who but you know
There's another Pete track overlayed here
But I can't understand it
There's always love
You must understand
You may not be released
You must understand
You may not be released
Well I say, Well I say you must understand
You may not be releasedEmbed
