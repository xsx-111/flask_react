Days Of... LyricsIt was one of those days
Of salvation and loss
Just one of those days
When you wait for the worst
First they hold you for a ransom
Then they buy you for a song
Just one of those days
When you laugh at what you've done
How they ripped you from the pages
Oh, you waited for the best
It was one of those days
Of salvation and lossEmbed
