Old Man Song LyricsOnce he was up in a plane
Saw the world as it was
Only to come down again
Only to come down again, ooh
Left to his own accord
He would sit up all night
Nothing from anyone else
Nothing from anyone else, ooh
Clothes that hang on his frame
Now he could go either way
Marvels at what he believes
Marvels at what he can see, oohEmbed
