Two-Step LyricsAnd the light, it burns your skin
In a language you don't understand
It's not that hard
It is not that hard
That's not all
Voices small
Heed them either way they call
Two-step around the room
Kneel down on white
Two-step around the room
Kneel down on white
Two-step around the room
You can kneel down on white
Two-step around the room
You can kneel down on white
That's not all
Voices small
Heed them either way they call
And the light, it burns your skin
In a language you don't understand1Embed
