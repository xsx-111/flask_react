Soon LyricsSoon, it will be over
I laughed under my breath, over your shoulder
There's a message out tonight
Nobody's looking at the sky
Soon, it will be over
I laughed under my breath, over your shoulder
You think that I don't know your name
And now your face is all in flames
You think that I don't know your name
And now we'll stand there all amazedEmbed
