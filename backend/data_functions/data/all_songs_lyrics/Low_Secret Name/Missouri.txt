Missouri LyricsOh, speak to me
Adam and Eve
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
You wanted it back
Faces painted black
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
What did you get
For your dishes and sweat
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
Oh, speak to me
Adam and Eve
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
Oh, Missouri
Oh, MissouriEmbed
