Weight of Water LyricsTake a cupful from your hand
Wait for forty days
Make a river through the sand
'Til you're called by a secret name
And the weight of the water has brought me back to this
Just leave me to the river
Let it cleanse my face
I have no power to ward it
Like the baptism of the earth
And the weight of the water has brought me back to this
And the step where you stood
As I bleed from the wound
How I cower to that weight
Still Iâ€™ll make this water homeEmbed
