Immune LyricsTell me is the time as slow
Only when your eyes are closed
Do we stand to waste some more?
Am I still immune?
Am I naked too?
Does it taste like home?
Only when your eyes are closed
Have you been away too long?
Am I still immune?
Am I naked too?
Am I naked too?
Tell me is the time as slow
Only when your eyes are closed?
Is the point to stay too long?
Am I still immune?
Am I naked too?
Am I naked too?
Feels like being usedEmbed
