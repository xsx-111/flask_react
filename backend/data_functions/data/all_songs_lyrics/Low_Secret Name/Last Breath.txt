Last Breath LyricsI held your last breath in my hand
I held your last word in my heart
Without the recourse
Without the light bulb
Without your reasons
What more do I know?
I held your last breath in my hand
I held your last word in my heart
I held your last hope in my mouth
I held your last trust in my heart
I held
I held
I heldEmbed
