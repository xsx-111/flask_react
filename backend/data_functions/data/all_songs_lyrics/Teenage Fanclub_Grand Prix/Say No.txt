Say No LyricsSay no
I know you're gonna stay
With more than one way
To say no
Don't go
I know you're here today
You never knew the way
To say no
I know
I never got it wrong
With only this song
To say no
You know
The way we've been taught
With only one thought
To say no
I know
You never had a lot
But never had a thought
To say no
Don't go
Now you don't belong
With only this song
To say no
I'll go
Anywhere at all
And wait for you to call
To say no
We'll know
The things you can't recall
And life will seem too small
To say no
I know
I knew it all along
With only one song
To say noEmbed
