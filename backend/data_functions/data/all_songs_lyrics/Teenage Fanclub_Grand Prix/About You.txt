About You LyricsI always knew the way about you
I always knew the way about you
Always on my mind
Always take my time
Take my time and I can find my way
I never took the time to see through
I always knew the way about you
Always on my mind
Always take my time
Take my time and I can find my way
Always on my mind
Always take my time
Take my time and I can find my way
Always on my mind
Always take my time
Take my time and I can find my way
Always on my mind
Always take my time
Take my time and I can find my way
Take my time and I can find my way
Take my time and I can find my wayEmbed
