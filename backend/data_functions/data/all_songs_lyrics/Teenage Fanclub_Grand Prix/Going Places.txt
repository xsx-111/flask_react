Going Places Lyrics
Bound in motion
Found my headwind was blowing fine
I've requested the stars to shine
For words that no longer rhyme

Drank the ocean
Moved my feet to a different sound
Tried to find what was left unfound
It's funny how it lets you down

Just kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the sky
I've got no beat in time, got no place in line


Got the notion
That this rain's never gonna last
'Cause the scene always moves too fast
I've read all about the past

Just kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the sky
I've got no beat in time, got no place in line
Just kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the sky
I've got no beat in time, got no place in line

Just kick my feet off the ground, I'll embrace the sky
I've got no beat in time, got no place in line1Embed
