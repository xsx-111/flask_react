I Gotta Know LyricsI got a feeling I know what I mean
Feel like deceiving is almost obscene
Always believing I'll always believe
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I got a feeling I know what I need
Always believing I gotta succeed
Always believing I'll always believe
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
{SOLO}
I gotta know
I gotta know
I got a feeling I know it's naive
Feel like I'm stealing from what I perceive
Always believing I'll always believe
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
{SOLO}
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta know
I gotta knowEmbed
