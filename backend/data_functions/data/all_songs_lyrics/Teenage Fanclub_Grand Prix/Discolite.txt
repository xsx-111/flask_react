Discolite LyricsCould you light me up on what I'm doing
And waken up the sleeping words inside my head
The morning that surrounds you
The feelings that have found you
Can grow every world you'll ever need
If you think there's a better place to see
Get your mind made up on me
Got another thing to be?
Ooo ooo...
Ahhhh....
Ahhhh....
Ahhhh....
Ahhhh....
When the morning fades too soon
Is there life in this cartoon?
Woke up in a place where I belong
The endless fights
The disco lights
If you think there's a better place to see
Get your mind made up on me
Got another thing to be?
Ooo ooo...
Ahhhh....
Ahhhh....
Ahhhh....
Ahhhh....
When the DJ plays your tune
There's a light inside your moon
If the takes don't take you
And the breaks don't brake you
Get the train on time
I've waited much too long
If you think there's a better place to see
Get your mind made up on me
Got another thing to be?
Ooo ooo...
If you think (ooo ooo)
If you think (ooo ooo)
If you think (ooo ooo)
If you think (ooo ooo)Embed
