Tears LyricsThere's no future so don't fake it
Don't know if you're going to make it
When everything becomes unclear
You're tired and you're broken
Your true feelings remain unspoken
You couldn't hide behind your name
You're excited and ecstatic
Your exit was so dramatic
When all your passion disappeared
You're no sucker so don't blow it
You're succeeding but you don't know it
You've got to turn yourself aroundEmbed
