Neil Jung LyricsYou had a girlfriend
That wasn't good enough for you
She was younger
But that was old enough you knew
To get undressed for you
Stressed for you
Distorting everything
Became depressed for you
You were changing
Didn't want to stay the same
Re-arranging
Dropped a letter from your name
She'd get uptight with you
Would fight with you
And you would never win
It wasn't right for you
Was going nowhere
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
Was going nowhere
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
Not understanding
Had a different point of view
Tried to reach her
When she moved away from you
She was confusing you
Using you
You couldn't understand
Began amusing you
Was going nowhere
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
Was going nowhere
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
{SOLO}
Was going nowhere
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
Was going nowhere
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
Couldn't take the pain and left it there
{SOLO}Embed
