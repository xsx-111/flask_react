Anyway LyricsDo you remember when your hair was long, Mum?
Do you remember when Dad could drink?
I guess so much has changed here lately
But I’m so proud of you and him
Just so you know, I like your hair short anyway
And so you know, I like it that way
And we’re on our way to Nan’s house
I’ve got my best shirt on
Are you feeling okay, okay?
‘Cause I know this journey is far too long
Just so you know, I like your hair short anyway
And so you know, I like it that way
Even though you listen to the radio
So quietly and talk all the way through
I’d still sing songs on the motorway with you any day
