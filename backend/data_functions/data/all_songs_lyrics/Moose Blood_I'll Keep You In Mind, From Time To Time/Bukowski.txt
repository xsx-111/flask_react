Bukowski LyricsBukowski's growing old
This coffee's getting cold
I guess I'll never know
Why you closed the window
Start reading Hemingway
Start drinking cups of Earl Grey
Then I guess maybe one day...
I'll be yours forever
I'm the best book you'll never read
You make me feel like Jimmy Dean
You make me feel like Morrissey
When you undress from your best dress

To keep warm, I'll bring a sweater
You can have mine, it looks better
And honestly, you can take it home
We'll take blankets to stay safe
I'll do my best to stay out of your way
Then I guess maybe one day
I'll be yours forever
I'll introduce you to Clarity
Teach you the words to The Sound of Settling
Make you watch High Fidelity
On a Sunday, maybe one day...
To keep warm, I'll bring a sweater
You can have mine, it looks better
And honestly, you can take it home2Embed
