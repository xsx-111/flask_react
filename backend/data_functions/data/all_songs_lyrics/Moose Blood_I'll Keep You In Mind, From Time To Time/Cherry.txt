Cherry Lyrics
There’s only one place that I want to be
It’s home with you, girl, so I can hear you breathe
With your hair up like you do
And that face that you give me when you’ve missed me
And I’ve missed our girl so god damn much
I’ve smoked a lot and I feel so rough
Guess this is just what I want to do
Keeping half-smoked smokes and sing to half-filled rooms

I was young and irresponsible about a year ago
And it’s impossible to tell if my hands will ever warm up
I don’t believe in growing up

But look at me now, I’m engaged to be married
I’m only 23 and I got myself a family
She’s not mine and she never will be
I’m reminded everyday
She’s not mine and it fucking kills me
She won’t look at me that way

I was young and irresponsible about a year ago
And it’s impossible to tell if my hands will ever warm up
I don’t believe in growing up3Embed
