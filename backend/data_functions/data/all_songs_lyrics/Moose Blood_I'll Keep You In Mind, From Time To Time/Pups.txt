Pups LyricsHere’s one for my old man
I know I haven’t got your name on my hand yet
But I will, you know that I will
Do you remember saying
That you’d stretch your ear so much bigger than mine?
And you ain’t got the time, you gave up
I guess that I won

And I jumped a flight of stairs
‘Cause I knew you were waiting there
I jumped a flight of stairs
‘Cause I was so excited to have you home
Do you remember I took you out on the town?
And you fell to the ground and we made that sound that we do
My friends just don’t get it
Do you remember when you left my friends?
You went off on your own and you missed your ride home
You missed out
Mum couldn’t find you

It doesn’t matter that we can’t get drunk, Dad
It doesn’t mean that we can’t have fun
We can go out for a couple, or maybe a few
It wasn’t getting drunk I loved, it was being with you1Embed
