Gum LyricsDo you wanna come over later to my house?
Watch American Beauty in the dark
And I’ll hold your hand till the very end, the very end
And we’ll stay awake till tomorrow starts
Do you wanna come over later to my house?
Listen to your favourite songs
We’ll pretend the words ain’t true
They don’t mean anything to you
But do you wanna come over later to my house?
I’ve been smoking too much lately
I can feel it on my chest
But I’ll stand in the garden with you
I didn’t get much sleep last night
But that’s alright
It was worth it just to see you move that hair from your eyes
And smile like you do
Stay with me tonight
I’ll kiss your head till the morning
I’ll let you sleep on my side of the bed, girl
Stay with me tonight
I’ll kiss your head till the morning
I’ll let you sleep on my side of the bed, girl6Embed
