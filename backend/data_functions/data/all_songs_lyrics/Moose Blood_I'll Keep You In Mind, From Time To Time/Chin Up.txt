Chin Up LyricsI should have seen dad more
I should have been around
And all those conversations that we had before I found out

I remember missing all your calls
And how they went round and around
And that time that you told me you loved me
And you couldn’t feel more proud

That tattoo of your name
The number of your age
I don’t know what to say, I still think about you
And those pictures in mum’s house
That I touch when I’m around
And that ring you wore
I kept it by my side
I promise that I’ll keep it forever and I’ll treasure it
‘Cause it’s all I have
