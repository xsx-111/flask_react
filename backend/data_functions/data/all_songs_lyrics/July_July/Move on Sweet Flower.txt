Move on Sweet Flower LyricsYour day is done, see you
I'm the bad one, it's true
Yesterday was good fun
Move on, sweet flower
You know more amuse me
Dream of me by all means
Paper dreams they all see
You're no worse without me
Move on, sweet flower
You know more amuse me
I saw fish swimming in a fountain free from slime
I saw fox run through open fields to the hills beyond
I saw a cat asleep on the steps in the sun
I saw youEmbed
