The Way LyricsOn the park bench, in the cold
I told you so it's lovely when you go out now
Even if you were 21, you need to see the sun
You can't live within yourself
On the station, in the snow
And on the streets you row
In the boat made of your dreams, it seems
Concrete clouds go by, splash water in my eye
Trees will seize me, what you gonna do there?
Only in my head, go to bed
My mother said, she's not
The way to go on now
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh, ahhEmbed
