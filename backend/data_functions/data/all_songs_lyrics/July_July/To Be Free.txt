To Be Free Lyrics[?} you the dark, show you the light if you're afraid
The nearer the end, the further the start of the gold reign
Even the fox likes the eggs the hen laid
Simulated light, artificial world but they'll both fall
Black and yellow bird never heard, the snail calls
Jolly little souls dancing all the way to sad school
Loving such a lot together
We've been learning such a lot together
We should see how long it could be
To be free
Transparent roots, never see the shoots in the undergrowth
Butterfly in mind, hummingbird in flock, they drink and toast
Never mind the ants, they'll be  on the holes (alright!)
Smart-colored leaves shovel the fleet crossing sunlight strong
Rabbit in fear thinking the world shares  wrong
Black and yellow bird seeing the snail goes into stone
Loving such a lot together
We've been learning such a lot together
We should see how long it could be
To be free
Loving such a lot together
I said learning such a lot together
Hey hey, loving such a lot together
We've been learning such a lot togetherEmbed
