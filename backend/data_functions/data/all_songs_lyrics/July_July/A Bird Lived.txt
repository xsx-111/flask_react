A Bird Lived LyricsCome and have a drink please do
I take ice how about you?
Maybe when we talk and see
If there's a possibility
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Move over to my seat
The waiter's here I'll have mine neat
This is the place to stay
We can sit and drink and talk all day
I will try again how about you?
I know you'll like the things I can do
Even if it's just for now
Come with me and I'll show you how
Maybe when we talk we'll see
More than just a possibility
Once upon a time a bird lived
In the gilded cage
All at once the door was open wide
Stuck inside
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (la la la la la la la la)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (A bird lived)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (A bird lived)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (A bird lived)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (A bird lived)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (A bird lived)
Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh (A bird lived)Embed
