My Clown LyricsYou say you don't need me
Now I'm not around
I think you deceive me
You are just my clown
But I love my clown
More than you know
Stop foolin' around
Sometimes you slip my hold
And your mind grows free
But don't think that you can
Do better than me
Cause I love my clown
More than you know
Stop foolin' around
When my mind fills your head
Just remember things I said
Don't go thinking paper head
Just remember things I said
Will you cry when I'm dead?
Cry about the things I said
Stay with me paper head
Life is more than things I said
You say you don't need me
Now I'm not around
I think you deceive me
You are just my clown
But I love my clown
More than you know
Stop foolin' aroundEmbed
