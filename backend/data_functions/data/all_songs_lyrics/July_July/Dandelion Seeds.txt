Dandelion Seeds LyricsFloating on the air
Never seem to care
Worries have they none
See them drift upon the breeze
Dandelion seeds
Blow them and they're gone
Flying to the sun
Come and be with me
Where the air is always clean
Dandelion seeds
I tell the time for you
Twelve o' clock or noon it's still true
I know it's true
High above the tree's
Looking down on me
Birds fly by my side
People look up hopelessly
At dandelion seedsEmbed
