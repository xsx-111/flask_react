Hallo To Me LyricsSitting here alone
And all comes back I see
How she waves goodbye
Is more than just a memory
The sun comes up
And says hallo to me
Hallo hallo to me
I see the core mood
She says that's the price to be free
To be free, to be free, to be free
Everyday I see sides of a still around me
Love just for the christmas car looks out of me sadly
The sun comes up
And says hallo to me
Hallo hallo to me
I see the core mood
She says that's the price to be free
To be free, to be free, to be free
Downstairs I walk into the light of day
Close the door and her she's gone
There's nothing more to say
The sun comes up
And says hallo to me
Hallo hallo to me
I see the core mood
She says that's the price to be free
To be free, to be free, to be free
Close the door and her she's gone
There's nothing more to sayEmbed
