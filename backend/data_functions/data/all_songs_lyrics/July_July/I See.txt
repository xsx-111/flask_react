I See LyricsI could fly so high
It wouldn't be like me
I could be so low
You wouldn't see what I could see
What do I see?
I could be so black
You wouldn't see from me
I could be so near
You wouldn't see what I could see
What do I see?
Powder in my hair
Cows in the air
Ripples on the pool
Red on the black
Money in the sack
Empty seats at school
Floating on the  tide
See no one is looking
No one wants to see me
See no one is looking
I can see you and me
Sometimes we are happy
I could fly so high
It wouldn't be like me
I could be so low
You wouldn't see what I could see
What do I see?
What do I see?
Light in my eyes
Silver in the skies
Shouting out for me
Sending 
Little baby talk
Numbers up to three
Photograph my life's work
Don't make me laughEmbed
