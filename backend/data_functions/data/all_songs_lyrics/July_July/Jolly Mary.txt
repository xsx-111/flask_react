Jolly Mary LyricsLine up on the right and pay
For your ticket's on the boat today
The Jolly Mary sails today, ahoy there
The Jolly Mary sails today
Everybody's welcome aboard
No matter what you're called
The Jolly Mary sails today, ahoy there
The Jolly Mary sails today
The mate is Peg Leg Sears
Been working on the boat for years
The Mary is a very fine boat
She's the finest boat afloat
She's a super duper craft
A smashing little boat
Come aboard and take a seat
This is the trip to the week
The Jolly Mary sails today, ahoy there
The Jolly Mary sails today
The yellow  ticks so loud
It's sure to draw a crowd
The Jolly Mary sails today, ahoy there
The Jolly Mary sails today
The chef is Dumpling Joe
The finest cook I know
The Mary is a very fine boat
She's the finest boat afloat
She's a super duper craft
A smashing little boat
Can't stop thanking Mr. Sears
Hard to starve with Mr. Sears
Full speed ahead, Mr. Sears
Don't miss this fun-packed ride
We're sailing with the tide
The Jolly Mary sails today, ahoy there
The Jolly Mary sails today
Everybody stand and laugh
Take your photograph
The Jolly Mary sails today, ahoy there
The Jolly Mary sails today
I'm the captain and my name is Ned
Remember all the things I said
The Mary is a very fine boat
She's the finest boat afloat
She's a super duper super duper
Smashing little boatEmbed
