You Missed It All LyricsYou just see flowers
You take in beauty, not the bad things
You missed it all
There's more in loving
Than just the times when minds in tune sing
Wake up paperhead, wake up
Don’t pretend you didn't make it up
Wake up paperhead, wake up
Don't pretend you didn’t make it up
Rise up and live now
Come meet the rain
You see so little
It's quite amazing what you don't see
You missed it all
You can hear nothing
It's a shame you don't listen to me
Wake up paperhead, wake up
Don't pretend you didn't make it up
Wake up paperhead, wake up
Don't pretend you didn’t make it up
I see more than you can see
I hear more than you can hear
I see more than you can see
I hear more than you can hearEmbed
