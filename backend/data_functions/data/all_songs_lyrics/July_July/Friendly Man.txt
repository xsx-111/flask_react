Friendly Man LyricsFriendly man I know
Stops to say hello
He doesn't rush to go
Friendly man I know
Mother say stay away
Far as you can, friendly man
Friendly man walks tall
He's got no conscience at all
Just in my mind he says
Friendly man won't change his ways
Mother say stay away
Far as you can, friendly man
Friendly man knows much
Look friendly man but don't touch
Those in the town gather round
Look friendly man you're the clown
Mother say stay away
Far as you can, friendly manEmbed
