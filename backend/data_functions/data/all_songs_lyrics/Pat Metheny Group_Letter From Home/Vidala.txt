Vidala LyricsLost in the maze of emotion
I've cried your name too many times
Love is but a sentence for the heart
What wouldn't I give for the answer
That broke the spell and cleared the path
Love is but a riddle for the heart
I asked the Guard of the Temple
His lips were sealed by my own doubts
Love is but a battle for the heart
The search may never be over
Blessed be the well that so profound
Love is but a miracle from the heartEmbed
