Clayman Lyrics
Your self control makes me feel alone
I've tried confidence, had it for breakfast today
I've lost the perfection, a mess without words
As the seasons change I'll continue to ignore
The image I project is me without me
The picture that I scanned is borrowed
After the education you stopped making sense to me
Seems to me that it's all the same
Time and time and time and time again
Slowly, what I believed in, turning into a lie
To aim and miss, my supernatural art
Spending too much time with myself
Trying to explain who I am

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay
I need someone to break the silence
Before it all falls apart
I need something to cling onto
Before I break you in parts
So afraid of what you may think
And all the plastic people that surrounds me
I have to find the path to where it all begins
To teach the world my supernatural art

How come it's possible
I wish there was a way
I feel so invincible
I'm the sculpture made out of clay1Embed
