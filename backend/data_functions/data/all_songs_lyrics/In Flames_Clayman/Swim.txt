Swim Lyrics
As we build a brand new planet
Let's reconstruct and get it straight

Unlock forgotten skills
Travel to a new dimension
Solace from the dark seduction
We are the new invention

We're the settlers of year zero
Let's reconstruct and take it back

Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
The last freedom call

Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
Collect the word, add some gold
And give it back
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numb
From a thousand branches
Spreading the new voice

As we're heading for the throne
Connect, evolution will begin

Leaders of our time
Heading for a downfall
The threshold of revolution
The last freedom call

Blanked out fire etched on the crystal display
The seas are deep
You better swim
Don't go numbEmbed
