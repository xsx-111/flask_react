Square Nothing Lyrics
For all the times you left me bleeding
Clouded, weakened by the haze
Cut off my pride, enough to forgive
Reconcile, back to square nothing

It seems I lost my direction
Don't have the strength to let it slip
Have no desire for the shore
Just let me play here for some time

Spent some quality time
With the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle
But you know I'm here to win
Is this how I want to spend my days?
Shadowed, it fears me, my utopia
Try to find some peace to destroy
These are my sins, I'm heading to fall

Never understood though I accepted
All the weakness that I discover
You gave me a place to hide and lost the key
Drowned my head just to see it sink
Spent some quality time
With the demon of mine
I like the way you struggle
But you know I'm here to win
Spent some quality time
With my borrowed smile
The gleam is replaced
Rip me open and erase me
Spent some quality time
With the demon of mine
He says I like the way you struggle
But you know I'm here to win
Spent some quality time
With my borrowed smile
The gleam is replaced
Rip me open and erase meEmbed
