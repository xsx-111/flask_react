...As the Future Repeats Today Lyrics
For so long I tried to be like you
Pushed aside with no time to evolve..
There's no place that still remains
Just deserted space all left in grey
Why did we lose, the knowledge of time?
Is this the price, the hell we pay?
The poisoned fear known to man
Is he who try to find his path
The collective force blaming you
"This is the day we split in half"

Thrown to the gallow, forgotten and sore
Sworn to be different in what way I can
The sultry taste that is special to me
Is the last gleeful glimpse of a bitter man

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
As the future repeats today
So impressed, lost the faith in all I had
Broken down, I'm on my way to be dissolved
The hopes and prays of things to come
I've lost them all with glory
Urgent to aim for that short-lived joy
I see gold in all that lies before me

And so we ignore the baggers cup
Praise your act in the Grand Finale
Teach the unborn the winners sign
A welcome grin to the world Royal

Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
As the future repeats today
Down and troubled, in search for better days
Back to the beginning, I'm at the end again
All my time, compressed to itching moments
As the future repeats todayEmbed
