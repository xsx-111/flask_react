Satellites and Astronauts Lyrics
Since the day of my departure
I've been stumbling through reality
I play my symphony in reverse
In search for that special path

Be gentle to the tear in this I
Lonesome arms, lost its wings again

Buy me a trip to the moon
So I can laugh at my mistakes
I can see the end from here
From this perspective it looks kind of silly
Satellites and astronauts
Tell me there are greater things ahead
Make me feel like a man
A silent cry from the middle of hell
I - the irony - I promise, I'll be mature
So please,  please invite me
Please invite me
To your shelter again
Been hiding since I heard "never"
Take me back to yesterday, I need to grow

Buy me a trip to the moon
So I can laugh at my mistakes
I can see the end from here
From this perspective it looks kind of silly
Satellites and astronauts
Tell me there are greater things ahead
Buy me a trip to the moon
So I can laugh at my mistakes
I can see the end from here
From this perspective it looks kind of silly
Satellites and astronauts
Tell me there are-
Steal my mask and make me pay
I need a new skin
I'm going insaneEmbed
