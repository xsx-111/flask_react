Pinball Map Lyrics
As I aim for that bright white day
Conflict serum with my aura
It seems that life's so fragile
I guess I'll fly some other time
I lack from superhighway thoughts
Won't live as long as the city lights
Soaked by underwater times
Electric splash on a midnight drive

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Sometimes I don't belong
Release me from your world
Pacified by the small things in life
I wait for earthquakes to rearrange
Never been able to use the force
I've only have it read to me
Despite all the misguided faith
I'll find a place in this mess

Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common pride
Early morning moments
A glimpse of joy
But soon it's over and I return to dust
As I try to be
Everything and everyone
I shrivel up and waste away
Wish I could rape the day
Just something radical
Lost the sense of sweet things
Who's gonna take me widely?

Guided by the pinball map
The driver - still unknown to me
Who was sent to glorify?
Before we injected this common prideEmbed
