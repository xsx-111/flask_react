Long Live Politzania Lyrics"As facts are few and far between hypothesis denies all logic as to what precisely er, led to her demise. For what appears sheer grandiosity, no legacy remains except
Her crumbling ruins on which these words were found engraved:"
Politzania
Politzania
Long live Politzania
Politzania
Politzania
God save Politzania
"Now these ancient Politzanians as far as archeologists have traced had most
Thoroughly convinced themselves they were a superior race. Quite a ridiculous notion
Granted, however if we assume her sister rivals rose to quell such monstrous claims
I most humbly submit her unpleasant end is satisfactorily explained"
Politzania
Politzania
Long live Politzania
Politzania
Politzania
God save Politzania
Those citizens who questioned, those suspect harborers of doubt
Were brought before a panel of the Ministry of Health
They were tested and encephalographed
'Til rendered quite insane
When in accordance with the laws
They reprocessed their brains
They reprocessed their brains ha ha ha ha
They reprocessed their brains
Politzania, brave strong and true
Politzania, we all love you
We'll smite our foes for we are right
And God is on our side
Politzania, red, white and green
Politzania, reigning supreme
Victors in war
Champions of peace
Unto eternity
Everybody now
La la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la la
We're the masters of the worldEmbed
