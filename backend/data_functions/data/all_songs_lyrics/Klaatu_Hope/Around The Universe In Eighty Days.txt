Around The Universe In Eighty Days LyricsCome aboard my ship, I've something to show you
Some new equipment to take us where we're going
A subspace machine, a hole in the fabric
Of the very being of the universe
Ignition
Atomic power on
We must break our orbit and soar right past the planets
It took man a million years
To make it only this far
And we'll leave the solar system very soon...
Around the universe in eighty days
Sit down I think you'll like it out in space
There's nothing left to stop us now
We're sure to win the race
Sure to win the race...
In our warp where time and space are one
We can no longer see the sun
In fact there's nothing there for us to see
For light is nowhere near as fast as we
Our computer says we've exceeded expectations
When we reach our departure point there will be celebrations
What this means is our existence no longer has a limit
The universe will be our new home
Now the earth is just beginning to learn of our existence
All life in space must learn to live as one
Maybe now is the time for friendship with our neighbors
For our planet is the second from the sun
Around the universe in eighty days
Sit down I think you'll like it out in space
There's nothing left to stop us now
We're sure to win the race
Sure to win the race...Embed
