Madman Lyrics
You tried and were thrown out of the garden
Now you find it harder still
You seem quite catatonic of late
Say your last rites for the world that created you madman
Madman

Time passed and you ceased your evolution
Where is your solution now
It's over
You missed your last chance to find the answer
Before the last man becomes a madman
Madman

Weep now for the children of your children
It's not for you but they we sing
Do it
And when you realize that you blew it
You will look in the eyes of the madman
