Hope LyricsHope is like a lighthouse keeper's beam
Hope the master cobbler of our dreams
For Hope believes in desert streams
The mightiest of stars
The microcosm in a jar
Vast or small they all revolve on Hope
Hope the guardian angel of the dove
Hope a gift of guidance from above
For Hope is the heart in mother's love
No plans could be conceived
No ships could fare the seas
For there would be no courage were it not for Hope
Now the path before us lies before our very eyes
Don't you see
And it leads up to the gateway
Lead me through
Don't you see
Then come and take my hand
Raise up your head
And dry your eyes
For up ahead I see
Woh woh yeah
A ray of peace
A shining on me
So let us feel Hope
And feel the sunrise in our minds
To give Hope is to enlighten all mankind
Ah, but lose Hope and life seems black as blind
When faith gives way to fear
When motivation disappears
All is lost if one abandons Hope
All is lost
If one abandons Hope1Embed
