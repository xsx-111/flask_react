What Would I Want? Sky Lyrics
Sky
What would I want?
Sky

Is everything alright?
You feeling moany?
You feeling lonely?
You're not the only
Is everything alright?
You feeling stormy?
You feeling phony?
You're not the only
Do you get up, up, up?
Clouds stop and move above me, too bad they can't help me
What is the right way?
Do I float up, up, up?
When I stop and look around me, grays where that color should be
What is the right way?

Old glasses clinking, and a new order's blinking, and I
I should be floating, but I'm weighted by thinking
That I got on the river, really can't make it change
When the sky gets filled up too fast and the taxi-man's saying:
"You better give me some money--stop daydreaming, dude."
When the point of horizon is hiding from you
What would you want? Sky
Is everything alright?
You feeling lonely?
You feeling moldy?
You're not the only
Is everything alright?
You feeling stormy?
You feeling foamy?
You're not the only
Do you get up, up, up?
Clouds stop and move above me, too bad they can't help me
What Is the right way?
Do I float up, up, up?
When I stop and look around me, grays where that color should be
What is the right way?

Are you taking it lightly?
Lost in the flurry
You start to worry
You will be buried
Taking it lightly
And so you hurry
And then you worry
Here come those flurries
Old glasses clinking, and a new order's blinking, and I
I should be floating, but I'm weighted by thinking
I'm a fly on the river, that should make me some change
When the sky gets filled up too fast and the taxi-cab's waiting
You better give him some money--stop daydreaming, dude
When the point of horizon is hiding its blues
What would you want? Sky1Embed
