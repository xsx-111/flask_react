Bleed Lyrics
"You know, those red moments where it's thin, like, pretty, early on, and... But then, simulâ€” I also, like, include the... like the tinted blues"

Blessed
Nightmare
Heart pain
Hurtful
Somehow
I feel
Hopeful

Listen
Nightmare
New plane
I swore
Good friend
I've been
Shameful

That I must bleed

Blessed
Nightmare
Heart pain
Hurtful
Somehow
I feel
Hopeful
Listen
Nightmare
New plane
I swore
Good friend
I've been
Shameful

That I must bleed

Blessed
Nightmare
Heart pain
Hurtful
Somehow
I feel
Hopeful

Listen
Nightmare
New plane
I swore
Good friend
I've been
Shameful
That I must bleed1Embed
