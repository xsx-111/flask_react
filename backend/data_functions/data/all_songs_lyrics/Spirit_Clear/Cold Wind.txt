Cold Wind LyricsFeels like we've all known it
Been two brothers and never shown it
The sun was high but a cold wind was blowing
It feels like weâ€™ve all known it:
Been two lovers and never shown it
The sun was high but a cold wind was blowing
You gotta see
Cold winds turn away
And let us get together today
You gotta see
Cold winds turn away
And let us get together today
We can turn on one this way, this way
It feels like cold winds are dying
The sun is high, but the clouds are flying
The sun is high, but cold winds are dying
You gotta seeEmbed
