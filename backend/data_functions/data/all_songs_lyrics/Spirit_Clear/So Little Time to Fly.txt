So Little Time to Fly LyricsDo you see
The reasons why
There's very little time to fly
Find a garden
That's green all year
And you might not have to hear
The sound the city is calling
It's just around the corner
The sound the city is calling
Well, if you see
And if you know
And if you've got a place to go
Then find your friends
And take them along
And help us out to sing this song
Oh, love for everyone
It's just around the corner
Love for everyone
Do you see
A reason why
There's very little time to fly
Find a garden
That's green all year
And you might not have to hear
The sound the city is calling
It's just around the corner
The sound the city is calling
It's just around the corner
It's just around the cornerEmbed
