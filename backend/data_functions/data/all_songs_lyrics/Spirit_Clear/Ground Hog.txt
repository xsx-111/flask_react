Ground Hog LyricsGroundhog comin' on Groundhog Day
Hey, yeah
Groundhog comin' bringing the latest summer along
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Tell me, Mr. Groundhog, what do you say?
Hey, yeah
Tellin' us good folks old man winter was gone
Well, I hope you don't find no shadow 'round your hole
When you're trying to look over your shoulder
Hope you don't find no shadow 'round your hole
All because I'm counting on you
Hey, Mr. Groundhog
Sweet Miss Malley won't you go with me
Hey, yeah
Little Miss Malley won't you come along and be my bride
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Well, little may cross the mountains and the sea
Hey, yeah
Be my heart and stay close by my side
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Hope you don't find no shadow 'round your door
Don't try and look over your shoulder
Hope you don't find no shadow 'round your door
All because I'm counting on you
Hey, Mr. Groundhog
Groundhog people with your groundhog ways
Hey, yeah
I see you in the sun, but you fly when the shadows get long
Whoa, whoa, yeah
Tell me, Mr. Groundhog, what do you say?
Hey, yeah
Tellin' us good folks old man winter was gone
Old man winter was
Old man winter was
Old man winter was
Old man winter was...Embed
