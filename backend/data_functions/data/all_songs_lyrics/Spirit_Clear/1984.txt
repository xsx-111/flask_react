1984 Lyrics
Nineteen eighty-four
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run?
Nineteen eighty-four
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run your life?

Someone will be waiting
For you at your door
When you get home tonight
Ah, yes, he's gonna tell you
Darkness gives you much more
Than you get from the light

Plexi-plastic eyeball
He's your special friend
He sees you every night
Well, he calls himself Big Brother
But you know it's no game
You're never out of his sight
Nineteen eighty-four
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run your life?

It's time you started thinking
Inside your head
That you should stand up and fight
Oh, just where will you be
When your freedom is dead
Fourteen years from tonight?

Those plexi-plastic 'copters
They're your special friends
They see you every night
Well, they call themselves protection
But you know it's no game
You're never out of their sight

Nineteen eighty-four
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run?
Nineteen eighty-four
Knockin' on your door
Will you let it come?
Will you let it run your life...?Embed
