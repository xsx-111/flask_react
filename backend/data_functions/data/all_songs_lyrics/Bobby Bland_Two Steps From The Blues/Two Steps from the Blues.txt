Two Steps from the Blues LyricsOne month from the day I first met you
Your promises proved to be untrue
So step by step, I've been a fool
Now I'm just two steps from the blues
The reason we didn't get along
Was telegrams and telephone
One brings bad news, the other rendezvous
That keeps me two steps from the blues
Here is a chance to be loved or be lonely
My heart awaits your call
I know it's better to have loved and lost
Than never have loved at all
So, darling, let's try to make amends
And if it should fail, let's try and try again
Oh, it makes no difference what you say or do
I'm so forgiving, I'm so forgiving
And I can't go on living two steps from the bluesEmbed
