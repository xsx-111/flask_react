St. James Infirmary LyricsI went down to St. James Infirmary
And I heard my baby goan
And I felt so broken hearted
She used to be my very own
I tried so hard to keep from crying
My heart felt just like lead
She was all that I had to live for
Oh, I wish it was me instead
Now she's gone, she's gone and may God bless her
Wherever she may be
She can search this wide world over
Oh, but she'll never find a man like me
She's gone, she's gone...
She's goneEmbed
