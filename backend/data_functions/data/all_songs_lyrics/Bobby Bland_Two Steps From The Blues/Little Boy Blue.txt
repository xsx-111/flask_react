Little Boy Blue LyricsWhen I thought I was so high above you
You were so good to me
Even though you knew I didn't love you
You were still good to me
And when it used to make me happy to see you cry
You were so good to me and that's no lie
You used to call me, "Bobby, Little Boy Blue"
You said, "Blow your horn baby, Little Boy Blue"
You used to call me "Bobby, Bobby"
So nice to me baby, oh yes, you were
I remember, baby, when you cried all night long
I know now, darling, that I was doing you wrong
If I had a million dollars I'd give you every, a-every dime
Just to hear you call me, "Bobby", one more time
You used to call me B O B B Y, B O B B Y
"Bobby", you called me 'Bobby"'
Oh, it used to sound so good, oh yeah
You don't know how much I miss you lady, yeah, yeah
If you'd just give me one more chance, darling
Yeah, let me hear you call me "Bobby"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby
You don't know how much I love youEmbed
