I Pity the Fool Lyrics
I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool
I pity the fool, yeah
I said I pity the fool
That falls in love with you
And expects you to be true
Oh I pity the fool

Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people

I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Oh I pity the fool that falls in love with you
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
I pity the fool
I pity the fool that falls in love with you
She'll break your heart one day then she'll laugh and walk away
Oh I pity the fool
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people
I know you wonder what they're doing
They're just standing there
Watching you make a fool of me
Look at the people

I said I pity the fool
Oh I pity the fool
I said I pity the fool babyEmbed
