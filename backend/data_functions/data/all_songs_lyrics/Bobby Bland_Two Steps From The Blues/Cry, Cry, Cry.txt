Cry, Cry, Cry LyricsCry, cry, cry, cry
That's what I want you to do
Then think about the lonely nights
I sat alone and cried for you
Cry, cry, cry years
You said you didn't want me to go
It's hard to say goodbye
But I won't believe a word you say
Until you hang your head
And cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Let your tears fall like rain
And then I'll know
My love for you wasn't in vain
Come on and cry me an ocean
Then I want you to cry me a sea
Somebody's hurt you, just like you hurt me
Cry me a river, cry me a seaEmbed
