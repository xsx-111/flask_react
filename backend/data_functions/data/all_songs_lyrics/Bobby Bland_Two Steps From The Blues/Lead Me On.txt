Lead Me On LyricsYou know how it feels, you understand
What it is to be a stranger
In this unfriendly land
Here's my hand
Here is my hand
Take it, darling
And I'll follow you
Let me walk
I want to walk right by your side
Let your love be my only guide
Here's my hand
Here is my hand
Why don't you take it, darling
And just lead me on
Lead me on, lead me on
You know I'm a stranger
And I'm so all alone
Here's my hand
Here is my hand
Why don't you take it
And just lead me on
And I'll follow youEmbed
