Mr. Man Lyrics
Something about the way you smiled at me just drove me wild
Wish I could know if you're alone, don't wanna cramp your style
But I cannot deny the feel that I feel when I looked straight into your eyes
Feel my heart beating fast for the challenge may arise

I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair

Like the way you've given me attention through the night
Maybe I've had too much Remy, my man's right by my side
Every time I catch you watching me, I feel something down my spine
I'll play the game, it's just for fun and only for tonight
All night

I wanna know what makes you feel the way you do, you do
I think you're hoping there's a chance for me and you, and you
Should I meet you at the bar and say we can't, we can't?
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
Unfair to Mr. Man
I know all you wanna know is answers
'Cause you can give me what I need (You can give me everything I need)
We both know that we're attracted
Should we let our desires, should we let our desires lead?

I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do (I know, you know)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you (If it's healthy, tell me)
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't (You can meet me at the bar)
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do (Do you wanna know? I know you do)
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man
I wanna know if you feel the way I do, I do
I wanna know if there's a chance for me and you, and you
If there's no way, meet at the bar and say you can't, you can't
'Cause I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Unfair to Mr. Man1Embed
