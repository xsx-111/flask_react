Jane Doe Lyrics
Hey yo, Alicia
What's up, Kandi?
Man, these Jane Does be killing me thinking they're slick with it
For real
Drop the beat, uh
Alicia Keys (Uh, one, two, uh, one, two), Kandi, collabo, uh, uh, uh

Let's talk about the situation
'Bout how you came with information
It's negative in every which way
Just dissing my man and our relations
You say he's cheating, want me to leave him
I've changed my mind, I think I'll keep him
Listening to you will leave me lonely
That's not what I'm trying to be

'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no
See I, caught you trying to check my man out
How 'bout you 'plain what that's all about
Think you slick like I wouldn't know
But I got something for you, Doe
Mess around, end up in a choke hold
Girl, I think it's time for you to go
Away from my man and me
That's the way it's gonna be

'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no (To steal him, no, no)
Just crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (My man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him (No)
Oh no, oh no (No, no)

I love my man, he loves me more
He may not be the perfect man, but I don't plan to let him go for
Jane Doe (Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe)
Oh (Jane Doe, Jane Doe)
(Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe)
'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy, crazy) to let my man go (Mmm, man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him (Try to steal him oh, no)
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy (I'd be crazy) to let my man go (My man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no (Oh, no)
Crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him (Jane Doe)
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy to let my man go (Jane Doe, man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him (No, no)
Oh no, oh no (No, no, no, no)

Jane Doe, Jane Doe (My man go)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Oh, the Jane Doe)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Jane Doe can't have him, oh no)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe
Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Jane Doe can't have him, oh no)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Jane Doe can't have him, oh no)
Jane Doe, Jane Doe, Jane Doe (Jane Doe can't have him, oh no)
'Cause I'll be crazy (Crazy, No) to let my man go (Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (My man go)
Come and try to steal him (For no Jane Doe)
Oh no, oh no
Just crazy (Said you've got to be crazy, Crazy) to let my man go (Huh, don't you think for a minute, Man go)
And let some other Jane Doe
Come and try to steal him (No)
Oh no, oh no (No, no, no)
Crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (To let my man go)
And let some other Jane Doe (Jane Doe)
Come and try to steal him
Oh no, oh no (Can't steal my man, oh no)
Just crazy (Crazy) to let my man go (My man go)
And let some other Jane DoeEmbed
