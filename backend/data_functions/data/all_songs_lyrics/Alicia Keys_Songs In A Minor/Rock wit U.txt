Rock wit U Lyrics
There's no escape on the spell you have placed
Leaving my heart and my mind
Foolish am I, if I was to try
To ever leave you behind

I wanna rock wit' you, come give me all your love
No matter what we do, I wanna rock wit' you
Wit' you and only you, I wanna rock wit' you
I wanna rock wit' you, rock wit' you, baby

I'll stay and walk this life wit' you
No matter what we may go through
Dead broke, no job, no house, no ride
I'm gonna stay right by your side

I wanna rock wit' you, come give me all your love
No matter what we do, wanna rock wit' you
Wit' you and only you, wit' you and only you
I wanna rock wit' you, rock wit' you, baby, baby

Don't question where you're headed to, my love
Don't be (Don't be) afraid, just believe in love
I wanna rock wit' you, no matter what we do
Wit' you and only you, I wanna rock wit' you
I wanna rock wit' you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
No matter what we do (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
Wit' you and only you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
I wanna rock wit' you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
I wanna rock wit' you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
No matter what we do (They know who, this posess')
Wit' you and only you (Wanna rock wit' you baby)
I'm gonna rock wit' you (Moral is, no more less)

Do your thing, do your thing (Hey, hey)

Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing

Do your thing, do your thing

Do your thing, do your thing
Do your thing, do your thing
Mmm
