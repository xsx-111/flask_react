Why Do I Feel So Sad Lyrics
Friends we've been for so long
Now true colors are showing
Makes me wanna cry
Oh, yes, it does
'Cause I had to say goodbye

By now, I should know
That, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad?

How can I adjust
To the way that things are going?
It's killing me slowly
Oh, I just want it to be how it used to be, yeah

'Cause I wish that I could stay
But, in time, things must change
So it shouldn't be so bad
So why do I feel so sad? (Uh)

You cannot hide the way you feel inside
I realize
Your actions speak much louder than words
So tell me why, oh
By now, I should know that (Should know)
That, in time, things must change (Things must change)
So it shouldn't be, it shouldn't be so bad (Be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?
By now, I should know (I should know)
That, in time, things must change (Things must change)
So it shouldn't be so bad (Be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad?

By now, by now, I should know (I should know)
That in time things must grow
And I had to leave you behind (Things must change)
So why do I feel so sad (Be so sad)
If it couldn't be that bad?
Tell me why (Why do I feel so sad?)

By now, I should know (I should know)
That, in time, things must change (Things must change)
So it shouldn't be so bad (Be so bad)
So why do I feel so sad? (So sad)

Why do I feel so sad? (Why do I feel so sad?)
When I know that it must change (Why do I feel so sad?)
It must change, I don't mind
Just be real with me, just be truthful (Truthful)
And the rest, I'm leaving up to this one, yeah
Why does it feel so bad inside (Ah-ah-ah)
When I realize that you got to be left behind? (I feel so sad)1Embed
