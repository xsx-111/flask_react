Troubles Lyrics
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Dear Lord, can you take it away? (Ooh)
This pain in my heart that just follows me by day (Yeah)
And at night, it stalks me like the shadows on my wall (Mm)
Oh my goodness

Feel like the world is closing on me
Feel like my dreams will never come to me
I keep on slippin' deeper into myself
And I'm scared, so scared

If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (Ah)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

Why does it feel
That my mind is constantly trying to pull me down?
I can't seem to get away
Continuous mistakes I know I've made before
How long will I feel so out of place?
If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (You got to let it go)
If you're worried, baby (Oh)
You just gotta let it go (I know, I know)
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know

Yeah
I know I like you now
Can't stop, mmm

If you're troubled
You just gotta let it go (You got to let it go)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Don't you worry)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (Don't you worry, no, no)
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know (You got to let me know)
If you're troubled (Are you troubled?)
You just gotta let it go (Are you troubled?)
If you're worried, baby (Are you worried?)
You just gotta let it go (Are you worried?)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (But you're a hustler)
You just gotta take it slow (You're a hustler)
When you need me, baby (You're a)
All you do is let me know (Oh)
If you're troubled (Oh)
You just gotta let it go (Let it go)
If you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Mmm)
All your hustles ain't for nothing (You're a hustler)
You just gotta take it slow
When you need me, baby (Don't you worry)
All you do is let me know ('Cause I will run, yes, I will run)
If you're troubled (Don't you worry)
You just gotta let it go ('Cause I will run)
And if you're worried, baby
You just gotta let it go (Woo)
All your hustles ain't for nothing
You just gotta take it slow (You just gotta take it slow)
When you need me, baby
All you do is let me know
Oh
'Cause I will run to you
You, you don't have to worry
