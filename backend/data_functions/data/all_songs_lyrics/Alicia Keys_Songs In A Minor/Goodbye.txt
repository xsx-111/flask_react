Goodbye Lyrics
Mm-mm
Bye-bye

How do you love someone
That hurts you oh so bad?
With intentions good
Was all he ever had

But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long, and I've
Given him all that I could?
Maybe love is a hopeless crime
Givin' up what seems your lifetime
What went wrong with somethin' once so good?

How do you find the words to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye? (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

I know now I was na√Øve
Never knew where this would lead (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm not tryna take away, oh no
From the good man that he is
But how do I let go when I've
Loved him for so long, and I've
Given him all that I could?
Was it somethin' wrong that we did
Or 'cause others infiltrated? (Infiltrated)
What went wrong with somethin' once so good?

How do you find the words to say (To say, to say)
To say goodbye (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (No, my heart don't have the heart)
To say goodbye? (Goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)

Is this the end? (End)
Are you sure? (Are you sure?)
How should you know when you've never been here before? (Never been here before)
It's so hard to just let go (Hard, just let go)
When this is the one and only love I've ever known (Only)

So, how do you find the words to say (Man, it's been so long)
To say goodbye (To say goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (Mm-mm-mm, yeah)
To say goodbye? (To say, to say goodbye; find the words to say goodbye)
How do you find the words to say (To say, to say goodbye)
To say goodbye (To say, to say goodbye, my love; find the words to say goodbye)
When your heart don't have the heart to say (No, my heart don't have the heart)Embed
