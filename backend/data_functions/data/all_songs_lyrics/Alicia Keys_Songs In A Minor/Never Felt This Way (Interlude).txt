Never Felt This Way (Interlude) Lyrics
There will never come a day
You will never hear me say
That I want to or need to be without you
I wanna give my all
Baby, just hold me
Simply control me
Because your arms
They keep away the loneliness

When I look into your eyes
Then I realize
All I need is you in my life
All I need is you in my life

'Cause I never felt this way about loving, no
Never felt so good, baby
Never felt this way about loving
It feels so good2Embed
