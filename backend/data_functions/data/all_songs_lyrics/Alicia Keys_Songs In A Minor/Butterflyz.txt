Butterflyz Lyrics
Mm-hm
Mm-hm-mm

Lately, when I look into your eyes, I realize
You're the only one I need in my life
Baby, I just don't know how to describe
How lovely you make me feel inside

You give me butterflies
Have me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies

It seemed like the likely thing
From the start, you told me, yeah
I would be your queen
But never had I imagined such a feeling
Joy is what you bring, I wanna give you everything

You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control these butterflies
You and I are destiny
I know now
You were made for me (Oh)
Oh, ooh-ooh
I can't control it
It's driving me
Taking over me, and I, oh-ooh

You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control the butterflies
You give me butterflies (Butterflies)
Got me flying so high in the sky
I can't control, I can't control it (Butterflies)
You give me butterflies (Butterflies)
Got me flying so high in the sky (Butterflies)
I can't control the butterflies, oh no, oh no, oh no

You give me something I just can't deny (Got me flying so high in the sky)
Something that's so real
I just can't control the way I feel (Control the butterflies)
Inside of me (Oh no, oh no, oh no)
You give me something I just can't deny (Butterflies)
Something that's so real (Got me flying so high in the sky)
I just can't control the way I feel
Oh, I never felt like thisEmbed
