Million Dollar Bash LyricsWell, that big dumb blonde with Gorgeous George
And Turtle, a friend of theirs, with his cheques all forged
And his cheeks in a trunk with a cheese in the cash
You're all gonna be there at that million dollar bash, and it's
(Chorus)
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
Ooh baby, ooh-ee
It's that million dollar bash
Everybody from right now go over there and back
The louder they come, well the bigger they crack
Come now, ?sweet pea?, and don't forget the flash
We're all gonna meet at that million dollar bash
(Chorus)
Well, I took my counsellor out to the barn
Silly Nelly was there, she told him a yarn
Then along came Jones and emptied the trash
Everybody went down to that million dollar bash
(Chorus)
Well, I been hittin' it too hard, you know, my ?sloes? won't take
I get up in the morning, bit too early to wake
First it's "Hello", then "Goodbye", they push and they crash
But everybody's gonna make it to that million dollar bash
(Chorus)
Well, I looked at my watch then I looked at my wrists
Punched myself in my face with my fists and I
Took my taters back a-home to be mashed
But then I made it right on to that million dollar bash
(Chorus)
(Chorus)
(Chorus)Embed
