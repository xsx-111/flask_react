The Ballad of Easy Rider LyricsThe river flows, flows to the sea
Whereever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
All he wanted was just to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow, river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
Flow river go, past the shady tree
Flow river flow, flow to the sea
Flow river flow, flow to the sea
The river flows to the sea
Whereever that river goes that's where I want to be
Flow river flow, let your waters wash down
Take me from this road to some other town
All he wanted was just to be free
And that's the way it turned out to be
Flow, river flow, let your waters rush down
Take me from this road to some other town
Flow river go, past the shady tree
Flow river flow, flow to the sea
Flow river flow, flow to the seaEmbed
