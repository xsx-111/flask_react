Silver Rings LyricsSilver rings, stay with me
Silver rings
Oh
Stay with me, my love
Oooooooo...
I don’t think
About dying, alone
I don’t think
About dying, alone
Silver rings, stay with me
Oh oh oh
Silver rings, stay with me
My love
Oooooooo...
I don’t think
About dying alone oh oh oh
I don’t think
About dying alone
Silver rings
Stay with me oh oh oh
Silver rings
Stay with me
My love
Oooooooo...
