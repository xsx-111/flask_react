Turns Turns Turns LyricsI know, I know
I did something free
I can’t tell if it’s wrong
Running cross eyed
Hearing the sound of my lungs
I’m hoping that it feels good
It turns, it turns, it turns
Trying to breath in
In turns, in turns, in turns
I’m hoping that it's easy
It turns, it turns, it turns
I know, I know
Watch out when you are faced by
What you don’t know
Eyes turn, cheeks burn
Tell me where do I go?
I’m hoping that it feels good
It turns, it turns, it turns
Trying to breath in
It turns, it turns, it turns
I’m hoping that it's easy
It turns, it turns, it turns
I’m hoping you believe me
It turns, it turns, it turns
I know, I know1Embed
