This Is Magic LyricsI feel like a kid
I see some monsters standing over my crib
And they fall in
Somebody knows who I am
Somebody sees me and wants to be my friend
And I know
This is all that I want
I had dreams about you when I was so young
And you're mine, mine
I hear a murderer walk
I hear his footsteps talk through the floorboards in my house
And he climbs the stairs
If this is all that I have
If this song is the last thing I do I feel so good
That I sang it
I see this light
Coming from behind and growing to enormous size
This is magic, magic
As I let my body go
I thought you should know that it's been so fine
I've been fine, fine
I feel like a kid
I see some monsters standing over my crib
And they fall in, in1Embed
