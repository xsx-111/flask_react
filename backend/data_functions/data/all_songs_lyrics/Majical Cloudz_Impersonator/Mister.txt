Mister Lyrics
I say I've seen it all before
And the lie damns me
I say I've seen it all before
And they all tell me

Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?

I feel I'm not without your love
I feel carried
I feel I'm not without your love
And your eyes don't scare me

I feel the mood to love myself
And I know I'm trying
I feel the mood to love myself
I want to be loving

Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Love come down
I'm feeling down
Love goes down
I'm feeling down, down

I say I've seen it all before
And the lie damns me
I say I've seen it all before
And they all tell me

Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?
Hey Mister, don't you want to be right here?

Love come down
I'm feeling down
Love goes down
I'm feeling down, down1Embed
