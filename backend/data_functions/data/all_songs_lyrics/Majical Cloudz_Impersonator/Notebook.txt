Notebook LyricsHey man, sooner or later you'll be dead
I want you to know I've got respect
Both of us have seen the light
It caused an obsession
Hey now, if it's not too late I'd like to know
How much do I have to love to grow?
Will I be alone forever?
I don't want to turn to the Bible
Hey man, do you remember what you said
When you heard voices in your head?
Something on that scribbled paper
Omnia vincit amor
Hey now, see you in your hospital gown
Never let surroundings bring you down
You and me won't be here forever
Love will conquer these feelingsEmbed
