I Do Sing for You LyricsLoving you
I'm loving you
I'm loving you
I want to
I would love to
You would laugh
But I'm on stage for you
I do sing for you
Of course I do and I love to
Now, say goodbye
But I don't want to
Then I don't have to
Oh oh oh
Then I don't have to
Oh oh oh
Then I don't have to
Here with you
We're a pair me and you
In my soul it's true
I wanna know you
I would love to
When you go
I will worship you
I will remember you
Of course I would
I would love to
Now, say goodbye
But I don't want to
Then I don't have to
Oh oh oh
Then I don't have to
Oh oh oh
Then I don't have to
Loving you
I'm loving you
I'm loving you
I want to
I would love to4Embed
