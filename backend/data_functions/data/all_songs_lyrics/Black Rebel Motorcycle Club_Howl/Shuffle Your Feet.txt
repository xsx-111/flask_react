Shuffle Your Feet LyricsTime won't save our souls
Time won't save our souls
Time won't save my soul, no
Well everything's going down
Nothing seems to feel the same
No one seems to know my name
No one seems to go my way
Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again
One more for the soul mate dreamers
One more for the wicked man
One more for the peaceful protest
That keeps the war in demand
Who knows if I'll see you again
Who knows if I'll see you again
(Probably not darling)
Time won't save our souls
Time won't save my soul, no
Time it won't save our souls
Time won't save my soul, no
I never thought I'd see it coming
I never thought I'd ever know
Nothing seems to take me over
Nothing seems to let me go
Who knows if I’ll see you again
Who knows if I’ll see you againEmbed
