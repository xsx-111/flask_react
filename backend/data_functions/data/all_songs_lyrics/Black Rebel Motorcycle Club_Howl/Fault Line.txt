Fault Line LyricsI've been waiting on the fault line
Living evil take me on
I'll be standing with my dying bed
If you care to come along
Racing with the rising tide to my father's door
Racing with the rising tide to my father's door
I've been lying in the bright light
See my shadow from below
Never wanted from another man
Never wanted for my own
Drowning in the rising tide at my father's door
Drowning in the rising tide at my father's door
Through a window to the last mile
My living picture on the wall
From the banks on the far side
See the lights come ashore
Racing from the rising tide to my father's door
Racing from the rising tide to my father's door
Racing with the rising tide to my father's doorEmbed
