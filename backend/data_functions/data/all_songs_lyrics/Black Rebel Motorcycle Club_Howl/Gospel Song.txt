Gospel Song LyricsI will walk with Jesus 'til I can't go anymore
And I will stay with Jesus 'til I can't go another mile
And people will see all the good that's concealed
And people must know not to feel any sorrow
'Cause I will not stand by and watch you cry
I will stay with Jesus 'til I can't stay anymore
And I will stand with Jesus 'til I can't take another stone
And people will see all the good that's concealed
And people will know not to feel any sorrow
'Cause I will not stand by and watch you cryEmbed
