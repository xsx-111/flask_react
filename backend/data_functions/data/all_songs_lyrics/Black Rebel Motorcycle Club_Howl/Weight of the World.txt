Weight of the World LyricsThis is more than I wanted
Take me out of the dark I roam in
Cold and black you are out of touch here
Lightly falling you whisper you're scared
It's the weight of the world I know
As I struggle to be whole
It's the weight of the world I know
As you are mine and we will find
This is stranger than love or loss
Turning backwards you face the dawning
No excuse for a wasted life
Lightly falling through a whisper of sky
It's the weight of the world I know
As I struggle to be whole
It's the weight of the world I know
As you are mine and we will find
Time will change
Still the world remains the same
Time will change
Still the world remains the same
It's the weight of the world I know
As I struggle to be whole
It's the weight of the world I know
As you are mine and we will findEmbed
