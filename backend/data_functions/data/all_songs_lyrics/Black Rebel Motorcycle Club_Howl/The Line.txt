The Line LyricsI am the line
I hold you near
There is no burden left to bear
I can see clear
You're in suspension
You know no love
There is no story left to tell
You have no wisdom to pass on
I am the soul of absolution
No man can hide his own illusion
My hands are crippled from the pain
You are the splinter in my vein
You put your head between your hands
And understand nothing it has
I feel the answers keep you scared
I've put the harm inside myself
I am the line
I hold you near
There is no burden left to bear
I can see clear
I am perfected
I know no void
I have no conscience to keep clear
I understand there's nothing more
You try to kid yourself with questions
Bleeding inside for some correction
I found you tied unto the cross
Your judgment owns your every thought
You know my words all mean the same
You've buried here to isolate
Into this prison in your mind
Where you were born without a spine
When did you stop caring?
When did you stop caring?
When did you stop caring?
When did you stop caring?1Embed
