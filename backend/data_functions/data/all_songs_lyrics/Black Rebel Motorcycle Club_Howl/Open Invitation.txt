Open Invitation LyricsOn and on
I've been waiting on the open invitation
Your silence show me no relation
In the rising cold
Don't you feel alone
I'll be standing with your sorrow
All you left me's gone away tomorrow
And we may never be here again
And we may never be here again
Pull me up
On either side
Don't leave me standing alone in the light
Pull me up
On either side
Don't leave me standing alone in the light
On and on
I've been waiting on the open invitation
Your silence show me no relation
In the rising cold
Don't you feel alone
I'll be standing with your sorrow
All you left me's gone away tomorrow
And we may never be here again
And we may never be here againEmbed
