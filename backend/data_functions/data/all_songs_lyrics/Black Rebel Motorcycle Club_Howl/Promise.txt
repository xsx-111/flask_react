Promise LyricsSon, I see it in your eyes
There is a burden you cannot hide
But in their arms you feel so alive
And in a moment you're cast aside
All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you
I'll stay with you
It's a promise not forgotten
Now I hear you in my mind
There is a story you bring to life
And I will bow gently by your feet
But tread softly, you tread on my dreams
All lines have broken and we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you
I'll stay with you
It's a promise not forgotten
You're crying all these tears but they mean to leave you dry
Still fighting all these years about the same old things
We wished we never had
The vision softly fades
But there's a light that still remains
And in these walls I feel your sadness wane
But in a moment you'll feel no pain
All lines have broken but we need you to hold on
Your eyes have opened but you've got to go on
I'll comfort you
I'll sing to you
It's a promise not forgotten
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Come on baby let's light the sunrise
Come on baby let's light the night
Light the night
Let's light the nightEmbed
