Sympathetic Noose LyricsI got a feeling I can't lose
I got a sympathetic noose
But I don't know how to be grateful
Yeah, I don't know how you're thankful
I got a feeling I can't lose
I got a sympathetic noose
Cause I don't know how to lean on
Yeah, I don't know how to be freed from
You got to keep you head up
You got to let yourself get through
When all you'll ever dream
Lifts you up too high
As all your expectations leave a hold inside
And all you'll ever dream
Lifts you up too high
As all your expectations leave a hold inside
I got a feeling in my boots
I got to make some sense to you
Cause I don't know how to be careful
Yeah, I don't know how to be there for
I got a feeling I can't prove
I got a sympathetic noose
Cause I don't know how you're grateful
Yeah, I don't know how to be thankful
You got to keep you head up
You got to let yourself get through
When all you'll ever dream
Lifts you up too high
As all your expectations leave a hold inside
And all you'll ever dream
Lifts you up too high
As all your expectations leave a hold insideEmbed
