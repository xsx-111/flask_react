Howl LyricsYou try so hard to be cold, you try so hard to not show
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me
I give you all that I have but you don't see
Now I know that my eyes must close here
Every word seems to feel like you don't care
But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't wanna give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going on
You try so hard to be heard, you try so hard to not hurt
I give you nothing to doubt and you doubt me
I give you all that I have but you don't see
Now I know that my eyes must close here
Every word seems to feel like you don't care
But I know that you're so confused and afraid
I just want to be one true thing that don't fade
I don't wanna give up tomorrow
I just can't understand why we're going on
I don't wanna be sad, I don't wanna be sad
I don't wanna be scared, I don't wanna be scared
I don't wanna decide, I don't wanna decide
I see the road is hard, I see the road is hard
I won't wait for you in silence, I won't wait for you in silence
I won't wait for you in silence, I won't wait for you in silenceEmbed
