Still Suspicion Holds You Tight LyricsYou're everything you need and so you fight
You take them on your own until you die
The wisdom in your breath comes much too late
And everyone you see just gets a face
In time the words will come they say with faith
But everything you see just turns you gray
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
No mind or cares decisions must be made
Whose side who's on, no questions should be saved
Your purpose comes when nothing's left in sight
And it's clearly seen that nothing here feels right
Now everyone's afraid 'cause no one moves
Not towards anything, worth anything to you
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
The righteous come and bleed you from the bone
It's all they ever wanted from your soul
They're hidden in intentions and no more
And it's all you'll ever get if you let go
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tight
You're everything you need
The still suspicion holds you tightEmbed
