Hey Jude (Take 2) Lyrics
From the heart of the black country
When I was a robber
In Boston place
You gathered 'round me
With your fine embrace

Hey Jude, don’t make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it’s a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder

Mmm, hey Jude, don't let me down
She has found you, go out and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it
Better better better better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Better better better better better, oh

Yeah, na na na na na na, na na na na, yeah Jude, yeah
Naa, na na na na na na, uh make it Jude!
Na na na na, hey Jude, hey Jude, yeah
Naa, na na na na na na, uh make it Jude!
Na na na na, hey Jude, ooh ooh, yeah
Na na na na na, na na na na, oh yeah!
Na na na na na na na, Jude!Embed
