Junk (Esher Demo) Lyrics
Motorcars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bags for two
 â€”boree


Motorcars, handlebars
Bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots
Sleeping bag for you
 jamboree

 shop window
"Why? Why?" says the junk in the yard

"Buy! Buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why?" says the junk in the yard
