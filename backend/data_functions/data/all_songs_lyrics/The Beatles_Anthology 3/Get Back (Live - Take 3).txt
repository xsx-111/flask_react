Get Back (Live / Take 3) Lyrics
Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jojo
​​
Go home

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Jo


Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was a woman
But she was another man
All the girls around her say she's got it coming
But she gets it while she can
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Get back, Loretta

Hoo
Go home

Oh, get back, yeah, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Yeah, get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged
Ooo

Get back, ooh
Thanks, MoeEmbed
