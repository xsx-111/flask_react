Let It Be (Take 1) Lyrics
Are we supposed to giggle in the solo?
Yeah
Okay
This'll.. This is gonna knock you out boy

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

When all the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
But though they may be parted there is
Still a chance for that to see
There will be an answer, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be


Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

Yeah, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Oh, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Yeah, oh let it be, let it be
I think that was rather grand
I'd take one home with me
Okay lets track it
You bounder! You cheat!Embed
