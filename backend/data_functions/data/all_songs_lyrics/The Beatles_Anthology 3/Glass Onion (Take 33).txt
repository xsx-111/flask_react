Glass Onion (Take 33) Lyrics
I told you 'bout Strawberry Fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well here's another place you can go
Where everything flows

Looking through the bent back tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul

Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you, man, he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me

Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dove-tail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion

It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!
It's a goal!Embed
