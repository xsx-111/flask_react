Glass Onion (Esher Demo) Lyrics
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It’s just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It's just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
 half lives
Looking through a glass onion

I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here’s a place you know just as real, ooh
It's just another place you can go
Where, everything glows
(Help!)
 bent backed tulips 
 how the other half lives 
Looking through a glass onion
