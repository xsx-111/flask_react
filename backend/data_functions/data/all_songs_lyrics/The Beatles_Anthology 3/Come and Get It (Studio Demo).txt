Come and Get It (Studio Demo) Lyrics
Red light

Demo take one

If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast

If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast

If you want it, here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it, any time
I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last

Did I hear you say that there must be a catch?
Will you walk away from a fool and his money?

Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
Woo, fool and his money

Sonny, if you want it, here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fast
You'd better hurry because it's going fastEmbed
