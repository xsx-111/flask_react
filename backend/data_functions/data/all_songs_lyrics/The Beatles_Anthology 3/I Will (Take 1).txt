I Will (Take 1) Lyrics
Who knows how long I've loved you, yeah?
You know I love you still
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
If you want me to, I will, hmm

You know if I ever saw you
I didn't catch your name
But it never really mattered
I will always feel the same

Love you forever and forever
Love you with all my heart
Love you whenever we're together
Love you with all my heart

And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
When it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear me to you
Oh, you know, I will
I will
