Mean Mr. Mustard (Esher Demo) Lyrics
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

He's such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Shirley works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
It's the only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man (Hey!)

Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty
Mean Mr. Mustard
Such a dirty, dirty
Mean Mr. Mustard
(Such a dirty, dirty)
Oh yeah brother, come here
I'll grip yourâ€”grip your thigh
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper (shoot)
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

He's such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
