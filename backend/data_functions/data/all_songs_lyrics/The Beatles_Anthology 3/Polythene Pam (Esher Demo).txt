Polythene Pam (Esher Demo) Lyrics
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
See Polythene Pam

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
Well it's a little absurd
But she's a nice class of bird
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Say she was attractively built

See Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag (...News of the World...)
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
See Polythene Pam

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
That makes the News of the World
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl (it's a little absurd)
 say she was attractively built

Ahh
It's too hard, thatEmbed
