Honey Pie (Esher Demo) Lyrics
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

Now honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong

You became a legend of the silver screen
And now you're 

Now honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong


Will the wind that blew her boat away to sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
To be where you belongEmbed
