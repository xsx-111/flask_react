Tinseltown Swimming in Blood LyricsTinseltown swimming in blood
Tinsel ribbons dancing in the rain
Flowers on the skyline, hey how was the wine?
What comes round's going round again
Towers coming up for air
I couldn't see, I was blind
Off in the corner, doing poet's work
That's alright for now
It was just a dream of your blue eyes
Tinseltown dripping in blood
Tinsel women dancing in the wind
Dead flowers on the skyline
Hey how was the wine, baby?
What comes round is going round again
Now let me tell you about the dream:
I had no feeling, I had no past
I was the arctic, I was the vast
Spaces without reprieve
I was a dreamer
Watch me leaveEmbed
