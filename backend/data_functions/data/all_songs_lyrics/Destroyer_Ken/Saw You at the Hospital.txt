Saw You at the Hospital LyricsSaw you at the hospital
Your mind was insane
Your gown was on wrong in the rain
Well, it's a trick, at least I think so
I don't wanna know
Saw you at the Palace Hotel
In your robes from hell
On glass
Your silhouette
Says I'm not there yet
But soon I'm going to be...
Free at last
Saw you at the castle
Your eyes were clearly insane and your robes undone
I'm around, so is she
Do nothing till you hear from me, wasted beneath a landslide
Saw you at the hospital
Your mind was on fire
Your gowns were falling down
Well it's a scene, at least we think so
Well it's a scene, at least we think so
Says the amplifiers to the snow
You watch 'em, you watch 'em glow...
You watch 'em, you watch 'em glow...
You watch 'em, you watch 'em glow...Embed
