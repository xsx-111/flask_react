Sometimes in the World LyricsI can't pay for this.  All I've got is money
And money don't make the world spin
Sometimes in the world the thing that you love dies
And you cry and you cry and cry
Sometimes in the world you turn your back on it
Don't normally go in for that kind of thing, as a rule
Vancouver's got a new Caligula, hey that's cool
Sometimes in the world.  Sometimes in the world
Sometimes in the world.  Sometimes in the world
Sometimes in the world, you're very alive
You're nuts and bolts and electrocutions
You're antidotes, you're solutions
I can't pay for this.  All I've got is money
I can't pay for this.  All I've got is moneyEmbed
