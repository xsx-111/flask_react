Ivory Coast LyricsAt night I sit and watch the world go by
I'm never never gonna try for the world
Like a rolling stone, always alone
With the father and the ghost
And the ivory on the Ivory Coast
Mama says
"Sometimes everyone hurts
Some beasts eat their shirts
When they're hungry!"
The future looks bleak
The future looks bright
Colour of a star, in the shape of a kite
Will I have to say goodbye to all this dirt, all this snow?
Yes, I think so...
Mama said
"No no no no no."
Like a rolling stone, always alone
In any kind of weather
Good things come to those who wait forever
Good things come to those who wait forever
Good things come to those who wait foreverEmbed
