La Regle du Jeu LyricsTuesday: trees are weeping for the sky and its obscene
Marriage to a woman and its vulgar marriage to a man
A roll of the dice in a world that is bawling and totally loaded
That is bawling and totally loaded...
Thursday: possibilities, slim and endless
Possibilities, slim and endless
The excellent beautiful woman
Left behind at the party by her friends
With a pig of a man who is wasted
She is wasted and slightly blinded
But not so blind as to not see...
L'America...
But not so blind as to not see...
La Règle du Jeu, La Règle du Jeu
La Règle du Jeu, La Règle du Jeu
La Règle du Jeu, La Règle du Jeu
But not so blind as to not see...Embed
