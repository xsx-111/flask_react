Cover from the Sun LyricsNancy takes a bow
Sheila takes Manhattan
Lunatics in satin
I think I know what you did last summer
You run for cover from the sun
So what's new, the girl thinks you are a blonde Che Guevara
Asleep in cars, theatre under stars
Shakespeare in the park, you've come undone
It was the year of the tour of the skin, not her own
My life's completely blown
I spent it on a feeling!
So sleep in cars
Theatre under stars
Read Shakespeare in the bars
I think I know what you did last summer
You run for cover from the sunEmbed
