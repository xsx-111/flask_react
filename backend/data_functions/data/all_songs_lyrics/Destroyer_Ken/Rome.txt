Rome LyricsYou go out, it's no good
You remain made of wood
It's cruel and unusual
It's insane to be out
In the cold light
In the hallways of the world
You keep hearing it said -
"You're a doornail, you're dead
You're dead.  You're dead.  You're dead."
You're dead...
But one look in his eyes and you know that you're going
One look and you know that you're gone
Please don't bother trying to find her
Let's check your sales, England and Wales
It's not looking good for the dusk, for the dawn
Do not save the date.  Wait.  Get out of town
You do not save the date, you wait
You get out of town
You do as Romans do
You do as Romans do
You do as Romans doEmbed
