Stay Lost LyricsStay lost.  Never found
Out on the street, in The Book of the Dead, for a living
Stay lost.  It's an illusion
Being alone's an illusion
Come on, agitation!
W-w-wake up, sh-sh-shake it up!
Levitate!  This burden is just
These here three stones!
Stay lost!  Stray!
Out on the streets, in The Book of the Dead
Out on the streets, in The Book of the Dead
Out on the streets, in The Book of the Dead
Out on the streets, in The Book of the Dead
Out on the streets...Embed
