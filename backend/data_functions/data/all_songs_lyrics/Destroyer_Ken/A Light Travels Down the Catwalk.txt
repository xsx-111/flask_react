A Light Travels Down the Catwalk LyricsStrike an empty pose
A pose is always empty
The girl sure loves her roses
The camera lens closes
On bullshit for the night
It's grief, it's suffering
A thorn in my side told me, "Hold, please"
A thorn in my side tells me we’ll see
A light travel down the catwalk
Let down your curls
Your guests will soon be arriving
On the boulevard of sinners
It's later than you think
On the boulevard of sinners, it’s sunset...
Strike an empty pose
A pose is always empty
The boy sure knows his roses
The camera lens closes
On bullshit for the night
Money comes, money goes
A girl down on Easy Street gathers up her clothes
In Berlin it’s sunny; Barcelona, it snows
A light travels down the catwalk
A light travels down the catwalk
A light travels down the catwalk
A light travels down the catwalk
Strike an empty poseEmbed
