Sad Sad Kiddie Lyrics

I know you
You get on my nerves
You feel that way too
It's the same with me

You don't see me
Too late for regrets
I can't permit you
To stain my pride

Will you leave behind the lost words?
Just a few steps to tell
There's no use saying anything
Hey, You!
Sad Sad Kiddie, so long

I know you
You are not my type
If I were you, I want to hide
It's so to speak, grown-up baby
You are selfish, an idle fish
Will you leave behind the lost words?
Just a few steps to tell
There's no use saying anything
Hey, You!
Sad Sad Kiddie, so long

Will you leave behind the lost words?
Just a few steps to tell
There's no use saying anything
Hey, You!
Nobody comes to help you forever
Sad Sad Kiddie, so longEmbed
