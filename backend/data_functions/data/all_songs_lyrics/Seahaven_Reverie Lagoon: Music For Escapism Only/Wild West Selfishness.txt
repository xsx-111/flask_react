Wild West Selfishness Lyrics
No more friends
Never needed them
Read her skin
Never again
Took your steps
Left me under them
It's wild west selfishness

Someone left you looking for a reason
Found it in the Reverie Lagoon
Hate to see you lose you in illusion
Don't forget who's watching you

Junebug came
Left with everything
Change my name
Change my face

Someone left you looking for a reason
Found it in the Reverie Lagoon
Hate to see you lose you in illusion
Don't forget who's watching you
Someone left you looking for a reason
Found it in the Reverie Lagoon
Hate to see you lose you in illusion
Don't forget who's watching youEmbed
