Love to Burn LyricsThe diamonds in your eyes they keep my sunglasses on
We take the love we feel we earn and leave the rest to burn
You don't need me, but we'll make believe like you do
Well you don't
I'll be sour, you be sweet; it's nothing new
What are you still doing here?
I know the space is hard enough without me making moreEmbed
