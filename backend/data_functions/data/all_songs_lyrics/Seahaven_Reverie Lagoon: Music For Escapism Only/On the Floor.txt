On the Floor Lyrics
When you know that it’s wrong, yet you still move it along
And you find, all in all, for yourself it’s better off
There’s something you create that won’t ever wash away
Well, you knew it was wrong; it is wrong

So you buy and you sell the means of keeping you from hell
But the ghost on your trail can’t seem to neglect a step
There’s a noose in his hand with a shape to fit your neck
Keep on running from hell; this is hell

Ain’t it something when everything falls apart?
The ground you build upon determines if you’ll fall
It’s slow motion as I watch it from the hall all come undone
It’s the past that leaves you on the floor
Leaves you on the floor

Forgiveness, it comes with a humiliating clause
It’s the last thing you want, and the first to move forth
Now your demons are sewn to your shoulder, clearly shown
It is your futile refrain from vulnerable

Ain’t it something when everything falls apart?
The ground you build upon determines if you’ll fall
It’s slow motion as I watch it from the hall all come undone
It’s the past that leaves you on the floor
Leaves you on the floor
As you fall, you faintly hear a familiar song
Hum along, “hallelujah.”
Now he’s gone, as is the time you now have lost
We die alone, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Ain’t it something when everything falls apart?
The ground you build upon determines if you’ll fall
It’s slow motion as I watch it from the hall all come undone
It’s the past that leaves you on the floor
Leaves you on the floor6Embed
