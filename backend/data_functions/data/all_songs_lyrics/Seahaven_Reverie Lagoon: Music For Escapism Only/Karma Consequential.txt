Karma Consequential LyricsShe will pass by a noose tied with loose ends
I will follow her
She buried a burden and called it a miracle
Ain't it something how they grow?
Fold up your story and stow it in a safe place
Unfold in a decade or when you feel ready
A title will follow; "Karma Consequential."
Equipped with conclusion to eat up your soul
She watches the sun fall into its destiny
Out of her hand, sunshine flees
Now living in darkness, she runs with the skeletons
That ain't what it was in ninety-one
In some odd years you will rest in a field
While remorse in the heat smells of ripening grapes
I will come visit you when the poppies are blooming
And carry a bloodline on back to the root
We don't take time from misery, for anyone
Don't it feel time, to let it be humanly?Embed
