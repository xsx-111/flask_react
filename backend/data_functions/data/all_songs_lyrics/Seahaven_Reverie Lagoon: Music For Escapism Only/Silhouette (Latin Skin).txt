Silhouette (Latin Skin) LyricsAnd your friends, are they dangerous
And if they are, well how much
And your friends, are they glamorous
And if they are, lost interest
Silhouette, loose sundress, low sunset, baby
Desert heat, come with me, just one drink, thirsty
This city ain't safe at sundown
And your chest, does it sound a beat
And if it does, we can never be
Silhouette, loose sundress, low sunset, baby
Desert heat, come with me, just one drink, thirsty
This city ain't safe at sundown
I thought you noticed all our blemish
Didn't you know this is temporary
Inject a face into a memory
Extract before you reach the final scene
That way you will only be left with the grave
And not the hell to pay
Silhouette, loose sundress, low sunset, baby
Desert heat, come with me, just one drink, thirsty
This city ain't safe at sundown1Embed
