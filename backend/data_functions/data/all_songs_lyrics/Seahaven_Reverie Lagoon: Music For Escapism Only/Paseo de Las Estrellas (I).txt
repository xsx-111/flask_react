Paseo de Las Estrellas (I) LyricsFell asleep to dream
To meet subconsciously
But you were hidden deep
You were "absentee."
As were all my teeth
Do you know what that means?
River without flow
Boat without its oars
Wind without its blow
Where'd you go?
Thought deep might have deeper means
So I kneeled down to see
As strange as it may seem
You were the water's sheen
I guess that's what I get
Not you, but what I am
The bittersweet result of all things supernaturalEmbed
