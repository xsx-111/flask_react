Andreas LyricsCome to me, come to me
Yeah, I'll be your friend
You're sitting alone at home
With your open wrists that bleed all over
Been notable years now
Well, it's easy for me
Yeah, yeah
And maybe if I was not so vain
Well maybe then I would have seen it

You will find yourself in time
All it will take is some time
Know that all that it will take is some time
I am furthest from the sun
Closest to roots of the tree
You're not the only one under shade suffering
You'll hate her forevermore
And you'll love her the same
And she'll never understand no
Cause life seems to work that way
The dark DNA intact
Leaves a stain in your brain
Yeah I know
That I am not all that you see
Most of it you'd never want to be

I need my degree
I'm breaking
Priority
I'm learning
All that is me
I will be
Not enough time
For trying
All that you are
Is much more
Than what you call
As your worth
You're who this is for
You're foremost
Don't you forget
I love you
