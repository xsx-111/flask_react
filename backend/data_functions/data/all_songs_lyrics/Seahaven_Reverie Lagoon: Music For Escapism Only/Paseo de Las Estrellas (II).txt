Paseo de Las Estrellas (II) LyricsMurky are the lessons
Taught from stars above
Rub my eyes forever
We're made of skin and bone
That's why we stay searching
For perception well disguised
As someone or something missing
We plead without reply
Lately it's acceptance
That keeps my face intact
It's rightful place in virtue
As wrong as it can sound
Everything has reason
At least I'd like to believe
If not, this world no longer has a thing to offer meEmbed
