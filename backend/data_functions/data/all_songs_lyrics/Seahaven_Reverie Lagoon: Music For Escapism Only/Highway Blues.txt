Highway Blues LyricsSick on the I-5 with you on my mind
The sun is high, but it don't shine
I am making my way in heavy spite
To denounce you line after line
Great fields, they pass, made of greener grass
My neck fights my will to not look back
At everything that I never had and now will never have

Just promise to let me know if you come around
I won't be too far from Torrance, California
I'll come to you at the moment I hear your call
Pick you up in your truck, this time no hesitation
This life's a mess, you and I know best
But we ain't got much control I guess
I sat out in the rain on the first Christmas
Your brother stood and said
"Is God really that dirty, to not grant a man's only wish?
You do not understand his Love, I'm sorry you never will."

You were the lonely one
Now I am the lonely one
You buried your Love
So I dig for your Love
