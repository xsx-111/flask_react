Solar Eclipse LyricsDark stains on ivory
They'll never go away
They look a lot like me
Found ways to hold the weight
Pawn to heredity
But I am me
I'm sorry for all of the things that you don't know
I'm everything now that you would never want
If you knew the length of my selfishness
Distant and naive are two that still believe
Gentle hands that feed
And on my chest one sleeps
The closest one to me in every way
In a parking lot, in a burning truck, I'm waiting around
The hours pass. I'm a mess, and it's getting worse
I'm freezing cold sweats are all that I'm worth
You're at home, lying proud of a son
But it don't shine anymoreEmbed
