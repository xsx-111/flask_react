Baby Stick Around LyricsCome on you people get your dancing shoes on
Reds and yellow and pinks and blues on
Too late, too late
To stay home and sit around
Purple leopard skin and see-through plastic
Whatever you want, but just make it drastic
Too late, too late To stay home and sit around
What you wanna bet
We ain't started yet
Baby stick around
Baby stick around
Pushin' and shovin' and sweat wet leather
Up and down we go chained together
Too late, too late
To stay home and sit around
Somebody tellin' me the latest scandals
Somebody steppin' on my plastic sandals
Too late, too late
To stay home and sit around
What you wanna bet
We ain't started yet
Baby stick around
Baby stick around
Too late, too late
To stay home and sit around
What you wanna bet
We ain't started yet
Baby stick around
Baby stick aroundEmbed
