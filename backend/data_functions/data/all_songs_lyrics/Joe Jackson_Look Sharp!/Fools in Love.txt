Fools in Love LyricsFools in love, well are there any other kind of lovers?
Fools in love, is there any other kind of pain?
Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you see, everything you know now
Everything you do, you do it for your lady love
Your lady love, your lady love, your lady love
Fools in love, are there any creatures more pathetic?
Fools in love, never knowing when they've lost the game
Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you see, everything you know now
Everything you do, you do it for your lady
Everything you do, you do it for your lady love
Your lady love, your lady love, your lady love
Fools in love, they think they're heroes
'Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again
Fools in love, gently hold each other's hands forever
Fools in love, gently tear each other limb from limb
Everything you do, everywhere you go now
Everything you touch, everything you feel
Everything you do, even your rock 'n' roll now
Nothing mean a thing except you and your lady love
Your lady love, your lady love, your lady love
Fools in love, they think they're heroes
'Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again
Fools in love, they think they're heroes
'Cause they get to feel more pain
I say fools in love are zeros
I should know
I should know because this fool's in love again1Embed
