Pretty Girls LyricsAhhh - Here she comes - just a-walk - just, just a-walkin' down the street
Singin' down do be do do wop a do do wop
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
Hey!
I took a walk 'round
The market down town
Taking it easy just to see what I could find
I found the girls there
Long legs and blond hair
All getting set to make
A mess out of my mind
Hey! Eyes left!
I got the hard word
You know what I heard
They say the miniskirt
Is comin' back in style
I say it's not fair
But what do they care?
When you've got power
Then you use it for a while
Hey! Eyes right!
See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
Down do be do do wop -- wop!
God, if you're up there
Listen to my prayer
In future man should
Have a different design
Give him a switch so
He can turn off his libido, now
Give him a tranquilizer
Built into his mind
Hey! Eyes right!
See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop (On their feet!)
Down do be do do wop -- wop!
Don't talk to me about Women's Liberation
They already got me right just where it hurts
Ah - here she comes - just a-walk - just a-walkin' down the street
Singin' down do be do do wop a do do wop
Down do be do do wop a do do wop
See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
See the pretty, pretty, pretty girls in the street
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop
See them walkin' with their pretty shoes on their feet
Down do be do do wop a do do wop a do do wop (On their feet!)
Down do be do do wop -- wop!Embed
