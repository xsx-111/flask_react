Happy Loving Couples LyricsI've just been to see my best friend
He's found another girl
Says she's just about the best thing
In the whole damn world
And he says, "Can't you see
What the little lady's done for me?"
Says it like he thinks I'm blind
But the things that you see
Ain't necessarily the things you can find
Happy loving couples make it look so easy
Happy loving couples always talk so kind
'Til the time that I can do my dancing with a partner
Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine
People say I'm too damn fussy
When it comes to girls
Happy couples say
I must live in a lonely world
Wanna be, wanna really be
What my friends pretend to be
Be it in my own good time
Being kind to myself
'Til I become one of two of a kind
But those happy loving couples make it look so easy
Happy loving couples always talk so kind
'Til the time that I can do my dancing with a partner
Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You know what I mean
Happy loving couples
In matching lamb turtle-neck sweaters
Reading Ideal Homes magazine
Yeah!
Wanna be, wanna really be
What my friends pretend to be
Be it in my own good time
Being kind to myself
'Til I become one of two of a kind
But those happy loving couples make it look so easy
Happy loving couples always talk so kind
'Til the time that I can do my dancing with a partner
Those happy couples ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
You ain't no friends of mine
Right, that's enoughEmbed
