Got the Time LyricsWake up, got another day to get through now
Got another man to see
Got to call him on the telephone
Got to find a piece of paper
Sit down, got another letter to write
Think I'll try to get the letter just right
There's a ringing on the telephone
Oh no, got to write a little later
No such day as tomorrow, only one two three go!

Time - got the time tick-tick-ticking in my head
Time - got the time tick-tick-ticking in my head
Time - got the time tick-tick-ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
Ticking in my head
If I tell you what I'm doing today
Will you shut up and get out of my way?
Someone asked me what the time is
I don't know
Only know I gotta go now
No time - trying to get a watch repaired
No time - never got a thing to wear
Hear the ringing of the telephone no no
Hear a ringing in my head now
No such thing as tomorrow, only one two three go!
