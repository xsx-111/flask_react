One More Time Lyrics
Tell me one more time, as I hold your hand, that you don't love me
Tell me one more time as teardrops start to fall
Shout it to me and I'll shout it to the skies above me
That there was nothing after all

Baby, baby
Tell me that you never wanted my loving
Baby, baby
Tell me that you never, tell me, tell me one more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye
One more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye

Tell me one more time we never had a thing in common
Tell me one more time as you turn and face the wall
Tell me I should know you never were my kind of woman
And tell me we were fools to fall

Baby, baby
Tell me that you never wanted my loving
Baby, baby
Tell me that you never, tell me, tell me one more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye
One more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye
Tell me one more time your tears are only sad confusion
And tell me it's just been so long and that is all
Tell me one more time that love was only my illusion
You never answered to my call

Baby, baby
Tell me that you never wanted my loving
Baby, baby
Tell me that you never, tell me, tell me one more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye
One more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye

One more time
One more time
Say you're leaving
Say goodbye
One more timeEmbed
