You Got the Fever LyricsWell, things are getting bad now
Since your woman left you, just can't do without it
The other day you even read a book
That tells you how to go about it
It says to join an evening class
Or hang around in zoos and railway stations
And gives you lots of lines to use
And how to make the best of situations
You know it's just a bunch of crap, you used to do okay
But that was long ago and far away
You got the fever
You got the fever
You gotta love her
And you gotta leave her
It's something you can't fight (hey hey hey)
Let's call it something polite
Like the fever of love
Fever of love
The girls that want you you don't want
The girls you want they never seem to want you
The girls at work are married
And the girls at dances never seem to want to
The girls in bars are always with a friend
Or waitin' for their new fianc√©
And you tell the barmaid you're just lonely
She just smiles and says: "That's what they all say"
So you look up some old number you said you'd never use
And tell yourself you win instead of lose
You got the fever
You got the fever
You gotta love her
And you gotta leave her
It's something you can't fight (hey hey hey)
Let's call it something polite
Like the fever of love
Fever of love
You got the fever
You got the fever
You gotta love her
And you gotta leave her
It's something you can't fight (hey hey hey)
Let's call it something polite
Like the fever of love
Fever of loveEmbed
