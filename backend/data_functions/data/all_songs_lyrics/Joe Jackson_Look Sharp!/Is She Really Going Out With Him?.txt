Is She Really Going Out With Him? LyricsPretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window, I'm staring while my coffee goes cold
Look over there (Where?)
There, there's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something, so I'm told
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there (Where?)
There, here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
And so there goes your proof
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here
But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's marked down as dead
'Cause I've had my fill
Listen, you, take your hands from her head
I get so mean around this scene
Hey, hey, hey
Is she really going out with him?
Is she really gonna take him home tonight?
Is she really going out with him?
'Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
Around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong around here
Something going wrong aroundEmbed
