Something to Believe In LyricsWhen I saw you for the first time
Eyes the color of the ocean
Something moved inside of me
Long forgotten lying broken
Now I can't turn away
Watching you as you lay sleeping
Can you hear winds of change
Is this something to believe in
I lost direction in the darkness
Couldn't stop myself from running
I could feel the sun on my back
But I was afraid to let the light in
Now I can't run any more
Now I see this gift you bring me
Can you hear winds of change
Maybe this loser's luck is turning
I will carry you in my heart
I will hold you in my memory
You could be a million miles away
But when I call
You will hear meEmbed
