Make a Play for Her Now LyricsWords of comfort and love
Spoken in design
Turn cruel, unkind
You have your ready treasures of sin
And it all begins
With an innocent smile
Go on, make a play for her now
While I'm standing here
I bleed so slow
You may never know
Whisper she is safe
That you sympathize
The darkest lies
When you know right now you'll be gone
At the kiss of dawn
Your conscience runs clear
Go on, make a play for her now
While I'm standing here
I bleed so slow
You may never know
And I won't make a sound
Who am I to lay the blame
When it's all a game to you
You and I misfired
Left me cold and tired
Hey love it's alright
Go on, make a play for her now
While I'm standing here
I don't keep score
No not anymore
And I won't make a sound
Hey, who am I to lay the blame
When it's just a game
In the back of your mind
The pattern's starting to unwind
And you know you're alone
Oh, but you smile anyhow
When the moment allows
Make a play for her nowEmbed
