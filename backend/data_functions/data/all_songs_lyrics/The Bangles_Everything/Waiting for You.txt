Waiting for You LyricsI get so restless here alone
That's why I call you on the phone
I get nervous, over-anxious, lose control
Waiting for you, baby
Lately I dream that I'm in your arms
When you're here I feel I'm safe from harm
I'd do anything that you want, babe
Anything at all
And I'm waiting for you to see
You mean the world to me
Stars and the moon wait for you in my lonely room
The warmth of the sun is in your smile
I get so restless here alone
That's why I call you on the phone
I'd do anything that you want, babe
Anything at all
And I'm waiting for you to see
You mean the world to me
Waiting for you
