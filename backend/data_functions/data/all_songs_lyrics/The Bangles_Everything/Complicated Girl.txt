Complicated Girl LyricsValerie is beautiful
But she seems a little bit confused
The life you offer her she says she cannot use
You live in another world
She thinks she won't fit in
And oh, what about her plans for him
She bends to his will
Hey, you better listen
'Cause I'm warning you
Love is never simple
With a complicated girl
You call her on the phone
She's got the other guy on hold
You see the scene unfold
You know it very well
Stay inside your room all day
When she doesn't call you pull the shades
Never seen you act this way
The girl has hit you hard
Hey, you better listen
'Cause I'm warning you
Love is never simple
With a complicated girl
Why bother making rules
You know she will not follow
Someday she'll find a way to remedy
This lovely mess she's made of you
Hey, you better listen
'Cause I'm warning you
Love is never simple
With a complicated girlEmbed
