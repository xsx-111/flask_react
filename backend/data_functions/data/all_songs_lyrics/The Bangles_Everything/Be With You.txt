Be With You LyricsOut my window
The rain starts to fall
And the wind blows
Through an empty hall
In the mirror
Ooh, reflections of you
In the distance I hear a sound
Is that you coming around
(What you gonna do) Oh, what you gonna do
(I think I should) I think I should be with you
(A love that's overdue) A love that's overdue
Oh, I think I should be with you
Thought I saw you
In a stranger's face
Should I call you
Or should I walk away
Around the corner
Is around the world
Is that you looking at me
Or am I living a dream, woe-oh
(What you gonna do) Oh, what you gonna do
(I think I should) I think I should be with you
(A love that's overdue) Oh, a love that's overdue
Oh, I think I should be with you
And when I'm lost in a dream
You are all I can see
All alone in the night I'm waiting for you
In a moment I'd die
Just to look in your eyes
The dream is alive, I'm waiting
Oh, my (Oh, my)
How I try
To make you see that
I should be with you
In the distance I hear a sound
Is that you coming around
(What you gonna do) Oh, what you gonna do
(I think I should) I think I should be with you
(A love that's overdue) A love that's overdue
Oh, I think I should be with you
(Oh-I-I-I-I-I) I think I should be with you
(I-I-I-I-I) Oh, I think I should be with you
(I-I-I-I-I) Yeah, I think I should be with youEmbed
