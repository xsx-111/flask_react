Jewel Lyrics
If I could keep this moment here
And never let it get away
Then I would feel you close to my heart
Shining, shining like a jewel...
Like walking high on a wall
And let's not fall, let's not fall
Sweet dreams I remember it all
I remember it all

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

If I could keep this hour
And hold it gently next to me
Then it would sparkle like a jewel
And always mean so much to me
But now it's gone, it's gone too fast
I wish it would never be in the past
For then all our love wouldn't go to waste
There would be no more screaming it away

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do1Embed
