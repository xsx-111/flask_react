Cloudless LyricsLike jumping in the breeze, falling in the sea
You live up there....
Like things you try to keep, moments as you sleep
You live up there....
And you were angels in her hair
As warm as summer air...you live up there
Like jumping in the breeze, falling in the sea
You live up there....
It feels like fields in June and spring
And lots of happy things... you live up there....
Like the things that never go away
And all the things you love
And all the moments that never end
And all the things you tried to say
You live up there, you live up there....
Higher than the sky, higher than you eye
You live up there
Higher than the clouds, higher than the clouds
You live up there....
Oh you live up there.... higher than the clouds
And when you kiss her there
You know, you know you'll soon be in the air
Like falling in the sea
You'll lay your head down next to me
You live up there
Higher than the clouds....higher than the clouds1Embed
