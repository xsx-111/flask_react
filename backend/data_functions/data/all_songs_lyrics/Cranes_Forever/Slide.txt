Slide LyricsThere's a bright full moon in a sky of jewels
To light the way for all God's fools
There's a beaten path towards the truth
Way past the clouds on the road through youth
... So tired now as she walks down the road
For the burden of love is a heavy load
Through the forest so.. Her soul to wring
For she knows it
Didn't mean anything...
... Years go by... Now is then
The sun will rise and fall again
For who she waits... She does not know
Maybe love... Maybe hope
Yeah she's just waiting for the bells to ring
For her heart to cry and her soul to sing
Why! Listen to the sound of the angel wings!
Let's just see what the angles bring...
Did it mean anything?
Did it mean anything?
Did it mean anything?
Did it mean anything?
One slots out and another slots in
They'll stick when it's thick
Then they'll split...
Did it mean anything?
Did it mean anything?Embed
