Everywhere Lyrics
Don't you know I care
Don't you know that I'll be there
As soft, as wide as air
Climb to the stars
Shine high up there

And fall into your stare
With all the colours I can wear
I'd touch you if I dare
And there'll be angels everywhere

And when our body is bare
And everything is soft and clear
As close as we can bear
And all our love goes everywhere

And I know I could be lost
And always too soon it's over
But there's everything to feel
And there's everything to discoverEmbed
