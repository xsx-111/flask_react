Sun and Sky LyricsThere are feelings you know
That sometimes I can't show
It's too painful you know
Cos it does hurt me so
Other times it all flows
Can't control where it goes
And it pours and it pours
Like it will never stop
And I try but it's not enough
If I could only make it stop
And I try but it's not enough
And then sometimes the sun fills the sky so slowly
And I know this is the happiest that I could ever be
And each moment makes me happier
Means more to me
More than you know
Don't know what the future holds
Just watching it all unfold
Don't know what the future holds
Just watching it all unfold
And then sometimes the sun fills the sky so slowly
And I know this is the happiest that I could ever be
And each moment makes me happier
Means more to me
More than you knowEmbed
