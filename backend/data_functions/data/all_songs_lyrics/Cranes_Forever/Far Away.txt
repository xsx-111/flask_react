Far Away LyricsThere she goes
Far, far far away
There she goes
And everything she once had is gone
Everything she had, everything she loved
Everything that made her glad
Everything she loved is gone
There she goes, there she goes
And nothing seems to matter now
And all her things are scattered everywhere
And then from nowhere come these tears
Never ceasing, never ceasing
There she goes, there she goes
Once lit a star that shone
Watched 'til it all was goneEmbed
