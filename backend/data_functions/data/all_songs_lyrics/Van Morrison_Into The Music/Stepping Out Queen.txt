Stepping Out Queen LyricsVerse 1:
Put on your lipstick
Apply your makeup
Sometimes you're living in a dream
And then you go steppin' out queen
Verse 2:
Well, you go to a party
And you laugh loud and hearty
You stay all night, you know you make the scene
As you go steppin' out queen
Steppin'out
Chorus:
It's just a windfall away
It's a love, keeps getting stronger every day
You gotta look up and say
It's just a windfall away
(Viol√≠n solo)
Chorus:
It's just a windfall away
It keeps getting stronger every day
You gotta look out and say
It's just a windfall away
Verse 3:
Well, you go through the drama
And you work in the dharma
Then you stand up and wipe your mirror clean
And then you go steppin' out queen
Outro:
Come in the garden and just look at the flowers
We can just sit and talk for hours and hours
It's just a windfall away
It's a love, it's a love
Keeps getting stronger every day
I'll come in your garden and then we'll go steppin' outEmbed
