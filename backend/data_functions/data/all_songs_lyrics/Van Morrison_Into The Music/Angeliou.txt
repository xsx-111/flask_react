Angeliou LyricsAngelou oh Angelou
Oh oh Angelou Angelou
Oh Angelou oh Angelou oh my Angelou
In the month of May
In the month of May
In the city of Paris
In the month of May
In the month of May
In the city of Paris
And I heard the bells ringing, and I heard the bells ringing
In the month of May
In the city of Paris and I called out your name
In the month of May
In the city of Paris
In the month of May
In the city of Paris
Oh oh Angelou oh Angelou oh oh Angelou oh my Angelou
Just walkin' on a city street
Who would think you could ever be touched by a total stranger?
Nah, not me
But when you came up to me that day and I listened to your story
It reminded me so much of myself
And I listened to you
It wasn't what you said it was just the way it felt to me
As I listened to your story
About a search and a journey
Somewhere inside yeah hey hey hey hey hey
Just like mine
Will you be my baby
Will you be my baby now
Will you be my baby
Will you be my baby now
Angelou oh Angelou
Angelou oh Angelou
Yes I will yes I will yes I will
After she told all these things to me I said yeah I got a story too
And my story, it got no words
It goes something like this
Oooooooohh
Yeaaaaaaah
Angelou
Angel
Angelou
