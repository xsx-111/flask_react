Troubadours LyricsFrom the ancient sun to the old heart stove, say the troubadours
From the city gates to the castle walls
I wish it was the troubadours
On a sunlit day it was bright and clear
And the people came from far and they came from near
To hear the troubadours
Well the troubadours sang their songs of love to the lady fair
She was sitting outside on a balcony
In the clear night air
It was a starry night and the moon was shining bright
And the trumpets rang and they gave a chime
For the troubadours
And for every man all across the land and from shore to shore
They came singin' songs of love
And chivalry from the days of yore
Baby lift your window high, do you hear that sound
It's the troubadours as they go through town
With their freedom song
Baby lift your window high, do you hear that sound?
It's the troubadours with their freedom song
Baby, baby, baby lift your window high, turn your lamp down low
Oh baby, don't you know I love you so?
Do you hear that sound? Do you dig that sound?
It's the troubadours coming through town
