Rollercoaster Lyrics
Sweet like my tomato, red cherry tomato
Down at the market, pick out the ripe one
Tempting me sorely, I want to bite one
Wait, save it for later

We had a good time at the beginning
It tasted just like all the things I was missing
I'll go at full boil
'Til you st-st-stop me later

Stay, I will make you dinner, taste, each dish will be better
After the first bite, say it's delicious
But appetite isn't what we'd predicted
Would you want to heat it up later?

We had a good time at the beginning
It tasted just like all the things I was missing
I'll go at full boil
'Til you st-st-stop me later

Rollercoaster, want to go back to the way things were
I'm on a rollercoaster
Want to get back on the Tilt-A-Whirl
(Ride the rollercoaster)
I'll be your monkey, a puppy
I'll be your circus freak
(Ride the rollercoaster yeah)
I fell the first day
It took you a whole week
(Ride the rollercoaster)
Rollercoaster can we go back
(Ride the rollercoaster yeah)
To the way thing were
Vertigo is the only clue
You're sick on me, I'm sick on you
Rollercoaster, want to get back on the Tilt-A-Whirl
(Ride the rollercoaster)
I'm dizzy and faithless
Where is the ground?
(Ride the rollercoaster yeah)
You said this thing would
Not go upside down
(Ride the rollercoaster)
Rollercoaster wanna get back
(Ride the rollercoaster yeah)
To the way things were alright
Sweet, you're my tomato, red cherry tomato
I know that some of our days are bitter
Stay with me honey and things could be better
Wait, wait until later

We had a good time at the beginning
It tasted just like all the things I was missing
I'll go at full boil
'Til you st-st-stop me laterEmbed
