The Fox LyricsOn the day the duck was born
The fox was watching all along
He said, "Land Ho!" when he saw the duck
"Land Ho!" and the duck saw him too
"Shiny Pretty Fox," thought the duck
The duck came up onto the land
The fox was watching and he just laughed
"I could show you some shiny tricks," he said
"Come along we'll get our kicks," he said
"Land Ho!" for shiny tricks
"Land Ho!" for me
"Oh Fox! Is this love? Can you tell me? What is love?"
That good looking fox only knew one trick
He could break hearts just lickety-split
The duck knew this game she had to quit
And her own pond she was headed too quick
"I'll go I'll go and there's no looking back"
Goodbye, little fox
Goodbye, my foxEmbed
