Night Light Lyrics
Oh, little light that shines for me in the dark of night
Oh, little sigh, sometimes I follow you all the way home
I would almost have to ask you, I hate to be led
So give me a spark, I can look for instead

How do you do it? This bitter and bloody world
Keep it together and shine for your family
How do you do it with visions of worst to come?
Live in the present and spin off the rays of the sun

Oh, little beam, splitting the fog and the dirt in between
Oh, simplify, like a problem you try to work out in your mind
I would almost have to ask you, it's clumsy when said
So give me a spark I can look for instead

How do you do it? This bitter and bloody world
Keep it together and shine for your family
How do you do it with visions of worst to come?
Live in the present and spin off the rays of the sunEmbed
