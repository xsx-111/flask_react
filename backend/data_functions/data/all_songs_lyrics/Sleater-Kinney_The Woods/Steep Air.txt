Steep Air Lyrics
I'm tired of waiting on a ship that won't leave shore
I'm tired of waiting on a ship that won't leave shore
The water's bloody with the ones who came before
The water's bloody with the ones who came before

Hey, she made you say it, yeah they'll make you say it
Yeah, you know you said it alot
Hey, you never stay for, now you gotta pray for
Something better than what you've got

I'm tired of waiting on a plane that don't have wings
I'm tired of waiting on a plane that don't have wings
The runway's rotten with the dirt and weeds
The runway's rotten with the dirt and weeds

Hey, he made you say it, yeah they'll make you say it
Yeah, you know you sad it out loud
You never stay for, now you gotta pray for
Something better than what you've got

I booked my ticket
Packed my bags
Flight is leaving
Our time has passed
I'm tired of knocking on a door that just won't budge
Locked out of the engine; it's a wheel that you have spun
But who's to say I don't have wings
But who's to say I don't have wingsEmbed
