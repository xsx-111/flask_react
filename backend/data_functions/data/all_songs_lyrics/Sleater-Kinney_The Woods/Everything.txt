Everything LyricsIf you're tired of lying
There's something you should try
You said Hallelujah baby
Hallelujah child
Who is more deserving than me?
Why live with less when I can get all the things that I want to?
And I want to
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
If you're tired of watching
The good life pass you by
You say you owe it, you stole it
And everybody knows it
They'll make you pay until they're dry
Who are better suited than we?
Dressed for success but get all the things that we want to
At any price that we want to
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
To know it
To find it
My head's just desperate
Reach for it
Come to it
Blow it up on a shelf
So tired of the whining
Your sad little lullaby
You've got the money, no honey
A feeling in your tummy
Why don't you just lay down and die?
Who is better suited than me?
I feel like a wreck, but I've done all the things that I want to
At any price that I want to
At any price
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
Everything in the world
Everything in the worldEmbed
