Dark Forces Lyrics
You´ll need a bit of holy water
And a little bit of knowledge
Invocation
To your holy guardian angel
The great evil around

God gave man dominion
Over fowls of the air and the fish of the sea
Justification
Of desecration
Who wrote this madness?

Get up, wake up
Someone´s taking you for a ride
Get up, wake up
Dark forces

They´re printing up money
That doesn't exist
Then watch the wealthy
As they cash their chips
Economy´s failed, start a war machine
Devoid of moral cause
As we witness the end
Of international laws

Get up, wake up
Someone´s taking you for a ride
Get up, wake up
Dark forces

I´m an inside man
Of the serpent clan
33 degrees
I´ll do as I please

Power for power's sake
A personal treasure trove
And two weeks off
In bohemian grove
You wanna come?

All the banking houses
That buy and sell
(They´d sell their own mother)
Just eat shit and die
Like everyone else
Get up, wake up
Someone´s taking you for a ride
Get up, wake up
Dark forces

Get up, wake up
Someone´s taking you for a ride
Get up, wake up
Dark forcesEmbed
