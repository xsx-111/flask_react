The House That Pain Built Lyrics
My faith (faith) and my love
But howl, howl, howl, the pain
My faith (faith) and my blood
Oh why, why, wild insane
My faith (faith) and my people
We'll howl, howl, howl, the pain
My faith (faith) and my freedom
I'll never let it go again

Not anymore, I must let go
And when I finally reach the point of no return
I must let go because I know
I'm manic, I'm manic, I'm manic, so

And when you need catharsis (yes)
Because it's how you're made, you know (yes)
And when you need absolving (yes)
Don't ask how, but come into my house
Of pain

My faith (faith) and my love
But howl, howl, howl, the pain
My faith (faith), yes my own will
Oh, see me through this pain
My faith (faith) in my blood
And flow right through my vein
My faith (faith), no reason
I'll never be the same
Not anymore, I must let go
And when I finally reach the point of no return
I must let go because I know
I'm manic, I'm manic, I'm manic, so

And when you need catharsis (yes)
Because it's how you're made, you know (yes)
And when you need absolving (yes)
Don't ask how, but come into my house
Of pain

My faith (faith) and my love
But howl, howl, howl, the pain
My faith (faith) and my freedom
I'll never let it go again

Not anymore, I must let go
And when I finally reach the point of no return
I must let go because I know
I'm manic, I'm manic, I'm manic, so

And when you need catharsis (yes)
Because it's how you're made, you know (yes)
And when you need absolving (yes)
Don't ask how, but come into my house
Of pain
And when you need catharsis (yes)
Because it's how you're made, you know (yes)
And when you need absolving (yes)
Don't ask how, but come into my house
Of painEmbed
