Total Invasion Lyrics
Just enough water to ensurface the world
Oil baron running the government
So I'll start a war

All votes invalid, use any old lie
Gonna carve up your wealth like pumpkin pie
Only fools won't realise, you won't be told
That empires run on the old black gold

It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United Nations
It's a total invasion

Terrify them, complete submission
This is our goal, this is our mission
Destroy your customs, you'll have no say
We'll clothe your women in the western way

It's a crusade
A lesson in trade
So all you intellectuals
We're gonna invade
It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United Nations
It's a total invasion

Mexico City
24 million people
Half a litre of water a day

The final push, the last battle
Even restored? Man is cattle
We want your oil, we want your land
We'll take your wealth, you'll have much less
We'll change your God to the bitch Goddess

It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United Nations
It's a total invasion
It's a global abrasion
It's conflagration
United Nations
It's a total invasionEmbed
