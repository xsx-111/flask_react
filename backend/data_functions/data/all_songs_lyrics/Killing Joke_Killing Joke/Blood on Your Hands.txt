Blood on Your Hands Lyrics
When the summer fails us
And the rain, it rains so hard, oh
When the rivers overflow
And a waves runs over Prague, oh
Poison the waters so
That only GM crops grow

Five corporations
Earn more than forty-six nations
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
Corruption at the highest levels
Man-made hell and a man-made devil
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands

Behind a coat of arms
The jewels of gilded lies glow
Know the crown prepare the sacrifice
And she prepares to die, oh
Radiant and beautiful
She's taken in her prime, oh
Oh executioner
Atone for all your crimes now
Send horrors through your soul
And when it happens then you'll know
Send horrors through your soul
And when it happens then you'll know

Five corporations
Earn more than forty-six nations
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
Corruption at the highest levels
Man-made hell and a man-made devil
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands

Rulers seek fossil fuel
As the poor still eat their stools, oh
And watch the thunder flash
Unleashed for oil and gas, oh
Send horrors through your soul
And when it happens then you'll know
Send horrors through your soul
And when it happens then you'll know
Five corporations
Earn more than forty-six nations
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
Corruption at the highest levels
Man-made hell and a man-made devil
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
Jacques de Molay turns in his grave
As Cecil Rhodes rides out again
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your hands
You've got blood on your handsEmbed
