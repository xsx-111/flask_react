The Truth Lyrics
In the blue of the evening when the sun is low
There's a shadow that creeps across my cellblock floor
And it comes to remind me what I'm in here for
No, I'm not admitting that I done the crime
I'm only getting down to doing time
The passing of days is no concern of mine

There's a guard on the second shift, comes on at three
And he's always about a half inch off of me
Like he needs to keep reminding me that I'm not free
God forgive him 'cause he doesn't see
He's no less a prisoner 'cause he holds a key
And God forbid he turn his back on me

For every wall you build around your fear
A thousand darker things are born in here
They're fed on contempt for all that you hold dear
The truth is it doesn't matter what you do
Till you gaze in that mirror with an eye that's true
And admit that what scares you is the me in youEmbed
