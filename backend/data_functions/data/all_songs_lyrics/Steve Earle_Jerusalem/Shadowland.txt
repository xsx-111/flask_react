Shadowland Lyrics
Way out yonder where the wild wind blows
There's a place there lonely fools can go
Where if you hold your money, it will burn your hand
So you buy a ticket to the Shadowland

Down the highway, down the road I'm bound
And my heart keeps pounding and the wheels go around
It's a hard place for a mortal man
And a heart-broke pilgrim in the Shadowland

Yeah, when I was younger, I could hold my own
My right hand was thunder and my left was stone
Now I ain't as handsome as I was back then
So I'm taking my chances in the Shadowland

Down the highway, down the road I'm bound
And my heart keeps pounding and the wheels go around
It's a hard place for a mortal man
And a heart-broke pilgrim in the Shadowland

Been down a thousand highways and they're all the same
Another empty place where I can hide my shame
And there's a heartache waiting up around the bend
For a lonesome stranger in the Shadowland
Down the highway, down the road I'm bound
My heart keeps pounding and the wheels go around
And it's a hard place for a mortal man
And a heart-broke pilgrim in the ShadowlandEmbed
