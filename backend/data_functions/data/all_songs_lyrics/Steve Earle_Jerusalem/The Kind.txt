The Kind Lyrics
Tell me a story about a fellow with a crazy dream
Everybody tells him that it won't amount to anything
He fires the shot heard around the world
Wins the prize and he gets the girl
That's the kind of story I like
The kind that makes you think

Sing me a song about a cowboy with an aching heart
Riding along the lonesome prairie about to fall apart
And every time those doggies moan
He doesn't feel so all alone
That's the kind of song I like
The kind that breaks your heart

Paint me a picture of a girl with a secret smile
Looking back at you across the years through ancient eyes
You're standing there like an open door
Because she's seen it all before
That's the kind of picture I like
The kind that makes you sighEmbed
