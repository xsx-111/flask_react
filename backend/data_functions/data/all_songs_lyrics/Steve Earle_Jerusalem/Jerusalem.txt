Jerusalem Lyrics
I woke up this morning
And none of the news was good
And death machines were rumbling
'Cross the ground where Jesus stood
And the man on my TV told me
It had always been that way
And there was nothing anyone could do or say
I almost listened to him
Yeah, I almost lost my mind
Then I regained my senses again
And looked into my heart to find
That I believe that one fine day
All the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in Jerusalem

Well, maybe I'm only dreaming
And maybe I'm just a fool
But I don't remember learning
How to hate in Sunday school
But somewhere along the way, I strayed
And I never looked back again
But I still find some comfort now and then
Then the storm comes rumbling in
And I can't lay me down
And the drums are drumming again
And I can't stand the sound
But I believe there'll come a day
When the lion and the lamb
Will lie down in peace together in Jerusalem

And there'll be no barricades then
There'll be no wire walls
And we can wash all this blood from our hands
And all this hatred from our souls
And I believe that on that day
All the children of Abraham
Will lay down their swords forever in JerusalemEmbed
