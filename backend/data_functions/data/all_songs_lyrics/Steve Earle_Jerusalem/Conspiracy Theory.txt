Conspiracy Theory Lyrics
What if I told you it was done with mirrors?
What if I showed you it was all a lie?
Better be careful, someone might hear you
The walls have ears and the sky has eyes

What if I said you were only dreaming?
What you want to bet that all you gotta do
Is open up your eyes and you will wake up screaming
When you realize that it's all come true

Hush now, don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes now
Take it or leave it
Go back to bed now, don't you cry

Half a million soldiers fly across the water
One in ten are never coming back again
Fifty thousand sons who never grew to fathers
Don't you ever wonder who they might have been?

What if you could've been there on that day in Dallas?
What if you could wrestle back the hands of time?
Maybe something could've been done in Memphis
We wouldn't be living in a dream that's died
Hush now, don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes now
Take it or leave it
Go back to bed now, don't you cry

Go on and tell yourself again there are no secrets
Go on and tell yourself that you don't want to know
It's best that you believe that you don't hear the footsteps
That follow you around no matter where you go

Maybe you were thinking that it didn't matter
Maybe you believed nobody else would care
But once you've added every little lie together
You finally find the truth was always waiting there

Hush now, don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes now
Take it or leave it
Go back to bed now, don't you cry
Hush now, don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes now
Take it or leave it
Go back to bed now, don't you cry
Hush now, don't you believe it
Cover your head and close your eyes now
Take it or leave it
Go back to bed now, don't you cryEmbed
