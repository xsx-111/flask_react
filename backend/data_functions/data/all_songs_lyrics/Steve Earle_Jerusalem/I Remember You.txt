I Remember You Lyrics
When I'm walking these streets
And I'm counting my steps
And I'm dragging my feet
Because I ain't ready yet
To start all over again
Because every time that I do
I remember you

Well, you broke my heart
And it healed alright
Now we're far apart
And I don't lie awake at night
But every once in a while
Right out of the blue
I remember you

You never write and I never call
And I don't miss you tonight
I'm just curious, that's all
Do you still have dreams?
Did they all come true?
Does it ever seem like
You'll never make it through?
Do you ever miss me?
The way that I do
When I remember you
I'm walking these streets (Well, you broke my heart)
I'm counting my steps (But it healed alright)
And I'm dragging my feet (Now we're far apart)
I don't lie awake at night
Every once in a while
Right out of the blue
I remember you
I remember youEmbed
