Go Amanda Lyrics
Take your red dress, leave the hanger
Lose the sadness, use the anger
You might need it 'fore you get there

Oh, Amanda
You don't have to say goodbye
Just go Amanda
Ain't no way you didn't try
Whoa all right

Tell your sister, tell your brother
Take a picture to your mother
You've been living undercover

Oh, Amanda
You don't have to say goodbye
Just go Amanda
Ain't no way you didn't try
Whoa all right
Oh, Amanda
You don't have to say goodbye
Just go Amanda
Ain't no way you didn't try
Whoa all right
Oh, Amanda
You don't have to say goodbye
Just go Amanda
Ain't no way you didn't try
Whoa all right

Oh, Amanda
Oh, AmandaEmbed
