Amerika v. 6.0 (The Best We Can Do) Lyrics
Look at you
You take a look in the mirror
Now tell me what you see
Another satisfied customer
In the front of the line for the American dream
I remember when we was both out on the boulevard
Talking revolution and singing the blues
Nowadays it's letters to the editor
And cheating on our taxes is the best that we can do
Come on

Look around
There's doctors down on Wall Street
Sharpening their scalpels and trying to cut a deal
Meanwhile, back at the hospital
Got accountants playing God and counting out the pills
Yeah, I know, that sucks
That your HMO ain't doing what you thought it would do
But everybody's gotta die sometime and we can't save everybody
It's the best that we can do

Four score and a hundred and fifty years ago
Our forefathers made us equal, as long as we can pay
Yeah, maybe that wasn't exactly what they was thinking
Version 6.0 of the American Way
But hey, we can just build a great wall around the country club
To keep the riff-raff out until the slump is through
Yeah, I realize that ain't exactly democratic
But it's either them or us and it's the best we can do
Passionately conservative
It's the best we can do
Conservatively passionate
It's the best we can do
Meanwhile, still thinking
Hey, let's wage a war on drugs
It's the best we can do
Well, I don't know about you
But I kinda dig this global warming thing
It's the best we can doEmbed
