I Smell A Rat LyricsI think I smell a rat in my house, baby I believe it's got just two legs
Aw, I smell a rat, I smell a rat in my house, honey, I think it's walkin' 'round on two legs
I need a rat in my house like this now, just like I need a hole in my head
You claim you afraid at night, you say you can't stay home all alone
Oh you said you afraid, afraid to stay home at night, you say you didn't want to be home alone
Oh, but I can smell a rat in the time I get back, and all, and all you do is gonna make me moan
You got my backdoor wide open, baby you say you're supposed to be afraid
You got my backdoor wide open, and you tell me you're supposed to be afraid
You know the last time I slept with it opened, you know in Chicago I almost lost my head
Sometime I think you're foolin' me baby, and I do believe it's just drivin' me around
Sometime I think you're foolin' me baby, honey I think you're just drivin' me around
Why don't you leave me alone woman, you know I think there's another women I can go
I can be found
I think that you have it to explain. honey I'm not that hard to understand
Did you ever try to sit down and explain, I am not that hard to understand
You will be sleeping with the backdoor open, baby or with another man
You're so good, I don't believe I wanna leave you alone
Oh you're so sweet to me, I don't believe, I can leave you alone
Stayin', and peepin' like you got a woman, and try to make me, all happyEmbed
