Outskirts Of Town LyricsYeah yeah
I'm gonna move baby
Listen
Way out on the outskirts of town
I said I'm gonna move baby
Way out on the outskirts of town
Yes
You see we won't need nobody baby
You know always hangin' round
Oh baby
Yeah
Yeah
It may seem funny honey
Just as funny as funny can be
But now if you have six children woman
You know i got to have them all all just looking like me
Gonna move baby
Listen
Way out on the outskirts of town
You see we won't need nobody baby
Always hangin' round
Yeah
I got a little girl
You know what
She put me on that wonder
And I wonder what's wrong with me
He, hehe
I got a little girl
My little girl
You know she put me on a wonder
And she misuses me
You know she's alright with me I know
Because this little girl she suits me to a tee
I never want for nothing, no
You know she brings me everthing I need
Yes
You know I never want, I never want, no I never want for nothing, nothing
I tell ya
She brings me everthing I need
She's my satisfaction in the morning
You know I love my baby
Oh yes indeed
I'm gonna move baby
Way out on the outskirts of town
Yes baby
I'm gonna move
Way, way out on the outskirts of town
Yes I Am
Oh you see we won't need nobody baby
Yeah
Baby , Oh a oh yeahEmbed
