When I Left Home LyricsBlind man standin' on, on the corner
He said I don't, ah, I don't need a dollar
And don't you give me a dime
Until you bring back that little girl
Ow my

The people try to tell me to stop cryin'
And find me someone new
'Cause when the good Lord made one woman
Halleluja, don't you know he made two
And I can't let her go no no
Lord Lord know I can't let her go

A thing about the blues
