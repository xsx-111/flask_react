Winding Wind LyricsI lived a thousand years
In someone else's shoes
I lived a thousand lives
With someone else's blues
I talked so many nights
With voices I don't know
Wore someone else's face
And hoped it didn't show
Oh winding wind
Oh winding wind
I made a place for you
And you made time for me
And we have promised all the things
We know will never be
I waited far too long
Out on the winding wind
Dreaming and hoping as the world moved on
It would blow away my sins
Oh winding wind
Oh winding wind
Everybody's got a soul to sell
Everybody's got a tale to tell
All about the things that might have been
Blown away in the winding wind
And some may change the world
And some just lose their way
And some just sit around holding hands
Praying for a judgment day
I hear them talking deep in the night
Wondering if they will make it tonight
So I will walk with giant men
At peace among their feet
And we will cross the wild frontier
Not ever to retreat
Oh winding wind
Oh winding wind
Everybody's got a soul to sell
Everybody's got a tale to tell
All about the things that might have been
Blown away in the winding wind
Everybody's got a soul to sell
Everybody's got a tale to tell
All about the things that might have been
Blown away in the winding windEmbed
