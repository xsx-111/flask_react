Seven Waves LyricsI don't think too much, I don't look inside
For the things I hid away for all those years
Have faded now or died
So don't you look through me, with those strangers eyes
For the world keeps turning underneath my feet
If I go on with the lies
Hey baby just you go out tonight, it's only me that cries
And love is waves away, we are waves away
And love is waves away, seven waves away
That's me down here, shining up your shoes
Keeping my head down like I always do
When you walk in with the blues
There's nothing to be said, nothing to be done
For I laid my head down at your most famous feet
When you said I was the one
Hey baby don't you stay out tonight, and say it isn't fun
And love is waves away, we are waves away
And love is waves away, seven waves away
And love is waves away, we are waves away
And love is waves away, seven waves away
And the sound that comes from you sleeping
In the darkness is a doorway
And the sun that beats on the window
In the morning is a doorway
And the sun that calls through the window
Every morning is a doorway
It doesn't hurt anymore, It doesn't get me down
But I might just swim out on the waves tonight
And lay right down and drown
Do you really want to be here tonight, or are you just around
And love is waves away, we are waves away
And love is waves away, seven waves away
And love is waves away, we are waves away
And love is waves away, seven waves away
And love is waves away, we are waves away
And love is waves away, seven waves awayEmbed
