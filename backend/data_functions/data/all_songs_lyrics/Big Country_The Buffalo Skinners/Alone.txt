Alone LyricsThe mid-day sky was grey and purple
At least it wasn't blue
I want the sky to be the way I am
And what I do
For I have been a lost and lonely
Sailor on your sea
Run aground by trusting signals
You were sending me
The streets are filled with empty faces
Nothing here is new
It's just the same in other places
I have journeyed to
I was the first across the water
The last across the land
I walked out of the silver mine
My pockets full of sand
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world
It's not my life in those old pictures
The ones you threw away
For I was always someone else
And always far away
Walking in the darkest places
Where the mission meets
Waiting for the ground to open up
Beneath my feet
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little world
Alone inside my head
Alone inside my room
I feel alone inside my head
Alone inside my tiny little worldEmbed
