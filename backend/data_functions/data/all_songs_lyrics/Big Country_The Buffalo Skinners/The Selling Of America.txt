The Selling Of America LyricsGonna take a message to mother
Tell her that I'll be home soon
Let her know I'm still undercover
Hiding out behind the moon
The selling of America
Its going on now town by town
The selling of America
You better keep it underground
...Ha...
Better get a message to mother
Tell her that our workers are doomed
You better call on General MacArthur
And tell him that the invasion is due
The selling of America
Its going on now town by town
The selling of America
You better keep it underground
Here come the dollar bombers
...Hey hey ya ya...
I guess you better get the word to the boss man
A wire from the industries ba???
Tell him that their over the border
Trying out the white house for size
The selling of America
Its going on now town by town
The selling of America
You better keep it underground
The selling of America
Its going on now town by town
The selling of America
You better keep it undergroundEmbed
