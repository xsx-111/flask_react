The One I Love LyricsThere were you and me
Seems like twenty five years ago
This old city was different then
How were we to know
I've got to live my life
In a simple way
Got to live it all
In a single day, a single day
The one I love is still in you
And the one I want is in there too
The one I love is still in you
I don't have the time that I used to
I can be your miracle man
Maybe it's my day
I was always a lucky man
Teach me how to pray
I believe in you
You know it too
You can leave me out
But what I do is what I do
The one I love is still in you
And the one I want is in there too
The one I love is still in you
I don't have the time that I used to
The one I love is still in you
And the one I want is in there too
The one I love is still in you
I don't have the time that I used to
The one I love
The one I want
The one I love
The one I want
The one I love is still in you
And the one I want is in there too
The one I love is still in you
I don't have the time that I used to
The one I love is still in you
And the one I want is in there too
The one I love is still in you
I don't have the time that I used toEmbed
