Ships LyricsLook at him now
Another used man
Wearing the passing of his dignity
With all the courage that he can
He stood in the storm
Carved out in stone
He said I've worn my honesty with pride
In everything I've done
So where were you when my ship went down
Where were you when I ran aground
Where were you when I turned it around
Where were you when they burned me down
You see her now
All tired and worn
She never thought her life would come
To be so cold or so alone
She walked in the light
Fought bondage for love
She said I cast off the chains that I was born with
But it never was enough
And where were you when my ship went down
Where were you when I ran aground
Where were you when I turned it around
Where were you when they burned me down
Silent souls washed up on the shores
Left to walk the sands evermore, evermore
And where were you
When the ship went down
Look at you now
Just chasing your life
Make like the savior of the planet
You're just trying to get by
Now you may walk the line
You may see it all through
But I know you cry yourself to sleep at night
Just wondering what to do
And where were you when my ship went down
Where were you when I ran aground
Where were you when I turned it around
Where were you when they burned me down
Where were you when my ship went down
Where were you when I ran aground
Where were you when I turned it around
Where were you when they burned me downEmbed
