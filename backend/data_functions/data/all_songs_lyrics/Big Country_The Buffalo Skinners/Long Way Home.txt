Long Way Home LyricsCome on lay your hands on me
Feel the will of God's TV
I will save you every one
And you can pay me when I'm done
100,000 Jesus Children
All dressed up and no-one with them
Lead them not into temptation
With your tales of hell's damnation
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Out upon the China sea
Boats will run eternally
Storms on land and storms assail
Captains roar and the women wail
A half a million Nixon babies
Some with toys and some with rabies
Hunted by the man in black
No room here man send them back
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Underneath your own safe sky
You may never wonder why
Some will never make their peace
Some have never been released
Fires in the L.A. sky
The truth ran out and justice died
You better arm the National Guard
Cause final notice has been served
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
Searching for the long way home
The long way homeEmbed
