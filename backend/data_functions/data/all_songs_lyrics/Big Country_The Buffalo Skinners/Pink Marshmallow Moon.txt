Pink Marshmallow Moon LyricsWe could both be something still
We could spend our lives fulfilled
We could leave the battlefields
No more arrows, no more shields
When the dust of war subsides
Will I find you by my side
We could be at peace out there
Before the summer fair
We'll live tomorrow girl
Today has come too soon
We'll live tomorrow girl
Beneath a pink marshmallow moon
On the road to monterey
I will be with you one day
Ride the length of highway one
Silhouettes against the sun
You can be my surfer queen
I will be your football team
We could build a love machine
At least you let me dream
We could find a secret room
Somewhere in the house of gloom
Meet the lost and lonely man
With his lost and lonely plan
He will say what I said then
You have loved and will again
Even though the gift of rain
Is destined to remainEmbed
