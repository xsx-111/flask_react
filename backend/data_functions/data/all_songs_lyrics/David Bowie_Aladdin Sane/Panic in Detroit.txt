Panic in Detroit Lyrics
He looked a lot like Che Guevara
Drove a diesel van
Kept his gun in quiet seclusion
Such a humble man
The only survivor of the National People's Gang

Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit

He laughed at accidental sirens
That broke the evening gloom
The police had warned of repercussions
They followed none too soon
A trickle of strangers were all that were left alive

Panic in Detroit
I asked for an autograph
He wanted to stay home
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Putting on some clothes, I made my way to school
And I found my teacher crouching in his overalls
I screamed and ran to smash my favorite slot machine
And jumped the silent cars that slept at traffic lights
{Verse 3}
Having scored a trillion dollars
Made a run back home
Found him slumped across the table
A gun and me alone
I ran to the window, looked for a plane or two

Panic in Detroit
He'd left me an autograph
"Let me collect dust."
I wish someone would phone
Panic in Detroit
Panic in Detroit
