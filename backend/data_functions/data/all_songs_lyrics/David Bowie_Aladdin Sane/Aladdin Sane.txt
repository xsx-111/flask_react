Aladdin Sane Lyrics
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet (dead roses)
Sake and strange divine
Uh-huh-huh-uh, huh-uh (You'll make it)
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war (Don't fake it)
Saddening glissando strings
Uh-huh-huh-uh, huh-uh (You'll make it)

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne
Just in time for sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane (You'll make it)

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Love Aladdin Sane

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

They say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway4Embed
