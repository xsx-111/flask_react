Little Bit Of Soul Lyrics
You've been robbed
You've been used
You've been crucified and
You've been abused
You've been sacrifice and
Now you're confused
Ain't it the truth

You got a hole in your head
And a cold empty spot
In your big brass bed
When you're mad at the world and
You feel like you're losing control
All you need to get by is
A little bit of soul

When you've lost in the flood
And you feel like you been
Kicked through the mud
You know they still
Haven't found the drug
To pick us up
Feeling down, misunderstood
You know these times
They ain't looking so good
When you're mad at the world and
You feel like you're losing control
All we need to survive is
A little of soul

Whoa oh
Little bit of soul
What we all need
To survive
Is just a little bit of soul

Everyone's complaining
Nothing but frustration
The king has pissed in
Your pot of gold
It ain't entertaining spending
So much time in the hole
Send down a little bit of soul
When you're mad at the world
And you feel like
You're losing control
What we all need
To get by is just
A little bit of soul
Whoa oh little bit of soul
Whoa oh little bit of soul
Whoa oh little bit of soulEmbed
