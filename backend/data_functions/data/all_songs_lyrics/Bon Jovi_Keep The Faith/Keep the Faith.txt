Keep the Faith Lyrics
Mother, mother, tell your children
That their time has just begun
I have suffered for my anger
There are wars that can't be won
Father, father, please believe me
I am layin' down my guns
I am broken like an arrow
Forgive me, forgive your wayward son

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, mother
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please believe me
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough)
And it's hard to hold on when there's no one to lean on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Now we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Tell me, baby, when I hurt you
Do you keep it all inside?
Do you tell me all's forgiven
And just hide behind your pride? Yeah

(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Mother, father
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
Please don't leave me
(Everybody's bleedin' 'cause the times are tough)
Well, it's hard to be strong when there's no one to dream on

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you know it's never too late
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith

Keep the faith, keep the faith
Oh, we've gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith, keep the faith
Lord, we've gotta keep the faith
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I've been walking in the footsteps, of society's lies
I don't like what I see no more, sometimes I wish that I was blind
Sometimes I wait forever, to stand out in the rain
So no one sees me crying, trying to wash away this pain

Mother, father (Everybody needs somebody to love)
There's things I've done I can't erase
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
And every night we fall from grace
(Everybody's bitchin' 'cause they can't get enough)
It's hard with the world in your face
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on
(Everybody needs, everybody, keep the faith)

Faith, you know you're gonna live through the rain
Lord you gotta keep the faith
Faith, don't you let your love turn to hate
Right now we've gotta keep the faith
(Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith)
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on, yeah
(Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith)
Everybody keep the faith
(Faith, keep the faith, keep the faith)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
(Everybody needs somebody to hate)
(Everybody needs somebody to love)
(Everybody needs, everybody, keep the faith)
(Faith)
