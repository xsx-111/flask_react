I Want You Lyrics
The last time that I saw her
Was the night she said goodbye
She said that love's a stranger
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did
As she packed up her belongings
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye
But I could see a tear roll
Off her face
As we both tried so hard
Not to cry she said

I never wanted the stars
I never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Cause I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I tried so hard to remember
Where when how why love went away
I tried to drown myself in pity
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings
All the things that my money brings
And the servants to paint the skies blue
And I worked so hard seven days a week
Built a fortress for your heart to keep
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you
I never wanted the stars
I never shot for the moon
I like them right where they are
All I wanted was you
So baby just turn away
Because I can't face the truth
All I'm trying to say
Is all I wanted was you

I may have built for you a dream house
But never thought you were alone
I filled the party up with company
But never made our house a home
All I got is my guitar these chords and the truth
All I got is my guitar, but all I want is youEmbed
