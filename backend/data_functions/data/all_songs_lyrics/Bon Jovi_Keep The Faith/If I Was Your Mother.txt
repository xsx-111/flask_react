If I Was Your Mother Lyrics
If I was your mother
Would you let me hold your hand
Would you say you were my baby
Would you always be my friend
If I was your mother
Could I teach you what's right
Could I tell you stories, maybe tuck you in
And kiss you sweet goodnight

Oh, tell me what I've got to do
To make my life mean more to you
I could get so close it's true
If I was your mother

Would you always believe me
Because I'd wake up in the middle of the night
Just to see if you need me
Tell me there's no other
With whom you're sharing your secrets
And would you tell me 'bout the boys
You been bringing home to meet me

Oh, tell me what I've got to do
To make my life mean more to you
I could get so close it's true
If I was your
Tell me who I've got to be
To make you a part of me
No one else you'd ever need
If I was your
Mother, mother
If I was your
Mother, mother

When love is blood, you're never on trial
It don't get deeper than a mother and child
Oh baby, I got to get that close to you

Tell me what I've got to do
To make my life mean more to you
I could get so close it's true
If I was yours
Tell me who I gotta be
To make you a part of me
There's no one else you'd ever need
If I was your
Mother, mother
If I was your
Mother, mother, yeah
Mother, mother
If I was your
Mother, mother
(If I was your mother, mother)
(If I was your mother, mother)
(If I was your mother, mother)
(If I was your mother)
(If I was your mother, mother)
(If I was your mother)Embed
