Blame It on the Love of Rock & Roll Lyrics
First time I heard the music
I thought it was my own
I could feel it in my heartbeat
I could feel it in my bones
My momma thinks I'm crazy
My dad says I'm insane
I got this boogie woogie fever
That's burning in my veins
They took me to a doctor
But it's too late for me
Then dragged me to a preacher
That they saw on their TV
Who said that for a small donation
My lost soul would be saved
I said I don't think so preacher
I'll come back another day

All that I want, is to be a Rolling Stone
They don't understand what we all know

It feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock and roll
My teachers didn't like me
They tried to put me down
Because I wore my hair too long
I played my music way too loud
Every little boy wants to learn to play guitar
So he can pick up all the chicks
And be a rock and roll star

They said it won't last, but they misunderstood
If people think it's bad then I'll be bad for good

Lord, you know it feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

Blame it on the love, blame it on the love
Dad don't understand what the little girls know
Blame it on the love of rock and roll

All that I wanted, all I ever needed
My guitar gave to me
Every song I've sung (Blame it on the love)
Every war I've won (Blame it on the love)
Everything I've done (Blame it on the love)
Blame it on the love of rock and roll
It feels so good that it ought to be illegal
I got my vaccination from a phonograph needle
I'll never grow up and I'll never grow old
Blame it on the love of rock & roll

Blame it on the love, blame it on the love
Dad don't understand what the little girls know
Blame it on the love of rock and rollEmbed
