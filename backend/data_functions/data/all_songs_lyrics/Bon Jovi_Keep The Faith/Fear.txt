Fear Lyrics
I see you looking over your shoulder
Tell me who do you think's out there
You're reaching for your four leaf clover
But baby there ain't no luck down there
I swear that there's no heart in this city
It's here the slogan reads
"Do your time" everybody's doing their sentence
It's just there ain't nobody here
Who knows just what's the crime

I watched my father live a lie here
I'd rather die than fade away
I read the rules
And yeah I know them
Still you ain't ever going to
Make me play the game of

Fear
Fear
Fear
Fear
Running with the rats in this city
Makes you feel like you're a partner in crime
Girl, once you were young and pretty
Now won't you stop to watch that little girl die
Hey baby won't you stop and hear me
Just being here we're breathing heart attacks, yeah
We can run and chase
The setting sun, baby
We can run and we won't ever look back, no

Take my hand I know we'll make it
I'll let nothing slow us down
I know you want to curse
This place but there's only
One thing that's stopping us now

It's fear
Fear
Fear
Of a new thing
Fear
Fear
Fear
Of the brass ring
You ain't one for taking chances
You work and live and you breathe that nine to five
Still that's what you call living, ha
Man, that's surviving to me
And surviving is living to die in

It's fear
Fear
Fear
Of a new thing
Fear
Fear
Fear
Of the brass ring

Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear
