Save a Prayer Lyrics
Dear Lord, Jesus, Buddah, Allah or can I just call you Joe
I've got a lot of things to tell you and some things I got to know
I'm tired of hearing talk about this world's about to end
If we can die together then can't we all be friends
I got to know
Hey, I got to know
So Mister can you tell me, got to know
Baby can you tell me, got to know
Whoa oh oh I got to know
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, I got to know
Baby can you help me, got to know
I got to know
Did you ever feel like you were drowning
Did you ever feel betrayed by a kiss?
Did you ever feel like you needed somebody
Would you feel alone in a world like this?
Did you ever feel like you needed shelter
Did you ever laugh when you wanted to cry?
Did you ever dream about evolution
Don't you ever feel like your living a lie?

Oh, Whoa, too many children grow up blind to the truth
I say, Oh Oh, Oh, Oh
Say a prayer for me
I'll save a prayer for you
Did you ever feel like you were helpless
Did you ever feel like an open wound?
Did you ever feel that there is no forgiveness
Did you ever feel that close to the truth


Did you ever feel like you need shelter
Did you ever feel like you lived through the flood?
Did you ever feel a lust for survival, did you ever feel, feel, feel?
The world keeps turning
Rooms still burning
There's too many hearts that haven't found a home
This train's on the tracks and the world's on my back
Save a prayer for me and I'll save one for you

No one to blame , but it's hard to explain
Why too many soul's are feeling so alone
You've got to hold on if it's all you can do
Save a prayer for me, I'll save a prayer for you
I'll save a prayer for you, I'll save a prayer for you
I'll Save a prayer
For you, for you, for youEmbed
