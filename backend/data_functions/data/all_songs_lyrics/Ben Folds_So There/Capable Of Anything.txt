Capable Of Anything LyricsWhat is this?
It doesn’t make much sense
They sing it like a pop song
You’re capable of anything
And I’m sure they meant
You could be president
Or you could just forgive me
But I stopped caring what you think about me
I gave up
We’re told we are capable of anything
But you don’t seem to think that you are
Capable of anything
Swung and missed
I put my heart in this
Mythical, holy, good guy
I want so bad to be
But I was weak and wrong
And when I owned it all
It only made you righteous now
You get to blame your life on me
But I stopped caring what you think about me
I gave up
We’re told we are capable of anything
But you don’t seem to think that you are
Capable of anything
You are capable of anything
But you don’t seem to think that
You could fly so low or sink so high
That you could ever love again or even try
That you could steal, or cheat, or kill, or lie
But you mightEmbed
