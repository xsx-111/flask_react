Phone in a Pool Lyrics
Take it easy, take it slow
Oh
Get on with the show
That's what I know
I woke in a cold sweat last night
Seems what's been good for music
Hasn't always been so good for the life

I threw my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life
Again y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks
Oh yeah

I can't tell what you're saying when you yell at the same time
You could be telling me the story of your life
Your life
Is my malfunction so surprising because I always seem so stable and bright?
Ain't it always the quiet types?

I threw my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life
Again y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks
Oh yeah
Well I won't
I won't
I won't
I won't blame New Orleans
Can't you people function for a little while
Without me bouncing off your satellites for a night

Drink it fast or drink it slow
That's what I know
When you've gotten to the bottom of it
It's time to go
And when you've lived to be two hundred feel free to proffer your advice
But until that time
Here's my auto reply

I threw my phone in a pool
In New Orleans
Found the love of my life
Again y'all knows what I means
And I'll be back on your sofa in a puddle in a couple of weeks

That's what I know
That's what I knowEmbed
