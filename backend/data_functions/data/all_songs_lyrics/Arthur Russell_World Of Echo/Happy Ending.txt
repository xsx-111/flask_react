Happy Ending Lyrics
Not much is give away
Try to give away
A town like this, it's gotta know you
There's no one inside to let you in
You fooled around and now you look for what to do
There's too-too much water flying over the bridge
But I see a happy
Ending, yeah
 (x2)
I see, I see
A happy ending for you, yeah

Not much is give away
I try to give away
A town like this, it's gotta know you
There's no one inside
There's no one inside to let you in
You fooled around and now you look for what to do
There's too-too much water flying over the bridge
But I see a happy
Ending, yeah
 (x5)
I see, I see
A happy ending for you, yeah

Not much is give away
Try to give away
A town like this, it's gotta know youEmbed
