Being It LyricsAre you talking yet
But being isn't certain
Any compliment he gives, it's under
It is on the bridges
Get away
Soon to go away
It is on the bridges
It is on the bridges
It is on the bridges
They were by the rail
It is on the bridges
Get away, save the window
But you are seeing in
Where it goes to
Being standard
Always last place
And it shows up
Any railcar
Tender with her
And it's being it
It is on the bridges
It is only beingEmbed
