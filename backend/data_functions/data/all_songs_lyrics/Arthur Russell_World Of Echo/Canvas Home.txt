Canvas Home LyricsCanvas home by the freshwater pool
A seat in the sand, looking out you found him sitting there
On hokey dokey day under the sun
The dog is just finding the boy
Another dog is licking the boy
And the boy is laughing at the sky
Now the sun is out, thereâ€™s a fish you can see
And anything you find goes back to the sea
Anything you find goes back to the sea
Anything you find, anything you find goes back to the sea
Anything you find goes back to the sea
Anything you find goes back to the seaEmbed
