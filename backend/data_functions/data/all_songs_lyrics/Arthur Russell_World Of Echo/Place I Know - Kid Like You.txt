Place I Know / Kid Like You Lyrics
The place I know is several days away
What I say I’m bound to
Is "try and beat my old score"
What I do is now
Being in what is bearing out
What in itself, in itself
Pull in its wealth
In vain, square time
Is trying to be inside itself

Your friend did something that put me on fire
It sure could, it sure would
Put this kind of kid
We’re up on some kind of hill
Where we ended up
‘Cause your friend did something that put me on fire
A kid like you could never understand
And men like me are never understood, then
A kid like you could never understand
A kid like you could never understand that1Embed
