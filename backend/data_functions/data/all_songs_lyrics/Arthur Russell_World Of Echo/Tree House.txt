Tree House LyricsTree house!
School bell!
School bell!
Tree house!
School bell!
Backdoor
(Treehouse! School bell! School bell!)
Never find a school that is
A longer warm-up, longer warm-up
In a school that is a treehouse
(School bell! School bell! School bell!)
Backdoor, tree house
Backdoor, tree house
Oh, back door in here
Tree house where?
Tree house
Tree house
Downtown
(Tree house! School bell! School bell!)
(School bell! School bell!)
(School bell! School bell! School bell! School bell!)Embed
