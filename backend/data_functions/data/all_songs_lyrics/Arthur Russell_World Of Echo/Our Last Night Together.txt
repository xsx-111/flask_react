Our Last Night Together Lyrics
Although, although, although you're coming back
Although you're coming back
Although you're, you're coming back
Although you're coming back

It's our last night together
Our last night, our last night together
Our last night together
Our last night, our last night together

Although you're coming back
I'm losing you for now
This job is just a one-way street
It's taken you away from me

Although you're coming back
Although you're coming back
Although you're coming back
Although you're coming back

It's our last night together
Our last night, our last night together
Our last night together
Our last night, our last night togetherEmbed
