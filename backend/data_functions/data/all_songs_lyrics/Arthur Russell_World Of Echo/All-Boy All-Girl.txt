All-Boy All-Girl LyricsStill, they are tough
They go, still alive they know
All boy, all girl, yeah
All boy, all girl
All boy, all, yeah

Kiss, yeah, yeah
Kiss at the door, in all
Kiss at the door, a scan in the light, they know
At the same time that they were letting go
They were kissing
They were kissing
They were kissing
Dry-eyed inside
Dry-eyed inside, they walk on
Dry-eyed inside
Now they're taking off
And now they're, yeah they're taking off
And then they're taking off
And now they're taking off
And now they're taking off
And now they're taking offEmbed
