Hiding Your Present From You LyricsWhere you see where it is, but don’t know where it is
Where you see where it is, but don’t know where it is
Where you see where it is, but don’t know where it is
Where you see where it is, but don’t know where it is
Where you see where it is
Where you see where
I’m putting everything around you, over by you
Now I’m hiding your, your present from you
Now I’m hiding your, your present from you
Now I’m hiding, now I’m hiding
Where you see where it is, but don’t know where it isEmbed
