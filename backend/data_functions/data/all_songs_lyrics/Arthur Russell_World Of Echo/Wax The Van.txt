Wax The Van LyricsI need the sunlight near you
Oh yes, keep on doing what I’m doing
Oh we can see the van drive up and get the sunlight
Oh see the van drive up and get the love
Oh see the van
In the, in the back
In the back seat, going but there
There is no back seat
I need the sunlight
Keep on doing what I’m doing
Need the sunlight, make it shine
And the moonlight
I need the sunlight, make it shine
In the van, wax the van
See the, wax the van
See the van, wax the van
See the, wax the van
In the, wax the van
See the, wax the van
See the van, the vanEmbed
