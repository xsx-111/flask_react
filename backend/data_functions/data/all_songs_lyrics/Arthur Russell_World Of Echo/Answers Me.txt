Answers Me Lyrics
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
Baby lion goes
Where the islands go
Baby lion

Coming where the main ties onto the sail
Better on sighting for astern, oh
Calling your goodbye with the safest words to
Words to use to tell me
What the answer is
In this song and dance, darling

Answers me, answers me
Answers me, answers me
Answers me, answers me
Answers me, answers me
Answers me, answers me
Answers me, answers me2Embed
