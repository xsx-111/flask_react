See-Through LyricsSee through me, see through
See through me, see me
See through me, see me
You appear when sorry
Sends a friend from my imagination
(Okay, put â€˜em on the appropriate line)
You appear when sorry
Sends a friend from my imagination
Sends a, sends a friend to my
My imagination
Sorry sends a friend to
Sends a friend to my imagination
We are a see-through, through, babe
Seeing through, seeing through
We are a see-through loveEmbed
