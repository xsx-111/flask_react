Tears of Pearls Lyrics
And we stare each other down like victims in the grind
Probing all the weakness and hurt still left behind
And we cry
The tears of pearls
We do it, oh we do it
Is love really the tragedy the way you might describe?
Or would a thousand lovers still leave you cold inside?
Make you cry
These tears of pearls

All these mixed emotions we keep
Locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we keep
Locked away from all the world

Your kisses are like pearls, so different and so rare
But anger stole the jewels away and love has left you bare
Made you cry
These tears of pearls
Well, I could be the tired joker, pour my heart to get you in
Sacrifice my happiness just so I could win
Maybe cry
These tears of pearls
All these mixed emotions we keep
Locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we keep
Locked away from all the world

We twist and turn where angels burn
Like fallen soldiers, we will learn
That once forgotten, twice removed
Love will be the death, the death of you

Baby, c'mon darlin'
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, yeah

All these mixed emotions we keep
Locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we keep
Locked away from all the world
All these mixed emotions we keep
Locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we keep
Locked away from all the world
All these mixed emotions we keep
Locked away like stolen pearls
Stolen pearl devotions we keep
Locked away from all the world1Embed
