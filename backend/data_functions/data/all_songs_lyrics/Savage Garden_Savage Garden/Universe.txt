Universe Lyrics
Well, I'd like to take you as I find you
Imagine our clothes are on the floor
Feel my caress so soft and gentle
So delicate you cry for more
But you know baby, You know baby does it right
And you know baby does it right

Universe inside of your heart
You gotta let me know
So you can be free baby
You wanted it so much
And now that its over
You don't know what you want

Put time in a capsule
Two minds consensual
Entwined to perfection
If we could....
Cuddle up close, lay on my chest now
Listen our heart beats coming down
If you get tired you close your eyes now
When you wake up I won't be found
Cause I know baby
I know you're the nervous kind
With so much going on in your mind
Universe inside of your heart
You gotta let me know
So you can be free baby
You wanted it so much
And now that its over
You don't know what you want

But let me tell you that, this time
I'm gonna make you mine
(I won't let you go)
Cause I know this time
I'm gonna make sure I look out for me
Cause you know baby, You know baby does it right
And you know baby does it right
You will only end up lost in loneliness
And wake up with the words already on your lips
So I'll let you go baby
So I'll let you go...

Universe inside of your heart
You gotta let me know
So you can be free baby
You wanted it so much
And now that its overEmbed
