Violet Lyrics
If there's a way that you could
Be everything you want to be
Would you complain that it came
Too easy?
Just like the games with you and me
A resolution hard to see
But that's O.K. 'cause I don't
See things that are plain to see
I've got a dream to take you over
Exploding like a supernova
I'm gonna crash into your world
And it's no lie
You want to give ectasy delivered
With certainty
But you're afraid the pleasure
Won't be needed
In a way, we're the same two people
Looking out to sea
For a wave that would carry all our
Fantasies

If there's a way to infiltrate you
Sway your mind and complicate you
I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie
Let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to
Cling to
The color inside your head (Violet)

Contemplate jealousy intermixed
With urgency
A million things take a damned
Good shot at you and me

If there's a way to infiltrate you
Sway your mind and complicate you
I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie

Let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to
Cling to
The coulor inside your head (violet)
I'm gonna take you
I'll do my best to break you
I'm gonna take you higher
And that's no lie
Common sense is a game many people don't like to play
But give it in and the moment takes
You either way

I've got a dream to take you over
Exploding like a supernova
I'm gonna crash into your world
And that's no lie

Let your body move into the doorway
To the disco inside you head (Violet)
Wear a colour that you want to
Cling to
The coulor inside your head (violet)

If there's a way that you could
Be everything you want to be
Would you complain that it came to you
Too easy?
In a way we're the same two people
Looking out to sea
For a wave that would carry all our
FantasiesEmbed
