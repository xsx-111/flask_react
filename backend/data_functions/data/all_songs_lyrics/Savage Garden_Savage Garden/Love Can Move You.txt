Love Can Move You Lyrics
Get me through the heart of the freeway
Got to see the lights up in New York City
I'm so close I think I can hear the sound of the taxi siren symphony

Don't you want to feel amazing?
Baby you know I do
You get back ten times what you give freely
Like my mamma told me

Love can move you take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments seem like heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life

Get me to the heart of the subway
Creepin' like a snake into New York City
I'm so close I think I can see those lights
Let the sun get closer to the ground

Don't you want to feel amazing?
Baby you know I do
You get back ten times what you give freely
Like my mamma told me
Love can move you take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments seem like heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of life

And I breathe the love you've given
And I feel the love you've hidden
And though it's cold down here well I can honestly say
I can still stay
That love can move you
That love can move you to a child

Love can move you take you deeper every time
Can make the darkest moments seem like heaven's come alive
Love can move you to a place inside your heart
Where you can fear no evil and acceptance is a natural part of lifeEmbed
