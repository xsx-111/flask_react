A Thousand Words Lyrics
We stumble in a tangled web
Decaying friendships almost dead
And hide behind a mask of lies
We twist and turn and we avoid
All the hope of salvage now devoid
I see the truth inside your eyes

So take all this noise to your brain
Send it back again
I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, call you up and then
I'll say the words out loud

You can resurrect a thousand words to deceive me more and more
A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymore

Time manipulates your heart
Preconceptions torn apart
Begin to doubt my state of mind
But I won't go down on what I said
I won't retract, convictions read
I may perplex but I'm not blind
So take all this noise to your brain
Send it back again
I'll bear the cost, shed my skin, call you up, and then
I'll say the words out loud

You can resurrect a thousand words to deceive me more and more
A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymore

I'll say the words out loud
I'll say a thousand words or more
Manipulation. Fabrication. Conversation. Annihilation
I'll say a thousand words or more
Damnation, frustration, elevation, procreation
I'll say a thousand words or more

You can resurrect a thousand words to deceive me more and more
A thousand words will give the reason why I don't need you anymoreEmbed
