Rational Culture LyricsWe are gonna rule the world
Don't you know, don't you know
We are gonna rule the world
Don't you know, don't you know
We're gonna put it together
We are gonna rule the world
Don't you know, don't you know
We are gonna rule the world
Don't you know, don't you know
We're gonna put it together
Want to put it together
We're gonna put it together
Want to put it together
We're gonna put it together now
Together now
Listen me you all
We're gonna tell you
The most important thing
That you've ever
Heard in your life
You've never
Heard that before
We came
From me a superworld
World of rational energy
And we live
In the energy world
World of animal's energy
Read the book
The only book
The book of God
"Universe In Disenchantment"
And you'll gonna know the truth
Oh, right, man
