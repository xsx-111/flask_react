It Gets the Worst at Night LyricsIt gets the worst at night
With nothing on my mind
But you
I'm thinking too damn much
I go ahead and get up
And put on my boots
So i can drive as far as i can get from you
On my way out of town
I drive by your house
Two times
It don't do me no good
I didn't think that it would
'cause you're not mine
You might have seen me but i kept on driving by
Gonna lose myself on some dark road tonight
'cause there's something 'bout just laying down and taking all that pain
I'd rather drive all night, if it's all the same
'cause half a tank of gas will get me far enough
To be completely lost by the time the sun comes up
And so it's four a.m
I'm on the road again
To find some peace
Some old gravel road
God only knows
There's nothing for me
And there ain't nothing left for me in tennessee
Because i know you're not awake thinking of me
And there's something 'bout just laying down and taking all that pain
I'd rather drive all night if it's all the same
'cause half a tank of gas will get me far enough
To be completely lost by the time the sun comes up
And there ain't nothing left for me in tennessee
'cause i know you're not awake thinking of meEmbed
