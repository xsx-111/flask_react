All These Love Songs LyricsI'm tired of all of these love songs
Those girls and those times are gone
But my heart keeps holdin on
Well I'm tired of thinking about you
And the hell that you put me through
But the songs eat up some of the pain
Take the place of the tears
And ease the heartache
Over you my dear
Well I'm tired of these love songs
They won't make you mine
I'm tired of singing my heart out every night
Well i'm here all alone with not a soul to hear
All these love songs and where the hell are you, my dear
Well i'm tired of all of these songs now
Never meant to let you down
It just all went wrong somehow
Well i'm tired of feeling all this hurt and i'm tired of all these words
But the songs eat up some of the pain
Take the place of the tears
And ease the heartache
Over you my dear
Well i'm tired of these love songs
They won't make you mine
Hell, i'm tired of singing my heart out every night
Well i'm here all alone with not a soul to hear
All these love songs and where the hell are you, my dearEmbed
