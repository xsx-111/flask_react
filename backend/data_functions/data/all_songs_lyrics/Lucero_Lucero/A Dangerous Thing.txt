A Dangerous Thing LyricsWell i'm reckless and free
Now you can't hurt me
My heart is not meant to be tamed
And your beauty and charms
Can't do me no harm
So just stop looking at me that way
Well it's plain to see
You're a dangerous thing
With those hips, those lips, and those eyes
And it's lucky for me
That i like being free
Or i might try and make you mine
Now i might give in to kiss you
But don't plan on me staying long
Well i'm leaving town
On 40 westbound
And my heart aches for no one
I'm right at home
Driving along
Just me and the settin' sun
Well it's plain to see
You're a dangerous thing
With those hips, those lips, and those eyes
And it's lucky for me
That i like being free
Or i might try and make you mine
Now i might give in to kiss you
But don't plan on me staying long
Now i might give in to kiss you
But tommorrow i will be goneEmbed
