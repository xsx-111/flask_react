All Sewn Up LyricsAll sewn up
With bad tattoos
All bit up
Nothin to lose
Well i've been a fool for oh so long
Now the mississippi mud cakes my boots
I'm afraid that i might drown if i don't move
From these waters that run so deep
From these southern ways and lazy heat
Now i'm stuck
Ain't got much to show
With a little luck
Just watch me go
I've got torn up knees and calloused fingertips
Broken vocal chords and busted lips
This goddamn guitar is never quite in tune
Id leave it behind if it weren't all i could do
Now i'm stuck
Ain't got much to show
With a little luck
Just watch me go
Hell im all sewn up with bad tattoos
Can't hide from the faded truth
Well it follows me wherever i might move
All sewn up with bad tattoos
Well san francisco sure sounds nice
And brooklyn might suit me just fine
Well life down here just moves so slow it seems
Like a river barge pushin upstream
Now im stuck
Ain't got much to show
With a little luck
Just watch me go
Now im all sewn up with bad tattoos
Can't hide from the faded truth
Well it follows me wherever i might move
Im all sewn up with bad tattoosEmbed
