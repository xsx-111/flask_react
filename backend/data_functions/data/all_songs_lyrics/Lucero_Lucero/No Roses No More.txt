No Roses No More LyricsAin't no roses no more, it's not like it was before
She had them tears in her eyes, ain't no roses no more
It's yourself you adore, so just go ahead, say goodbye, you don't care if it's right
It's time to go, well that's all that you know
So just tell her true, you're not coming back tonight
Like the waves in the sea, you won't never catch me
I crash on your shores and I'm gone, like the stars in the sky
Plain to see with your eyes, but I'm far out of reach and too hard to hold
And now I'm getting old, only so much time
And I'm taking what's mine, so just tell her true, you're not coming back tonight
Ain't no roses no more, not like it was before
She had them tears in her eyes, ain't no roses no more, now
It's yourself you adore, now, all she's got; tears in her eyes
You said goodbye, she was so strong
Don't mean it's not wrong, so just tell her true
You're not coming back tonight, hell, it won't hurt you, you'll be just fineEmbed
