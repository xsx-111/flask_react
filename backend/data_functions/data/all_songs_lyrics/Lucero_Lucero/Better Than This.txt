Better Than This LyricsMet her out on the interstate
Sleep in my car where I was to wait
She tapped on the glass
Together at last
With the girl I missed
And it really don't get any better than this
No better than this
Sun was shining bright, shining cold
On the dirt and the snow out in new Mexico
We were half way between
The south and the sea
At a motel 6
And it really don't get any better than this
Just five nights and I had to go home
Well she cried big tears at the side of the road
Said our goodbyes
And I left her behind
With one last kiss
And it really don't get any better than this
No better than thisEmbed
