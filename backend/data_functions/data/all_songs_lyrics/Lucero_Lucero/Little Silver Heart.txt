Little Silver Heart LyricsYou're too sweet to let go of
But I don't need to fall in love
Now I'm too tired to talk my way out of this one
It's a losing game, I've had enough
It's too late to make things right
And there ain't no strength left in this heart of mine
Now we make quite a pair but we never got our share of good times
It sure felt nice
Little silver heart
That you once adored
And you don't wear my heart
Around your neck no more
You're too good for this game of mine
Girl, I know I never treat you right
Just a little silver heart, send my lucky star
On a little silver chain, valentine
Little silver heart
That you once adored
And you don't wear my heart
Around your neck no more
All the tears I've cried for you
They don't mean a thing
All the tears you've cried for me
They won't change meEmbed
