Wandering Star LyricsThe bands are done I should go home
All my friends left a long time ago
The girl serving drinks is the only one I know
I got no good place to go
It's a wandering star that lights my way tonight
On the city streets I call my home
It's a wandering star that lights my way tonight
I follow it 'till I am gone
The streetlights fade and disappear
I can see the stars that are out here
Cross the bridge to the country roads
I'll follow that star wherever it goes
It's a wandering star that lights my way tonight
On the city streets I call my home
It's a wandering star that lights my way tonight
I follow it 'till I am gone
Then I wander wherever it might roam
The luckiest star to call my own
And I wander 'till my hearts taken to rest
And my star falls from the sky
'cause falling stars are bestEmbed
