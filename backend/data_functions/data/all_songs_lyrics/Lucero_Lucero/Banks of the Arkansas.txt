Banks of the Arkansas LyricsPrettiest little ever i saw
Stood on the banks of the arkansas
Her hair was brown and her eyes were green
She's the prettiest little ever i'd seen
Well wave the ocean and wave the sea
Wave that pretty back to me
Well wave the ocean and wave the shore
Wave this town wave no more
Prettiest little ever i saw
Stood on the banks of the arkansas
Her hair was wild and her stare was mean
She the prettiest damn ever i'd seenEmbed
