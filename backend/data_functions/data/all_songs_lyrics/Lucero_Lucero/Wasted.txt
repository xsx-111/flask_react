Wasted LyricsI wasted my hands, I wasted my heart, and the night, is so cold
Wasted my tears, and wasted my words, and I wish I cold hold
You tonight, just tonight, well it won't be tonight
Won't be tonight Wasted my fists, I wasted my arms
Hell, these tattoos will slowly fade, Wasted my strength
And I wasted my youth, and I'd trade the rest of my days for you tonight
Just tonight Well it won't be tonight, won't be tonight
One day I'll stop wastin' my life away Hell, I'll come through for you
Prove myself to you, Girl I'll show you what I can do, One day Ill stop wastin' my
Life away, And Ill come through for you, Prove myself for you
Girl Ill show you what I can do, well it won't be tonight
It won't be tonight, won't be tonight, won't be tonight
Girl, it won't be tonight, won't be tonightEmbed
