Hold Fast LyricsWell the sail
The sail on this ship comes
Crashing down
As the rope
That is your love slips
Slips from my hands
I hold fast, figures
Don't let her slip away
Hold fast 'cause you need her
To get to the calm of the bay
Now the bow
The bow on this ship is
Under the sea
But i won't
Let go the rope so
Though the waves come to me
And i hold fast, figures
Don't let her slip away
Hold fast 'cause you need her
To get the ship back to the bayEmbed
