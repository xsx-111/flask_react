Priscilla Lyrics
She'd come to my house
And dance in the hall
With the music up loud
Against the light on the wall

And I danced beside her
Feeling no shame
We were in costume
And this was a game

She'd put on her skirt
Of layers of chiffon
The top of the umbrella had come off
So I put that on

And we danced together then
An awkward ballet
She was 20 years older than I was
But still we did play

She was 20 years older than me
And many times my size
It's her little feet I remember
The look in her eyes

And once when I saw her
She made me a doll
Of ribbon and paper and ink
And lace, I recall

I danced beside her
Feeling no shame
'Cause we were in costume
And this was a game

I think of her now I'm older
I still love to dance
Something will shine through the body
If you give it a chance

(Still love to dance)
(Still love to dance)
(Still love to dance)
(Still love to dance)
(Still love to dance)
(Still love to dance)Embed
