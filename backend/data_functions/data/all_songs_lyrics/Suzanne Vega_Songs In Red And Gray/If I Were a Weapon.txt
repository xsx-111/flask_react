If I Were a Weapon Lyrics(Oooh)
If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range, I guess
With silencer and stun
I feel more like a needle
Always pulling on the thread
Always making the same point again
And wondering if you heard what I just said
If you were a weapon
A hammer's what you'd be
Blunt and heavy at the end
And coming down on me
I've concealed a weapon
Like a pocket knife attack
All folded up inside until you see the shine
And then you'll want it back
(Oooh)
I've concealed a weapon
Like a pocket knife attack
All folded up inside until you see the shine
And then you'll want it back
(Oooh)
If I were a weapon
You said I'd be a gun
Lethal at close range, I guess
With silencer and stun
If I am that weapon
I am pointing now at you
So just put down the hostage and we'll talk it down
Until we see this through
(Oooh)
Talk it down until we see this through
(Oooh)Embed
