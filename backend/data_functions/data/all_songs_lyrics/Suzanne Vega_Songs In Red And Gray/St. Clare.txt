St. Clare LyricsCall on that saint
And the candle that burns
Keeping her safe
Until her return
Plaster and paint
Holding the fire
A poor woman's saint
Holding all man's desire
Bold little bird
Fly away home
Could I but ride herd
On the wind and the foam
All of the souls
That curl by the fire
They never know
All man's desire
Watercress clings
To the banks of the stream
In the first grip of spring
When the snow melts to green
Barefoot and cold
And holding a lyre
By the side of the road
Holding all man's desire
Call on the saint
When the white candle burns
Keeping her safe
Until her returnEmbed
