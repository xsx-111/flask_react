It Makes Me Wonder Lyrics
The Virgin Mary on a chain
Has hit me in the mouth again
As we explore the carnal score
Of sacred and profane

Sulky boy won't drink his milk
So mother's breast beneath the silk
Remains untouched it's way too much
Reject all of that ilk

I have to say it makes me wonder
If you are holding me
To the same blue flame that you're under
'Cause I feel you scolding me

It makes me wonder
It makes me wonder

Your Virgin Mary's in the way
Hallucinate her face by day
Obscure the view in front of you
It's me here made of clay
You're playing near that line so thin
Austerity or just give in
To endless appetite
Embrace that white oblivion

I have to say it makes me wonder
If you are holding me
To that cold blue flame that you're under
When you are holding me

And why so high the expectation?
Who could live up to this?
And there's no time now for explanation
Cool as an angel's kiss

And I have to say it makes me wonder
If you are holding me
To that cold blue flame that you're under
When you are holding me

It makes me wonder
(I have to say)
It makes me wonder
(I have to say)
It makes me wonder
(I have to say)
It makes me wonder
(I have to say)Embed
