Solitaire LyricsBlack on the red and the red on the black
It's a tic of a tired mind
Come and sit down, won't you try your luck
See if you unwind
Never use your threes and twos
Follow superstition
Otherwise you are going to lose
Compulsion makes you listen
Take what's wrong, and make it go right
You can weave it like a prayer
Wonder if you'll spend the night
Playing solitaire?
Just do it again, when you find you're all done
Like an idiot savant
Shuffle up your luck. You see, you almost won
Now wrestle down what you want
Jack on the Queen, and the ten on the Jack
It's a happy repetition
You and your fate in a kind of check-mate
And you are your only competition
Take what's wrong, and make it go right
You can weave it like a prayer
Are you going to spend the night
Playing solitaire?

Take what's wrong, and make it go right
You can weave it like a prayer
Are you going to spend the night
Playing solitaire?
