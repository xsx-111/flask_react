Machine Ballerina LyricsAm I an afternoon's pastime?
A thing on a string
To be thrown and retrieved
Like a phone call received
On somebody's birthday
To tease and delight
And then say goodnight
And then just say goodbye?
Am I a toy on a tray ?
A soft piece of clay
Queen or clown for the day
Machine ballerina
Soldier of tin
Standing so loyal
While you sit so royal
Then I'm put away?
Ch: For your approval
Perusal
And your possible
Refusal
I'm amusing
I'm a puppet for your play
Am I your Mad Magazine?
Skin trampoline
Pin-up pinball machine
Your fantasy girl
Of puzzling parts
But none fits or starts
We match wits but not hearts
I'm heard but never seen?
Chorus againEmbed
