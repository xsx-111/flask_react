See You Again Lyrics
Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone
Faded into the setting sun
Slipped away
But I won’t cry, 'cause I know I’ll never be lonely
For you are the stars to me
You are the light I follow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again

I can hear those echoes in the wind at night
Calling me back in time
Back to you
In a place far away where the water meets the sky
The thought of it makes me smile
You are my tomorrow

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again
Sometimes I feel my heart is breaking
But I stay strong and I hold on 'cause I know
I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, yeah, yeah

I will see you again, oh
This is not where it ends
I will carry you with me, oh
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
'Til I see you again
Yeah, yeah, oh

Said goodbye, turned around
And you were gone, gone, gone13Embed
