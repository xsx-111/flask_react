Leave Love Alone Lyrics
Funny how love can make you feel
Crush you like a ton of steel
Fake you out, make you think it's real
Funny how love can make you feel, yeah

Ooh, ooh, yeah
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
Hey!

Ain't it funny how love can make you fly?
Sweetest buzz and the highest high
When you can't walk to the other side
Ain't it funny how love can make you fly?

Ooh, I can't stop it
Ooh, gotta have it, want it
I can't help it
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone (Can't leave it alone)
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
Hey!
Oh, come on!
Burn me once, but it don't sink in
I just keep coming back again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just canâ€™t leave, I can't leave it
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave love alone
I just can't leave
I can't leave it alone
I can't leave itEmbed
