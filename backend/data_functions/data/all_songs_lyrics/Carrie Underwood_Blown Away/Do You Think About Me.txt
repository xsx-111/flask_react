Do You Think About Me Lyrics
That first cold September night
You were the blanket holding me tight
You were kissing me and the Earth stood still
You said we don't have to, I said I will, yeah
We ran in when the thunder came
You told me sugar melts in the rain
Don't wanna watch our love go to waste
So we ran inside 'fore it was too late

Oh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you? Yeah

I moved on to another town
Wrote you letters 'til the ink ran out
When the clouds rolled in, I grabbed the keys
And played that song that we used to sing
I met a boy a lot like you
It's funny how he used to sing it, too
But he was always just a little out of key
So much different than you and me
Oh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Ooh, yeah

Sometimes I wonder if you wonder
What it could've been like
When you're sittin' there drinking coffee
Are you thinkin' of me
When it's thunderin' and rainin' outside?

Oh I, oh I, I'm not even tryin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin'
Oh I, oh I, it's sendin' me flyin'
Oh I, oh I, but I can't stop smilin', yeah

Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me
Like I think about you?
Do you think about me?1Embed
