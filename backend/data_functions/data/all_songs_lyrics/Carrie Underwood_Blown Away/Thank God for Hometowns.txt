Thank God for Hometowns Lyrics
Yesterday I got a call
Someone I didnâ€™t know at all had passed away
Mama said, "Yeah, you know him
You went to school with both his kids
They lived out on Prescott lane"
She said, "You should've seen the line
Mrs. Johnson said to tell you hi"

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes  'em go 'round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
'Cause when you're lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
Yeah

Last June, my cousin tied the knot
Didn't know if I'd go or not
But I'm sure glad I did
It was a pretty good haul, but worth the drive
I could feel myself come back to life
The closer that I'd get
First red light, I rolled the windows down
Breathed it in and took a look around
Thank God for hometowns
First kisses and touchdowns
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
And when you're lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns

I always find another piece of me
Walking down these old familiar streets

Thank God for hometowns
And all the love that makes 'em go 'round
Thank God for the county lines that welcome you back in
When you were dying to get out
Thank God for Church pews
And all the faces that won't forget you
And when you're lost out in this crazy world
You got somewhere to go and get found
Thank God for hometowns
