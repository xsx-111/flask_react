Nobody Ever Told You Lyrics
Take off all the makeup, girl
Shine your light, show the world
Don’t be shy, don’t be scared
You don’t have to hide under there
Let’s throw away all the magazines
Turn off the static on the TV
Wish you could see yourself the way I do

Nobody ever told you
Nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
And you need to know what nobody ever told you
Yeah
La, la, la, la, la

Mirror, mirror, on the wall
Acting like it knows it all
Tells you lies of vanity
It doesn't care what's underneath
All hung up on the negative
Doesn’t have to be the way it is
Wish you could see yourself the way I do
Nobody ever told you
Yeah, nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
And you need to know what nobody ever told you
Na, na, na, na...

Free as a bird up on a wire
Just like a flower growing wild
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful

Nobody ever told you
Yeah, nobody ever told you
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
And you need to know what nobody ever told you

Yeah, oh
You shine like a diamond, glitter like gold
You need to know what nobody ever told you
Na, na, na, na
Oh, you're free as a bird up on a wire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Just like a flower growing wild
Just like a flower growing wild
Na, na, na, na1Embed
