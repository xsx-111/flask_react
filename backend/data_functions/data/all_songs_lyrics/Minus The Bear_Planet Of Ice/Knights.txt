Knights LyricsI owe you, don't I?
A little light today, but tomorrow
Oh, tomorrow
I owe you, don't I?
I know it ain't the money
Girl, there never was money
This usury, so typical
A piece of you for a piece of me
It's hard-coded
A piece of you for a piece of, me
And it's all right
Let's call it good
A, a little more
Let's make this even
This usury, so typical
A piece of you for a piece of me
It's hard-coded
A piece of you for a piece of me
This usury,  so typical
A piece of you for a piece of me
It's hard-coded
Is it really a sin if we both come out even?
We come out evenEmbed
