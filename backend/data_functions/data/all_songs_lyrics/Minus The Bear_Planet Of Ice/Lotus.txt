Lotus LyricsThere are no ghosts
Watchin' through your walls
So put the cross down
And there are no angels
Readin' your thoughts
Keep your feet on this ground
You gettin' scared yet?
The man in the blue suit's got God
Are we there yet?
The congregation's been sold off
They've been bought
What to do about tomorrow?
Please let it come, just let it come
What'cha gonna do about today man?
It's right here, starin' you in the face
What a difference that would make
If we were finally, awake
You gettin' scared yet?
The man in the blue suit's got guns
And are we there yet?
The congregation's been killed off
Are we gettin' scared yet?
We drop our bombs to lift them up
To lift them up
You've gotta be out of your head
Is it worth all the dead
Do you like it?

(Does the wife)
Does the wife mind the touch
Of your reddened hand
Or the money on your breath
Does your balance turn her on
Regardless of the sin?
Blind your eyes watchin' sunbeams
And you can't see this
Creepin' pack of dogs
Blind your eyes watchin' sunbeams
You can't see this
Creepin' pack of dogs
Blind your eyes watchin' sunbeams
The purebread beasts
Wait, lickin' their chopsEmbed
