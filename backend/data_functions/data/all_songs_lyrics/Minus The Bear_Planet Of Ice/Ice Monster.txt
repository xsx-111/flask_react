Ice Monster LyricsYou've come to this, you were once a lion
You've come to this, bringing den here
You've come to this, you were a lion
You've come to this, sigh alone now
You walked on some tall moon tail
It's come to this, you walked on a tall
We all know you've come home to fall
She's gone, she's gone 'cross the border, man
And you're never gonna see her again
I could give fuck all what you do to me
But your party's over, it's done, the end
Take a step back
Take a step back
Take a step back man
Take a step back and turn yourself around
The check has been cashed
There's no stopping it now
You're safe if I'm safe
And she's safe, we're okay
The sooner we're past this
We'll all stop our knocking on wood
Knock on wood
She's gone, she's gone 'cross the border, man
And you're never gonna see her again
I could give fuck all what you do to me
But your party's over, it's done, the end
It's come to this, it's come to this
It's come to this, it's come to this
It's come to this, it's come to this
It's come to this, it's come to this
And we all know
That you've come home
To fall
She's gone 'cross the border, man
And you're never gonna see her again
I could give fuck all what you do to me
Just leave her out of thisEmbed
