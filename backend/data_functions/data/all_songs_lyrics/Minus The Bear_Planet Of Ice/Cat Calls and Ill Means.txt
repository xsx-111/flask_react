Cat Calls and Ill Means Lyrics
There is no memory of you
With the day on your face
Just late night, bar light
A street lamp, a movement bedside
Does that feel right?
Falling apart before sunrise
As if we're afraid that
The sun on our skin will start fires

We don't care
We don't seem to care
Each of these nights
Seem to connect

Each of these nights
Seem to connect
Each of these nights
When we connect

Listen to sirens cry
Not finding their crime scenes
And the loose sparks outside
Their cat calls and ill means
Some kinks are never
Meant to be worked out
The more that you feel them
The more you need their doubt

We don't care
We don't seem to care
Each of these nights
Seem to connect

Each of these nights
Seem to connect
Each of these nights
When we connect

Each of these nights
Seem to connect
Each of these nightsEmbed
