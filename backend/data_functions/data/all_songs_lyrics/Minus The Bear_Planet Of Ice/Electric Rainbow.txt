Electric Rainbow Lyrics
What did you do?
What did you do?
You've got some heat on you
You've got some heat on you
They've been tracing all your moves
Your mark has made you his
And if you want to live
Let me suggest this
Get a gun and get a car
Get on the 25 south to Mexico
You find some place and lay low, just lay low
I just need to check the score
'Cause girl, you've gotta move

Oh, stay lonely, stay quiet
Stay, you'll keep breathin' air

How did it go so wrong so fast?
The confidence and then a money grab
Simple enough, simple enough a plan
It all went to shit and you're on the run
At least you've got the cash
At least you've got the cash
Oh, stay lonely, stay quiet
Stay, you'll keep breathin' air
Oh, stay lonely, stay quiet
Stay, you'll keep breathin' air

Air, you'll keep breathin'
The road in front of our protagonist runs in
Then you'll sleep this dough under pillow again, again
Don't bring no lights on you

What did you do?
What did you do?
You've got some heat on you
You've got some heat on you
They've been tracing all your moves
What did you do?
What did you do?
You've got some heat on you
You've got some heat on you
What did you do?
What did you do?Embed
