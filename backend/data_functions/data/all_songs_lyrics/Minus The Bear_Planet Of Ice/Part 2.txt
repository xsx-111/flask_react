Part 2 LyricsThat night he found the key to decode you
Tokyo
Between warm sake
And streetlight caught in falling snow
Holding each word he spoke, her hands
Filled up full
The quiet voice she gave him
Translates by tone
They laughed throughout their talking
With every round
Words came into meaningEmbed
