Double Vision Quest LyricsCaught in the locked
Groove of this long season
These hours, motions
Circle, still repeating
The beat moves on itself
The beat moves on itself
Every day my love
Crazy, crazy days are gone
When I come home
And we're finally alone
And I'm caught in
Your arms, safe from a morning
No one walks out on the tightrope
Today my love
The beat moves on itself
The beat moves on itself
Every day my love
Crazy, crazy days are gone
When I come home
Crazy, crazy days are gone
When I come home
We awoke
At the edge of a summer
New days began to stretch their legs
And the tempo's changing to compensate
The needle finds the groove to free us tonight
We awoke
On the edge of this winter
The ice melts off, and flows in like a song
The record plays but the needle's old
It lets the player take control
To move the speakers how they're told
To make us want for something more
Music is a sedative
And you put out what you put inEmbed
