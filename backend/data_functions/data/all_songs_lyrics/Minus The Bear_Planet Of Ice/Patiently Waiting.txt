Patiently Waiting Lyrics
She woke up on a train
A train moving through a mountain range
And she's still silently watching trees falling East, she's thinking
Home is just a hang up when nothing's easy
Last night, hotel bar you lost track of time, emptying glasses
Then you turned your head as he walked through the door
He found your gaze but you made him yours
Did you know you could take a man so easily? For what it's worth

Move, baby, move
Your life is falling on you
Move, baby, move
Your life is falling on you

Morning came and saw you alone, he had turned into a note
"Thanks girl, next time in my town just pick up the phone"
It found the floor, you found you weren't at home
It was a night just like any other night, or someone, somewhere

Move, baby, move
Your life is falling on you
Move, baby, move
Your life is falling on you
Go back to sleep for a little longer
You got the best of me
Your clothes have been patiently waiting
Go put them back on, it wasn't so wrong

Move, baby, move
Your life is falling on you
Move, baby, move
Your life is falling on youEmbed
