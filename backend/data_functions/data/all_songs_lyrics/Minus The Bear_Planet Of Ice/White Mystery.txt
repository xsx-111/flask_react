White Mystery LyricsLeft her at home in the cold London night
She had nothing on (not a stitch)
Nothing on (not a stitch on)
And she stays that way (til I get back)
With her regrets and (til I get back)
Another bottle of good times
Her body's over the covers
And there's nothing wrong with a single inch and in the same position
Laying on her back waiting for a kiss
A kiss that she gets
Long and slow, starts at her toes
And then it goes (and goes) and goes (and goes) and goes (and goes) and goes (and goes)
And moves slow (slow, slow)
And when I get to her lips I still have skin to explore
Her body's under the covers
And there's nothing wrong with a single inch and then we change positions
She's got me on my back losing common sense
Lay under bright lights
Lay under bright lights
Lay under bright lights
Lay under bright lights
You can't hear the music but we're playing the same tune
Each beat, every note played perfectly by you
Lay under bright lights
Lay under bright lights
Lay under bright lights...Embed
