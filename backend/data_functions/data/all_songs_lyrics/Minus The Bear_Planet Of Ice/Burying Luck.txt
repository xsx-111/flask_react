Burying Luck Lyrics
In the nightmare desert stood a building
Outside someone was digging a hole in the ground
They were burying my luck

What have you done?

The man in the hole has smoked up all my income
My better days his for the take and I watched it all
Him putting pins into a doll

What have you done?

This dream blinks into night
The man in the hole
Has carried away the moonlight
Cupped in his hands
A dime on the water
He's a patient man
As his careful stepping shows
Will he take her love?
Will his hands know what mine did?
Will her body like the fit?
Will he take her love?
What have you done?Embed
