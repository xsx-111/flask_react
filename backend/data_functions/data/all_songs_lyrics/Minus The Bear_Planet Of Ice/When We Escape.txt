When We Escape LyricsSomeone's turning the lights down low
And the music up
Do you feel the beat?
I see you do by the way you move
I need to feel your body moving on me
You must be an illusion
Can I see through you?
Someone's pulling me out the house
Cars are parked up and down the street
Your dress is begging to come off
A quiet dark place is all we need
You must be an illusion
Can I see through you?
You must be an illusion
You must be an illusion
When we escape
It's with a white lie
We're both alive
Now we lay this close
Catching measures of the pulse
You must be an illusion
Can I see through you?
You must be an illusion
You must be an illusion
You must be a
You've got to be
An illusion, an illusion
You must be an illusion
Can I see through you?
You must be an illusion
You must be an illusion
You must be an illusion
(You've got to be an illusion)Embed
