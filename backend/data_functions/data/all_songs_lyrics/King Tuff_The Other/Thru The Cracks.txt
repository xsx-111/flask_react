Thru The Cracks Lyrics
I'm going back to the edge of the Earth
Looking for an old friend
I didn't know when we said goodbye
That I wouldn't see you again
I still see your smiling face
In all the stars of outer space

Here one moment, gone in a flash
I guess we all fall through the cracks

The river shimmered like a sequin dress
Bouncin' off your blue eyes
You put it on, you started to dance
'Til you turned into the blue sky
I still see it in the summers of my brain
See it in the rainbows, see it in the rain

Here one moment, gone in a flash
I guess we all fall through the cracks

What is on the other side
Some palace in the sky
A perfect paradise
Another kind of life
You know you had such a beautiful brain
But no one understood you
You only saw one way to escape
But I wish you didn't have to
But through the cracks, a light came shining
Like the biggest, brightest diamond
Through the cracks, where you dispersed
And became a whole universe
I still see it in the stillness of the breeze
Sittin' on the stoop down on Elliot Street

Here one moment, gone in a flash
I guess we all fall... Oh yeah, we all fall
Oh yeah, we all fall... We all fall through the cracks
La la la la la la la la...
Through the cracks
La la la la la la la la...
Yeah we all fall
La la la la la la la la...
Fall through the cracksEmbed
