Birds Of Paradise Lyrics
You were young, just a child
Imagination running wild
There was nothing but the glow
Of fireflies and chasing rainbows
Wonder where that child went
Vanished with your innocence
He grew up and he was told
He better stop daydreaming

There's no sunshine in your face
There's no blue sky in your brain
You just lay in bed all day
Watching the world twist away

That child is still alive
In that prison of your mind
Don't be afraid, you don't have to hide
Just put your little hand in mine
'Cause tonight we're gonna fly
Like birds of paradise

Remember when you were green
And you touched eternity
Seems like only yesterday
All you ever did was play
Now you walk the ruined road
You don't let your garden grow
You let it lay there paralyzed
You give it only poison
No more sunshine in your face
No more blue sky in your brain
You just lay in bed all day
Watching the world twist away

That child is still alive
In that prison of your mind
Don't be afraid, you don't have to hide
Just put your little hand in mine
'Cause tonight we're gonna fly
Like birds of paradise

There's no sunshine in your face
There's no blue sky in your brain
You just lay in bed all day
Watching the world twist away

That child is still alive
In that crescent of your mind
Don't be afraid, you don't have to hide
Tonight we're gonna fly
Yeah, tonight we're gonna fly
Like birds of paradise
Show yourself and come outside
Put your little hand in mine
Yeah, tonight we're gonna fly
Like birds of paradiseEmbed
