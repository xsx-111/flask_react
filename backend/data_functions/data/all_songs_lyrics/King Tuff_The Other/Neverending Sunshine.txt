Neverending Sunshine Lyrics
Diamond sky, ocean air
Purple flowers everywhere
Crooked smile, desert heat
Burn away my bluest dream
Cool it down, take a sip
Watch that broken AC drip
'Cause everybody's going blind
In the neverending sunshine
Neverending sunshine
Summer strawberry breeze
Snowflakes falling in my dreams
Wish all day, wonder when
I'll ever see the snow again

Hot as hell here in heaven
All the rattlesnakes are sweating
Coca-cola in my wine and
Neverending sunshine
Neverending sunshine
A neverending sunshine
Neverending sunshine

And the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Oh yeah the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Here we are, stuck in cars
Searching for a shooting star
Blacktop burning up my feet
Skin is sticking to the seat

There's no seasons, there's no time
Just palm trees screaming "Paradise"
Just a big hole in my mind
Just neverending sunshine
Neverending sunshine
A neverending sunshine
Neverending sunshine

And the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Oh yeah the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Yeah the time is gonna come
I'm gonna smile when I'm swallowed by the sun
Yeah the time is gonna comeEmbed
