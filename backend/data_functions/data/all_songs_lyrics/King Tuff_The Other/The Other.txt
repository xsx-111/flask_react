The Other LyricsStuck in traffic on my way
To no particular place
No agenda, no master plan
No important dates
No reason to be alive at all
As far as I can tell
Except for one small detail
Like a distant ringing bell
And it keeps on calling out to me
Like a lost forgotten lover
So I blast off down the shoulder
To go looking for the other
Driving up the coast
Past the surfers and the seals
All them lonely rich folks
Who only know how to steal
Science can cure sickness
But what can cure my soul
It won't be long before I'm gone
Laying in some hole
So I find an ancient payphone
To tell my mother I love her
But she ain't home
She must have gone out looking for the other
Pull up off the highway
The moon is looking wicked good
I throw my keys into the breeze
And get lost in the woods
I think about my old man
And the mystery of time
When suddenly between the trees
I see the lake of fire
So I jump right in
And take a swim
In this pool of unknown colours
And as I swim I begin to brim with visions of the other
Found my car a few days later
After I came to
Her name was Blue Subaru 1982
I punched the clutch
And kick the gas
And take off in a burst
Well it wasn't long before the gas was gone
And we were overcome from thirst
So we found a dusty truckstop
Above the vultures hovered
And I thought it was the end
But then I thought again
And that was when I took the hand of the otherEmbed
