Infinite Mile Lyrics
Mm, talk to me
Let's take a walk
Gimme some of your sweet time
Before all this madness
I remember your pretty mind
We'll listen to each other's words
And make each other smile
Oh, hold me like you used to do
On the infinite mile

Then walk into oblivion
I'll see you in a while
Yeah, I know we'll meet again someday
On the infinite mile

I can't help but find it foolish
To flash away my days
With the endless streams of information
Flying at my face
A flicker flame and a diamond dance
That's my kinda style
Best to avoid the androids
On the infinite mile
So walk into oblivion
See you in a while
Yeah, I'm happy that we found each other
On the infinite mile

We felt the darkness coming
From a million miles away
We tried hard to avoid it
But it hit us anyway
Oh, when I met you, you were innocent
Just a starry-eyed child
Before all that shit went down
On the infinite mile

So walk into oblivion
Flash me one more smile
Yeah, I know we'll meet again someday
On the infinite mile
So walk into oblivion
See you in a while
Yeah, I'm happy that we found each other
On the infinite mile
On the infinite mile (repeated)Embed
