Ultraviolet LyricsI step into the sunrise
In my yellow shoes
Crossing through illusions
Directly to the truth
I light a little candle
I blow and make a wish
Cuz in this very moment
Death does not exist
No death does not exist
For so long I lived in shadows
Covering my eyes
I made it out of there somehow
To my own surprise
I guess I owe it all to Big Luna
I call her with my bell
She took me in her silver wings
Yeah I believe she suits me well
Yeah I believe she suits me well
So I'm following that rabbit
The potion's getting stirred
And all that's left to do now
Is say the magic word
And we can blow this popsicle stand
Straight to kingdom come
Cuz all I need is your hand
And your ultraviolet love
Yeah your ultraviolet love
Utraviolet coming down
Everybody's happy now
Ultraviolet coming down
Everybody's high
X2
Ultraviolet coming down
Everyone is happy now
