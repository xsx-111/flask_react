Raindrop Blue Lyrics
You fell onto my fingers
Like velvet to the touch
You were flying all directions
You were everywhere all at once
And you shine on me like silver
And set me free of fear
Yeah, you were just like flowers
Bloomin' in my tears

And like the raindrops
Poundin' on my roof
It hit me like a cloudburst
When I fell in love with you

You dazzle me with destiny
And magnetise my mouth
We kiss between the crocuses
That gathered all around
And you dressed me up like dynamite
When I was lookin' wild
Now everybody's always askin' me
How I got my style
'Cause I'm electric
Thinkin' about you
Well, I must've turned to lightnin'
When I fell in love with you

I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue, blue, blue

Yeah, I'm electric
Thinkin' about you
Well, I must've turned to lightnin'
When I fell in love with you

So shower me with symphonies
And bathe me in blue moons
Endless my epiphanies
And shine my solitude
Because I left it all behind me
To wander with the Fool
And when I finally found the Priestess
She handed me this jewel
I'm radiating
Sun is peeking through
Yeah, my love is never-ending
And It's shinin' all for you

I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue, blue, blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue, blue, blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue, blue, blue
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I keep on falling (I keep on falling)
I'm falling for you raindrop blue, blue, blue1Embed
