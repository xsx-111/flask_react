Circuits In The Sand LyricsShow me the way
Back to good old days
When we were only butterflies
And all we did was play
Our senses have been numbed
We can't enjoy the taste
Cause everyone's been digitized
But no one will be safe
The artist and the athlete
The stripper and the priest
Policeman and the poet
The kids down on the street
We all thought we found paradise in the
Palm of our hand
But all they found in the future was
Circuits in the sand
Bathed in blue light
Two lovers under cover
Suckin' on their screens
They forgot about each other
Sunrise forever paralyzed
In flowing finger streams
Forgot how to fantasize
Forgot how to dream
The teachers and the students
The Christians and the Jews
The janitors, the warriors
The geniuses, the fools
We all thought we found paradise in the
Palm of our hand
But all they found in the future were
Circuits in the sand
I'm trying to remember
How it felt to be alive
I'm trying to remember
The last time I went outside
I'm mesmerized and hypnotized
Distracted endlessly
Trying to remember any
Good it's done for me
The donkeys and the elephants
The Beatles and The Stones
The skinheads and the street punks
Everybody's on their phones
They all thought they found paradise in the
Palm of their hands
But all they found in the future were
Circuits in the sand
So take me to your telescope and
Point me to the void
Save me from the ones and zeros
Before it all gets destroyed
Poisoned by the power in the
Palm of our hand
And all they found in the future were
Circuits in the sandEmbed
