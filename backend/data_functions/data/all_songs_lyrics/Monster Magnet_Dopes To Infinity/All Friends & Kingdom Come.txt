All Friends & Kingdom Come LyricsEnter now the lions den
It's long past due that we begin
I have longed for you afar
Love sacriface in my backyard
I have seen beyond my gaze
I have gazed beyond today
And their lust shall build a world
Is what the prophets have to say
In this world where I am king
The atoms roar and strange love sings
All the jewels that one can bring
Mutant rags and big T.V
Service now, the mushroom boy
Come to me now, by my side
And if you don't want to play
Then I'm afraid you'll have to cry
'Cause I can fry you with my eyes
I can blow you to kingdom come
I can take all the friends away
I've got mushroom clouds in my hands
And a place in my head for you
Better come to the throne today
There's a line inside my head
I dance at night before bed
But I never took the ride
And silo shed, on the other side
Service now, the mushroom boy
Or at lest come to a show
Just one lick upon my thoughts
Or both our worlds will have to go
'Cause I can fry you with my eyes
I can blow you to kingdom come
I can take all the friends away
I've got mushroom clouds in my hands
And a place in my head for you
Better come to the throne today
Whoa..
I'm just not quite right today
Whoa..Embed
