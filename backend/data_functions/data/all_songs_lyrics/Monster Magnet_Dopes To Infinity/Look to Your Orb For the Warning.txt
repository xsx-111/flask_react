Look to Your Orb For the Warning LyricsGoing down now
The mountain screamed three times today
I guess it thought I'd like to play
How much does one have to pay
To fry a peak and melt away?
Launching titan's breath on mine
The sweating measure lands on time
And the old man is down by the river
Well, he gets up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now
Going down now
Going down now
Looking for the rat that crowed
He's hooked up down in Mexico
Slap my nerve, now give me more
It's my disaster, friend, not yours
And the old man is down by the river
Well, he gets up and he walks on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now
And the last one, it's down by the river
Where he gets up and he floats on down
To the spaceship that's parked at your doorstep
And it's waiting to take you away now
It's down by the river
It's always this way now
It's down by the river
It's always this way now
Going down now
Going down nowEmbed
