Eclipse This LyricsI'm gonna plant your man
Out in the fields
He ain't tapped like me, baby
And I can use the wheel
I'm gonna cop me some peace
I wanna take it slow
I wanna tighten your evenings, baby
Out on the crystal road, alright
Time is gone and life is short
I gotta go
I'd love to get to loop ya somehow
Yeah
I gotta shake my head
You're way to cool
You got the grip of your mother, honey
But you're matchin' that fall
I ain't got the time
But I do have a way
Of making snakes sing to Jesus, lady
Like it's Judgment Day
Time is nothing, life is life
You gotta know
That everything is happening right now
I'm gonna plant your man
Out in the fields
He ain't tapped like me, baby
And I could use the wheels
I'm gonna cop me some peace
I wanna take it slow
I wanna tighten your evenings, baby
Out on the crystal road, aw yeah
Time is gone and life is short
I gotta go
I'd love to get to loop ya somehow
YeahEmbed
