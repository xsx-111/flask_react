Dead Christmas Lyrics
I crept up on my baby
I laid down on my town
I found a shrinking violet
I crushed it into the ground
I felt the heart of forever
I held it over my head
I said "fuck you" on Christmas
And then they put me to bed
And I'm never gonna tell you why

I got my face in the furnace
I got my snake in a sleeve
God's drowned in a bowl of cereal
I have to ask you to leave
Roll up your expectations
And feed them into my sleep
I'll ask the master cylinder
What kind of cookies he eats
And I'm never gonna tell you why

Sometimes my soul just moves so slow
Like a dream a of diesel heart that just won't go, yeah
There's a light that used to shine
I breathed it all the time
Now I wait on the edge of Mars but it just don't show, yeah
I'll see you around, baby
I'll see you around, baby
I'll see you around, baby
I'll see you around, baby
So long here, baby
So long here, baby
So long here, baby
So long here, baby, yeah
Baby, yeah
Baby, yeah
Baby, yeah
Baby, yeah
I'll see you around, baby
I'll see you around, baby
I'll see you around, baby
I'll see you around, baby
So long here, babyEmbed
