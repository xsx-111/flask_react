The Raven King LyricsThe raven's flown and left the tower
And Albion feels all abandoned
A desecrated cenotaph - surveillance state and waning choices
Guarded by warriors we knew
Guided by our ancestral voices
Let flags of black and red unfurl
Echoes of distant laughter
Confederation of the dispossessed
Fearing neither God nor master
Brother of this wretched man
I heed your call - never giving in
Watching from his perch bemused
I see him now
The spectre of the Raven King
Forever in this moment
Rejecting those who would control us
Touched by a common genius
All bound by fate and common purpose
Brother of this wretched man
I heed your call - never giving in
Watching from his perch bemused
I see him now
The spectre of the Raven King
All our lives transformed
Touched forever more
All connected
All as one
Spirit of resistance haunt us once again
Your restless call for this defiance
Let sorrow turn to anger in your name
Carpe nocturna, seize the night now
Brother of this wretched man
I heed your call - never giving in
Watching from his perch bemused
I see him now
The spectre of the Raven KingEmbed
