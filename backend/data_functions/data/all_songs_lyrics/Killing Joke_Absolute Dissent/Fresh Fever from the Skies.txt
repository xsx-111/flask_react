Fresh Fever from the Skies LyricsMother, what's that light
Shining in the night?
I can't get to sleep - I'm afraid
Just above the snow there's a pale glow
Line of sight obsured - there is fear
Another shock, a firework?
Fresh fever from the skies
Markets crashing down
Nothing more than sand
Sky cracks open and I'm afraid
Change this if you can
Judgement Day at hand
When it all comes down - I'm afraid
Another shock, a firework?
Fresh fever from the skies1Embed
