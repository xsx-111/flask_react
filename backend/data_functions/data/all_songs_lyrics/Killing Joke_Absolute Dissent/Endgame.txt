Endgame LyricsWestern-sponsored civil wars, famine and disorder
Consolidate all currencies, erode all national borders
Mass migrations, demonstrations, voices getting louder
World Trade Center seven wasn't hit but turned to powder
Sit back, enjoy
A three-dimensional screening
Of the end of the world
Baxter's caught out sending spores
Vaccinations for the poor
Shock by shock - We're all starting to wake up
Holocaust begin to roar
Be prepared for martial law
Shock by shock - we're all starting to wake up
Endgame!
Institutions, corporations, a silent hand endorses
Measuring and quantifying all the earth's resources
Satellite technology maps all the water sources
Every acre of arable land protected by private forces
Sit back, enjoy
A three-dimensional screening
Of the end of the world
Baxter's caught out sending spores
Vaccinations for the poor
Shock by shock - We're all starting to wake up
Holocaust begin to roar
Be prepared for martial law
Shock by shock - we're all starting to wake up
Endgame!
Correlate with population, analyse the data
Everybody's looking inside humanity's empty larder
Diversion of the rivers just to water slave plantations
Inmates who were citizens from once-proud sovereign nations
Sit back, enjoy
A three-dimensional screening
Of the end of the world
Baxter's caught out sending spores
Vaccinations for the poor
Shock by shock - We're all starting to wake up
Holocaust begin to roar
Be prepared for martial law
Shock by shock - we're all starting to wake up
Endgame!
