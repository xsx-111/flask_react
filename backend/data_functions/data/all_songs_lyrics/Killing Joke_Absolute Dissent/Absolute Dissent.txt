Absolute Dissent LyricsAbsolute dissent
I won't relent
I oppose poison water
I reject poison air
I expose poison bodies
I refuse complicity
I reject this prison planet
I reject and resent
Absolute dissent
I won't relent
I abhor space weaponization - genocidal plans
From Jeckle Island to Chemtrails
Unelected control
I reject this poison planet
I reject and resent
Absolute dissent
I won't relent
Brainwashed masses fit for fodder
Useless eaters - condemn
Eradicate the worthless breeders
I oppose, resist, foment
I reject this poison planet
I reject and resent
Absolute dissent
I won't relentEmbed
