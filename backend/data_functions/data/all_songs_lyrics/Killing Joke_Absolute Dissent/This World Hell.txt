This World Hell LyricsEverybody's keeping quiet
Why has it come to this?
They're using food as a weapon
Black blood, rage in the streets
This world hell. Die, long pig!
The iron hand of man is rising
And a concrete fist is calling
And an evil moon is rising
I am choking with disgust
This world hell. Die, long pig!
Draw them in with words of honey
No more pain of debts
Let us all return to nature
And we'll share out all the spoils
This world hell. Die, long pig!
And you'll never ever get to see heaven...Embed
