The Great Cull LyricsThomas Malthus Eugenics are alive and kicking
Nutrients and vitamins extract from edible goods
Legislate, sick populations - a higher rate of mortality
Food code (as it's known) Codex Alimentarius
Thin the herd, thin the herd, the great cull is coming down...
Develop virus market cure - exploit the panic
Contaminate by guile and stealth - a quick strum of the harp
Depopulate initiate - pharmaceutical companies
All fall down, all fall down, Codex Alimentarius
Thin the herd, thin the herd, the great cull is coming down...
Most of us must die...
Instigate wars in population density centres
Maintain population below 500 million
Immunise, irradiate, deregulate all toxins
Monsanto feed, Monsanto seed - all the bees are dying
Depopulation in every nation, follow the food code
All fall down, all fall down, Codex Alimentarius
Thin the herd, thin the herd, the great cull is coming down...1Embed
