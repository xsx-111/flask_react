Honour the Fire LyricsJust for this moment
The glorious now
Just to feel freedom
Just for the sounds
Shoulder to shoulder
Until the end
Constant companion
Eternal Friend
And the fire that drives us overcomes all pain
And all of our struggles never been in vain
As we get older - we cry, just one more sunset
One more blue sky
Just to hear laughter
Just one more sigh
One perfect gig, please
Before I die
And the fire that drives us overcomes all pain
And all of our struggles never been in vain
Spark of life, eternal spring - everlasting flame
Gain to lose, lose to gain - utterly enflamed
Marching into the mire -
Together we will honour the fire...
Just one more winter
Geneva snow
Just one more Christmas
Before I go
Just one more smile
Just one more laugh
Beloved mother
Guiding my path
And the fire that drives us overcomes all pain
And all of our struggles never been in vain
Spark of life eternal spring - everlasting flame
Gain to lose, lose to gain - utterly enflamed
Marching into the mire -
Together we will honour the fire...
Spark of life - eternal springEmbed
