In Excelsis LyricsLiberty is ours to protect
The glorious pursuit of happiness
The rights of free speech by consent
The right to express discontent
The glory of freedom, simple liberties
In excelsis
The rights of man to eat and drink and breathe
In excelsis
The glory of freedom
The glory of freedom
In excelsis

The glorious pursuit of happiness

Liberty our common goal
Smash the cabals that control
This world is ours
We won't be sold
No profit, interest or loans
The glory of freedom, simple liberties
In excelsis
The rights of man to eat and drink and breathe
In excelsis
The glory of freedom
The glory of freedom

The glorious pursuit of happiness

The glorious pursuit of happiness
