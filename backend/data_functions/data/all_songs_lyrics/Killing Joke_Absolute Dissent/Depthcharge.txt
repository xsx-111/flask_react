Depthcharge LyricsIn the ignorance of night
As the owl is taking flight
In the garden of bliss
With the Black Isis
Depthcharge...
Depthcharge, Kali, Kali, Kali
Lying in front of the box
Dead as a rock
The wish-fulfilling tree
At the bottom of the sea
Depthcharge...
Depthcharge, Kali, Kali, Kali
I don't see the stars
Can't touch the grass
I don't feel the tides
Tight as Kali's smile
Depthcharge...
Depthcharge, Kali, Kali, Kali
(No more beautiful, no more terrible)Embed
