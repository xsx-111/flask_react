Here Comes the Singularity LyricsWorld population mass has reached the critical
Humanity shall function as a single cell
Machines design and clone a different race of man
Who is the architect, who is the hidden hand?
Kneel down and freedom's gone
Speak out - something's wrong
So when society breaks down in screaming insanity
And when the sky cracks open
Here comes the singularity
Military industrial complex on the rise
Let new Pearl Harbours take no-one by surprise
One million people marched against a traitor's war
No weapons found and no-one heard their call
Kneel down and freedom's gone
Speak out - something's wrong
So when society breaks down in screaming insanity
And when the sky cracks open
Here comes the singularity
Foundations and shareholders identified on lists
Big corporations dismantled brick by brick
Investment bankers crushed like lilies under feet
Let Baboeuf and Saint-Just pass judgement from the street
Kneel down and freedom's gone
Speak out - something's wrong
So when society breaks down in screaming insanity
And when the sky cracks open
Here comes the singularity
Kneel down and freedom's goneEmbed
