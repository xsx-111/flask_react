Big Train (From Memphis) LyricsWhen I was young, I spent my summer days playin' on the track
The sound of the wheels rollin' on the steel took me out, took me back
CHORUS:
Big Train from Memphis, Big Train from Memphis
Now it's gone gone gone, gone gone gone
Like no one before, he let out a roar, and I just had to tag along
Each night I went to bed with the sound in my head, and the dream was a song
CHORUS
Well I've rode 'em in and back out again - you know what they say about trains;
But I'm tellin' you when that Memphis train came through
This ol' world was not the same
