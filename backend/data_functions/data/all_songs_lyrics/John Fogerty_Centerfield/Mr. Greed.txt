Mr. Greed LyricsMr. Greed, why you got to own everything that you see?
Mr. Greed, why you put a chain on everybody livin' free?
You're hungerin' for his house, you're hungerin' for his wife
And your appetite will never be denied
You're a devil of consumption; I hope you choke, Mr. Greed
CHORUS:
How do you get away with robbin'? Did your mother teach you how?
I hear you got away with murder, did you do your mama proud?
Mr. Greed, why you got to take more than you can ever use?
Bring 'em to their knees; isn't it enough just to win while they lose?
You bring no honor to the game, you feast upon the blood and pain
But the bones you hoard can only bring you shame
There's corruption in your path, be that your epitaph, Mr. Greed
