Zanz Kant Danz (Vanz Kant Danz) Lyrics
Vanz can't dance, but he'll steal your money
Watch him or he'll rob you blind. (X 4)

Out in the street a crowd is gatherin'
Pushed down by the heat of the building, they're wantin' to dance
Makin' their way up the street, a boy with a pig and a radio;
Little Billy can work on the crowd, put 'em into a trance
For the little pig Vanz

You're watchin' 'em dance, not a care in the world;
So Billy and Vanz get busy, they're makin' their move;
The little pig knows what to do, he's silent and quick, just like Oliver Twist;
Before it's over, your pocket is clean
A four-legged thief paid a visit on you
