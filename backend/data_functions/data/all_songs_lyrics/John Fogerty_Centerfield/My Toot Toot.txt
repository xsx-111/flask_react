My Toot Toot LyricsChorus:
Don't mess with my toot toot, don't mess with my toot toot
Well you can have the other woman, but don't mess with my toot toot
She was born in her birth suit, the doctor slap her behind, (slap!)
Say you're gonna to be special, you sweet little toot toot
Well you can look as much, but if you much as touch
You're gonna have yourself a case - I'm gonna break your face!
Chorus
Oh toot, hey!
Whoa, mama was the same way too, all the fellas didn't know what to do
And papa never had a chance, with a sweet little toot toot
She was born in her birth suit, the doctor slap her behind, (slap!)
Said you're gonna to be special, you sweet little toot toot
