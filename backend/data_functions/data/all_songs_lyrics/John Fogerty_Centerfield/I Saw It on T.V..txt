I Saw It on T.V. LyricsThey sent us home to watch the show coming on the little screen
A man named Ike was in the White House big black limousine
There were many shows that followed from hooter to dootyville
Though I saw them all I can't recall which cartoons were real
The coons skin caps, Yankee bats, the Hound Dog man's big start
The A bomb fears, Annette had ears - I lusted in my heart
A young man from Boston said "sail the new frontier"
And we watched the dream dead end in Dallas
They buried innocence that year
Chorus:
I know it's true oh so true cause I saw it on T.V
We gathered round to hear the sound coming on the little screen
The grief had passed, the old men laughed, and all the girls screamed
Cause four guys from England took us all by the hand
It was time to laugh, time to sing, time to join the band
But all too soon, we hit the moon and covered up the sky
They built the bombs and aimed their guns and still i don't know why
The dominoes tumbled and big business roared
Every night at six they showed the pictures and counted up the score
Chorus:
I know it's true oh so true cause I saw it on T.V
The old man rocks among his dreams, a prisoner of the porch
The light he said at the end of the tunnel
Was nothing but a burglar's torch
And them that was caught in the cover are all rich and free
But they chained my mind to an endless tune
When they took my only son from me
Chorus:
I know it's true oh so true cause I saw it on T.V
I know it's true oh so true cause I saw it on T.VEmbed
