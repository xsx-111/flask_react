Searchlight LyricsCHORUS:
Oh the midnight, need a searchlight
Oh the midnight, need a searchlight
I walk along the rocky shore, the place I lost myself;
I search the water, look in the sky, I hear the cries for help
I trace my footsteps down to the sea, but then the path disappears;
Here in the darkness, I'm runnin' blind
Been stumblin' for all of these years
CHORUS
What was the demon that made me run, can I ever hope to understand?
I hear my voice, echoes on the wind; I try to reach out with my hand
Without a light, I might be here forever, lost for all eternity;
There in the darkness, slippin' through my fingers
The face that smiles back is me
CHORUS
