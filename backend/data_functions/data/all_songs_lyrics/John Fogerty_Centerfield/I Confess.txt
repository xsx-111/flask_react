I Confess LyricsI want the world to know (I want the world to know)
I want the world to know (I want the world to know)
Yeah! (yeah!) yeah! (yeah!) yeah! (yeah!)
That I (you!), that I (you!), that iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii! (aaaaaaaaaaah, you!)
I confeh-heh-hess
Mercy, mercy baby! I done you wrong
Had my share of wine, women and song, want you back here in my arms
My days are empty without you baby, wasted time turns into years
My pillow is soakin' wet baby, with all my cryin' tears
Built a home in detroit, cattle in texas
Way up in the san francisco bay
I got apartments in new orleans, skyscrapers in new york
But if you're honest baby, you sound lonely, and I'm alone
Matilda! (I don't believe she hears ya)
Matilda! (ya gotta call a little bit louder)
Matilda! (a just a little bit louder)
Matilda! (lord, a little bit louder)
Matilda! (I believe, she might hear ya now)
Matilda! (just say it again, now)
Matilda! (do it one more time!)
Matilda! (I believe she hears you)
Hey, hey, matilda! (whoa, a little bit louder!)
Matilda! (just a little bit louder now)
Matilda! (I believe she hears you now)
Matilda! (I believe she hears you now)
Matilda! (here she comes! here she comes!)
Matilda! (I believe she heard you now)Embed
