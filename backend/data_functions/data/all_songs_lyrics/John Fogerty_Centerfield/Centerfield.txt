Centerfield Lyrics
Well, beat the drum and hold the phone
The sun came out today
We're born again, there's new grass on the field
A-roundin' third, and headed for home
It's a brown-eyed handsome man
Anyone can understand the way I feel

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, I can be centerfield

Well, I spent some time in the Mudville Nine
Watchin' it from the bench
You know I took some lumps when the Mighty Casey struck out
So say hey, Willie
Tell Ty Cobb and Joe DiMaggio
Don't say it ain't so
You know the time is now

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, I can be centerfield

Yeah! I got it, I got it!

Got a beat-up glove, a homemade bat, and brand-new pair of shoes
You know I think it's time to give this game a ride
Just to hit the ball and touch 'em all
A moment in the sun
(Pop) It's-a gone
And you can tell that one goodbye!

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, yeah, I can be centerfield

Oh, put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Put me in, Coach
I'm ready to play today
Look at me, gotta be centerfield
