Summertearz Lyrics
The coldest wind hit me so hard
I raise my fist, I slip apart
Ohh, ohh

Nothing compares, nothing at all
Just like my tears, I let them fall
Ohh, ohh

It's in my blood, this dizzy vein
It never cared of all my pain
Ohh, ohh

So lead me on into your web
It's just a ride that's in my head
Ohh, ohh

Kind of driven and kind of triggered on
I watch the woods trying to find those inner gods
Hold it back just to try to hold it in
Just like the devil that stayed ready to win
No competition still I'm acting on a race
Watching angels dancing in the slowest of ways
Got to let it go, but I can't
Got to let it go, but I
I, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh

Ohh, ohh2Embed
