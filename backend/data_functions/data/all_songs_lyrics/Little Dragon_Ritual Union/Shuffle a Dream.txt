Shuffle a Dream Lyrics
You cruise around in your deluxe water craft
And play it big in designer shades, acting high class
And the girls that you know all admire that
They want your kids in a row, they'll be lining up fast

To your door, so make a move
Castle in the sky, pick and choose
If you want him, would you share?
Cause that's the deal, girl

Trickling coins making the noise
Follow it blind, follow the signs
Why would you want someone so vain
Stealing your soul, making it rain?

You act supreme as your fortune lit the sky
But it's a shell with a crack, and you're just a plain guy
Play it big 'cause our world made it easy to
I see those shimmering rocks moving closer to you

To your door, so make a move
Castle in the sky, pick and choose
If you want him, girl, could you share?
'Cause that's the deal now, if you dare
Trickling coins making the noise
Follow it blind, follow the signs
Why would you want someone so vain
Stealing your soul, making it rain?
Trickling coins (Trickling coins)
Making the noise (Making the noise)
Follow it blind (Follow it blind)
Follow the signs (Follow the signs)
Why would you want (Why would you want)
Someone so vain (Someone so vain)
Stealing your soul (Stealing your soul)
Making it rain? (Making it rain?)
Trickling coins (Trickling coins) making the noise
Follow it blind, follow the signs5Embed
