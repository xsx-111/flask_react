Crystalfilm Lyrics
Lost my grip and my vision gone dull
I swing my hip like a dancer gone numb
I saw your shadow, saw the skeleton run
Now something’s missing from my memory of you

You shake my world from my ground to my head
I miss the voice that would wake me out of bed
I listen as the walls cave in
I’m hanging on ’cause your memories spin on

Ooh, I lost my grip, I balanced it on a piece of paper
True in one trip, it’s weaving in, and I wait for later
Who is leaning on, leaning in on my yes to be?
Who is sneaking in, is sneaking in on me, on me?

I cut a house in half and turn a frown
Painted walls and letters upside down
I try to hold on, I try to hold on, but you’re gone
Then I try to let go, but your memory’s still on

Ooh, I lost my grip, I balanced it on a piece of paper
True in one trip, it’s weaving in, and I wait for later
Who is leaning on, leaning in on my yes to be?
Who is sneaking in, is sneaking in on my, on me?
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me
On my, on me, on my, on me...6Embed
