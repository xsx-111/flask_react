Little Man Lyrics
You grew high, taller than the middle class
Boy, cash running in your pockets
You skate high, gold on your finger tips
They try to make people nervous

There's something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell my when, tell me why when

Green dollar bills slip your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly

Castle, house, cars and the ladies
Blues, no doubt, got you feeling empty
Your bank's packed to edge, and still you're sad

There's something missing in your smile
Something missing in your soul
Are you suffering the blues?
Tell me why, tell my when, tell me why when
Green dollar bills slip your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantly
Boy, when the plan slipped your hand, little man
Anything you want, it come instantlyEmbed
