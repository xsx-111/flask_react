Nightlight Lyrics
Open the door, there you're standing in a row
Dancing in a twisted blue form of light, turning over
Making a sound, then you're braiding it around
Turning in a twisted blue form of light, moving your shoulders

1, 2, you move, your feet, your shoes
Flying like an arrow in the room

Be my angel, love
Tell me everything we need from above
Be my heroin
Tell them please what we need to never be sin
Be forever sun
Never, never, ever stop everyone
Be my shining light
Lady, I believe you transform the night

You open my mind, got me floating out of time
Dancing in a twisted blue form of light, turning over
Driftin' a sound, got me turnin' it around
Moving in a twisted blue form of life, moving your shoulders
1, 2, you move your feet, your shoes
Flying like an arrow in the room

Be my angel, love
Tell me everything we need from above
Be my heroin
Tell them please what we need to never sin
Be forever sun
Never, never, ever stop everyone
Be my shining light
Lady, I believe you transform the night
Be my angel, love
Tell me everything I need from above
Be my heroin
Tell them please what we need to never be sin
Be forever sun
Never, never, ever stop everyone
Be my shining light
Lady, I believe you transform the nightEmbed
