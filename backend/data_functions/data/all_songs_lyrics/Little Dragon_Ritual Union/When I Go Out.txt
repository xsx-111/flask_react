When I Go Out Lyrics
When I go out
I let my armor fall
And when they shout
I walk through the door
The sea's blooming
I need to be gone

Through the tunnel
Kids are grown, hair's not long
Who took the heat, took the light
From me and my shadow?
Through the tunnel
Kids are grown, hair's not long
Who took the heat, took the light
From me and my shadow?


When I go out
I let my armor fall
And when they shout
I walk through the door
The sea's blooming
I need to be goneEmbed
