Ritual Union Lyrics
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand

Love is sinking in the sand
Petals falling on demand
My feet are running like the wind
I'm sorry, boy, that we sinned
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
I drown my feelings in the sea
They dried out over on the beach

Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand

Mother, tell me how it is
I know you've been through all of this
You ran away so many times
Your kids, your heart, a couple of dimes
Love is not like they say
A lie, that it's hard to make it stay
I drowns my feelings in the sea
They dried out over on the beach
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand
Ritual union's got me in trouble again
I was wondering of a white dress
And the mistress and a spirit holding my hand11Embed
