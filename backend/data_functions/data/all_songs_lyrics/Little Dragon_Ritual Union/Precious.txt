Precious Lyrics
Precious, you know I can't stay
I asked, you never told me
So soon, I take myself back again, again, again
I'm bitter sweet, you know that I can't pretend

Precious, I cannot hold back
I asked, and you put me off track
So soon, I dream myself back again, again, again
I'm bitter sweet, you know that I can't pretend


Precious, you know I can't stay
I asked, you never told me1Embed
