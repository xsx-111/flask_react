Please Turn Lyrics
With your clover, you're picking cherries
Taking pills and running with the steam
Loves all make believe
Swinging branches by your mansion
And by the pool, she's posing leopard skin
Got you dancing in

Please, pull the string now
Turn the winds all round and round
Oh, the diamonds don't lift up
Oh, the color shift and cut

Staring down at wondering faces who want your place
But on the papers, you can shine and fly
Smiling in their eyes
Over land and over space
You take me to that unreal place that I had never known
So oh, don't you cry

Please, pull the string now
Turn the winds all round and round
Oh, the diamonds don't lift up
Oh, the color shift and cut
Please!
Turn!
Oh!
Please!
Turn!
Oh!
Oh!2Embed
