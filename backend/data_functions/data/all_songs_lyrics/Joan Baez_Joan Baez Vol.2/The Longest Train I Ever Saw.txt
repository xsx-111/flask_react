The Longest Train I Ever Saw LyricsThe longest train I ever did see
Hundred coaches long
Only boy I ever loved
Is on that train and gone
On that train and gone
On that train and gone
Only boy I ever loved
Is on that train and gone
Who's gonna shoe your pretty little foot?
Who's gonna glove your hand?
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips
And who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna be your man?
Who's gonna kiss your red ruby lips
And who's gonna be your man?
Papa will shoe my pretty little foot
Mama will glove my hand
Sister will kiss my red ruby lips
And I don't need no man
I don't need no man
I don't need no man
Sister will kiss my red ruby lips
And I don't need no man
Sister will kiss my red ruby lips
And I don't need no manEmbed
