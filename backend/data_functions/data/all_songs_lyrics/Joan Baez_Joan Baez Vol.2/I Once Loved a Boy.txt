I Once Loved a Boy LyricsI once loved a boy and the bold, brown-haired boy
I would come and would go at his request
And this bold, bonny boy was my pride and my joy
And I built him a bower in my breast
And this girl who has taken my bold, bonny love
May she make of it all that she can
For whether he loves me or loves me not
I will walk with my love now and thenEmbed
