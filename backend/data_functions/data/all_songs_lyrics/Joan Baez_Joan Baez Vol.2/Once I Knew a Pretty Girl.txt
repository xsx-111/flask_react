Once I Knew a Pretty Girl LyricsOnce I knew a pretty girl
I loved her as my life
I'd gladly give my heart and hand
To make her my wife
Ooh, to make her my wife
She took me by the hand
She led me to the door
She put her arms around me
Saying, "Please don't come no more"
Ooh, Please, come no more
Well, I'd not been gone
But about six months
When she did complain
And she wrote me a letter
Saying, "please come back again."
Ooh, Please, come again
So I sent her an answer
Just for to let her know
That no young man should venture
Where once he could not go
Ooh, Where once he could not go
So come all you young lovers
Take a warning from me
And never hang your affections
On a green, growing tree
Ooh, on a green, growing tree
For the leaves they will wither
Roots will decay
And the beauty of a young girl
Will soon fade away
Ooh, will soon fade awayEmbed
