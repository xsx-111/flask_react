Old Blue LyricsWell, I had an old dog and his name was Blue
Had an old dog and his name was Blue
Had an old dog and his name was Blue...
Betcha five dollars he's a good dog too...
"Here old Blue"
"Good dog you"
Well, I shouldered my axe and I tooted my horn
Went to find 'possum in the new-grown corn
Old Blue treed and I went to see
Blue had 'possum up a tall oak tree
Mmm, boy I roast'd 'possum, nice and brown
Sweet po-ta-toes, n' all a-round...
And to say "Here old Blue (here-boy)
You can have some too"
Now, Old Blue died and he died so hard
Made a big dent in my back-yard
Dug his grave with a silver spade
Lowered him down with a link of chain
Ev-er-y link I did call his name...
Singing "Hereâ€¦old...Blue-ue...
"Good dog you"
Now, when I get to heaven, first thing I'll do
When I get to heaven, first thing 'awm do
When I get to heaven first thing I'll do
Pull out my horn and call old Blue...
I'll say, "Here Old Blue come-on dog"
"Good dog you."
I'll say, "Here Blue-e"
"I'm a coming there too"
"Down boy... good dog"Embed
