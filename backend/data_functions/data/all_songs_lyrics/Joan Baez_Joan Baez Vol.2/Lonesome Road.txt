Lonesome Road LyricsLook up and down that lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry - my Lord!
Hang down your head and cry
They say all good friends must part sometimes
Why not you and I (my Lord)
Why not you and I
I wish to the Lord that I've never been born
Or died when I was a baby, my Lord!
Or died when I was a baby
I would've not been here eating this cold cold bread
And supping this salty gravy, my Lord!
And supping this salty gravy
I wish to the Lord that I've never seen your face
Heard your lying tongue, my Lord!
Heard your lying tongue
So look up and down that lonesome road
All our friends have gone, my Lord!
And you and I must go
Look up and down that lonesome road
Hang down your head and cry - my Lord!
Hang down your head and cryEmbed
