Pal of Mine LyricsIn the night, while you lay sleeping
Dreaming of your amber skies
Was a poor boy broken hearted
Listening to the winds that sigh
My little darling, oh how, I love you
How I love you, none can tell
In your heart you love another
Little darling, pal of mine
Many a day, with you I've rambled
Happiest hours, with you I've spent
For I had your heart forever
But I find it's only lent
There is just three things I wish for
That's my casket, shroud and grave
When I'm dead, don't weep for me
Just like those lips that you betrayedEmbed
