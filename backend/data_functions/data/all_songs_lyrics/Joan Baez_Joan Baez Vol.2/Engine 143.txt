Engine 143 LyricsSong: Engine 143

Along came the FFV the swiftest on the line
Running o'er the C&O road just twenty minutes behind
Running into Sou'ville headquarters on the line
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind

Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm
Saying my darling son be careful how you run
For many a man has lost his life in trying to make lost time
And if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time

Up the road he darted against the rocks he crashed
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast was smashed
His head lay against the firebox door the flames were rolling high
I'm glad to be born for an engineer on the C&O road to die

The doctor said to Georgie my darling boy lie still
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free
I want to die with the engine I love one hundred and forty three
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave
His face was covered up with blood his eyes they could not see
And the very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee
