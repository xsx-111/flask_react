Line of Best Fit Lyrics
These things take my time and energy
Don't stand too close without apologies
Cutthroat, cut out candid glimpses and
Wind me up, I'm ready

Can't escape this line of best fit
Can't escape this line of best fit

These things take my time and energy
Don't stand too close without apologies
I remember being inside something more than you

Can't escape this line of best fit
Can't escape this line of best fit
Can't escape this line of best fit
Can't escape this line of best fit

I remember being inside something more than youEmbed
