Your Bruise Lyrics
It's a backwards attraction
To your forward eyes
But you're so far-sighted that you can't place trust
In what or who you recognize

We sped the Plymouth 'cross the banks of the Mississippi River
Mary Timony was smaller than a superball
Chitter-chatter all these secrets started giving me the shivers
Plain and simply broken down near Olympia

I think your bruise was understated
Cause you can't feel this anymore
It's getting bluer and you can't keep faking
That you can't feel this anymore

I think your bruise was understated
Cause you can't feel this anymore
It's getting bluer and you can't keep faking
That you can't feel this anymore

I think your bruise was understated
Cause you can't feel this anymore
It's getting bluer and you can't keep faking
That you can't feel this anymoreEmbed
