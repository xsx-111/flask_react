President of What? Lyrics
I saw the scene unfold on a rainy Sunday
Creases indicating
Folds that kept four walls from caving in
I took a little more of what I take for granted
And filled my plate with fear
That gears would turn and wheels would roll away

Something's got to break you down
Something's got to break you down

Entered the scene (I'm told)
On I think it was Monday
You drove straight through and mined that
Quarry for all it could bleed 'til dry
I took a little more 'til I got taken for granted
'Cause beautiful boys gave chase
And when they arch your backbone
It's such a dreadful sight

Something's got to break you down
Something's got to break you down
And I'll react when faces find you
With jealous fits that gag and bind you
'Cause nothing hurts like nothing at all
When imagination takes full control

For years, I've been closely watching parents and children
I've noticed how the success of children later on really starts very early, in the home
All boys and girls are born with their own special talents
These talents have their greatest chance to grow in a friendly, loving home

And I'll react when faces find you
With jealous fits that gag and bind you
'Cause nothing hurts like nothing at all
When imagination takes full control

I saw the scene unfold
I saw the scene unfold
I saw the scene unfold
I saw the scene unfold1Embed
