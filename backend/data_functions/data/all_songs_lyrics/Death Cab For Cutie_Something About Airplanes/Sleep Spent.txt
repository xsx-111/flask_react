Sleep Spent Lyrics
I can't expel the truth
It's much more than I thought I could do
And with time, my worth will stain
And split your heart from my name

So drive away
Your mouth from my ears
And waste a day
So I can think clearly

And what's left to wait for here
As my hands sleep, spent this last year
Choking the bottle's neck
That pulled you from my bed

So drive away
Your mouth from my ears
And waste a day
So I can think clearly
Drive away
Your mouth from my ears
And waste a day
So I can think clearlyEmbed
