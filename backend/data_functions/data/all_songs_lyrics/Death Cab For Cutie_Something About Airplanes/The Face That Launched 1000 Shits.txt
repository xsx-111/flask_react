The Face That Launched 1000 Shits Lyrics
And I'm standing up in my practice room
I'm all alone, the speakers almost blown
On my new Gibson amp
Oh, what the hell

Things are not so different in my vocal master
You're the face that launched one thousand shits
Greeks and Trojans and their thousand shits
The shits lining the shores of Asia Minor
Lining on the shores of Asia Minor
You can tell that I'm not a minor in Asia no more

I'm standing up
This is the face that launched one thousand shits
I'm standing up
This is the face that launched one thousand shits

This is the face that shot
Who never have replaced
Splitting up his kingdom into three separate parts
For his sons and their three separate heartsEmbed
