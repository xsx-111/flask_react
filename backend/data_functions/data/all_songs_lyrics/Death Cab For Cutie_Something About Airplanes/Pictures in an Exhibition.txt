Pictures in an Exhibition Lyrics
I think you caught me on the down-slide, downturn
I was busy writing with a pen and paper thin dream
And all your plastic people with plastic hearts and smiles
They had the worst intentions all along after all, all, all, all

The royal castle holds the melodrama kings and queens
And all their dazzling children, they’re so regal, so clean
With pristine fingertips, they wash behind their ears
Then let their hair down ‘til the audiences
Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave

I’m definitely shaking
The silence isn't breaking
Backwashed and stranded memories
Of something I thought could be

I’m definitely shaking
The silence isn't breaking
Backwashed and stranded memories
Of something I thought could be

I’m definitely shaking
I'm definitely shaking
I’m definitely shaking
I'm definitely shakingEmbed
