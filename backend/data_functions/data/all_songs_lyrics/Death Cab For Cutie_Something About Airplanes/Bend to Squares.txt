Bend to Squares LyricsGravitated towards a taste
For foreign films and modern plays
But that machine could only
Bend to squares five to six times
Before your fingers came unwired
Weights down so that you could move forwards
Forwards, so you could move forwards, forwards
Pinch to snub that restless nerve
And knock the wind from one last urge
With two fingers in a rock glass
Time passed and that was that
Quite a slip (a loosened grasp)
Weights down so that you could move forwards
Forwards, so you could move forwards, forwards
What a way to cut lengthwiseEmbed
