Redbone In The City LyricsRedbone in the city
You got no time for love
You got no time for feelings
I don't want uh-uh you
Redbone in the city
You think that you are fine
You think you'll blow my mind
In a certain time

You, you, you're such a whore
Such a stinking whore
Redbone in the city
Redbone in the city
Redbone in the city
I don't want uh-uh you
Redbone in the city
You think that your the one
You think your lots of fun
What a joke uh-uh hahaha...

Redbone in the city...Embed
