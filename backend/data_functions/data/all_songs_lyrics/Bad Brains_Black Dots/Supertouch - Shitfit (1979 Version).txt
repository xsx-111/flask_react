Supertouch / Shitfit (1979 Version) Lyrics
Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
They just don't realize it's just my simple way to get down
I've got that supertouch, chances are I've got too much
I've come to let you see, that you also can be free
It seems that every time we all try to go underground
The stinking troopers them they think that we are fooling around
We have had about enough, now we're gonna get real tough
It happens everyday, that's why we got P.M.A
We got
 we got supertouch
