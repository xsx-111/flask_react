Black Dots LyricsIn the quest for the test to fulfill an achievement
Everybody's only in it for themselves
When the fact of the matter
Is they just don't care
To extend a helping hand to anyone else
So tell me why, did you have to lie
And try to make me all confused about the U. S. A
When the fact of the matter is you just don't care
To comprehend or understand a single word I say
I don't want to have I go against I
I don't want to have I go against I
Oh let me tell you
The same old story, no factual glory
I against I against I against I
And I say I don't like it
And I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I
Almighty watching, almighty watching
I against I against I against I
And I say I don't like it
And I know I don't want it
I against I against I against I
I said who's gonna tell the youth about the drugs
About the drugs, mugs, bugs, and the police thugs
About the rotten stinkin' rackets and the fantasies
Around the nation, around the nations
Oh baby what you gonna do
I tell you the truth is looking straight at you
I got a brass continental with a 300 Z
Two color t. v. s, now a video too
I got a rest home in Jamaica for my fantasty
For my family
Around the nations
What you gonna do...Embed
