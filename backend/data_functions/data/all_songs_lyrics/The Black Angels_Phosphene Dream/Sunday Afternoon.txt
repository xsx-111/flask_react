Sunday Afternoon LyricsCome on, over here
It's all right, over here
In the silent, empty places
It's shining, in the shadows
It's all right, over here
It's OK, over here
Up in my tree, where you can see
Crystal visions, on a Sunday
You know that you don't even know
(Yeah yeah yeah)
You think just like they told you to
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Look within you for the Kingdom
Then you'll see, you can see
Come on, over here
It's all right, over here
In the middle, of the daytime
Fell the colours, pull from inside
And come on, over here
It's all right, over here
With your new eyes, turn on your light
Let your love glow, leave your Ego
You know that you've just got to go
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You were blind, trapped inside their sty
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But now you see that you know nothing
So just go and let it showEmbed
