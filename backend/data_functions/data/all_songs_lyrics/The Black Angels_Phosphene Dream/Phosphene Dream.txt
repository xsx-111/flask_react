Phosphene Dream LyricsThe sky is blue and you are too
I feel like running
Your eyes are red and mine are too
I feel like laughing
The wind said nothing, nothing at all
It all meant someone was gonna fall
In the middle of summer
No one haunts me like you do
Mom and Dad look old again
Where am I heading?
My two sisters miss me yes
Without me knowing
It all meant something
Something to us all
The wind said nothing
Nothing at all
In the middle of winter
No one haunts me like you do
In the middle of winter
No one haunts me like you
Our president then was dead to us
Hallelujah
He takes his pills so he can kill
Praise the Bible
I need no pills to kill
Hallelujah
I need no pills to kill
Raise the rifle
Oh, the Phosphene Dream
The Phosphene Dream
Oh, the phosphene
The Phosphene Dream
Oh, the Phosphene Dream
The Phosphene Dream
Oh, the Phosphene Dream
