Bad Vibrations Lyrics
Can you tell a wish from a spell?
A hug from a lie?
They both make you feel so gone
We warned you from harm again
You're beating hearts again

We made love in June
I heard it from you
You were my best friend
You used my name

Hit hard with harm
She loves to off you then yawn
Never disarm, you know she loves to be drawn
You're leaching hard friend
I'm feeling down again

We made love with few
I took it from you
You were my worst friend
I felt that way
Braiding her hair
You can tell her from here
Drink her last tear
Yeah, you die for your dear
Bad vibes around her
She's eating hearts again

We made love in June
I heard it from you
You were my best friend
You used my name
