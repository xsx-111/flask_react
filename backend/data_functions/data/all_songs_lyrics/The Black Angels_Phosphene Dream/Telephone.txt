Telephone LyricsYou never call my name on the telephone
You never call my name on the telephone
I just sit and cry by the telephone
I try and call your phone, but you're never home
I try and call your phone, but you're never home
You watch me sit outside
You watch me wait and try
And much to my surprise
I caught you on the number 9
You never called my name on the telephone
You never call my name (you never call my name)
On the telephone (you never call my name)
You never call my name (you never call my name)
On the telephone (you never call my name)
You make me sick inside (you never call my name)
You make me wanna die (you never call my name)Embed
