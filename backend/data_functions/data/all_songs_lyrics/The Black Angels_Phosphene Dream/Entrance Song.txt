Entrance Song Lyrics
Rolling fast down I-35
Supersonic overdrive
Rolling fast down I-35
Thru the day and past the night
Rolling fast down I-45
I get ahead, goin' 109
Rolling fast down I-45
Bending time, feeling fine

Entrance Song
Entrance Song

Rolling fast down 75
Empty road, moonlit sky
Rolling fast down 75
Cutting through like a knife
Rolling fast down I-35
Polarized into the light
Rolling fast down I-35
Insterstellar hyperdrive
