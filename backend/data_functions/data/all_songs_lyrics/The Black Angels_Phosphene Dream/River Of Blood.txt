River Of Blood LyricsTrail away, an endless day
It happens once in your life
To be enthroned, in your home
Well, meet me by the drum
Amen
(River of blood, river of blood)
(River of blood, river of love)
Wreckin' days, you're flawless in ways
We break for the countryside
The rebels were all shocked to find
No food or guns in those mines
You're sitting ducks (river of blood)
On this river of blood
On this river of
Safe to stay, streams of red and grey
It happens once in a while
A freedom chase, right next to me
You've brought them their last wife
But, it's not enough (river of blood)
On this river of blood
On this river of
On this river of
I hear footsteps coming near us
They're getting louder, I am frightened
This is it yeah, we are ready
Superkilling rings headed for me
You're too damn human darlin'
New voices spinning in circles
I'll do what they tell me
If they get me
You and I, will never know
Probably be dead by tomorrow
You and I, will never know
You and I, you can know you and I
It wasn't like they told me
(I can't believe we got away)
This isnâ€™t like they told me
In the same room
With the same blood
Speaking freely
Talking has never been so easy
On this river of blood
On this river of
On this river ofEmbed
