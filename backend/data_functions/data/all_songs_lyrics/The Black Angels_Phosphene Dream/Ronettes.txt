Ronettes LyricsSee the light inside of your cage
Feel the power as you try to escape
Feel feed light, you stay away
Similar eyes, movement and shape
It taste like honey
It feels so good to me
It feels so to me
Then came and she brought her new dimension
Control free, entire as she sings
It sounds like empty
It feels so good to me
Feels so emptyEmbed
