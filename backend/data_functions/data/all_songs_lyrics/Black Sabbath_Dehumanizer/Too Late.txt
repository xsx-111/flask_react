Too Late LyricsSoon it's never more
When you've got to pay for promises
Made in the night
Call the magic one
And with the magic comes forever
Chained to the flame
It's too late
Too late for tears
Too late, no-one hears you
Do you feel the touch of evil?
It's too late
To wish and make it so
To feel the power growing stronger
Blessed by the dark
And when the candle fades
You can say it was a joke you played
So you must let me go, no
It's too late, you've said the word
Too late, something heard you
Too late, now the race is on
And you've run out of road
Too late for tears
Too late and no-one hears you
Can you feel the touch of evil?
It's too late
Save me
I believe in your name
I've fallen down
But now I've found nobody to take the blame
Misery
Come to drag me away
When the hunter cries, no alibis
Get ready for judgement day
As the candle fades
You can say it was a game you made
So you must let me go, let me go
It's too late, you've said the word
Too late, something heard you
Too late, the spell is gone
And this time you're the fool
It's too late for tears
Too late, no-one hears you
Welcome to forever
Welcome, it's too late, too lateEmbed
