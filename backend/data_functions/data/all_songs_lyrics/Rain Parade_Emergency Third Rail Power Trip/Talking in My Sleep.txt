Talking in My Sleep LyricsI know, I'm talking in my sleep
Sleeping in my dreams
Dreaming on my feet
I don't know what it means
There's something in my head
But it don't frighten me
I heard a knocking at the door
I crawled across the floor
And tried to let you in
But you were gone before
I could turn a key
And almost certainly
I find that people leave their homes
To find a place to go
I've seen them on the street
But I don't wanna stop
I thought I couldn't speak
And I wanted to go homeEmbed
