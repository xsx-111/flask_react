Kaleidoscope LyricsLike a kaleidoscope
I turn and I'm turning
What I thought was gone
Is now returning
I wonder if it matters
As the pattern shifts and shatters
Like a kaleidoscope
Revolve and revolving
What I thought was there
Is now dissolving
I wonder if it matters
As the pattern shifts and shatters
Like a kaleidoscope
I turn and I'm turning
What I thought I knew
I'm just now learning
I wonder if it matters
As the pattern shifts and shattersEmbed
