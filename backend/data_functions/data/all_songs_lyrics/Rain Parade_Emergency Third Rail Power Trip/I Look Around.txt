I Look Around LyricsWhen I'm lying down
I look around
I look around
And I see you
I see you
Tell me once again
That you're not proud
That you made me
Cry out loud
Cry out loud
All the things you left
You left behind
I want it back
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Living like you do
On borrowed time
Well, yesterday
Ain't worth a dime
Ain't got the timeEmbed
