Look Both Ways LyricsGreen light, green light, what do you say?
I say go but look both ways
Thank you red light, yellow, green
Now I know what traffic means, oh yeah
Hey hey hey
Chit chat, chit chat, that's the sound
Whenver my little girl's around
Pitter patter, pitter patter, that's my heart
You see my world, she's gonna tear it apart, oh yeah
Hey hey hey
Whoa yeah
Better look both ways
Green light, green light, what do you say?
I say go but look both ways
Thank you red light, yellow, green
Now I know what traffic means, oh yeah
Said hey hey hey
Oh yeah
Better look both ways
Oh yeah
Said hey hey hey
Oh yeah
Better look both waysEmbed
