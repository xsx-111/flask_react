Look at Merri LyricsIt's in her eyes and now you're feeling low
Color voices, 'round your head they go
Fast and merry, faster to the shore
All you want to see is what you know
Crystalline, she sings without a sound
Painted horses whirling upside down
Laughing, crying, dying all alone
All you want to know is what you found
Look at Merri, she goes 'round and round
That's just life
It's down, it's up
It's on its own
But it won't stop for me
Will it stop for you?
I see your name, it floats right past my eyes
But is she selling water-colored lies?
Disappearing teardrops in my hand
And she's trying hard to understand
Look at Merri, she goes 'round and roundEmbed
