The Occasional Flicker LyricsI don't want sympathy, No
Somewhere for these sins to go
Compromise is the devil talking and he spoke to me
He mentioned something of moving in
I conversed once with him and yes
He related to me how necessity is evil's mother
He has no father
Only victims weak or strong
I hope this won't take long
It won't take long
I was right the first time
I'll put it right with thirst now
Well, you might say I'm trying to redeem myself and in a way
I think this is true
I'm just trying to chew off more than those people that bite more than I do
You could say I'm a bitter man
I would agree I think this is true
I will remain so until I know more than those that know more than I do
It kind of reminds me of that burning feeling
I used to get
Yeah?
Kind of reminds me, it's the same kind of feeling
I see
You know that, you know the little problem I used to get
What problem?
You know the problem
Are you still getting trouble with that?
Yeah, not all the time or anything
Like it was?
Yeah, sometimes
Are you sure it's not heartburn?
Heartburn, no it's not a bit like heartburn, it's nothing like that
You know that problem, the one I used to get
Oh yeah
Well I still get trouble
Somethings I won't forget
Nothing big, nothing important
Just a little incident about burning
It's just a little matter of a burning
It's not arson, it's not arson
Nothing to get excited about
It's my own problem I'll deal with it in my own time, alright?
My burning, oh my burning
Like I said, it's my problem I'll deal with it myself
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeahEmbed
