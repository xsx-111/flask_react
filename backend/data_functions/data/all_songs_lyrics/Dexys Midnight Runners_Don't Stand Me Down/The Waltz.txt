The Waltz LyricsDon't stand me down, or around
For I'll never stop saying your name
I was the one who came rushing to see you believed in your strategy
Followed your course
Around this time, yes, I came near to remorse
I never quite did, of course
But then, things were no worse
And you were the one I was waiting to see, believed implicitly
But I never took tea
I was always in doubt
About working it out
Hence my reasons to shout
Were in permanent doubt
It's all changed now
Now, though it seems I am losing
It's not true
And though it seems there's confusion
It's also not true
As if I could not see
Believed implicitly
In the tales of the British democracy
How I swooned to the stories of Royal victories
But the books of history were fairy tale stories
But, never one to doubt
And not first think about
I restrained all my doubt
Now I'm working it out
Your good sister, it seems
Is nowhere to be seen
They don't talk of Kathleen
Things are not how they seem
There's no beauty any more
Now, though it seems I am losing
It's not true
And though it seems there's confusion, it's also not true
You say wait
But some things don't wait any more
Well, I've been to the promised Land
I've been there
I've also been down to the bottom
And looked up from despair
Now, though it seems I am losing
It's not true
Now, though it seems there's confusion it's also not true
Some things won't wait any more
Don't stand me down, or around
For I'll never stop saying your name
Here is a protestEmbed
