I Love You (Listen To This) LyricsI was thinking of a compromise when
I saw the beauty in your eyes
It heightened something in me so I'll say so
You were always near to me
And thoughts of you will stay with me
Until the day I die
You were standing next to me
In '82 and '83
In all that time
I barely proved I loved you
Well there's nothing wrong but the wrong in me
You were everything you were meant to be
Now I just want to say this to you
Listen to this, Iisten to this
I love you, I love you
Did you know that I loved you
From the start
You didn't care about my words
And why should you?
You didn't know that all the time I loved you so
I love you, I love youEmbed
