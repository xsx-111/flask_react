One of Those Things LyricsYou know, recently I was thinking
I was thinking about one thing and the other
And music crossed my mind Yeah? Yeah
It occurred to me to switch on the radio
I wanted to hear some music
So I turned it on, it was Radio One
Sid Jenkins on the air
He had synthesizers and soulful guises
I think you know the type of thing - Sure
It was alright It was OK ?
I'm not lodging any complaints or anything
There was just one problem
What was that?
It all sounded the same
You mean it all sounded similar?
I mean it all sounded the same
Anyway, so I started asking around, you know
I started making a few enquiries
Just putting out a few feelers
Yeah? Yeah
I had a word with a couple of so called socialists on my way
And during the course of our conversation
I put to them a question, I said:
"How do you feel about Ireland?"
Ireland? Yeah, Ireland
That place, it's just across the sea
Oh yeah, I know the place
Well they said:
"We're for Sandinista, Cuba's militia
The PLO, M.P.L.A, Afghanistan and Babylon"
They went on and on and on and on
And I said: "Alright, Alright
But what do you think about Belfast?"
And what did they say?
Well, their replies were various
But they all had one thing m common
And what was that?
They all sounded the same
You mean they sounded alike ?
They all sounded the same
Well, that's about the size of it
What can I tell you? You tell me. I dunno
It's just one of those of things
What you mean one of 'those' things?
Yeah, one of those thingsEmbed
