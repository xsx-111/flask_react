Fats LyricsCheck out Fats
He's a real cool cat
He's got a black and white tux
With lots of class
He says, "I love that jazz, I love that razzmatazz
I love to swing"
"I just go crazy when you give me room
To do my thing"
That's Fats
Well, check out Fats
He's a real cool cat
He's got bright white spats
And sharp dark trilby hat
He's got a chick that's slick
And I like her looks
And I like the way her lipstick
It matches the carnation on his tux
I love his jazz, I love his style
It makes me feel so nice
Oh Fats, won't you play with me a while?
That's Fats
Oh well, Sigmund Freud
He gets very annoyed
He was checking out Fats
And Waller just didn't like that cat
He said, "I don't like his looks
I don't like his fashion"
I love his jazz, I love his style
It makes me feel so nice
Oh Fats, won't you play for me a while?
Not that Fats
He's such a real cool cat
That's Fats
Nobody plays that jazz
Not like Fats
He's such a real cool cat
That's Fats
He's such a real cool cat
That's Fats
He's such a real cool cat
That's FatsEmbed
