Mexican Blood Lyrics
She was a Mexican girl, she had Mexican blood
I seen it the night that she died
She was a Mexican girl, she had Mexican blood
Oh, how she could drive that Mexican boy wild

He's on the run near El Paso
And he'll cross all across America
He's leaving behind old Mexico
And his girl, that pretty Mexican girl
That pretty Mexican girl that died

She had Mexican blood
That pretty little senorita
She had Mexican blood
She had Mexican blood

He was a Mexican boy with a Mexican smile
And he drank a little tequila
He was a Mexican boy in a Mexican town
And, oh, how he loved his young senorita

Now and then he'd cross the Rio Grande
And he'd come back a wanted, hunted man
And his Mexican girl was his Mexican prize
And that girl was his girl, that pretty Mexican girl
That pretty Mexican girl that died
She had Mexican blood
She had Mexican blood

He was a cowboy's boy and a cowboy's son
And on his side he had a gun
He was a cowboy's boy, he was the law
He was out looking for someone

That night he rode into town
The Mexican boy tried to gun him down
That's when his heart broke up inside
'Cause lying on the ground was his girl
His pretty Mexican girl, she died
She had Mexican blood

He loved her
And she loved him
And when he lost her
Oh how it hurt him
I seen it the night she died
He loved her
And she loved him
That's when he lost her
She had Mexican blood

He loved her
And she loved him
And when he lost her
He lost everything1Embed
