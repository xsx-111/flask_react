Renegade Lyrics
He's just a boy that has lost his way
He's a rebel that has fallen down
He's a fool that done blown away
To you and me he's a renegade
He's a clown that we put down
He's a man that doesn't fit
He's a king but not in this town
To you and me he's a renegade
But he is a king when he's on his own
He's got a bike and that's his throne
And when he rides he's like the wind
To you and me he's a renegade


He's just a boy who has lost his sights
He's a stranger, prowls the night
He's a devil, that's right
To you and me he's a renegade


Check it out, check his face
Look at his eyes, they're so sly
I wonder why he cries from the inside
I wonder why he's a renegade
Oh please, I'm on my begged bended knees
Oh please, please heed my call
He's just a boy that has lost his way
He's just a boy, that's all
