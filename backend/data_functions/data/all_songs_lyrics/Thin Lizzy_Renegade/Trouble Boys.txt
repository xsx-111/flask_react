Trouble Boys LyricsThe Trouble Boys came in
I guess they'd been out fighting and a'raving
It wasn't long before they moved in
And picked up the girls that we'd brought to
It closed at ten o'clock I had to move fast
To get my baby back from the Trouble Boys
Twenty-five guys from the east side of the city
Kings of hell-raising in the neigborhood
One of them walked up and started dancing with my baby
Who was crying because I didn't stop him
All I could say honey was "This guy is bigger than the both of us"
Trouble Boys, and the Trouble Boys all around me
No one like getting sand kicked in their face
But I don't know anyone who'd stand face to face with the Trouble Boys
Yes the Trouble Boys
I thought to myself it was time to make a move
I breathed my last sigh and I started to groove with my babe
Who was still dancing with the other guy
By the look in her eye I was a martyr
'Cause no one cuts in on the Trouble Boys
Twenty-five gorillas standing all around
I was shaking like a leaf on an Autumn tree
The leader came up and took me by the hand
He shook it like a brother
He didn't crush it after all
He said, "You're ok, you're the only one who's stood up to the Trouble BoyEmbed
