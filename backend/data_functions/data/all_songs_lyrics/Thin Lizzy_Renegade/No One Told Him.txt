No One Told Him LyricsHey, listen closely
Listen while I tell you why he loves you and what he misses mostly
It's pointless, his pretending
He's got a broken heart, a broken heart that needs mending
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
He's going crazy, he's reckless
Without you, baby, he's helpless
It's deadly how you broke him
He's a fool without you, baby, I'm not joking
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
Now when I'm down
My friends they always come around
And when I'm upset
My friends they help me to forget
But how can he forget?
He hasn't got a friend
'Cause no one told him
You didn't want to see him again
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
Now when I'm down
My friends they always come around
And when I'm upset
My friends they help me to forget
But how can he forget?
He hasn't got a friend
'Cause no one told him
You didn't want to see him again
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
He's all washed up and washed out
Without you, baby, every place he goes he's thrown out
He's turned vicious, he's malicious
Just goes to show you how much he misses, you know what
He wouldn't tell me
You didn't want to see him again
You didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
I couldn't tell him
You didn't want to see him again
I didn't tell him
You didn't want to see him againEmbed
