J.B. Witchdance LyricsIt was about a year ago on a full moon night
I was out walking on the moonshine
Fell in a boneyard in the shadow on the right
I saw naked witches dancing in the moonlight
I couldn't just say no, you see I got no place to go
So I hid behind a tombstone fascinated by this sight
The I heard 'em call my name, JB she called again
Come join the witches dancing in the moonlight
Dancing in the silver glow, you see the wind begin to blow
Young angels knelt before me in the moonlight
The hands that beckoned me now they drew me in to see
I was dancing with the witches in the moonlight
When I was young I didn't know the summer days seemed 25 years long
Now I ain't no wiser but I know that it's a drag to be alone
Watch out
So the moon took control of my eyes and my soul
I'm smiling cause I know for me no bell could ever toll
'Cause I'm dancing with the witches in the moonlight
Watch me dancing with the witches in the moonlight
When I was young I didn't know the summer days seemed 25 years long
Now I ain't no wiser but I know that it's a drag to be aloneEmbed
