She Got Me (When She Got Her Dress on) LyricsShe got me when she got her dress on
She got me when she got her dress on
She got me when she looked fine
When she got her dress on
She got me when she got down
When she got her dress on
She got me when she got her dress on
Got it on
She got me when she got her dress on
She got me when she got her dress on
She got me when she looked fine
And now she gets it all the time
She got me when she got her dress on
She got me when she got her dress on
Got it on yeah
Yeah, get it on, children
Get it on yeah
Get it on, children
Get it on
Yeah yeahEmbed
