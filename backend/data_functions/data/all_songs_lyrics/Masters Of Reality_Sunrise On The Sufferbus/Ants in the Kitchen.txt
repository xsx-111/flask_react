Ants in the Kitchen LyricsThere's ants in the kitchen baby
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen baby
Thought I'd let you know
There's two right there makin' off with the stereo
There's bugs in the compressor honey
That's why the truck won't go
There's bugs in the compressor honey
That's why the truck won't go
Stuck in Indiana with a bug in my banana
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you know
There's ants in the kitchen
Thought I'd let you knowEmbed
