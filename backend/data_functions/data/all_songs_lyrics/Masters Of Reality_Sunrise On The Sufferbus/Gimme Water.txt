Gimme Water LyricsHello baby gimme water
You said you were the farmer's daughter
Wave your wand and give me water
Hello baby give me bread now
I'm hungry and I need be fed now
Wave your wand and give me bread now
All your good is seedless
All your tears are needless
I'll be sitting waiting
While all my hope is fading just as well
Hola corrida dame agua
It's sunrise on the sufferbus
Dig your well and give me
Wave your wand and give me
Dig your well and give me waterEmbed
