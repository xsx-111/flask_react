Rabbit One LyricsYeah I wish I was a bird
Birds can fly
Yeah I wish I was a bird
Birds can fly
I'd be 14 thousand miles away
Before you say goodbye
Yeah I wish I was a rabbit
Rabbits can run
Yeah I wish I was a rabbit
Rabbits can run
I'd be 15 thousand miles away
Before you shoot your gun
Yeah, yeah
Yeah I wish I was a rabbit
Rabbits can run
Yeah I wish I was a rabbit
Rabbits can run
I'd be 15 thousand miles away
Before you shoot your gun
Yeah I wish I was a bird
Birds can fly
Yeah I wish I was a birdEmbed
