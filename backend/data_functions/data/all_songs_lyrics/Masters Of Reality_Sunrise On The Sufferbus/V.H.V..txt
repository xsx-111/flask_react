V.H.V. LyricsGot a mean little kitten
Chasing all the dogs away
Got a mean little kitten
Chasing all the dogs away
People ask me if she bites me
I wouldn't have it any other way
Got a mean little kitten
Growls when you get near
Got a mean little kitten
Growls when you get near
People ask me if she bites me
I tell 'em put your hand right here
Yeah, put your hand right here
Yeah
Got a mean little kitten
Chasing all the dogs away
Got a mean little kitten
Chasing all the dogs away
People ask me if she bites me
We should end the song right hereEmbed
