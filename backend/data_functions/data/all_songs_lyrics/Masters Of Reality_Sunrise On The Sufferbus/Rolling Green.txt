Rolling Green LyricsRolling green
Rolling green
The story of a land the likes you've never seen
Rolling green
Rolling green
The great reforming shadow hanging over me
Silently over me
Like a dream on fire
Around midnight
Like finding life
In your night light
Burning brightly
Rolling green
Rolling green
The great reforming shadow hanging over me
Silently over me
Like a dream on fire
Around midnight
Like finding life
In your night light
Burning brightly
Rolling green
Rolling green
The story of a land the likes you've never seen
Silently
Never seen
Rolling greenEmbed
