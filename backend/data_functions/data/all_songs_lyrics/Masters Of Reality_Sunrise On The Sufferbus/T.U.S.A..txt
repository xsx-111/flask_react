T.U.S.A. LyricsNow this is serious!
One thing in this country that really bothers me
Is the inability of Yanks to make a good cup of tea
Instructions are printed on the teabag
But they either can't read
Or they think it's a gag
I mean, pour boiling water over the tea
How simple and clear can instructions be?
They bring you a cup with a lemon slice
And an unopened tea bag beside it (how nice)
And a pot of water and it may be hot
But boiling it isn't so tea you have not
Why can't we
Get our tea
We need tea
To set us free
It's boiling water that brings out tea's flavor
With a dash of milk you've a real brew to savor
They drink luke warm brown water that looks like gnats pee
And it's got nothing to do with a good cup of tea
Pour boiling water over the tea
How simple and clear can instructions be?
Pour boiling water over the tea
Pour boiling water over the teaEmbed
