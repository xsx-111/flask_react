100 Years (Of Tears on the Wind) LyricsI found my place in bed
Three feet beneath your head
I wanted to stay home
I couldn't think of nothing new
I moved like syrup, slow
I moved I didn't know
I'd took off from my faith
And I couldn't think of nothing new
Boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo
Waiting waiting
I'd been called down
Waiting waiting
Would I rebound
Waiting waiting
I found my place in bed
Three feet beneath your head
I wanted to stay home
And I couldn't think of nothing new
Boo hoo boo hoo boo hoo
Boo hoo boo hooEmbed
