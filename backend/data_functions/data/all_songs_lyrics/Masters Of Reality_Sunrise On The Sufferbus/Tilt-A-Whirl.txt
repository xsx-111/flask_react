Tilt-A-Whirl LyricsLittle child just sitting there
C'mon down to the county fair
Out on the highest peaks
Where we can speak our piece
Up on the ferris wheel
We can make a nice round deal
Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl
C'mon away with me and
Spend another day with me
And we can run around
The kind of place where love is found
It's all for you and me
To burn up in ecstacy
Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl
Hey babe my fire
My heart's on fire
Hey babe my fire
My heart's on fire
Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl
My little girl, my little girl, yeah
Little child just sitting there
C'mon down to the county fair
Out on the highest peaks
Where we can speak our piece
Up on the ferris wheel
We can make a nice round deal
Out on the Tilt-A-Whirl
You will be my little girl
My little girl, little girl, little girlEmbed
