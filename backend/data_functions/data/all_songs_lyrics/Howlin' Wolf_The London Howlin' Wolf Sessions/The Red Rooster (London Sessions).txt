The Red Rooster (London Sessions) Lyrics
Well, I got a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
Well, I've got a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
Keep everything in the barnyard upset in every way

Well, the dogs begin to bark, hound begin to howl
Well, the dogs begin to bark, hound begin to howl
Oh, watch out, strange kin people
The little red rooster's on the prowl


If you see my little red rooster, please drive him home
Well, if you see my little rеd rooster, please drivе him home
There's no peace in the barnyard since the little red rooster been gone

I've got a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
Oh, I've got a little red rooster too lazy to crow 'fore day
Keep everything in the barnyard upset in every wayEmbed
