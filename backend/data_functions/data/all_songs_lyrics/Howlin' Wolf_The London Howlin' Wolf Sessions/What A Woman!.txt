What A Woman! Lyrics
I'm gonna leave you, woman, before I commit a crime
I’m gonna leave you, woman, before I commit a crime
You tried so hard to kill me, woman, it just was not my time

You put poison in my coffee instead of milk or cream
You put poison in my coffee instead of milk or cream
You 'bout the evilest woman that I ever seen

You mixed my drink with a can of Red Devil lye
You mixed my drink with a can of Red Devil lye
Then you sat back and watch me, hoping that I would die

I'm gonna leave you, woman, before I commit a crime
I’m gonna leave you, woman, before I commit a crime
You tried so hard to kill me, woman, it just was not my timeEmbed
