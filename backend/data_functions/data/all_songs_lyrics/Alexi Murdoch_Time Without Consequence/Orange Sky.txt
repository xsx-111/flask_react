Orange Sky Lyrics
Well I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky
Yes, I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky
With my brother standing by
With my brother standing by

I said
Brother, you know, you know
It's a long road we've been walking on
Yes it is,  yes it is, you know it is
Such a long road we've been walking on
Oh, brother, oh, brother

And I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky
With my sister standing by
With my sister standing by

I said
Here is what I know now, sister
Here is what I know now
Goes like this
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
In your love
In your love
Oh, but you know I am so weary
And you know
My heart, my heart's been broken now
Sometimes
Sometimes
My mind is too strong to carry on
Too strong, too strong to carry on

But when I am alone
When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone
When I've lost all care for the things I own
That's when I miss you
That's when I miss you
You who are my home
You who are my home now

And here is what I know now, brother
Here is what I know now, sister
Goes like this
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
In your love
In your love
Your love now
Well, I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky
With my brother and my sister standing by
With my brother and my sister standing by now
With my brother and my sister standing by5Embed
