The Patient Lyrics
A groan of tedium escapes me
Startling the fearful
Is this a test? It has to be
Otherwise, I can't go on
Draining patience, drain vitality
This paranoid, paralyzed vampire act's a little old

But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here
But I'm still right here
Giving blood, keeping faith
And I'm still right here

Wait it out
Gonna wait it out
Wait it out (Be patient)

If there were no rewards to reap
No loving embrace to see me through
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now
Gonna wait it out
If there were no desire to heal
The damaged and broken met along
This tedious path I've chosen here
I certainly would've walked away by now

And I still may
I still may
Be patient
Be patient
Be patient
I must keep reminding myself of this
I must keep reminding myself of this
I must keep reminding myself of this
I must keep reminding myself of this

If there were no rewards to reap
(I must keep reminding myself of this)
No loving embrace to see me through
(I must keep reminding myself of this)
This tedious path I've chosen here
(I must keep reminding myself of this)
I certainly would've walked away
(I must keep reminding myself of this)
By now
And I still may
And I still may
And I still may
And I'm
Gonna wait it out
Gonna wait it out
Wait it out
Gonna wait it out24Embed
