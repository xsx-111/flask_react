The Grudge Lyrics
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen

Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Justify denials and
Grip 'em to the lonesome end
Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise, it all comes down
Terrified of being wrong
Ultimatum prison cell

Saturn ascends
Choose one or ten
Hang on or be
Humbled again
Humbled again

Clutch it like a cornerstone
Otherwise it all comes down
Justify denials and
Grip them to the lonesome end
Saturn ascends
Comes round again
Saturn ascends
The one, the ten
Ignorant to the damage done

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate
Desperate to control all and everything
Unable to forgive the scarlet lettermen

Wear the grudge like a crown
Desperate to control
Unable to forgive and sinking deeper
Defining, confining
Sinking deeper
Controlling, defining
And we're sinking deeper

Saturn comes back around to show you everything
Lets you choose what you will not see and then
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent
Saturn comes back around
Lifts you up like a child
Or drags you down like a stone
To consume you 'til you
Choose to let this go
Choose to let this go

Give away the stone
Let the oceans take and transmutate
This cold and fated anchor
Give away the stone
Let the waters kiss and transmutate
These leaden grudges into gold

Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go, let go
Let go, let go, let go29Embed
