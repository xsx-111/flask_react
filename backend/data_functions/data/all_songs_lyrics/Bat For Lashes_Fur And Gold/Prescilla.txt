Prescilla LyricsThere's a girl that wants to stop
Been thinking about having a couple of kids
Comb a brush around their heads in the morning
To be needed, simply and with meaning
Her name is Karen
Been on the road for so long
She wants to live in a place that has a number and a name
Find love as an anchor before the courage is gone
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, I tell you
To live life outside the whirl
To break the cross that bears her name
She's not your queen anymore (queen of the highway)
Needs something better than running away
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, Prescilla
She really loves him, I tell you
Gone away!
Queen of the Highway
Gone away!
Gone away!
Queen of the Highway
Gone away!Embed
