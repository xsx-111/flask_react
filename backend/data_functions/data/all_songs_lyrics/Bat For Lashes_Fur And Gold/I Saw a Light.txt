I Saw a Light LyricsI saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
Freshly cut lawns
And little children sleepwalking
I saw a light
I saw the light
Shining on a car
And a couple inside
Had committed suicide
Death in your arms
Death in your arms
I saw a light
I saw a light
Coming through the trees
And I packed my things
After I saw the light
I packed my things
The light gave me life
And helped me see more clearly
And the children went to sleep
And the car was towed away
And the leaves were rustling
As the night turned to day
I saw a light
Getting smaller in the distance
And I said, "Goodbye"Embed
