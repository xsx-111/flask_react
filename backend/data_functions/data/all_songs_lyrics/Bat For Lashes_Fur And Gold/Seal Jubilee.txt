Seal Jubilee LyricsThe seals, they cried in jubilee
Sharks, they howled along with me
And birds, they flew into the wind
The whale, he roamed the lonely sea
And I dive into you
I dive into you
And oh this ocean blue
'Cause I dive into you
The lighthouse dog lifted his brow
The crippled trees bent low to growl
And swans, they wrestled with lifetime's grasp
In hopefulness they nestled the past
Teachers and travelers made their mark
They dined and feasted on whale and shark
And so the ocean lost its depths
And boredom rained as the ocean wept
Birds, they raised their young for dead
And ladies used feathery pillows for bed
And black snow came and black snow stayed
And froze the ocean out of love, out of love
I lay quiet, next to you
Transformed a whole, transformed anew
No longer diving into
But lying quiet next to youEmbed
