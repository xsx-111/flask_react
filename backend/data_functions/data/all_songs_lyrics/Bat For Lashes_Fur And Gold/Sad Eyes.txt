Sad Eyes LyricsDon't like the things you don't say
Leaving it for such a long, long time
Why do you show me those sad, sad eyes
Each time you decide to pass on by?
And when you smile
Those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still
Autumn's hue in those sad eyes
Makes me love and love them more
We'll have a bath, I'll make the dinner
And then I'll go away for a long, long time
But still, you've not passed my door
And when you smile
Those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still
I can tell that you're lonely but it seems now
There's nothing you want me to do
So I won't try to take the sadness from those eyes that I love
Leave it open for someone else to
And when you smile
Those sad eyes
Look sadder and sadder still
Trying to hold it together
Keep my love as light as a feather
Sad eyes, baby
It's been such a long time
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
Come and spend the night
Sad eyes, I'm trying to hold it together
Keep my love as light as a feather
Sad eyes, baby
It's been such a long time
Keep my heart breaking in the dark
Come and spend the night
Sad eyes
Sad eyes
Sad eyesEmbed
