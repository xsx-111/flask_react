Tahiti LyricsCommunity saw the best in me
Exchanging the common heart
For the salt in the sea
Children of the Sun on a highway of hope
The beauty of coming together
In sorrow
Tahiti, we don't got no name
Tahiti, we don't got no home
Tahiti, we don't got no money
Tahiti, we don't got no honey
"But we do the dishes and we make the bread"
"We are powdered ashes in the light of the beauty"
He said
Wear those dark glasses to help us see
Hot tears rolling down and our arms are knitted
All around you
Creatures of the night on a highway of hope
The beauty that we'll leave each other
Tomorrow
Tahiti, we don't got no name
Tahiti, we don't got no home
Tahiti, we don't got no money
Tahiti, we don't got no honeyEmbed
