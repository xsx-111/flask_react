Punishing Sun LyricsThe wayward high and the wayward low
Anyway is the only way to go
Relying on eye to eye to know
Depending on what, not who, you know
Shadowing down when its way too hot
Bundle up when its all you got
Under the punishing sun
In the wheel there lies a seed
Will it breed or will it bleed
Under the promising thunder
Candles are melting without being lit
Knocked upside the head without even being hit
The lamp light flickers from a bad wire
The dark is self editing prior to expire
Raising up the stakes and Iâ€™m betting the pot
Seldom are the breaks, incase you forgot
In the wheel there lies a seed
Will it breed or will it bleed
Under the promising thunder
Under the punishing sunEmbed
