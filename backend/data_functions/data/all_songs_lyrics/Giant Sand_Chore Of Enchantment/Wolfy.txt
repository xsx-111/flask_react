Wolfy LyricsThe wolves are all around the door step
Circling like they do
Now is not the time to forget
What there's still time left to do
MmmmMMmmmmm
Hasnt even hit the papers yet
Just speculation and preview
Criticism boings like sonar
Tells you how deep you do
MmmmmMmmmMMMmmm
(Chorus):
All this suction
All this verve
Is just good old fashion
Self destruction and loss of nerve
Avoiding which makes you feel better
Colliding with what you represent
Finally getting around to writing the letter
Can't remember if it ever got sent
(Chorus)
Failing is falling
Is ... entertaining tooEmbed
