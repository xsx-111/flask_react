Satellite LyricsHalf way round the globe
You’re pulling for him
You’re pulling for her
You’re pushing the envelope
You can get Leonard Nimoy
To play the part of Leonard Cohen
Singing the songs you already own
What are you going to do
When you can’t get through
Satellite has had enough of you?
Yeah, you can still throttle
And brake with the best of them
If only in certain time and pendulum
What are you going to say
When a little one gets in your way
And asks the question of the day, "Are you ok?"
Never mind speaking your mind
And shoving it all the way up there
Satellite is just a sad old light
And still ill equipped to careEmbed
