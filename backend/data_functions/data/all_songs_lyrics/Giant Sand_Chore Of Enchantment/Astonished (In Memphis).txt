Astonished (In Memphis) LyricsOut here on the sidewalk
At home in the rain
I count the staining gum spots
If you connect those dots they spell your name
And I stand astonished
Do we remain?
Way out here, even the odd matters
Way out here in the rain
Still at home here in these splatters
Even the rain spits out your name
And I stand astonished
And I remain
You astonish me
Out here on the sidewalk, out here in the rain
I count the staining blood drops from some poor unfortunate
But if you connect those dots
Even they spell your name
I stand astonished. I refrain
I stand astonished. We remainEmbed
