Temptation Of Egg LyricsShape of a woman. Temptation of egg
There in Gitche Gumee, the notion coming to me
In lucky Louisiana, or in lusty Alabama
Shape of a woman. Temptation of Egg
I wake up with something in my eye
I pull out one of your lashes
I like the way you stuck in my eye
I like the way my eye stashes
Shape of a woman. Temptation of eggEmbed
