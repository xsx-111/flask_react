No Reply LyricsSeeing you seeing me
See how we abide
Surviving the emergency
When worlds collide
No reply
See the sky bursting open
See our surprise
Down here in the crowd and hoping
See how it opens our eyes?
Something will open our eyes
Even when the worst is over
And on this you can rely
If I ever ask you over
Just give me no reply
Still seeing eye to eye
