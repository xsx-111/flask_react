Dirty From the Rain LyricsDirty from the rain
Dirty from the ever present
Dirty from iridescent
And the rain
Well I got some friends who say
"Better off to just go away
Then to stick around here and stay
And face the nation"
Dirty from investigation (irrigation)
Theres a momentary sigh from a passerby
Reminds me that I am lying clueless in the realm
More like the stealth, maybe I got my health
And the rain
(Chorus)
Dirty from irrigation (aggravation)
Look up in the sky this night and something just wasn't right
But ain't that the norm?
Peculiar feeling inside like its filling up a whole other form
But ain't that the norm?
(Chorus)
Maybe you should stick around and stay
How hard can it be to face the nation
Being all dirty from misrepresentationEmbed
