Bottom Line Man LyricsSwollen is the dark heart that seldom masters muster
Happy is the hunger that still allows the flight of fluster
Sorry is the soap star that cannot choose her next film…
It’s tragic when the magic is as skinny as film
(Chorus):
That’s the bottom line, man
She’s the bottom line, man
3 cheers for Madame Bottom Line
Staring out the looking glass
Light lends lure the luster
Way out on gray graffiti stone
Kept clean by unknown duster
Never mind those hurry flurries
Or the icing of the air
Keep in touch with your feminine side
In case she loves you there
(Chorus)
When folks fall in love they are delivered to the unknown
Fools that never fall are in love with the safety zone
You can end up all crippled up by the crazy seeds you’ve sown
Therein lies the crux of the sweet flux of such irresistible moan
(Chorus)Embed
