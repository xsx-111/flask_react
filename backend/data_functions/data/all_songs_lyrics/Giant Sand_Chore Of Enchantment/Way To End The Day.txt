Way To End The Day LyricsLast night I got wasted
So I could end the day
Old Joe Pe√±a and I sat there well basted
Till the blur bar faded away
And I could smell the sweet sunshine on my face
Like when I was small
And I could hear the chirping birds singing
While the orange and gold leaves began to fall
When I woke up it was a new morning
I was only sick from the night before
The day attacked me without warning
(Like I was just in its way)
In high isolation
Reinventing the unending day
In high isolationEmbed
