Shiver LyricsC'mon, c'mon
Something's in the water
Besides a moon that dont know when to quit
Spine waits to feel the shiver
Right now deals with a great lack of it
Way up in the high desert
Or down in anywhere france
Trains were built to remedy
Tracks laid out, at least give us half a chance
To deliver
Deliver
Deliver a shiver
Forget age and well like some treasured splendor
With words just so strong and a touch just so tender
Is it better off beyond description?
Left alone in a dark room with a mouth full of prescription
Unable to deliver, unable to understand
The deliver of shiver
So you take your time
And you take your leave
Ready to do without
Ready to recieve
Never mind, gonna find good love down by the river
Might as well find your spine
The shiver
There's something in the water besides a moon that don't know when to quit
C'mon and deliver
C'mon and deliver
The shiverEmbed
