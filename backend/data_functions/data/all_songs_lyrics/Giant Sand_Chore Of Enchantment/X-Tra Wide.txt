X-Tra Wide LyricsUnder foot
Under the car
Under the weather
Wherever you are
You make your way here
With some extra wide turns
Sorry for the way we are
And it is with great human affiliation
It is with great human alienation
It is with great human evacuation
And it is with great human anticipation
Loving the way you are
No mattering which way
This whole wide world
All leathery and fried
And hung out to dry, will turn
Get you some extra wide
Sorry for the way we are
And it is with great human lenience
It is with great human inconvenience
It is with great human deviation
It is with great human OP8 for a headachy nation
It is with great human dichotomy
With any greater human
Beats the heck out of me
Awww you're feeling sorry for the way you are
You can make your way here
With some extra wide turnsEmbed
