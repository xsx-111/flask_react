(Well) Dusted (For the Millenium) LyricsDusted got dumped by what he thought he knew
Now he sits slumped and don't know what to do
Dusted gave away some important peace
Now he sits here completely incomplete
Alone
Alone
Sitting with his skin all outside in
Dusted's home is a dirty street
His time down here is almost complete
He relies on folks that feel
Jesus might return as he
Alone
Alone
Dusted's home is a hamster's wheel
And the hum tells him how he has to feel
He relies on folks that feel
Jesus might return
Jesus might return
Jesus might return
If only a slight return
Might return ? as heEmbed
