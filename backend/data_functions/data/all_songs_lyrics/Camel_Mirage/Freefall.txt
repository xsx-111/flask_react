Freefall Lyrics
I'm in a freefall, like a snowflake falling
Down, down, down, down, down
I close my eyes inside my head I stumble
Helpless to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh yeah

Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire
Flash by as I go
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher
Than I'll ever know
Go, go, go, go, go
Ohhh



I'm in a freefall, like a snowflake falling
Down, down, down, down, down
I close my eyes inside my head I stumble
Helpless to the ground
Down, down, down, down, down
Oh yeah
Smoke rings around me and bright sparks of fire
Flash by as I go
I've got the feeling and it takes me higher
Than I'll ever know
Go, go, go, go, go
OhhhEmbed
