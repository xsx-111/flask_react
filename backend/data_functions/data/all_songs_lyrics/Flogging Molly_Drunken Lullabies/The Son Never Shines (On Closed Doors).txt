The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors) Lyrics
I saw her there fade from afar
Her hair grey charcoal
Takes a drag from her tar
I kissed her a smile
But her blood red shot eye
Said the sun never shines on closed doors

It's been eight long years since I saw
The woman who's labored
Since the day I was born
These wrinkles now face
To that cold dark damp place
Where the sun never shines on closed doors

She said the sun never shines on closed doors
I open to find only hurricanes blow
Take me away, to the green fields of May
Because the sun never shines on closed doors

Death comes like a thief in the night
To steal while you sleep
The soul's flickering light
Well maybe it's then
She said, I'll see you again
Cause the sun never shines on closed doors

And we all go the same way home
Yeah, we all go the same way home2Embed
