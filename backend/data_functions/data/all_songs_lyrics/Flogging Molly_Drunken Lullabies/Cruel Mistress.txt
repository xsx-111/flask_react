Cruel Mistress LyricsNext time out to sea bring enough soil to bury me
For I don't want my final jig in the belly of a squid
Next time out to sea bring enough soil to bury me
For I don't want my final jig in the belly of a squid
Take my trousers take my shirt, just give me that sweet dirt
For the water's cold and grim and I never did learn to swim
No her love never set me free so I set off for the ocean
Now in my dreams she comes to me whispering of peace
But I've known since the day that we sailed for Santiago
Her dry embrace would kiss my face no never, no more
The sea is a cruel mistress
The sea is a cruel mistress
Many moons to the day that I threw her love away
Now every whale spouts "go to hell" as the wind laughs in my face
I've grown harder on the eyes and salty to the taste
My pride has gone with the wake as I wait a cold wet grave
I rose to the smell of a wet desert hell
And I thought to myself, how'd I wind up in this jail
Till a voice called to me from deep within the sea
Dry your eyes, my dear fisherman, your ass belongs to me
The sea is a cruel mistress
The sea is a cruel mistress
The earth will rest my bones
Lord I know, Lord I know
But I'll see you when I get home
From the cold, yeah from the cold
No her love never set me free so I set out for the ocean
Now in my dreams she comes to me whispering of peace
But I've known since the day that we sailed for Santiago
Her dry embrace would kiss my face no never, no more
The sea is a cruel mistress
The sea is a cruel mistress
Next time out to sea bring enough soil to bury me
For I don't want my final jig in the belly of a squid
Next time out to sea bring enough soil to bury me
For in my dreams she comes to me whispering of peace....Embed
