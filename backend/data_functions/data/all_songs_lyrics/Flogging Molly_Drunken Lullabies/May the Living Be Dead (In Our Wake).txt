May the Living Be Dead (In Our Wake) LyricsSaid her name was Marie from the banks of the Lee
With the prettiest eyes my own's ever seen
Her hair like ripples, they danced with the tide
As our hearts washed away to the sea
Was she sent down to me from the heavens above?
Her breath pure as whiskey, my heart fell in love
Now the devil is courting a different tune
And I laugh as these tears wash the rain
Tell me why no one's listening
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake
One cold winter's night behind the clouds stars did hide
And the ghost of our souls thanking Christ we're alive
Our spirits they crackled with lovers' first sight
Till the morning came fresh with a new
Will you dance with me now, heavens child, sang the clown
We've nothing to lose but your wings and my frown
Where over the hills and the valleys will ring
To the sound of our love singing true
Tell me why no one's listening
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wake
But the summer sun is melting now, with the leaves I'll soon be gone
Will you have the strength when the emptiness shadows fall?
Or will your aching heart be ripped apart by the beating from the storm?
Or will howling gales like yesterdays be gone?
Was she sent down to me from the heavens above?
Her breath pure as whiskey, my heart fell in love
Now the devil is courting a different tune
And I laugh as these tears wash the rain
Tell me why no one's listening
Is there nothing at all left to say
In a world so unforgiving
You mean more to me each every day
So may the living be dead in our wakeEmbed
