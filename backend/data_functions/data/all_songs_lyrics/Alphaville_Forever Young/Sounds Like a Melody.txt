Sounds Like a Melody Lyrics
It's a trick of my mind, two faces bathing in the screen light
She's so soft and warm in my arms
I tune it into the scene, my hands are resting on her shoulders
When we're dancing away for a while

Oh, we're moving, we're falling, we step into the fire
By the hour of the wolf in a midnight dream
There's no reason to hurry, just start that brand new story
Set it alight, we're head over heels in love, head over heels

The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a while
The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a while

It's the definite show, our shadows resting in the moonlight
It's so clear and bright in your eyes
It's the touch of your sighs, my lips are resting on your shoulder
When we're moving so soft and slow

We need the ecstasy, the jealousy, the comedy of love
Like the Cary Grants and Kellys once before
Give me more tragedy, more harmony, and fantasy, my dear
And set it alight, just starting that satellite, set it alight
The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a while
The ringing of your laughter, it sounds like a melody
To once forbidden places, we'll go for a, go for a while
