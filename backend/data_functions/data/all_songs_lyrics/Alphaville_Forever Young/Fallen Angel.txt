Fallen Angel LyricsI hear those voices on the radio
I switched it off because she told me so
She's an investigator
She's like an elevator
Nobody told me we'd be all alone
You know
Somewhere my friend he'd left me
In that red light zone
You know
She said: I've seen your deepest secrets, son
They're just as lightning
In the look of your eyes
I said: I want you, baby
I said: I want some more
I said: I never ever felt it like that moment before
She's an assassin
She's melting steel in my heart
But I long for more
She said: I want your body
She said: I want your soul
She said: A fallen angel takes it but she'll never let go
She's an invader
She's from another world
But I beg for more and more
She's raising feelings cutting like a knife
She's pouring fire into my liquid life
There's no escaping from her mysteries
She gives my kisses of the strangest kind
She says: I know you'll like it
So come over here
She says: Just let that rhythm filter
Through your body, dear
And then she...
She always did it and she always will
She'll stay that hunter
'Till the end of time
I said: I want you, baby
I said: I want some more
I said: I never ever felt it like that moment before
She's an assassin
She's melting steel in my heart
But I long for more
She said: I want your body
She said: I want your soul
She said: A fallen angel takes it but she'll never let go
She's an invader
She's from another world
But I beg for more and more
I said: I want you, baby
I said: I want some more
I said: I never ever felt it like that moment before
She's an assassin
She's melting steel in my heart
In my heart...
In my heart!
In my, in my, in my heart...
In my heart...
In my heart...
In my heart...
In my heart...
In my heart...
I said: I want you, baby
In my heart...
Never ever felt it
In my, in my heart...
Like that moment before
In my, in my heart...
She's melting steel in my heart
In my, in my heart...
Like that moment before
In my, in my heart...
In my, in my heart...
Never ever felt it
In my, in my heart...
Like that moment before
She's melting steel in my heart
She's melting steel in my heart1Embed
