Lies LyricsBaby, baby
Mmmh, what do I do?
Playing my tune for you
Playing my tune for you
Just to get you in the mood
Everybody's going to Hollywood
Aah, you're driving me mad
But I'm smiling to the crowd instead
A lot of money is at stake
This is a hit and that's a fake
This is what you mean to me
This is what they all should see
Make a make up in a foolish style
Telling the truth by making a big lie
When I come, I come but nothing's at ease
Breaking up the whole is a modern disease
Maybe you think tomorrow's just a joke
It's a joke after joke, after joke after joke
My love
Everything's an interview
And nothing's really new
And everybody's looking for clues
And you know what to do with a clue
My love
Get ready for the show
They're waiting and they will never go ho
This night is just a go, oh
And it's only for show
Dig that deal and be a millionaire
Drinking cocktails in the stratosphere
Getting jet lagged with my business friends
In these supersonic wonderlands
There's a shadow on the graphic display
First he's smiling then he's fading away
Maybe he thinks tomorrow's just a joke
It's a joke after joke, after joke after joke
My love
Everything's an interview
And nothing's really new
And everybody's looking for clues
And you know what to do with a clue
My love
Get ready for the show
They're waiting and they will never go oh oh oh
This night is just a go oh oh oh
And it's only for show
My love
Everything's an interview
And nothing's really new
And everybody's looking for clues
And you know what to do with a clue
My love
Get ready for the show
They're waiting and they will never go oh oh oh
This night is just a go oh oh oh
And it's only for show
Get ready, get ready, get ready
And it's only for show
Get ready, get ready, get ready
And it's only for show
Get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready
Yeah
Get ready for the show!!Embed
