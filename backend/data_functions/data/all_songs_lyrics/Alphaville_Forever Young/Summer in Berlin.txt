Summer in Berlin LyricsThis day's an invitation
And it's just for you
You've got a reservation
For the 17th of June
Open your eyes
And let the Sun break in for a while
There may be something
That you've never seen inside
Feel how your heart beats like a
Heavy machine
The sound of the traffic is like a
Silent dream
The dust in the park
The exhaust from the cars
Ascends in that heated afternoon
You touch a sweaty body
Summer in Berlin
It's alright (it's alright)
The days feel so tired
From the lead in the air
And the fire in the skies
Life seemed to be a fault of grace
But it's okay
It gave you a kiss
In the middle of the crossroads
Feel how your heart beats like a
Heavy machine
The sound of the traffic is like a
Silent dream
The dust in the park
The exhaust from the cars
Ascends in that heated afternoon
You touch a sweaty body
Summer in Berlin
It's alright (it's alright)
The days feel so tired
From the lead in the air
And the fire in the sky
Life seemed to be a fault of grace
But it's okay
It gave you a kiss
In the middle of the crossroads
Summer in Berlin
Summer in Berlin
It's alright (it's alright)
The heat of the sun
Which is stored in the pavement
Feels so fine
Here stands the innocent
And there it comes oh so wild
That's when you're longing
For a summer by the wall
Summer in Berlin
Summer in Berlin
It's alright (it's alright)
It's a summer in Berlin
The heat of the sun
Which is stored in the pavement
Feels so fine
It's a summer in Berlin
Here stands the innocent
And there it comes oh so wild
It's a summer in Berlin
That's when you're longing
For a summer by the wall
It's a summer by the wallEmbed
