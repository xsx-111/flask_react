In the Mood LyricsHe's in the mood to touch the fire
He's in the mood to touch everything you are
He's in the mood to touch the fire
Touch the fire, touch the fire
Jacky's locked in a silent dream
He's watching movies on the TV-screen
He feels unsteady lights a cigarette
He's getting mellow in his cabinet
In his cabinet
Oh Jacky, when everything goes wrong
Get ready, for you've got to be so strong
It's so supersensual, so sentimental
Dial that cipher in your tears
The number to the golden years
You've got to touch the fire
Wake up, little boy
You've got to play with fire
Wake up
You've got to touch the fire
Wake up, little boy
You've got to play with fire
You've got to play with fire
Jacky hears it, is it her or not?
His eyes are burning
'Cause the brain's too hot
He's sitting calmly on a swivel chair
There's something coming from the upper stairs
From the upper stairs
Oh Jacky, when everything goes wrong
Get ready, for you've got to be so strong
It's so supersensual, so sentimental
Dial that cipher in your tears
The number to the golden years
Oh Jacky, when everything goes wrong
Get ready, for you've got to be, you've got to be so strong
It's so sensual, so sentimental
Dial that cipher in your tears
The number to the golden years
Oo, Jacky
Now listen to me Jacky
You were always so lonesome in that quiet lonely house
High on the hill
Oo, Jacky
Just come
Come and meet me
You know where and we'll take a nice holiday
Back in the old, old days
Oo, Jacky
Of happiness
When everything goes wrong
Get ready, for you've got to be so strong
It's so sensual, so sentimental
Dial that cipher in your tears
Dial that cipher in your tears
In your tears
In your tearsEmbed
