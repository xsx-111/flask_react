Too Much Monkey Business LyricsRunnin' to and fro
Hard workin' at the mail
Never fail with the mails
Still they get my posted bail
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
Someone talkin' to me
Tryin' to run me up a creek
Says you can buy it
C'mon try it
You can pay me next week
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
Blond haired good lookin'
Tryin' to get me hooked
Want me to marry get a home
Settle down write a book oh
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
Workin' in the fillin' station
Too many checks
Check the windows
Check the tires
Check the oil
Goin' again
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
I been to Yokohama
Been fightin' in the war
Army bunk army chow
Army crew army coat
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
Telephone something wrong
Dial gone will mail
Hours to the operator
Tellin' me a tale
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by ten
Too much monkey business
For me to be in by tenEmbed
