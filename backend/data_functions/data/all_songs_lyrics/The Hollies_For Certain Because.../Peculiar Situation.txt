Peculiar Situation LyricsWe take walks in storms on rainy nights
When it's cold I hold you close to me
When we dine you help me choose the wine
It's these things that mean so much to me
Ain't this a peculiar situation
We're lovers but we don't make love
But when these things mean so much to us
Well, that's all right
I don't think your father is too rich
And I know your mother has good taste
And it's not because you're beautiful
When you're busy you find time for me
Ain't this a peculiar situation
We're lovers but we don't make love
But when these things mean so much to us
Well, that's all right
But when these things mean so much to us
Well, that's all right
You do well at things that interest you
When asked out you never turn away
If you're wrong you don't mind saying so
Not too proud to phone me when you're down
Ain't this a peculiar situation
We're lovers but we don't make love
But when these things mean so much to us
Well, that's all right
Ain't this a peculiar situation
Ain't this a peculiar situation
Ain't this a peculiar situationEmbed
