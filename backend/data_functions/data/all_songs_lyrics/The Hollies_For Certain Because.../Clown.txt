Clown LyricsI see a clown painting his face once more
Before the show has started
He paints a smile on his face with his makeup now
Although he's broken hearted
But the rule of the clown is simple
And the show must go on as always
People are there to laugh at him
And he mustn't let them down
He's lost someone dear to him
And he's crying now although he doesn't show it
He gives the show of his life though he's breaking down
Although you'd never know it
But there's something different about his smile
An unfamiliar frown
Yes there's something different about him now
He's painted his smile on upside downEmbed
