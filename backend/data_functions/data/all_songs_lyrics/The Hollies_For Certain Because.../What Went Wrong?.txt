What Went Wrong? LyricsIf you could look my way
You'd know that I exist
And then you'd realise
I'm waiting to be kissed
By you baby
Tell me what went wrong
With our love
Each time that you walk by
I feel my heart would break
And then I think about
The pain I'd have to take
From you baby
Tell me what went wrong
With our love
You'd be the only reason
That I'm leaving town
You'd be the only reason
Why I'd come back
For one more day
Why I'd come back
And maybe stay
If I could find out
What to say to you
Break
You'd be the only reason
That I'm leaving town
You'd be the only reason
Why I'd come back
For one more day
Why I'd come back
And maybe stay
If I could find out
What to say to you
So, I'll just pretend
That you will look my way
And I am hoping
That you'll come to me and say
Tell me baby
Tell me what went wrong
With our love
With our love
With our loveEmbed
