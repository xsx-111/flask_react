Tell Me to My Face LyricsWill you try to justify the meaning
Of the note you sent this evening
To my door, you're not deceiving me
I'd have thought that you'd have known much better
Sending round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much better now
Is it just that you can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place
If at last I think I'm glad to rid myself of you I'm sad
To think about the time I'll have to go
Then I'll turn and walk away so please don't beg for me to stay
Cause I know just what I will say to you
Is it just that you can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my place
Tell me to my face you're leaving now
Tell me to my face you're leaving now
Though you try to justify the meaning
Of the note you sent this evening
To my door, you're not deceiving me
I'd have thought that you'd have known much better
Sending round an unsigned letter
Facing me would be much better now
Is it just that you can't face the future with me
Can't you tell me to my face
You just took the coward's way to say goodbye
How would you feel here in my placeEmbed
