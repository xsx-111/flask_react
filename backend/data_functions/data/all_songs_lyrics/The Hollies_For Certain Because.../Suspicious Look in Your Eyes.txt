Suspicious Look in Your Eyes LyricsYou've got that suspicious look in your eyes
You've got that suspicious look in your eyes
Somehow at times I read your mind
You just float in a cloud above me
You've no control of what you say
And no faith in the things that I do
If I question you
It's not because I'm prying
I give you my best
So why don't you start trying
We used to act and think alike
No regrets after things that we'd done
You're changing all your thoughts of me
You've no right to put me down this way
I believe in you
So it seems worth trying
You sound so sincere
But when I look at you
You've got that suspicious look in your eyes
You've got that suspicious look in your eyes
Break
At times I think it seems so clear
But your eyes plague my mind, it's no use
They pierce, they glare, they seem to stare
If they spoke what a story they'd tell
I believe in you
So it seems worth trying
You sound so sincere
But when I look at you
You've got that suspicious look in your eyes
You've got that suspicious look in your eyes
You've got that suspicious look in your eyes
You've got that suspicious look in your eyesEmbed
