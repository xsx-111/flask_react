Natural LyricsEverything around is natural don't fight it
Don't disagree with this and that, no
Astrology, Evolution, this-and-that-ity
This religion and that, no

And if they were not meant to be
Well don't you think they wouldn't be
And if they were not meant to be
Well don't you think they wouldn't be, oh
Your beliefs, philosophy, don't give us peace
Destruction of our enemy does it make us right
And if you took them apart and destroyed them all now one by one
This still won't make it work, no

And if they were not meant to be
Well don't you think they wouldn't be
And if they were not meant to be
Well don't you think they wouldn't be, oh
Everything we like and don't like is whole and natural
I know iT doesn't feel like it and the world seems wrong
But if we don't like it now then who can we blame
Blame God, be still, find harmony
And if they were not meant to be
Well don't you think they wouldn't be
And if they were not meant to be
Well don't you think they wouldn't be, ohEmbed
