Pearl in the Shell LyricsAnd the fear goes on shadows
And the tear flows on for nothing
And the fear goes on shadows
And the tear flows on for nothing
Under his nose was a dream come true
Been there all the time and he almost knew
And the fear goes on shadows
And the tear flows on for nothing
And the fear goes on shadows
And the tear flows on for nothing
Under his nose was a dream come true
Been there all the time and he almost knew
Thoughts of people in misfortune stopped him doing things well
His duty was to use it - left his pearl in the shellEmbed
