New Song LyricsI've been waiting for so long
To come here now and sing this song
Don't be fooled by what you see
Don't be fooled by what you hear, whoa
This is a song to all of my friends
They take the challenge to their hearts
Challenging preconceived ideas
Saying goodbye to long standing fears
Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chains
Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chains
I don't wanna be hip and cool
I don't wanna play by the rules
Not under the thumb of the cynical few
Or laden down by the doom crew
Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chains
Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chains
I've been waiting for so long
To come here now and sing this song
Don't be fooled by what you see
Don't be fooled by what you hear
This is a song to all of my friends
They take the challenge to their hearts
Challenging preconceived ideas
Saying goodbye to long standing fears
Don't crack up
Bend your brain
See both sides
Throw off your mental chainsEmbed
