Never Over You Lyrics
Each day, I wait
And the pain's always followin' me
Oh I just won't do with someone new
Can't you see?
That the search, no it's not over
Until you're over lyin' next to me
I just won't do until I find a clue
And we're back how we used to be

Oooh, oh even if I wanted to
Oh I never ever could get over you
Oh and now there's nothing left for me to do

Can't erase the look on your face
As it turned and walked away from me
Oh I know I did not do, what you needed me to
And it's haunting me
