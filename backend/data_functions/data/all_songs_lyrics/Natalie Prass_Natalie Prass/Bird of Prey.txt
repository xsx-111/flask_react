Bird of Prey Lyrics
You plucked me from the vine
What a clean detachment
And although it wasn't time
I let it happen

Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
But to run away
You are a bird of prey
With a heart like the night

I had all the room to hide
In deep fields and tall grasses
Your sight, it will not tire
Until you have me
And I love you, oh but no
Oh, you will not let me go
Now the Sun, it sets, I'm on the run
I can't get you away from me

Oh no you, you don't leave me no choice
Oh no you, you don't leave me no choice
Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
But to run away
You are a bird of prey
With a heart like the night
Ooh, and I never said I didn't want you knocking on my door
All this run and chase, it's almost like I planned it
Never have I felt arms this tight on me before
Well, I never said I didn't want you knocking on my door
All this run and chase, it's almost like I planned it
It's out of hand it's, ooh, out of my control

Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
Oh you, you don't leave me no choice
But to run away
You are a bird of prey
With a heart like the night


I never said
I never said I didn't want you
I never said I didn't want you knockin' on my door
I never said
I never said I didn't want you
I never said I didn't want you knockin' on my door6Embed
