Christy LyricsChristy
A name that isn't too short or too sweet
Christy
Why compare my love to yours if we both know he adores you, Christy?
There's a shadow of a smile in your eye, Christy
There's an echo of a kiss stolen from a man who swore I wouldn't have to miss
Oh, Christy

Oh, why does it have to be
That she can take the hand of anyone she meets?
Still, the only one she sees belongs to me
Oh, Christy
Does he?
Slide each of his fingers down your back when he
When he puts a new record on, oh, no, he comes on strong
Oh, Christy
I can tell you anything that he likes, Christy
It's so wrong I'll still be here when all your love for him is gone
Oh, Christy

All his dreams aren't the only ones that you haunt
I never dreamt that this day would ever come
Oh, Christy
Oh, ChristyEmbed
