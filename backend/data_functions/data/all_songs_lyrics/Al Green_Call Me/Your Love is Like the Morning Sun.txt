Your Love is Like the Morning Sun Lyrics
Look at the morning sun, shining so brightly
Love is in the air, I don't care
Look at the smiling faces
Makes me know that no one can take your place
(Your place), your place, (Your place), your place

Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
(Your love, your love, ooh, ooh)

All the skies are gray, now messing up my day
I'd never leave you in this leave, oh no, never, never
Throwing up my hands, not being a man
Don't you know that's not going to pay?
Hey hey

Love is the morning sun, shining so brightly
It's me that's missing your love, now
(Your love, your love)

I'm tired of being alone, bye
Still in love with you, now
Let's stay together, togetherEmbed
