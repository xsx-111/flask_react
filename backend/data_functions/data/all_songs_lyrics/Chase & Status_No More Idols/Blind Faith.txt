Blind Faith Lyrics
Sweet sensation (sensation)

I am a man with a heavy heart
And I dare not turn the pages
Fighting with automatic self destruction
I- It's a blind faith, a cruel waste, one bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind

What is a man now to do with his mind
When it's working overtime?
The best I can do is now dance with the devil
I keep my soul sane
I won't waste this time and space
So I know I need this sweet sensation

Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
I am a man with a heavy heart
I am a man with a heavy heart
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation
Oh

Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind
Sweet sensation
The music that we play will ease your mind

I am a man with a heavy heart
I am a man with a heavy heart
It's a blind faith
A cruel waste
One bitter taste
So I know I need this sweet sensation4Embed
