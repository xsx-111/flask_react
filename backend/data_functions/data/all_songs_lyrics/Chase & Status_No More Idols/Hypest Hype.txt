Every time I go to the rave, everyone knows gonna be at next hype!
Every time I jump on stage, everyone here wants to shout next hype!
When Tempa T's in the rave, it's too much, he's such a next hype!
When I climb on stage, all'a my friends get shout next hype!
If guys step on my creps, I'm bottling man, I'm on a next hype! (Come on!)
Don't start calling the feds, I'll chase man to the yard, next hype!
The peng ting's calling my phone, big man ting, I'm on a next hype!
Now I'm ready for the rave!
