No Problem Lyrics

I move like water, I go with the flow
I go back to old school, I go back to Rome
But this is not history, it's the start of the show
Never worry, that is the way that I roll
I'm a bad man, what is it? Let me say again
You can try copy like a slave to a trend
Nothing they can say and nothing they can do
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you

But it's a problem for you, you, you, you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you
But it's a problem for you, you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you
But it's a problem for you, you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you

I move like water, I go with the flow
I go back to old school, I go back to Rome
But this is not history, it's the start of the show
Never worry, that is the way that I roll
I'm a bad man, what is it? Let me say again
You can try copy like a slave to a trend
Nothing they can say and nothing they can do
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you
But it's a problem for you, you, you, you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you
But it's a problem for you, you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you, you, you, you
But it's a problem for you, you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for you
It's no problem for me, but it's a problem for youEmbed
