Fool Yourself Lyrics

You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long

You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
Wake up in the morning next day and we're gone
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
So long, so long, so long, and we're gone
And we're gone, gone
And we're, and we're, and we're gone
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
Wake up in the morning next day and it's gone
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself, you can only fool yourself
You can only fool yourself for so long

You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
Wake up in the morning next day and it's gone
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
So long, so long, so long, and we're gone
And we're gone, gone
And we're, and we're, and we're gone
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
You can only fool yourself for so long
Wake up in the morning next day and it's goneEmbed
