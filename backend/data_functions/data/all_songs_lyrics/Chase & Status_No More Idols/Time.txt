Time Lyrics
If you can find the time
To give your life to me
I will wait for you
If that's all you need
If you can find the time
If ever you're free
Just drop me a line
And tell me where you'll be

I'll be right here
If you can find the time
Just be sincere
If you can find the time
I'll wait for you
But if you can't find the time
Then cut
Me loose

Cause I don't have the time
And I don't have the patience
What do you take me for?
Why must I wait?
Cause while you decide
I'm stuck here suffocating
Cause if you can't find the time
My bleeding heart won't make it
My bleeding heart won't make it
If you can find the time
To give your life to me
Just drop me a line
And tell me where you'll be

I'll be right here
If you can find the time
Just be sincere

Cause I don't have the time
And I don't have the patience
What do you take me for?
Why must I wait?
Cause while you decide
I'm stuck here suffocating
Cause if you can't find the time
My bleeding heart won't make it
My bleeding heart won't make it
My bleeding heart won't make it

I'll be right here
If you can find the time
Just be sincere
If you can find the time
I, I'll wait for you
But if you can't find the time
Then cut
Me loose
Cause I don't have the time
And I don't have the patience
What do you take me for?
Why must I wait?
Cause while you decide
I'm stuck here suffocating
Cause if you can't find the time
My bleeding heart won't make it
My bleeding heart won't make it

My bleeding heart won't make it
Cause I don't have the time
Cause I don't have the time
My bleeding heart won't make it2Embed
