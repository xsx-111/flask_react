Embrace Lyrics
When the daylight weighs a tonne
And all my friends are gone
There's rust around the things I'd loved
When it's fraying at the seams
Of reality and dreams
All those dreams are quiet and dull

This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run
This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run

Big time breakdown
Look how the stars come out
Big time breakdown
Why didn't you just shout?
I'm lonely
Without looking for a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know
I'm your absent Valentine
And the pigtails in the bride
I'm the steel that carves the toes in your bathtub
I'm the lynch mob in the dark
I'm the silk worm in your heart
Spinning out my perfect circles

This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run
This town's alright
But it's not enough
I'm looking for a quick exit
Like a prisoner on the run

Big time breakdown
Look how the stars come out
Big time breakdown
Why didn't you just shout?
I'm lonely
Without looking for a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know
Calm on the water
Fetch your brother, fetch your daughter
Come, come undone
Fetch your sister, fetch your son

This town's alright (Calm on the water)
But it's not enough (Fetch your brother, fetch your daughter)
I'm looking for a quick exit (Come, come undone)
Like a prisoner on the run (Fetch your sister, fetch your son)
This town's alright (Calm on the water)
But it's not enough (Fetch your brother, fetch your daughter)
I'm looking for a quick exit (Come, come undone)
Like a prisoner on the run (Fetch your sister, fetch your son)

Big time breakdown
Look how the stars come out
Big time breakdown
Why didn't you just shout?
I'm lonely
Without looking for a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know
I'm lonely
Without looking for a place to go
Where everything's an embrace
And everybody wants to know1Embed
