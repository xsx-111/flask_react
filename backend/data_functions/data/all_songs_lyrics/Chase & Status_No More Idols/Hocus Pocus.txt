Hocus Pocus Lyrics
We're not going to stand here and speak
Hocus pocus
Some shazam
Some abracadabra magic
(All right)
Hocus pocus
(All right)
We're not going to stand here and speak
Hocus pocus
Some shazam
Some abracadabra magic
We're not going to stand here and speak
Hocus pocus
Some shazam
Some abracadabra magic
(All right)
Hocus pocus
(All right)
(All right)
We're not going to stand here and speak
Hocus pocus
Some shazam
Some abracadabra magic
We're not going to stand here and speak
Hocus pocus
Abracadabra magic
We're not going to stand here and speak
Hocus pocus
Some shazam
Some abracadabra magicEmbed
