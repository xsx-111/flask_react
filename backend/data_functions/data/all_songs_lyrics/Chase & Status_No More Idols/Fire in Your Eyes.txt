Fire in Your Eyes Lyrics
Fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
Fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again

Always been a warrior
From back when I remember, now we stand together
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever
Always been a warrior
From back when I remember, now we stand together
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever

Always been a warrior
From back when I remember, now we stand together
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever
Always been a warrior
From back when I remember, now we stand together
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever
Fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
Fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
I see fire in your eyes again
Fly away
Fly away

Always been a warrior
From back when I remember, now we stand together
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever
Always been a warrior
From back when I remember, now we stand together
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Wanting this forever
Always been a warrior
Ready here whenever, wanting this foreverEmbed
