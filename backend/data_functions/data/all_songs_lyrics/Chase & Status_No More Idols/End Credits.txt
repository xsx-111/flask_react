End Credits Lyrics
When the blood dries in my veins
And my heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way
To heaven's door

I know when I knock
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rot, just like before
I know when I knock
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rot, just like before

I can feel something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start
Dragging me away from heaven's door
I can feel something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start
Dragging me away from heaven's door

When my mind stops thinking
And my eyes stop blinking, I hope
Somebody's there
When my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing in air
I hope somebody cares
When the blood dries in my veins
And my, heart feels no more pain
I know, I'll be on my way
To heaven's door

I know when I knock
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rot, just like before
I know when I knock
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rot, just like before

I can feel something happening
That I've never felt before
Hopeless dreaming will start
Dragging me away from heaven's door

When my mind stops thinking
And my eyes stop blinking, I hope
Somebody's there
When my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing in air
I hope somebody cares
When my mind stops thinking
And my eyes stop blinking, I know
