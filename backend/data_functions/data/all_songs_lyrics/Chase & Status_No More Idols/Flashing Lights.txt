Flashing Lights LyricsEven if I told you, told you, told you, told you
It's like I see my whole life, whole life, whole life, whole life
Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing right before me
So even if I told you, told you, told you, told you, told you
It's like I see my whole life flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing right before me
So even if I told you I know you won't believe
It's like I see my whole life flashing right before me
It's like I see my whole life, whole life, whole life
It's like I see my whole life, whole life, whole life
So even if I told you, told you, told you, told you, told you
It's like I see my whole life flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Before me
(Me)
So even if I told you, told you, told you
It's like I see my whole life, whole life, whole life
It's like I see my
Flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
Flashing right, flashing right, flashing right
