Midnight Caller Lyrics
I am the midnight caller
Waiting on the line, ooh
I need to be your lover
I need to get into your life, ooh

I'll be yours, forever more
Make me yours, forever more

When the feelings suffocate me and nobody's there
All alone, I turn to you, to you, to you

I am the midnight caller
Are you ready for me now? Ooh
You know I'll let there be no other
And your time's running out

I'll be yours, forever more
Make me yours, forever more

When the feelings suffocate me and nobody's there
All alone, I turn to you, to you, to you
I'll be at the back door waiting
For your love, anticipating
Every step we make together
Oh, our love will be for ever
I'll be at the back door waiting
For your love, anticipating
Every step we make together
Oh, our love will be for ever

I'll be yours, forever more
Make me yours, forever moreEmbed
