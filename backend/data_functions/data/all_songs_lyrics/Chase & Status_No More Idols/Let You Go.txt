Let You Go Lyrics
You say
You can't go on this way
Things have got to change
When you're gone
And each day
A choice gets made
You think it's yours to make
But you're wrong

There's no where to run, no place you can go
No where you can hide where you won't be found
There's no place on Earth where you could lay low
Wherever you are, I will track you down
There's no way in hell I will let you leave
Let you just get up and walk out on me
There's no way on Earth, hell would have to freeze
Over twice before I will let you go
Let you go
I will let you go
There's no way on Earth, hell would have to freeze
More than twice before I will let you go
Let you go
You say
You can't go on this way
Things have got to change
When you're gone
And each day
A choice gets made
You think it's yours to make
But you're wrong

There's no where to run, no place you can go
No where you can hide where you won't be found
There's no place on Earth where you could lay low
Wherever you are, I will track you down
There's no way in hell I will let you leave
Let you just get up and walk out on me
There's no way on Earth, hell would have to freeze
Over twice before I will let you go
There's no way
I will let you go
Let you go
I will let you go
There's no way on Earth, hell would have to freeze
Over twice before I will let you go
Let you go
There's no way
I will let you go1Embed
