Stroker Ace Lyrics
Monsieur Dan, can I come with you
As you both look awfully kind
Sadly he and me are through
Let me tell you what I've got in mind
I'll sing to you my mewing charm
Looks like you both could use a pet
And purr my purr all night long
I think a pussy's your best bet

Stroke that shiny coat
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that, it's a start
Only for the wild at heart
Stroke that shiny coat
Stroking is the antidote
Stroke that shiny coat
Stroking's what it's all about

My tail alone could tell you tales
It's got a life all of its own
Watch it move just like a sail
Sail you to the twilight zone
I love to lap a spot of cream
And I assure you that I'm neat
But you never know what you can expect
When the pussy is in heat

I like to watch, if you don't mind
Every sphinx knows how to pass the time
Your little love nest suits me well
Let me show you how to cast a spell
