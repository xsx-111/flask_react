Pit Stop (Take Me Home) Lyrics
I was driving in my car
Late at night, all alone
Then he stopped me, asked me for a ride
There you were on your own

Now ask me why do I feel my heart's on fire
Ask me, why do I feel this strange desire
Ask me, why do I feel like I'm falling
Falling?

Take me home
What a wonderful way to go
Take me home
What a wonderful way to go

Licking your greasy spoon, jukebox playing my tune
Making out in your room, blowing up your balloon
Playing you like a bassoon, but if I only knew
Where we were driving to, I wouldn't have let you fill my tank
I pulled in, to your truck stop and I'm
Sleeping on the asphalt
Eighteen, wheelin' and siphon gas
And I'm feeling you're my big 10-4
