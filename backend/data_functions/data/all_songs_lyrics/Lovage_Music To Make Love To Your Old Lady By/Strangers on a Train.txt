Strangers on a Train LyricsPardon me, sir, is this seat taken?
I overheard you say, "Not stirred, but shaken."
And I could really throw one back
Such thirst doesn't always permit for tact
So, if you would, sir, pardon me
A stiff one is my specialty
Oh, you're very charming, sir
No, here's to you
I don't want to know your name or what you do
I know, here's to strangers on a train
Strangers on a train
Oh, I think we're going faster
From the mountains to the pasture
Just look at that scenery
It's lovely
It's lovely
I really like to ride the train
Especially when I forget where I'm going
I really like the way it feels
Motion, heavy wheels
As the raging sparks are flying
From the wounded rails still crying
Battling the scenery
It's lovely
It's lovely
It's lovely
It's lovely
I really like to ride the train
Especially when I forget where I'm going
I really like the way it feels
Motion, heavy wheels
Molten metal
Oh, I'd better go
This is my station, you know
I've had a lovely time
Oh no, the pleasure's mine
All mineEmbed
