Archie & Veronica LyricsFlowers on your grave (I never loved you)
Flowers on your grave (I never touched you)
I'll bet that you're there (never knew you cared)
Flowers on your grave
Little buttercups and wild daisies
By the lily pond, remember baby
Blowing dandelions, my only wish was you
Sitting on a cold slab
Feeling my warm stab
You know I'll be missing you
That's why I'm kissing you
Flowers on your grave (I never loved you)
Flowers on your grave (I never touched you)
I paid my respects (too little, too late)
Flowers on your grave
Little buttercups and wild daisies
By the lily pond, remember baby
Blowing dandelions, my only wish was you
I look funny all dressed in black
My wet handkerchief won't bring you back
Now they're lowering you down
You feel me from underground
Flowers on your grave (I never loved you)
Flowers on your grave (I never touched you)
I'll bet that you're there (never knew you cared)
Flowers on your grave
Little buttercups and wild daisies
By the lily pond, remember baby
Blowing dandelions, my only wish was you
You are the lucky one
I hope you've had your fun
For all those nights I set you free
Tonight you'll remember me
Flowers on your grave (I never loved you)
Flowers on your grave (I never touched you)
I paid my respects (too little, too late)
Flowers on your grave
Jealous of the flies and the worms inside me
Jealous of the flies and the worms inside me
Jealous of the flies and the worms inside me
Jealous of the flies and the worms inside meEmbed
