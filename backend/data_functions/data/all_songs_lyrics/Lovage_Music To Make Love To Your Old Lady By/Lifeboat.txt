Lifeboat LyricsAfter all our dreams went down
Sinking 'fore our very eyes
Still echoing the sound
Of the frozen dreadful cries
Witnessed the passing of our only loves
Lose the battle to the sea
Why did you choose my only love?
It could have easily been me
But it seems there was some other plan
One I don't care to understand
In the refuge of these foreign arms
I could find the holy land
How can it be that we defy this tragedy
Find this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we have come together?
Veiled in sorrow, bear a spark?
In our soaking desperation
Truest thing we'd ever known
But to admit that to the world would be blasphemy
Just a shell we had outgrown
How can it be that we defy this tragedy
Find this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together
Veiled in sorrow, bear a spark?
How can it be that we defy this tragedy
Find this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together
Veiled in sorrow, bear a spark?
How can it be that we defy this tragedy
Find this lifeboat in the dark?
Is it wrong that we could come together
Veiled in sorrow, bear a spark?Embed
