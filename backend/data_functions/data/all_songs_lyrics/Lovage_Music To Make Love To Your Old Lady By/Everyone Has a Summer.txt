Everyone Has a Summer LyricsWhen a man needs a woman's love so much
It can be a beautiful love story
But not all love is beautiful
This is the strangest music to make love to
Passion filled rendezvous, heart-wrenching goodbyes
A memory of love
This is the way I've always wanted it to be like
It won't be
Not, not as long as you insist on living in the past
Cause that's pain, you dig
I don't care how cool you are
We got together, word I thought we'd be forever
It takes so many things to make love last
But most of all it takes respect
And I can't live with a man I don't respect
No wonder you're upset, she's lovely
What is love
A darling figure
Rob is quite the man about town
There's one song in particular he used in his romantic, uhm, "campaigns"
The phone bill is going to be enormous, you know that
Everyone has a summer they want to remember
Word I thought we'd be forever
Why'd you have to slip on a heart that's worldwide?Embed
