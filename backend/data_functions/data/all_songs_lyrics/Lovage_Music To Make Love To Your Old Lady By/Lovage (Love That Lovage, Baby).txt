Lovage (Love That Lovage, Baby) LyricsI love that lovage, baby
I love that lovage, baby
Old English lovage alcoholic cordial
Savour the old English cordial, originally distilled
From Devon herbs and spices
Using the secret recipe handed down through generations
And still one of Devon's most popular imbibes
Traditionally drunk two parts lovage to one part brandy
As a soothing winter warmer, but if you want something a little more explicit
We recommend two parts Hennessy to one part lovage
Enjoy, baby
I love that lovage, babyEmbed
