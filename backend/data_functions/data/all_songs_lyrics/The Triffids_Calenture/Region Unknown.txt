Region Unknown LyricsI'm my own worst enemy
I'm even my own prodigal son
I break my own first rules after that
Like the fool that I've become
I know I swore to myself
I would never never never do this again
Oh don't you know I can't swim?
Why do you have to throw me in at the deep end?
I don't love her for the money
I don't love her out of duty
My friend, I don't even care for your opinion
Why don't you leave us alone?
We'll build a world of our own
In a region unknown
Outside the rain turns the streets into rivers
The thought of you swimming
It makes me shiver
Come in inside
Drink this, wrap this around you
You're so lucky that I found you
I don't do it for the money these days
I don't sell to the highest bidder
I don't even care for your friendly advice
Why don't you leave us alone?
We'll build a world of our own
In a region unknown
So why don't you leave us alone?
I've got a friend on the east side of town
She don't wear the right clothes or say the right things
She doesn't look like no movie star
She don't have that red hair dye in her hair
She said 'Boy, you're so silly
Then again you're just a boy
In the end you must understand
You pay for everything you destroy'
I don't love her for the money
I don't love her out of duty
I don't even care for your good advice
Why don't you leave us alone?
We'll build a world of our own
In a region unknown
Why don't you leave us alone?Embed
