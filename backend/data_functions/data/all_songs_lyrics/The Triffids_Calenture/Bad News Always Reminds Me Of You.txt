Bad News Always Reminds Me Of You LyricsThere's a thin line of light
On the outskirts of love
Lights on the bend
Disappearing from view
There's a hard black road
Through the outskirts of love
It carries me back
And it scares me too
Bad news always reminds me of you
Well I recognise these parts
This once was my home
Where I played as a child
Where I first met you
Just to look at it now dear
Sends a chill to my bones
Oh I wish I knew then what I know now to be true
Bad news always reminds me of you
Bad news always reminds me of you
Bad news always reminds me of you
I heard one or two facts
That may once have been true
I heard colourful stories
Pertaining to you
And the corners of your postcard
Show telltale smudges of red
You said you were still in love
That wasn't what the postmark said
With the sky made of rock
My back to the rain
And the lights on the bend
Disappearing from view
I am winding the clock back
And starting again
The outskirts of love fading from view
Bad news always reminds me of you
Well the last time that I saw the lights
Was the last time that I saw you
It had to be me or it had to be you
Bad news always reminds me of youEmbed
