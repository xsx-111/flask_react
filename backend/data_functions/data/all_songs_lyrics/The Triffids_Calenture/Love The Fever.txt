Love The Fever Lyrics(Love the fever)
(Love to love the fever)
I catch lovers like diseases
Oftentimes they keep me in my bed
But given time and love you know the fever eases
I get to thinking with a clearer head
Chorus:
But I love the fever
When I'm coming down with a dose of you
Love to love the fever
When I'm coming down with a dose of you
As I recall it was a grey drizzly April
Afternoon I came down with you
When I drank you from your coffee cup
I should have known then and there that I'd catch your flu
(chorus)
Sometimes I get into town
Look up a bad virus I once had
To see if she can make me ill and dizzy again
Perhaps a little queasy or a little sadEmbed
