Everything You Touch Turns To Time LyricsSaying yes to everything
Turning down nothing
You forget about the joy true love brings
You get to itching for the devil's next love thing
The time has come
To look yourself in the face
When everything around you moves fast
And dissolves into air
What do you care?
You've forgotten the face
And look at the time!
Isn't it time?
Jesus, isn't it high time?
You're afraid of life
You're human, all too human
I can understand that
Honey I couldn't live like that
Everytime you plead to God
You twist yourself a little more inside
You're saying yes to everything
And everything you touch turns to time
Everything you touch turns to time
And the years they roll on by
And the years they roll on by
In the end don't add up to much
In the end don't add up to much
Now the time has come
To look yourself in the face
When everything around you moves fast
And dissolves into air
What do you care
You've forgotten the time
Saying yes to everything
Turning down nothing
You're saying yes to everything
And everything you touch turns to time
You're a king and everything you touch
Turns to time
Everything you touch turns to time
And it's time please gentlemen time
And it's time that you came home
And it's time that you came home
Time on your hands
Time to kill
Time on your hands
Time to kill
Everything you touch just turns to time
Everything you touch just turns to timeEmbed
