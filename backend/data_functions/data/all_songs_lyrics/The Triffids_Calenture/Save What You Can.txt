Save What You Can LyricsWell it doesn't look much like we'll see the new year
Cos all the bright young faces are here
And I can't see us rising to their occasion any more
No, not their Christmas cheer
Time is against us, even love conspires to disgrace us
And with things being what they are ...
Yes and things being what they are
Oh my friend, we used to walk in the flames
Now somebody's taken my arms
The shadows are taller. you're missing your halo
With your face in the half-light you Iook like a stranger
You made me catch my breath just then
You made me catch my breath
Is that you:... is that still you?
If you cannot run, then crawl
If you can leave, then leave it all
If you don't get caught, then steal it all
If you don't get caught. then steal it all
Steal it all
The final time we touch
I watch as you enter the church
You turn and you wave, then you kneel and you pray
And you save of yourself what you can save
If you cannot run, then crawl
If you can leave, then leave it all
If you don't get caught. then steal it all
If you don't get caught. then steal it all
Steal it all
And between ourselves, and the end at hand
Save what you canEmbed
