Baby Can I Walk You Home LyricsYou can run me on a leash
You can make me beg
You can crack the whip on me
I'll roll over and play dead
You can take my self-esteem
The flesh from off of my bones
You can hurt me all you want
But baby, baby, please
Can I just walk you home?
Well, you can throw sand in my face
You can make me kneel
You can rub salt in my wounds
So they may never heal
You can drain the blood from my veins
Leave me lifeless as a stone
You can hang me out in the coldroom
But baby, honey, please
Can I just walk you home?
You can take me for a ride
You can let me down
You can leave me frozen and naked
On the wrong side of town
You can hand me bound and gagged
To those whose violence you condone
You can watch as they mess me up
But baby, honey, please
Can I just walk you home?
You can violate my temples
You can penetrate my wounds
You can scrawl upon my headstone
You can desecrate my tomb
You can overturn my tables
Cast me out to the unknown
You can even shut the city gates
But hey there gorgeous please
Can I...
Can I just walk you home?Embed
