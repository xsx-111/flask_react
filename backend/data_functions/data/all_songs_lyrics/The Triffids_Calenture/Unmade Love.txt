Unmade Love LyricsUnmade love
Placed on probation from your limbs
Separated by a thin white veil of skin
And unmade love
Unmade love
To love you is to live beyond my means
The ghost of our love stalks me nightly
In my dreams
Dreams of unmade love
Let me sleep a little longer
Pray that in the morning I may wake a little stronger
I didn't think it would ever come to this
Your fingers that I counted on and kissed
Your body that once wrapped around me
Like a mist
Unmade love
And I'm not getting any stronger
The spade is getting heavy and the ground is getting harder
Harder than unmade love
Let me sleep a little longer
Pray that in the morning I may wake a little stronger
I didn't think it would ever come to this
Your fingers that I counted on and kissed
Your body that once wrapped around me
Wrapped around me baby like a mist
Oh like a mist
And I'm not getting any stronger
Let me sleep a little longerEmbed
