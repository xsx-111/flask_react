Open For You LyricsNow that you've gone away
So tired and full of pain
Do you remember the times?
Does it ever cross your mind?
How you had no key
But how the door was always open for you
Yes I left the door open for you
So you can walk through & through & through
And it will always be open for you
Well they've dug up the patch
And found the remains
They've taken them all away
The beads end the bones
Hidden beneath that old stone
Where we carved our names on the underside
If you're back this way again
Don't feel any shame
Walk up my front path
There's no disgrace in that
Walk right up to the door
Cos it will always be open for youEmbed
