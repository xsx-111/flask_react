Holy Water LyricsBlue girl
In a summer dress in the greenhouse
Where she overslept dreaming of an ocean
Like a meadow
But wet
Wet with holy water
Blue girl
In the shallows floating completely bare
We fell together 'cause good love is rare
And in the dying light a kerosene sun
Burns warmer than none
Oh, holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water
Sleeplessness
In the deepest water
Her smallest fear becomes a reef of death
And the blue girl's maiden voyage
Is shipwrecked and sunk in holy water
We go swimming in holy water
Floating in holy water
We fell together 'cause good love is rare
Holy water soaked through her hair
Holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water
Blue girl
In a summer dress in the greenhouse
Where she overslept dreaming of an ocean
Like a meadow
But wet
Wet with holy water
We go swimming in holy water
Lying in the shade of the tree of man
We fell together 'cause good love is rare
Holy water soaked through her yellow hair
Holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy water
Holy water, holy waterEmbed
