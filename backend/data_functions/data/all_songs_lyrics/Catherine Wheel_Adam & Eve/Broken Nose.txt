Broken Nose LyricsHey you, you with the broken nose
You've been a fighter for too long
Hey you, stuck in the same old clothes
You've been in Pumas for too long
And all our friends have gone (2x)
Gone somewhere, they don't know where to
Hey you, you with the serpent smile
You've been a creature for too long
Hey you, stuck in that same old style
You've been in fashion for too long
And all our friends have gone (2x)
Gone somewhere, they don't know where to
Hey you, you with the seasoned lips
They've been in service for too long
Hey you, you with the same old line and bullshit
You've been in business for too long
And all our friends have gone (2x)
Gone somewhere, they don't know
Gone somewhere, they don't know where to
Hey you, you with the broken chain
No one gives a crap for you
Hey you, you with your public displays of pain
You've been painful for too long
And all our friends have gone (2x)
Gone somewhere, they don't know
Gone somewhere, they don't know where to
Hey (6x) youEmbed
