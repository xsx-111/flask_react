Satellite LyricsFeeling only left him bleeding
For a whole number of reasons
He never discovered
But soon he would be riding his wave
Coast to coast
All his life was rosy and pink
Fluffy in the middle a constant grin
Anyone would think so
But see that body shaking
See that body racing
Feel that body baking from inside
The boy's a satellite
He won't be home tonight
And we crown ourselves again
There's been no change since you and I were young
When we burned ourselves again
The spaceship days when you and I were young
When you and I were young
Coast to coast
The scene was for Gene
All his life was mostly blue
And far more dangerous than he ever knew
But I didn't see the need to say so
See that body shaking
See that body racing
Same old painful aching bones inside
The boy's a satellite
He won't be home tonight
And we crown ourselves again
There's been no change since you and I were young
When we burned ourselves again
The spaceship days when you and I were young
When you and I were young
He says he won't bore us anymore
It's the final straw a reason to rejoice
The boy's a satellite
He won't be home tonight
Tonight
And we crown ourselves again
There's been no change since you and I were young
When we burned ourselves again
In spaceship days when you and I were young
When you and I were youngEmbed
