Future Boy LyricsYeah (15x)
You up there on the screen
I’d be your future boy
My big eyed bird in the movies
I’d be your future boy
Cos if that is what you need
A cinematic boy like me
Who’ll come along and set you free
Don’t fear, superboy is here
And it feels good to me
Yeah (10x)
As the wisdom runs
A boy should know his limitations
But I’ve talked myself through less
Can I be your future pest
Cos if that is what you need
A sycophantic boy like me
Who’ll tell you things you really don’t need
Oh joy I’m your boy
And it feels good to me
Don’t fear, superboy is here
And it feels good to meEmbed
