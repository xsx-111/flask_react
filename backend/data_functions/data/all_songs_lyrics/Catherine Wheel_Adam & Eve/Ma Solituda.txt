Ma Solituda LyricsSleep don't weep
Throw your arms together
Slide don't lie
We always stick together
Start the day in a cold December way
Feel what's new
It's December through and through
Ma solituda sinks confusion
Ma solituda sinks confusion
I fell down
Sleep don't weep
Throw your arms together
Slide don't lie
We always stick together
Start the day in a cold December way
End this day in a stream of celebration
Ma solituda sinks confusion
Ma solituda sinks confusion
I fell down
I fell down
December never ends, December
Ma solituda sinks confusion
Ma solituda sinks confusion
Ma solituda sinks confusion
I fell down, I fell downEmbed
