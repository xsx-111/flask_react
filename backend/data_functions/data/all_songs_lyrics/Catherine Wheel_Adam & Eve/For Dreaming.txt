For Dreaming LyricsHere come the good times
I have some good times you know
Bring on the good times
I have some good times you know
All we knew was happiness
All we knew and all we witnessed
It's only there for dreaming
It's only there for dreaming
I won't sentimentalize
The bonus loss of appetite
And skinniness that followed
The new taste of open lips
The last hope in trembling hips
And you swallow
For dreaming, for dreaming
I still can touch the ceiling
With the feeling that we swallowed
For dreaming, for dreaming
I still can touch the screaming heights
I'm pleading, can I follow you home
Bring on the good times
Bring on the good times once more
Cos we love the good times
On the other side of your green door
It's only there for dreaming
Dreaming, dreaming
I knew you'd find your way home
But you know I loved you
For dreaming, for dreaming
For dreaming, for dreaming
I still can touch the ceiling
With the feeling that we swallowed
For dreaming, for dreaming
I still can touch the screaming heights
I'm pleading, can I follow you homeEmbed
