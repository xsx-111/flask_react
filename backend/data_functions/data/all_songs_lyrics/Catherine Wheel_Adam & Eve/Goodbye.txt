Goodbye LyricsSomeone said it's easy
And as I sit here with my cup
Staring at it as if I'm some crazy poet
When I'm not, I'm just a rock n' roll Joe
With tales of woe and tears and fears
It's only love that stops you from walking out the door
Tears fly somewhere close to remorse
And sometimes its easy
To all my friends I love
I still don't find it easy
To all my friends I love
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I've arrived
Sally likes it sideways
Sally oh Sally don't ever change
And please don't think me scary
Cos I'm not, I'm just a rock n' roll Joe
With tales of woe and tears and fears
Its only love that stops you from walking out the door
And tears fly somewhere
Close to remorse
But sometimes it's easy
To all my friends I love
Now I find this easy
To all my friends I love I love I love
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
I finally arrived
And somewhere close to here
GoodbyeEmbed
