Phantom Of The American Mother LyricsWatch this picture blow
It makes you wonder
Bless this broken low
It takes time to explain to you
That underneath your skin is mother dear
And if you paint your face again you'll disappear
How you gonna feel
If superman and sonic youth are fairy tales?
Its time to face the truth
You'll throw your life away
As a woman dressed as baby jane
Like a phantom of the american mother
And it's here again
And it's here like a phantom of the american mother
All that you're concealing are the things that are good in you
And you do
And you're still abandoning the news
Now there's a sinking look in your eyes
Like black holes in the sky
And every time you moved I realized
Everything in you was hypnotized
How you gonna feel
If superman and sonic youth are fairy tales?
Its time to face the truth
You walked the hall of fame
A woman dressed as baby jane
Like a phantom of the american mother
It's here again
And it's here again like a phantom of the american mother
So here it is, you needed proof
There's no rock n' roll parade for you
Its time to face the truth
Like a phantom of the american mother
It's here again
Like a phantom of the american motherEmbed
