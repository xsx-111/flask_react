Delicious LyricsI must have been crazy
I think I was being brave
I think I was Bruce Lee
I might have been Michael Caine
So give me something to cover my eyes
Weakness and distress what am I
"A B C D you're in the belly of me"
You eat, you sleep, you breathe something delicious
You spill, you grip, you squeeze something delicious
You peel, you strip, you bleed something delicious, delicious
I must be confused
Oh its so typical
Some fleshy temptation
And the sweetness only improves
So give me something to cover my eyes
Weakness and distress what am I
"tree to fruit, apple to seed, you are the A in Adam and Eve"
You eat, you sleep, you breathe something delicious
You spill, you grip, you squeeze something delicious
You peel, you strip, you bleed something delicious, delicious
Something delicious
Give all your hope to me
"tree to fruit, apple to seed"
Make all your love to me
You eat, you sleep, you breathe something delicious
You spill, you grip, you squeeze something delicious
You say you think you are something delicious
Something delicious, something delicious
You say you think you hold something delicious
So save some of your hope for me
"was it as good for you as it was for me"
I'm in the belly...Embed
