Here Comes The Fat Controller LyricsDon't you think that it's about now
That you cooled your operations
And be generous somehow
Don't you think the sarcasm's a little hard to stomach
The cynicism's boring
And how do you feel
How do you feel
How do you feel
Here comes the fat controller with his boots off getting colder
I've got no confidence of where he's been
We can make him sing, sing, sing
Don't you wish the hounds would all agree
The animals are restless
And there's still no guarantee
Feeding time is over now the zoo will soon be closing
And the temperature is freezing
How do you feel
How do you feel
Here comes the fat controller with his boots off getting colder
I've got no confidence of where he's been
We can make him sing, sing, sing
Step outside your crazy tree
It's shaking canopy because you're alive
Drag your bad news home
Slip inside your soul
You know, you know you're alive
Sooner than later all will be revealed
You'll be feeling okay
And how do you feel
Oh, you know
How do you feel
How do you feel
How do you feelEmbed
