Loverman Lyrics
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
And he's bucking and braying and pawing at the floor
(How much longer?)
And he's howling with pain and crawling up the wall
(How much longer?)
Oh yeah, there's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
(How much longer?)
He's shouting your name and he's asking for more
(How much longer?)
Give him more, give him more
There's a devil waiting outside your door
(How much longer?)

Loverman! Since the world began
Forever, amen, until the end of time
Take off that dress, I'm coming down
I'm your loverman
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
L is for LOVE, baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY all that you are
E is for loving almost EVERYTHING you do
R is for RAPE me and
M is for MURDER me and
A is for ANSWERING all of my prayers
N is for KNOWING your loverman's going to be the answer to all of yours

Loverman! Till the bitter end
While empires burn down
Forever and ever and ever and ever, amen
Loverman
So help me, baby
So help me
Cause I am what I am what I am
I'll be your loverman!

There's a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer?)
With a trembling heart, he's coming through the door
(How much longer?)
With his straining sex and his jumping paw
(How much longer?)
Oh yeah, there'a a devil crawling along your floor
(How much longer?)
And he's old and he's stupid and he's hungry and he's sore
And he's lame and he's blind and he's dirty and he's poor
(Give him more, give him more, give him more, give him more
Give him more, give him more, give him more, give him more)
(How much longer?)
There's a devil crawling along your floor, oh yeah
(How much longer?)
Loverman! Now here I stand
Forever, amen, cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am
Forgive me, baby, my hands are bound
And I got no choice, no, I got no choice at all

I'll say it again
L is for LOVE, baby, and
O is for O yes I do
V is for VIRTUE, so I ain't gonna hurt you
E is for EVEN if you want me to
R is for RENDER unto me, baby
M is for that which is MINE
A is for ANY old how, darling
N is for ANY old time

I'll be your loverman! I got a masterplan
To take off your dress and be your man
Seize the throne and seize the mantle
Seize the crown, cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am
Your loverman!

There's a devil lying by your side
(How much longer?)
You might think he's asleep, but look at his eyes
(How much longer?)
He wants you, baby, to be his bride
(How much longer?)
There's a devil lying by your side, oh yeah
(How much longer?)
Oh he's a loverman! Oh he's a loverman!
Can you comprehend, 'cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am
What I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
'Cause he's a loverman! A real loverman!
A real loverman! A real loverman!
A loverman, loverman!
A loverman, loverman!
'Cause I am what I am, what I am, what I am, what I am
What I am, what I am, what I am5Embed
