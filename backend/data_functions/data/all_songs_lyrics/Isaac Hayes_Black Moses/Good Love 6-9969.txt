Good Love 6-9969 LyricsGood Love, 6-9969
Good Love, 6-9969
I'm bonafide, solidified
And qualified to do
Anything your heart can stand
It all depends on you
I've never lost a battle yet
I don't knock on wood
It ain't how good I make it, baby
It's how I make it good
I'm listed in the yellow pages
All around the world
30 years of experience
In loving sweet young girls
Just call Good Love 6-9969
Good Love 6-9969
I'm the king of the woman's world
They tell it from town to town
And when I find that deserving queen
I'm gonna share my crown
But until i meet my match
I'm gonna have my fun
Keep on bussin out now baby
And string it on the one
But if the line is busy, baby
Please, don't get nervous
Just try again and and again and again
Until you get some service
It's Good Love 6-9969
Good Love 6-9969
Good Love
Sweet Love
Good Love
I don't know but I've been told
By a signifying dipper
Sixty four thousand weeping husbands
They call me Ike the Ripper
They say I'm spreading the heartbreak
And all kinds of pain
But all i'm guilty of
Is spreading my love-type thing
If a woman is fine, my brother
It's gonna be a crying shame
I might can't control my head
It's gonna be a riptide thing
If she calls Good Love 6 9 9 6 9
Good Love 6 9 9 6 9
Good Love 6 9 9 6 9Embed
