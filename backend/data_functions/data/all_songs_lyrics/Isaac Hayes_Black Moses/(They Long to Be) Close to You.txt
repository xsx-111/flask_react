(They Long to Be) Close to You LyricsLet me get close to you
Close, let me get close to you
Closer, closer, closer
Close, let me get close to you
Closer, closer, closer
Close, let me get close to you
Closer, closer, closer
Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
So very close to you
Why do stars fall from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
So very close to you
Close, let me get close to you
Closer, closer, closer
Close, let me get close to you
Closer, closer, closer
Close, let me get close to you
Closer, closer, closer
On the day that you were born
(On the day that you were born)
On the day that you were born
The angels got together
They decided, they decided
They decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair
And I see heaven when I look at you
And that is why all the guys in town
Follow you around
Just like me, everybody longs to be
So very close to you, oh yeah
Just like me, everybody longs to be
So very close to you
Stars fall from the sky when you walk by
Just like me, everybody longs to be
So very close to you
Every guy in town
Just like me, everybody longs to be
So very close to you
All the fellas in town follow you around
Just like me, everybody longs to be
So very close to you
Just like me, all the fellas wanna be
So close to you
They wanna be, they wanna be
So very close to you
Just like me, everybody longs to be
So very close to you
All the stars fall from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, all the fellas wanna be
So close to youEmbed
