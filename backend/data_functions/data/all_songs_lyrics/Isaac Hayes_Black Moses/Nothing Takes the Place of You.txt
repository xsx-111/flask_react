Nothing Takes the Place of You LyricsI moved your pictures, from my walls
And I replaced them, both large and small
And each new day, finds me so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you
I read your letters, one by one
And I still love you, when it's all said and done
And oh, my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you
As I, as I write this letter
It's raining, it's raining on my window pane
And, and I feel the need of you
You see, without you, nothing seems the same
So I'll wait, I'll wait until you're home
Again I love you, but right now I'm all alone
And oh my darling, I'm so blue
Because nothing, oh nothing, takes the place of you
Nothing can take the place, of your warm smile
Nothing can take the place, of the look in your eyes
Nothing can take the place, of your soft and tender touch
Nothing can take the place, of you, oh I miss you so much
Nothing can take the place, of your arms around meEmbed
