Part Time Love LyricsYou know I got to find me
People, I got to find me, a part time love
Oh, I need, I need me a part time love
Every time, every time my baby leaves me
You know I need a part time love
The people in the cemetery, they're not all alone
Some turn to dust and some have bone
You know I'd rather be dead, six feet in the grave
Than to live lonely, each and everyday
I need me
I need me a part time love
Every time my woman leaves me
You know I need a part time love
She came home this morning
I asked her where she'd been
She said, "Don't ask me no questions, baby
'Cause I'll be leaving again"
I've got to find me
Don't you see, I've got to find me
A part time love, my baby leaves me
I need a part time love, yes, I do
Oh every time my woman leaves me
Have to suffer the whole time, she's gone
I got to say it again when she leaves me
I suffer every time, she's gone
When she leaves me
I just got to have me a part time love
Is there somebody out there?
Oh I need, I need me a part time love
Can't say it too much
I need, oh, I needEmbed
