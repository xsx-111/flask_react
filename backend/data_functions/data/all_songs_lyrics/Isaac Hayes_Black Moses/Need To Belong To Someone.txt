Need To Belong To Someone LyricsI need to belong to someone
It hurts to be known as no one
Will ever some sweet girl
Bring love into my world
Cause I need to belong to someone
I wanna be kissed and held tight
Want to be missed on a cold lonely night
Somebody hear my plea and call out to me
Cause I need to belong to someone
Sometimes I feel like a motherless child
No one cares for me, I've never known sympathy
I hide my needs from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man
And a man needs to belong to someone
A man hates to be known as no one
Will ever some sweet girl, bring love into my world, because
I need to belong to someone
Oh, I hide my needs, from the world with a smile
But understand, I'm only a man, and a man needs
To belong to someone
A man hates to be known, as no one
Oh send me a girl, to bring love into my world, cause
I need to belong to someone (need to belong) mm (to someone)
I need to be kissed
I need to be held tight
I need to be missed
I need girl to bring love into my worldEmbed
