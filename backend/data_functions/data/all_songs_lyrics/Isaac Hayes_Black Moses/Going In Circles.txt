Going In Circles LyricsI'm an ever rollin' wheel
Without a destination reel
Oh, and I'm an ever spinning top
Whirlin' around till I drop
But what am I to do
My mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to
You got me going in circles baby
Oh...oh...oh...round and round I go
You got me going in circles
Oh...oh...oh...round and round I go
I'm spun out over you
Over you (going in circles), over you (going in circles), over you
Over you (going in circles), over you
I'm a faceless clock
With timeless hopes that never never stop
And when I get that way
My very soul, my soul's at stake
But what am I to do
Woah, my mind, my mind, my mind is in a whirlpool
Give me a little hope
One small thing to cling to
Oh, I'm going in circles
Oh...oh...oh...round and round I go
You got me going in circles, mama
Oh...oh...oh...round and round I go
Strung out over you (Going in circles)
Over you (Going in circles) (x2)
Over you (I need you, baby)
Over you (Going in circles)
(I need you baby)
Strung out over you (Going in circles)
Over you (Going in circles) (x2)
(Spinning, spinning, spinning)
Strung out over you (Going in circles)
Over you (Going in circles)
Strung out over you (Going in circles)
(Spinning, spinning, spinning)
I'm strung out over you (Going in circles)
Over you (Going in circles)
Strung out over you (Going in circles)
I need you baby
(x3)
Over you (Going in circles)
Strung out over you (Going in circles)
Strung out over you (Going in circles)Embed
