Never Gonna Give You Up Lyrics
Ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Lovin' you too long, that's why my love's so strong
Never can get enough, that's why I'll never give you up
Never gonna give you up, ooh-ooh-ooh
Never gonna give you up, no, no, no
Ooh-hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh

Girl, you treat me bad and I know why
Yeah, I've seen you runnin' around with another guy
And you think if you hurt me that I'll go away
I've made it up in my mind that I'm here to stay

So you tell him that I
Never gonna give you up Oh no no
(No matter how you treat me)
Never gonna give you up
I'm never never never
(So don't you think of leavin')
Don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

Take a look
Do you see these tears all in my eyes?
Ain't no use in me lyin' 'cause I, I've been cryin' yeah
You think you're gonna take me and put me on a shelf
Girl, I'd rather die than see you with somebody else
So throw it out of your mind
Never gonna give you up
I'll never leave you
(No matter how you treat me)
Never gonna give you up
Though you grieve me and deceive me, mama yeah
(So don't you think of leavin')
Hey, don't you understand
What you're doing to the man?

My friends all say that I'm your fool, your fool, your fool
And you're using me just like a carpenter uses a tool, yeah
I know their intentions are all very good
Some of them would help me, ah, if they could
But it's no use 'cause I

Never gonna give you up
(No matter how you treat me)
So throw it out of your mind, yeah
Never gonna give you up
(So don't you think of leavin')
Can't you understand
That you're killing this man?
Never gonna give you up
I'll never, never, never
(No matter how you treat me)
No matter how
Never gonna give you up
I'll never Oh noooo
(So don't you think of leavin')
One of these days I'll be always standin' 'round ya door
Even though you say you don't love me no more
I'm never no Never gonna give you up
I'll never give you up
(No matter how you treat me)
I never Never gonna give you up
(So don't you think of leavin')
I've been loving you too long
That's why my love for you is so strong
I'm never no no no no Never gonna give you up
(No matter how you treat me)
You can't make me leave you
Never gonna give you up
(So don't you think of leavin')
I'm strung out on you, mama, yes I am
And you'll never never make me leave you, no
Never gonna give you up
'Cause I love you, and I need you
(No matter how you treat me)
I looooove you
Never gonna give you up
I'll never give you up, no
(So don't you think of leavin')
I'll never never never, oh no
