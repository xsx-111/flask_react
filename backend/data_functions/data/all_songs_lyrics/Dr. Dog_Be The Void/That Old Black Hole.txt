That Old Black Hole Lyrics
I put on my clothes like a bodyguard
I put the dogs on patrol in my own backyard
I don't want to fight but I'm constantly ready
And I don't rock the boat but it's always unsteady
There's an elephant in my head and I tiptoe around it
There are eggshells on the floor therefore I never touch the ground

It's like that old black hole, no matter how you try
You set out each day never to arrive

I got my eyes on the prize but it looks just like a mystery
And it all goes by on the lonesome trail to victory
I'm drawing the blinds, I've got my own four walls
Man, the show really starts once the curtain falls
Take this thorn from my side, fix this chip on my shoulder
Time is racing with the clock and I ain't getting any older
It's like that old black hole,  no matter how you try
It's like that old black hole,  no matter how you try

It's like that old black hole, no matter how you try
You set out each day never to arrive
I put on my finest thread
And I wrap up my body tight
With the sun in my eyes
I step into the night
Like a mystery in the dark
Oh, it's just another kind of light
I don't expect you to believe me but everything is alright
I don't make rules for a living
I don't do tricks for a dime
I was born on a good day
Deaf, dumb, and blind
Who am I to tell the truth?
Oh, I don't even know what it is
Well I don't know how to say it but I know that I can show you
I said, "I don't know how to say it but I know that I can show you"
I tied my boots up tight and I head straight to bed
There's a pistol and a crystal underneath my pillow
There's a tender heart inside that ugly armadillo
"These are tears of joy", cried the weeping willow
There's a spirit in the air, there ain't no way around it
I was not prepared to lose it all the moment that I found it

It's like that old black hole, no matter how you try
It's like that old black hole, no matter how you try
It's like that old black hole, no matter how you try
You set out each day never to arrive4Embed
