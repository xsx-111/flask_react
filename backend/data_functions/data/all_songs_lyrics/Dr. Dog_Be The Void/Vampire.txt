Vampire Lyrics
There's a darkness around you I can't explain
And the heart break surrounds you like the rain
You destroy all that's good here at your will
There's a part of me though that loves you still

You're a vampire baby, no reflection at all
You never think what you do really hurts
You're always giving me maybe, if I get something at all
Leaving me in the dark, oh what a nerve

There's a black mask in shadows behind your veil
You're as tempting and savage as Marcellus Shale
If you knew what you wanted I'd give mine
But I'm no grave robber baby, I can't know your mind

You're a vampire baby
You never think what you do really hurts
You're always giving me maybe, if I get something at all
Leaving me in the dark, oh what a nerve

Somehow, some way, some day, somehow we will get along dear
Dawn is always dark
Somehow, some way, some day, somehow we will get along
You're a vampire baby, no reflection at all
You never think what you do really hurts
You're always giving me maybe, if I get something at all
Leaving me in the dark, oh what a nerve
You're a vampire babyEmbed
