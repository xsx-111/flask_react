Get Away Lyrics
I'm aware of the danger
I think it's ok
I was never that young
I was born old and grey
Alone and in shambles
It's alright, it's ok
The storm cloud has broken
The haze burned away
I was 23 miles from the Chesapeake bay
I'd worn through my shoes
Always walking away
Seems like all of my troubles roll and tumble this way
The bottle has broken, the ghost has escaped

Oh no, I can't walk around with my feet off the ground
And when they hit, although we are strangers
Run away, run away, run away
I have

I didn't talk much to strangers
I'd bled my friends dry
Hard, hard living yet I was hardly alive
But I kept on rolling and now I know why
The storm clouds have broken a hole in the sky
Well get away from the shelter
Get away from the storm
Get away from the mountains
Get away from the shore
Get away from the hang-ups, they destroy the mind
Get away from the darkness
Get away from the light

Oh no, I can't walk around with my feet off the ground
And when they hit, although we are strangers
Run away, run away, run away
I have

Well get away, get away, get away
Get away, get away, get awayEmbed
