How Long Must I Wait? Lyrics
I walk with you everywhere I go
But it don't seem like you know
I sang your praise like an old songbird
But I don't suppose you heard
I climbed my voice to the top of my lungs
But I'm standing on the tip of my tongue
And all I see only looks the same
The picture is the frame

Oh soul of mine, look out and see
My time (my time)
My time (my time)
My time (my time) is to be

I fight for you
My love is war
The battle of Baltimore
I took you back then
I'll take you down the road
You're with me on my own

Oh soul of mine, look out and see
My time (my time)
My time (my time)
My time (my time) is to be
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?
How long must I wait?Embed
