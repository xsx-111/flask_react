Big Girl Lyrics
She's a big girl now and she can't be your baby anymore
Sha-na-na-na-na she's a big girl now
She had such wild expectations when she was very young
But you couldn't stand to see her happy or having fun
But she's a big girl now and she can't be your baby anymore
You had her doing all the dishes, had her mopping the floor
You had your dinner on the table when you walked through the door
But she's a big girl now she can't be your baby anymore
She could have been anything that she wanted
She could have had anything at all
But you broke her down man, you nearly undid her
You made her feel so very small
You made her call you daddy, changed the color of her hair
And when you stayed out very late you had her waiting on the stairs

But she's a big girl now and she can't be your baby anymore
She's coming with meEmbed
