Do the Trick Lyrics
My heart, it ain't running right
Won't you give it a kick
Will you be my handy man?
Will you do the trick?
I count the days as they pass me by
My tock is a nervous tick
Won't you free my hands of time?
Won't you do the trick?
All my marbles gone down the drain
You could say I'm a lunatic
Won't you set my mind at ease?
Will you do the trick?
I burnt the candle on every side
Long since run out of wick
Will you be my flame tonight?
Will you do the trick?
I been split down the middle
Call a doctor quick!
I'm in need of a better half
Will you do the trick?
I just can't find my way all alone
Man this fog is so thick
Won't you shine your light for me?
Will you do the trick?
I've thrown everything at the wall
But nothing will stick
Won't you hand around a while?
Won't you do the trick?
I could build you a home on high
I could lay each and every brick
Will you be there by my side?
Will you do the trick?Embed
