These Days Lyrics
I don't want to waste time
I don't want to wait here
Deciding whether we should stay or leave baby
Why you want to go now?
I don't want to go now
Even though our friends are gone
And the lights are on
You keep saying nobody cares if I'm here except me
Well baby, that's enough
I don't want to let go
People they get so old
I hate when people say "those were the days"
Well what are these then?
I really should have stayed home
So many people I don't really know anymore
And I got nothing to say but I don't know
I just get so bored
Over and over I get impatient and angry
When I feel like I've gone soft
It's such a drag, I just get dumber and dumber
I can't talk, I can't talk

I don't want to let go
People they get so old
I hate when people say, "those were the days"
But what do I know?
Why you wanna go now?
I don't wanna go now
Even though my friends are gone
And the music's off
Oh you keep saying nobody cares
If I'm here, except me2Embed
