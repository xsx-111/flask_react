Warrior Man Lyrics
Well I am the ancient warrior man
And I hail from the ancient warrior clan
I invented the computer man
Hubcaps and soda cans

Well the holy ghost, he owes me everything he knows
And everything he don't, you understand?
Well I think you can
Well the world at most is a homemade crypt
I made from my rib in a lightning trance
In a fevered dance


The roads of gold
I carved hieroglyphs into the Dover cliffs
I'm a self-made man with my own bare hands
The haunted ghost
They begged for the man with the hammer in his hand
To ring the bell and send him back to hell
Holy roller, do you know her?
I invented the Krav maga
Speak in a Vandalic Yanamam√∂ patois
Holy roller, do you know her at all?
Holy roller, do you know her?
Going to need another ride into town
Does she have another jockey at home?
Holy roller, do you know her
