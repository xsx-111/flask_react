Turning the Century Lyrics
I been singing for so long
I go from door to door
But it ain't the song I'm singing for
And I've painted every town
The colors I ignore
No it ain't the change I'm looking for

Mouth of the river, spit out the sea
Shake the hands of time
Turning the century

I've been fishing off the dock
At every beach and every brook
And it feels the same
And it felt the same without the hook
And I'm humbled by the maker
I've been given all I gave
And I don't expect
No I don't expect to be saved
No I don't expect, I ain't asking to be saved

I found the combination, I've got the key
Standing at the door
Turning the century
Mouth of the river, spit out the sea
Stand for something more
