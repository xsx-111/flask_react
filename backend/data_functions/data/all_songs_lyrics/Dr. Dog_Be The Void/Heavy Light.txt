Heavy Light Lyrics
I'm sleeping under carpet in a closet full of bone
In a body of boiling water
I'm scratching on the surface, I'm blind as can be
I am a trace
I am a gesture

In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light

They say that I'm a river
They say that I am one
Will I be the last to know?
So beyond the lines of mercy, I'm waiting for my turn
Someday my prince will come

In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
In the heavy heavy light, in the heavy heavy light
The sea is within me and that's 'cause I said so
And that's 'cause I said so
In love with the word, am I sound?
Am I right?
The sea is within me and that's 'cause I said so
In love with the word, am I sound?
Am I right?
The sea is within me and that's 'cause I said so
In love with the word, am I sound?
Am I right?
The sea is within me and that's 'cause I said so
Love, love

I wish I gave only love
Or could feel it when I didEmbed
