Step Lightly Lyrics
Step lightly
You're moving too fast
Take your time, boy
Soon the pain will pass

In the meantime
You gotta find yourself a love

That's going to last
Step lightly
Things will work out fine
Nice and easy
All it takes is time
Please, believe me
I wish this song was yours instead of mine

Now don't be angry at what I'm telling you
I'd be happy if you would see it too
But in the meantime
Find yourself a love that's true to you

But in the meantime, (meantime)
Find yourself a love that's going to last
Now I told you
Things don't work out fast
Gotta go now
Let's forget the past

But in the meantime, (in the meantime)
You gotta find yourself a love that's going to last

You gotta find a love that lastEmbed
