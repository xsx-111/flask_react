Devil Woman Lyrics
Every time I see you walking down the street
I say, you're the kind of woman I just gotta meet
You look so good and you look so fine
And one of these days I'm going to make you mine
Your eyes are green and your legs are long
And if I'm going to get you, well, I got to be strong
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed

Devil woman, you're like a stranger to me
Devil woman, this ain't the way it should be

Every time I see you in the neighbourhood
I say, you're the kind of woman that makes me feel good
I want to beat you up then I want to be kind
And one of these days I'm going to make you mine
Sexy Sadie, you look like the devil to me
Devil woman, that's not the way it should be


Early in the morning when the sun is hot
All i do is think about the things you got
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed

Every time I see you walking down the street
I say, you're the kind of woman i just gotta meet
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
But you're like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed
You look like the devil with horns in your head
The only way I'll get you is to get you in bed

I said, you look like the devilEmbed
