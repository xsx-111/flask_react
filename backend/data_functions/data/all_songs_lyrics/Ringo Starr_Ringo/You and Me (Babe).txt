You and Me (Babe) Lyrics
For you and me, babe, it's time that we part
And between you, babe, I gave you my heart
For these few moments
I wish we could start at the top again
For me and you, babe, it's the end of our date
Me and the band, babe, all thought it was great
To entertain you
But it's getting late and it's time to leave
Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine
And when the sun sets in the sky
And you close your sleepy eyes
I'll be in some night-club, getting high, that's no lie
Now you and me, babe, we may meet again
And in the meanwhile, stay out of the rain
But keep your nose dry
And give us a smile if you liked the show
Now I want to tell you the pleasure really was mine
Yes, I had a good time, singing and drinking some wine
Though I may not be in your town
You know that I can still be found
Right here on this record, spinning 'round, with the sounds
For you and me, Dave, they turned out the lights
The violins stayed to wish you good night
Me and the band-aid are reaching the end, so it's off we go
Goodbye, everybody!
Come on, lads, play it for me, boys, there we are

Well, it's the end of the night and I'd just like to say thank you to everyone involved in this piece of plastic we're making
Good old Jim Keltner, Klaus Voorman, Nicky Hopkins, George Harrison and John Lennon, Paul Mccartney
Richard Perry, for producing this masterpiece, Bill Schnee, ever smiling, ever loving
Vini Ponciedo and all his other friends and everybody else who joined in and helped us on this wonderful record
So it's a big good night from your friends and mine, Ringo StarrEmbed
