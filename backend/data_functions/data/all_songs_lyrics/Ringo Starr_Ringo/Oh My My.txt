Oh My My Lyrics
One, two, three, four!

I phoned up my doctor to see what's the matter
He said, "come on over."
I said, "do I have to?"
My knees started shakin', my wrist started achin'
When my doctor said to me:

Oh my my, oh my my, can you boogie, can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
Oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive

The head nurse, she blew in, just like a tornado
When they started dancing, I jumped off the table
I felt myself healing and as I was leavin'
This is what they said to me:

Oh my my, oh my my, can you boogie, can you slide?
Oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie if you try
Oh my my, if you try, it's guaranteed to keep you alive
Now if you should slow down and you're feelin' low down
Don't call up your doctor, just grab you a partner
It's what you've been missin', I've got your prescription
That boogie-woogie remedy

Oh my my, oh my my, you can boogie, you can slide
Oh my my, oh my my, we can boogie 'till we die
Oh my my, oh my my, it's guaranteed to keep you alive

Oh my my, oh my my, watch me boogie, watch me slide
Oh my my, (ow!) oh my my, born to boogie, born to slide
(Can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, oo-wee, boogie, oo-wee, aye
(Can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, play that boogie, play that slide
(Can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, love that boogie, love that slide
(Can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, oh my boogie, oh my slide
(Can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on baby, come on now
(Can you boogie)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on baby, I'm willin' to die
(Can you boogie?)
Oh my my, oh my my, come on baby, come on tryEmbed
