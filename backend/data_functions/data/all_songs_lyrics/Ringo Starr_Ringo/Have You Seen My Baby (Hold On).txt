Have You Seen My Baby (Hold On) Lyrics
Have you seen my baby on the avenue?
You know she's driving me crazy
With the funny things she do
I seen her with the milkman
Riding down the street
When you're through with my baby, milkman
Send her home to me

Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
You know it's been so long
Since she has been gone
Hold on, hold on, hold on

I seen her with the gypsies, dancing in the woods
She's always been unfaithful to me
She's never been no good
I said, "please, don't talk to strangers, baby."
But she always do
She said, I will talk to strangers if I want to
Because I'm a stranger too."
