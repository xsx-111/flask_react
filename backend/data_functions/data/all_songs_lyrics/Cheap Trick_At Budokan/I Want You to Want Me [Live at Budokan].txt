I Want You to Want Me  LyricsI want YOU to want ME
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm begging you to beg me
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
Shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand-new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
Shine up the old brown shoes
Put on a brand new shirt
I'll get home early from work
If you say that you love me
Didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Feelin' all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
Oh ...
Feelin' all alone without a friend
You know you feel like dyin'
Oh, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I see you cryin'?
I want you to want me
I need you to need me
I'd love you to love me
I'm beggin' you to beg me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
I want you to want me
