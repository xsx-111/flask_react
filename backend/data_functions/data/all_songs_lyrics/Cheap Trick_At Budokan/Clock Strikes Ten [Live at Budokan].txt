Clock Strikes Ten  Lyrics
Clock strikes ten it's a Saturday night
Got money in my pocket and it feels allright
Not stayin' home gonna stay out late
Gotta hear some rockin' music - it feels just great

Clock strikes twelve on a Saturday night
All the creeps are sleepin' all the cools in sight
All the kings and queens, they're out tonight
Lookin' for some action 'til it feels alright

Imagine what we're doin' tonight
You really got me goin' tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
I'm crazy for some action tonight

Clock strikes two I'll be out all night
All my money's spent but that's allright
Not goin' home gonna stay out late
Get ready for some action, want some action tonight

Clock stikes four I want some more
Everybody's layin' on the floor
Not goin' home gonna stay out late
Gotta hear that rockin' music it feels allright


Imagine what we're doin' tonight
You really got me goin' tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
I'm crazy for some action tonight

Gonna get down
Gonna get on down
Gonna get down
Gonna get on down
Gonna get down
Gonna get on down
Gonna get down
Gonna get on down
Gonna get down
Gonna get on down
Gonna get down
Gonna get down
Gonna get down
Gonna get on down - woo
Gonna get down
Gonna get on down - woo

Gonna get down
Gonna get down
Gonna get down
Na na na na-na-na na na na

Imagine what we're doin' tonight
You really got me goin' tonight (that's right)
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
I'm crazy for some action tonight (na na na na na na na)
Imagine what we're doin' tonight (woo)
You really got me goin' tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
I'm crazy for some action tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonight
You really got me goin' tonight
Imagine what we're doin' tonightEmbed
