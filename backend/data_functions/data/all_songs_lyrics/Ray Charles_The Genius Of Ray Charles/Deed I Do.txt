Deed I Do Lyrics
Do I want you? Oh my, do I?
I said, honey, 'deed i do
Do I need you? Oh my, and I, do I?
You know, honey, 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hanging round you
Do I love you? Oh my, do I?
I say, honey, 'deed I do

I'm glad that I'm the one who found you
That's why I'm always hanging round you
Do I love you? Oh my, do I?
I say, honey, 'deed I do

I said, honey
I'm talkin' about
Honey, 'deed I doEmbed
