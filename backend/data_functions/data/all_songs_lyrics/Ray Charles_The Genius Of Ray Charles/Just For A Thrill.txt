Just For A Thrill Lyrics
Just for a thrill
You changed the sunshine to rain
Just for a thrill
You filled my heart with pain

To me, you were my pride and joy
But to you, I was merely a toy
A plaything that you could toss around at will

Just for a thrill
You made my life one sad song
Just for a thrill
You just led me along

Although you're free and having your fun
To me, you're still the only one
'Cause you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrill (just for a thrill)

Although you're free and having your fun
To me, you're still the only one
'Cause you made my heart stand still
And baby, you, you made my heart stand still
Just for a thrillEmbed
