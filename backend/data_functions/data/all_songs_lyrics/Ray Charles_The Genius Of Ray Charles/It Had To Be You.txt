It Had To Be You Lyrics
It had to be you, it had to be you
I wandered around, finally found
Somebody who could make me be true
Whoa whoa whoa could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you
Some others I've seen might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But, they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still now
And it had to be you, it just had to be you
It had to be youEmbed
