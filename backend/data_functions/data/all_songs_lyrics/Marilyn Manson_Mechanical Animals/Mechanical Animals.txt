Mechanical Animals Lyrics
We were neurophobic and perfect
The day that we lost our souls
Maybe we weren't so human
But if we cry, we will rust

And I was a hand grenade
That never stopped exploding
You were automatic
And as hollow as the 'O' in god

I'm never gonna be the one for you
I'm never gonna save the world from you

They'll never be good to you, bad to you
They'll never be anything, anything at all

You were my mechanical bride
Phenobarbidoll
A manniqueen of depression
With the face of a dead star
And I was a hand grenade
That never stopped exploding
You were automatic
And as hollow as the 'O' in god

I'm never gonna be the one for you
I'm never gonna save the world from you

They'll never be good to you, bad to you
They'll never be anything, anything at all
They'll never be good to you, bad to you
They'll never be anything, anything at all

I'm never gonna be the one for you
I'm never gonna save the world from you

This isn't me, I'm not mechanical
I'm just a boy playing the suicide king, yeah!

Playing the suicide king
Playing the suicide king
(I'm just a boy) Playing the suicide king
(I'm just a boy) Playing the suicide king
(I'm just a boy) Playing the suicide king
(I'm just a boy) Playing the suicide king5Embed
