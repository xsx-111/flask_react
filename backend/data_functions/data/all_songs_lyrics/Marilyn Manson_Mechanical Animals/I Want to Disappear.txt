I Want to Disappear Lyrics
Look at me now, got no religion
Look at me now, I'm so vacant
Look at me now, I was a virgin
Look at me now, grew up to be a whore

And I want it, I believe it

I'm a million different things
And not one you know

Hey, and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now
But I know I wanna disappear

Disappear
I wanna disappear
Disappear, baby

Wanna die young, sell my soul
Use up all your drugs, make me come
Yesterday, man, I was a nihilist
Now today I'm just too fucking bored
And I want it, I believe it
And I want it

By the time I'm old enough
I won't know anything at all

Hey, and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now
But I know I wanna disappear

Disappear
I wanna disappear, baby
Disappear

Hey, and our mommies are lost now
Hey, daddy's someone else
Hey, and we love the abuse
Because it makes us feel like we are needed now
But I know I wanna disappear4Embed
