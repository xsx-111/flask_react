Posthuman Lyrics
She's got eyes like Zapruder, mouth like heroin
She wants me to be perfect like Kennedy

This isn't God, this isn't God
This isn't God, this isn't God
God is just a statistic!
God is just a statistic!

Say, "Show me the dead stars, all of them sing" (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
This is a riot, religious and clean (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
(Hey! Hey! Hey!)

God is a number you cannot count to
You are posthuman and hardwired

She's pilgrim and pagan, soft-worn and social
In all of her dreams she's a saint like Jackie O

This isn't God, this isn't God
This isn't God, this isn't God
God is just a statistic!
God is just a statistic!
Say, "Show me the dead stars, all of them sing" (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
This is a riot, religious and clean (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
"Show me the dead stars, all of them sing" (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
This is a riot, religious and clean (Hey! Hey! Hey!)

God is a number you cannot count to
God is a number you cannot count to
God is a number you cannot count to
You are posthuman and hardwired

"All that glitters is cold"
"All that glitters is cold"
"All that glitters is cold"

Say, "Show me the dead stars, all of them sing" (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
This is a riot, religious and clean (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
"Show me the dead stars, all of them sing" (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
This is a riot, religious and clean (Hey! Hey! Hey!)
