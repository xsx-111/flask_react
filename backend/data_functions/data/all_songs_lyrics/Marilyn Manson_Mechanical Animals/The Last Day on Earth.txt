The Last Day on Earth Lyrics
Yesterday was a million years ago
In all my past lives I played an asshole
Now I found you, it's almost too late
And this earth seems obliviating
We are trembling in our crutches
High and dead, our skin is glass

And I'm so empty here without you
I crack my xerox hands

I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

And the dogs slaughter each other softly
Love burns its casualties
We are damaged provider modules
Spill the seeds at our children's feet

And I'm so empty here without you
I know they want me dead
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

We'll never say goodbye
We'll never say goodbye3Embed
