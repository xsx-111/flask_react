Disassociative Lyrics
I can tell you what they say in space
That our Earth is too grey
But when the spirit is so digital
The body acts this way

That world was killing me
World was killing me, disassociative

The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down, I know
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down, I know

I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space

Sometimes we walk like we were shot
Through our heads, my love
We write our song in space like we're
Already dead and gone
Your world was killing me
World was killing me, disassociative
Your world was killing me
World was killing me, disassociative

I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space

The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down
(4, 3, 2, 1...)

I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space9Embed
