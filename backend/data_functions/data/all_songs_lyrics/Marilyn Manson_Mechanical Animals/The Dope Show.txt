The Dope Show Lyrics
The drugs, they say, make us feel so hollow
We love in vain, narcissistic and so shallow
The cops and queers, to swim, you have to swallow
Hate today, no love for tomorrow

We're all stars now, in the dope show
We're all stars now, in the dope show

There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

We're all stars, now, in the dope show
We're all stars, now, in the dope show

They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
The drugs, they say, are made in California
We love your face, we'd really like to sell you
The cops and queers make good-looking models
I hate today, who will I wake up with tomorrow?

There's lot's of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another
They love you when you're on all the covers
When you're not, then they love another

There's lots of pretty, pretty ones
That want to get you high
But all the pretty, pretty ones
Will leave you low and blow your mind

We're all stars, now, in the dope show
We're all stars, now, in the dope show19Embed
