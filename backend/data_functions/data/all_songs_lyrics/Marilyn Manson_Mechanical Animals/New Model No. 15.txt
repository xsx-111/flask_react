New Model No. 15 Lyrics
I'm as fake as a wedding cake
And I'm Vague and I know that I'm Homopolitan
Pitifully predictable
Correctly political

I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed, at the office
I can suck it and smile

New, new, new model
New, new, new model

I can choke and diet on coke
I'm Spun and I know that I'm Stoned and Rolling
Lifelike and poseable
Hopeless and disposable

I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed, at the office
I can suck it and smile
New, new, new model
New, new, new model
New, new, new model
New, new, new model

Pitifully predictable, correctly political
Pitifully predictable, correctly political

Don't let them know how far you go
Or that you use your "lovers"
Oh look, you're like a VCR
Stick something in to know just who you are

I'm the new, I'm the new, new model
I got nothing inside
Better in the head and in bed, at the office
I can suck it and smile

New, new, new model
New, new, new model
New, new, new model
New, new, new model (Model, model)
New, new, new model
New, new, new model
New, new, new model
New, new, new model4Embed
