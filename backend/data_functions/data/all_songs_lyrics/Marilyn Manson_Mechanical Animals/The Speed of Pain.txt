The Speed of Pain Lyrics
They slit our throats like we were flowers
And our milk has been devoured

When you want it, goes away too fast
Times you hate it always seem to last
Just remember, when you think you're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me

I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

I wish I could sleep, but I can't lay on my back
'Cause there's a knife for every day that I've known you

When you want it, goes away too fast
Times you hate it always seem to last
Just remember, when you think you're free
The crack inside your fucking heart is me
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day
I wanna outrace the speed of pain
For another day

Lie to me, cry to me, give to me, I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me, I would
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair, always
Keep all your secrets wrapped in dead hair, always
Lie to me, cry to me, give to me, I would
Lie with me, die with me, give to me, I would
Hope that we die holding hands, always
Hope that we die holding hands, always
Hope that we die holding hands10Embed
