Bittersweetheart LyricsWhy you always want to get the best of me?
I'm like a seeing eye dog and I can't even see
They're naked and they're following my master who is blind
And my mind's gone to pieces, I could use some peace of mind
So I picked up the pieces and I made a new start
Stole an old stiletto, started stabbing in the dark
I can't live without it, I would surely fall apart
But it's hard to make arrangements 'round a bittersweetheart
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart
Better get yourself a little street smart
Bittersweetheart, sad but true
It's a bittersweetheart that's a hard heart to cure
It's just my bittersweetheart
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart
It's like a suicide mission when you can't see no end
Tired of compliment-fishing and impressing your friends
I never kissed no one just to kiss and tell
It's a little bit of heaven and a whole lot of hell
In the eye of the beholder is a beautiful start
But you always seem to end up with a bittersweetheart
There's a darkness looming but the sun is shining bright
I can live to see the morning if I stay up all night
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart
Without a shortcut, without a head-start
Bittersweetheart, sad but true
It's a bittersweetheart that's a hard heart to cure
My bittersweetheart
It's the hardest part, bittersweetheart
Are you in there, are you beating?
Beating me up until I'm bleeding
How much blood can you spare?
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart
Think just a drink might get you to the good part
Lying in bed just wondering what to do
It's a bittersweetheart that's a hard heart to cure
In time inside you find
You always wind up with a bittersweetheart
Bittersweetheart, bittersweetheart
In time inside you find
You always wind up with a bittersweetheartEmbed
