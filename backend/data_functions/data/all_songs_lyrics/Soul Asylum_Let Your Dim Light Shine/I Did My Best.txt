I Did My Best LyricsHold up in a dressing room without a dress
Kneeling at the confessional with nothing to confess
And I knew all about my surprised party
I was spoiled and deppressed
But I acted surprise and I told lots of lies
Yes I did my best
Stop the truck at the truck stop
I need something to help me crash
Food stamp cheque and credit cards
But they only accepted cash
That was sweat beating on my brow
My heart was beating out of my chest
So I stole everything they couldn't give away
Yes I did my best
And I did the best that I could do
With all the mess that I've been through
What did u expect me to do
I did my best for you
I was waiting for a chain reaction
With a missing link
Waiting for that trickle down
Forever circling the sink
I was tired of being tired
I could not get no rest
So I kept sleepwalking and talking in my sleep
Yes I did my best
And I did the best that I could do
With all the mess that I've been through
What did u expect me to do
I did my best for you
I did my best for you
I did my best for youEmbed
