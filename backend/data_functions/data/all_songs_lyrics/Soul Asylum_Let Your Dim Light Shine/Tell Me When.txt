Tell Me When LyricsShe's all by herself at the end of the day
She'd talk to herself but wouldn't know what to say
Wrings her hands and steps out of the bath
The mirror laughs and splits her in half
She looks around the room
At her carpeted tomb
Threw the phone on the floor
Left the keys in the door
Tell me when does life begin
She got in the car and looked up at the stars
And made a wish
She held her breath and considered death
And in the rearview mirror
She looked back on her reflection
She was a long way from she wanted to be
And a long way from perfection
Tell me when does life begin
She chickened out and she called triple-A
And told them the way
After she paid they fixed the car
She got on her way and she drove past the bar
Where no one bought her a drink at
She always though it was 'cause she was too fat
And now she knows those places blow
Or maybe it was her nose
Tell me when does life beginEmbed
