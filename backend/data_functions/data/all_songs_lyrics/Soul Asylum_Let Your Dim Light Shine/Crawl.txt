Crawl LyricsYou got me going, so get me out of here
I should be blowin', in someone else's ear
I'm looking forward to looking back
On days like today
Though I wish you would go away
Stay, won't you stay
I'm gonna crawl, cra-ha-hawl, cra-ha-hawl
I never felt better just crawling home
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone
Good to see you, see you later, maybe one more beer
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home from here
Some respond to pleasure, some respond to pain
I'm hangin' out to dry, in the pouring rain
Victims of temptation, never can complain
I could use the sensation, you see I can't feel pain
I'm gonna crawl, cra-ha-hawl, cra-ha-hawl
I never ever said I'd never make it home
It's just a stone's throw, a crawl home
Good to see you, see you later, maybe one more beer
I'm just a crawl home, crawl home from here
I could use someone, to drag me out of here
I am that someone, it's all become quite clear
So get me out of here
I never felt better just crawling home
I'm gonna crawl home, crawl home alone
Good to see you, see you later, and I'm outta here
I'm just a crawl home, crawl home from hereEmbed
