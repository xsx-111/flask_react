To My Own Devices LyricsShouldn't have got so loaded
Damn near explode
Oh, you know
I should've known this
Whatever the price is
Whatever the crisis
Oh please, don't leave me
To my own devices
Please don't leave me
To my own devices
She was a pretty good waitress
Said she waited on Elvis
Said she talks too much
Please don't leave me
To my own devices
Saving up for a rainy day
It just rained yesterdayEmbed
