Caged Rat LyricsWhy don't you go home and crawl into your hole
Why don't you go home and spend some time alone
In the corner I looked across the room
To the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon
Caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat
Rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat
In the corner I looked across the room
In the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon
Caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat
Rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat
Why don't you go home and crawl into your hole
Why don't you go home and spend some time alone
From the corner I looked across the room
To the other corner, I knew I'd be there soon
Caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat
Rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged rat, caged ratEmbed
