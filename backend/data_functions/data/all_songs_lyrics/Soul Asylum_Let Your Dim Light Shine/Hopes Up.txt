Hopes Up LyricsThere's just no substitute for fun
I've tried every single one
And no one can take your place
Everybody gets replaced
My time has neither come nor gone
It just slips out when I yawn
Without hope I can't go wrong
Can't go wrong
Don't get my hopes up
Dont' get my hopes up
Don't get my hopes up now
Don't get my hopes up
Dont' get my hopes up
Don't get my hopes up now
It's so hard to settle down
Don't recognize my hometown
Home is where I hang my head
Lost in all these things I said
Been holding my breath for so long
I don't need air anymore
If you never let me breathe
I'll never breathe
I'll never breathe
Don't get my hopes up
Dont' get my hopes up
Don't get my hopes up now
Don't get my hopes up
Dont' get my hopes up
Don't get my hopes up now
Don't know what I was hoping for
I feel like feeling better than I ever felt before
My time has neither come nor gone
It just slips out when I yawn
Holding my breath for so long
For so long
Don't want to be bored no more
I know there's so much more
Don't know what I was hoping for
I feel like feeling better than I ever felt before
Don't get my hopes up
Dont' get my hopes up
Don't get my hopes up now
Don't get my hopes up
Dont' get my hopes up
Don't get my hopes up nowEmbed
