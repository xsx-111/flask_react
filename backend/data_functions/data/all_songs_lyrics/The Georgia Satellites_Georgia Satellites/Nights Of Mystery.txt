Nights Of Mystery LyricsYou know there's sometimes I just sit around and wonder
'bout what is and what would ever be
But you know I'd much rather find myself
Lost out on the sea nights of mystery
Yeah there's some people and they grow up crazy
And there's some people that never bother to grow up at all y'all
I don't worry about any of that shit anymore
I just listen for my sweet baby to call
She goes here i come I'm gonna talk talk
All the time about love, love
Got me a light and it shines just like a diamond
I never get me enough hoo hoo
Here it comes comes up again now
Watch it watchin on a you and me
Don't I love love to caught out on your sweet
Nights of mystery
All I need nights of mystery
All I need is one fine moment
Of intuition and clarity
Just one fine, fine moment
That's all I'll ever need in this life for me
I got this genious of the heart
That shines wild and free
Don't I love, love to be caught out
On your sweet nights of mystery
She goes here I come I'm gonna talk, talk
Talk all the time about love, love
Got me a light and it shines just like a diamond
I never get me enough, hoo hoo
Here it comes comes up again now
Watch it watchin on a you and me
Don't I love love to be caught out on your sweet
Nights of mystery
On these sweet nights of mystery
On these sweet nights of mystery
On these sweet nights of mysteryEmbed
