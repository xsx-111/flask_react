Red Light LyricsYeah my baby called up said I done made her mad
She's takin' me off for everything that I had
Ran out of town and now she's come back
Got Van Halen wailin' on the stereo eight track
Watch out baby that's what I said
There's a red light, road block, bridge out ahead
Here she comes in town runnin' lickety split
Runnin' red lights the girl's mad as shit
Comin' in town on some slippery road
Ninety miles an hour gonna get my goat
Tack started readin' in the double red
There's a red light, road block, bridge out ahead
Well she came up to Jack's bridge but
That bridge wasn't there
She stomped the 'cellerator jumped right up in the air
Tires was whinin' you could hear 'em sing
That Firebird flew like it just grew wings
Landed in my yard and she's totin' lead
There's a red light, road block, bridge out ahead
Well my baby called me ukp said I done made her mad
She's takin' me off for everything that I had
Ran out of town and now she's come back
Got Van Halen wailin' on the stereo eight track
Watch out baby that's what I said
There's a red light, road block, bridge out aheadEmbed
