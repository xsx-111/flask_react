Golden Light LyricsLet go this ribbon of darkness now
And like a drunk I'll go fall, laughing down
You can tell me I'm no different
But I hear the full moon call my name
You can me how nothin' changes
Nothin' stays the same
Lost in a golden light
Lost in a golden light
And they tell you truth is a moment it shines
Just like a flame
So let it shine on me and I'll stand when it calls my name
You can tell me I'm no different but
I hear the full moon call my name
You can tell me how nothin changes
Nothin stays the same
Lost in a golden light
Lost in a golden light
You can tell me I'm no different but
I hear the full moon call my name
You can tell me how nothin changes
Nothin stays the same
Lost in a golden light
Lost in a golden light
Lost in a golden light
Lost in a golden lightEmbed
