Railroad Steel LyricsWell I say some men they like to ride that train
I like it better that train ride me
That way, I can take my baby's love from sea to sea
On this moon lit night out on U.S. Eighty Two
I hear that train is just a callin' out
The way a little girl like to do
Baby's got to know about the way I feel
I got a heart that's made out of railroad steel
Cold, hard, true, and mean but when her train
Rides through it'll make me sing
Yeah baby I got them Dixie crystals and they're
Flowin' right through my veins
I'm just two tire tracks disappearin' in the pourin' rain
And there ain't nothin in this whole wide world
Worth havin' ever comes for free
And I swear to God in Heaven that little girl's
Gonna remember a man like me
Baby's got to know about the way I feel
I got a heart that's made out of railroad steel
Cold, hard, true, and mean but when her train
Rides through it'll make me sing
Are you listenin' baby?
Baby I got my finger right on your pulse
Poundin' just like a drum
I need a little bit of Coca Cola
I need me a shot of Ron Rico one fifty one
Ain't nothing in this whole wide world
Worth havin' ever comes for free
And I swear to God in Heaven that little girl's
Gonna remember a man like me
Baby's got to know about the way I feel
I got a heart that's made out of railroad steel
Cold, hard, true, and mean but when her train
Rides through it'll make me singEmbed
