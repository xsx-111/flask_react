Waiting for Somebody LyricsAll my life, waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, come and take my hand
All my life, waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, whoa, yeah
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha
Been down so long, doesn't really matter
This downtown home, been kicked and I've been spurred
You come along? It doesn't really matter
I'll go it alone, doesn't even hurt
All my life, waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, whoa, yeah
All my life, waiting on somebody
Ah ha ha, ooh, yeah
I'm waitin' for the day
Waitin' for the day
That you come my way
Hey, hey
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha
I know down deep, I made a big decision
I'm going to sleep, and I'm going there alone
I know damn well, I'm tired of all this cryin'
On my feet as far as I can tell
I'm waitin' for the day
Waitin' for the day
That you come my way
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody
Oooo, somebody
Ooohh
Waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha, somebody
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha, waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, I'm waiting for somebody
Ah ha ha, ah ha ha, waiting for somebody
All my life
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
All my life
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
