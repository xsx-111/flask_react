Flutter Girl Lyrics
I'm drinking dust with eyes of rust
Tonight my tears might stain your wings
So flutter home because you're better off alone than with me

So hide your face and tie your lace
And butterflies across your cheek
Forget how soon you become a fool for words when I speak

Flutter girl
You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
Because I give nothing for free
You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
Because I give nothing for free

My hands are rough, my fingers cold
And your heart's so young and so naive
To ever feel for a moment that I might dare to believe

Flutter girl
You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
Because I give nothing for free
You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
Because I give nothing for free
I'll tear your wings
As I melt in your smile
As I run all your colors away

Flutter girl
You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
Because I give nothing for free
You don't want to know what I live
You don't want to take what I give
Because I give nothing for free
