Birth Ritual (Live) LyricsLying like needles on forest earth
Euphoric rush trees bend to pray for us
I'm sputtering like cold machines
Late for the birth ritual
Ritual, ritual, ritual
You can drive my tail to watch the circus
A birth ritual, a birth of idiots
Now I woke up blessed and good strives for heartache
Marked for the death ritual
Ritual, ritual
As you start the song and face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime for every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual
I took the drug to make me stay
And now evеrything dies in shyness
The snakе retreats, admits defeat
And waits for the birth ritual
Ritual, ritual
As you start the song and face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime for every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual
Shining light
Child's highs
Mark his sides
Bright until the newness wears off
As you start the song and face this garden
I light a cigarette before the execution
Now you see your crime for every miracle
Add another drug at every birth ritual
Ritual, ritual, ritualEmbed
