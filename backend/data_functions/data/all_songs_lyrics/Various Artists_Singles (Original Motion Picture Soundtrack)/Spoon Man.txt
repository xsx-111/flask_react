Spoon Man LyricsFeel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
Spoonman
Speak the rhythm on your own
(Speak the rhythm all alone)
Spoonman
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
All my friends are Indians
(All my friends are brown and red)
Spoonman
All my friends are skeletons
(And beat the rhythm with their bones)
Spoonman
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
Save, save me
Save me, yeah
Save
With your...C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
With your hands
With your hands
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon....hands
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off
Come on while I get off, come on while I get off!
Spoonman, come together with your hands
Save me, I'm together with your plan
Save me
Save, yeah!
Save me
With your, with your hands
Feel the rhythm with your hands
(Steal the rhythm while you can)
