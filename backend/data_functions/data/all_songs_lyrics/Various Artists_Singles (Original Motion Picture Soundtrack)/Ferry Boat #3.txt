Ferry Boat #3 Lyrics
Help me, I don't know what I'm doing
Help me before I fall to ruin
And if I'm blind, I'll save you all
Come follow me to the bridge before the fall
Help me I don't know what I'm doing

Help me, I don't know what I'm saying
Sometimes this tongue can be betraying
And if I'm wrong, is that such a crime?
Til hope is gone you won't see me killing time

When your eyes forget to well
And when your lies forget to tell
And when our paths forget to cross
It doesn't mean you're lost

Help me, I don't see how you do it
Sometimes I see you sleeping through it
And when you wake to your loss
To blame your dreams
Won't relieve you of the cost
Help me, I don't know what I'm doing1Embed
