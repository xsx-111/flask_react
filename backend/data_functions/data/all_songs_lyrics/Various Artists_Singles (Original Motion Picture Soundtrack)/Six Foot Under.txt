Six Foot Under LyricsMy daddy was a working man, he used to load on the central line
Every time I talked to him, he was cold as ice
So he smoked too much
So he drank too much
So he fucked around too much
That's how you feel when you're six foot under the grave
That's how you feel when you're six foot under the grave
Told ya not to spit on my daddy's grave
I told ya not to spit on my daddy's grave
Be a bitch, dig your bone
Then your bitch take your gold 
So he smoked too much
So he drank too much
So he fucked around too much
That's how you feel when you're six foot under the grave
That's how you feel when you're six foot under the grave
That's how you feel when you're six foot under the grave
That's how you feel when you're six foot under the graveEmbed
