Drown Lyrics
No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you drown
You've traveled very far
Just to see you I'll come around
When I'm down

All of those yesterdays
Coming down

No matter where you are
I can still hear you when you dream
You traveled very far
You traveled far, like a star
And you are

All of those yesterdays
Coming down

Is it something someone said?
Was it something someone said?

Yesterday the sky was you
And I still feel the same
Nothing left for me to do
And I still feel the same

I wish, I wish I could fly
I wish, I wish I could lie
I will, I will try
I will, I will
