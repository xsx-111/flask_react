Overblown LyricsEverybody loves us
Everybody loves our town
That's why I'm thinking lately
The time for leaving is now
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's so overblown
Everybody loves us
Man, they give me the creeps
And you're up there, shirtless and flexing
Display of a macho freak
Now you got your attention
And you got so very far
They gave you your very own spotlight
Just like some real rock star
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's so overblown
Show 'em Stevie!
Got a sack full of candy
All I got was a rock
It's got you by your big business, boy
Nice to know you're packing extra socks
Everybody loves us
Everybody's getting kinda old
Couldn't hold a regular job
Long live rock'n'roll
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
It's so overblown
Overblown
Overblown
Overblown
It's all over and done1Embed
