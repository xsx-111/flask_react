Dyslexic Heart LyricsNa nanana na nanana na na
Na na na na nana etc
Ah ah ah...
You shootin' glances and they're so hard to read
I misconstrue what you mean
Slip me a napkin and now that's a start
Is this your name or a doctor's eye chart?
I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
I ain't dying to offend you, I got a dyslexic heart
Thanks for the book, now my table is ready
It's a library or a bar
Between the covers I judge you and ready
A half-angel, half-tart
I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
I ain't dying to offend you, I got a dyslexic heart
Do I read you correctly, you need me directly
Help me with this part
Do I date you?  Do I hate you?
Do I got a dyslexic heart?
You keep swayin'... what are you sayin'?
Thinking 'bout stayin'?
Or are you just playin', making passes
Well, my heart could use some glasses
Na nanana na nanana na na
Na na na na nana etc
Deep heart, I gotta deep heart, deep heart, ah ah ah
Are you stayin'?  What are you sailin'?  Well are you swayin'?
Just playin', making passes
Well, my heart could use some glasses
I try and comprehend you but I got a dyslexic heart
Do I read you correctly, I need me directly
Help me with this part
Do I love you?  Do I hate you?
I got a dyslexic heart
Deep heart, a deep heart, deep heart, a deep heart
Na nanana na nanana na na
Na na na na nana etcEmbed
