Breath Lyrics
Oh, tonight began with anything
Shaft of a light, a warm breath and a scream
Ah, yeah
Oh, tamper if you like between the doors
Oh yeah, uh. Huh
Oh, can't expect to go out, to go out with anything, anything more

Oh reach the door, a breath and a scream
Oh reach the door, and a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth, a breath and a scream
Oh reach the door

All these reaching hands out grabbing things. Grabbing me
Day in day out accumulating. Ah yeah
Whoa. I suggest you step out on your porch
Oh yeah. Huh. Huh. Huh huh, yeah
Run away, my son, see it all. Oh, see the world

Oh reach the door, a breath and a scream
Oh reach the door, and a la la la la yeah
Life ain't what it's worth, a breath and a scream
Oh reach the door
Come. Here it comes. There it goes. When it comes
Where it goes. Where it comes
Can't see through the faith
Woah
Ooh. Come. Here it comes. There it goes
Grasp what you can
Don't you know there's something inside your head? yeah

Oh, if I knew where it was
I would take you there
But there's much more than this
Ooh. Whoa, much more than this
Oh, see the world
Much more than
Oh, much more than
Why?
