Heart and Lungs LyricsI can't go outside
Until I clean my head
My perception is scarred
Nervous system is dead
She left me wounded and broke
Wound my guts into string
I can't feel my legs
I can't move a thing
Feel the strain in my heart and lungs
Feel the strain in my heart and lungs
Want to throw myself out
To an empty sky
No parachute excuses
No ability to fly
Smash my soul on rocks below
Recrystallize in a perfect flow
Feel the strain in my heart and lungs
Feel the strain in my heart and lungs
Feel the strain in my lungs and heart
Drown the rain until the clouds part
Smash my past
Wrap it around a tree
Press my face against the mirror
Until I can't evеn see
I wanna lose this face
From this very planе
Want to come onto her
Under a different name
Feel the strain in my heart and lungs
Feel the strain in my heart and lungs
I feel the strain in my lungs and heart
Drown in the rain until the clouds partEmbed
