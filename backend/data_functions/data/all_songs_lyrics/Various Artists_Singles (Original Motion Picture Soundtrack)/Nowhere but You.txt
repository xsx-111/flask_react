Nowhere but You LyricsNowhere but you
I'm gone until I'm within you
Nowhere but you
There is no better place that I've been to
And if I'm condemned
Let me rest on my pillow
And dream of those moments so few
And if I'm blessed
I'll be chasing your shadow
There I go
Nowhere but you
When you were here
I thought that I would never miss you
When you were gone
I felt that I had never lived hereEmbed
