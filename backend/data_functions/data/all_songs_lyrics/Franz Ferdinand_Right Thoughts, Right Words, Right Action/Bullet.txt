Bullet Lyrics
While I'm away, you can
Let the mouse go down on you
Let the mouse do what I'd do
If I was there, but you'd better explain
That I have a vendetta in my narrow bones
I have a vindictive eye
Of my jealousy, I have no control (No control)

I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind
I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind

How can I get your bullet out of my head now?
I have no control, but I try
Yeah, I try

I'd better explain
That I have a red vendetta in my narrow bones
And a wicked indicative eye
Of my yellow jealousy, I have no control (No control)
No control
I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind
I'll never get your bullet out of my head now, baby
I'll never get your bullet out of my mind

Get out of my head
Ah, get out of my head now, ah
Ah, get out of my head
Ah, get out of my head now, ah
Ah, get out of my head
Ah, get out of my head now
Ah, get out of my mind1Embed
