Stand On The Horizon Lyrics
How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am the proudest man ever born

I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun's this low
Everything's cold on the line of the horizon

Come to me, oh, won't you come to me? Whoa
Come to me, oh, won't you come to me? Whoa
Come to me, oh, won't you come to me?
Oh, won't you come to me? Yeah

How can I tell you I was wrong?
How can I tell you I was wrong?
When I am the cruellest man you have known
That you've ever known
That you've ever known
That you've ever known

Oh, I stand on the horizon
I want to step across it with you
But when the sun is this low
Everything's gold on the line of the horizon
In South Shields Metro station
I heard Marsden Rock was breaking
The North Sea shaking all that we know
To make us see the point of living is to live

So won't you come to me?
Oh, won't you come to me? yeah
Oh, come to me
Oh, won't you come to me? Yeah

Oh, the North Sea sings, "Won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, won't you come to me?
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, won't you come to me?
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, the North Sea singing, "Oh, won’t you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Oh, won’t you come to me, baby?"
The North Sea singing, "Oh, won’t you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Oh, won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, the North Sea singing, "Oh, won’t you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Come to me"
Oh, won't you come to me with you?
Won't you come to me with you?
Won't you come to me with you?
Won't you come to me?

Oh, the North Sea sings, "Oh, won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, the North Sea singing, "Oh, won’t you come to me?"
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Won’t you come to me, baby?"
Oh, the North Sea sings, "Won’t you come to me?"Embed
