Brief Encounters Lyrics
We are bored, we are married, we are young
On the edge of the city, the edge of ambrosia
Rows upon, rows upon, rows upon the sun

A certain party
A certain cul-de-sac
A certain outcome
A certain piece of me

Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys

Outside alone, crossing the perfect lawn
Could it be you, could it be you, could it be you, could it be
This is what freedom is

We are brief encounters
We all lose our keys
We all choose our partners
We all choose our keys
Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys

Ah, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Ah, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Pull back, pull back into the drive
Rigid in the matrimonial super king bed
Pretend to sleep, pretend to sleep
Come on, pretend, yeah, let's pretend
Yeah, let's pretend
Yeah, let's but

We are brief encounters
We all lose our keys
We all choose our partners
We all choose our keys

Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keys
Car keys, choose your keysEmbed
