Right Action Lyrics
Come home, practically all is nearly forgiven
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Almost everything could be forgotten
Right thoughts, right words, right action

Oh, how can we leave you
To a Saturday night on a Sunday morning?
Good morning

Sometimes, wish you were here, weather permitting
Right thoughts, right words, right action
This time, same as before, love you forever
Right thoughts, right words, right action

But how can we leave you
To a Saturday night on a Sunday morning?
Good morning

Do-do-n-do-do-do
Do-do-n-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do, do, do
11 Chalcot Gardens
Englandâ€™s Lane, Hampstead, London

Do-do-n-do-do-do
Do-do-n-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do

Sometimes, wish you were here, weather permitting
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Right thoughts, right words, right action
Right thoughts, right words, right action5Embed
