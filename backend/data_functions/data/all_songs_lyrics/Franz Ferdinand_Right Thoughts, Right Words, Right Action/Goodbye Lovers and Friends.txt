Goodbye Lovers and Friends Lyrics
Lovely, lovely

I don't play pop music, no
You know I hate pop music
Just sing Amazing Godless Grace
I don't wear bright colours, no
You know I hate bright colours
I never liked you for the way you dressed, anyway

Goodbye lovers and friends
So sad to leave you
When they lie and say, "This is not the end"
You can laugh as if we're still together
You can laugh about it all, anyway

I hope you didn't bring flowers (Oh)
Hope you didn't write a poem (Oh)
Hope you remember every fight
I know I could be noxious
Or occasionally cruel
But only to the ones I love
So, goodbye lovers and friends
So sad to leave you
When they lie and say, "This is not the end"
You can laugh as if we're still together
You can laugh about it all

Don't get inventory
Don't fake your memory
Don't give me virtues that I never had
Don't get sycophantal
We never were sentimental
I know that I took more than I ever gave


I don't need to be forgiven
But a moment from the living
Yeah, that's the only thing I ask
So don't play pop music, no
You know I hate pop music
Just sing Amazing Godless Grace

Goodbye lovers and friends
It's so sad to leave you
When they lie and say, "This is not the end"
You can laugh as if we're still together
But this really is the end1Embed
