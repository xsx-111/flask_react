Fresh Strawberries Lyrics
We are fresh strawberries
Fresh burst of red strawberries
Ripe, turning riper in the bowl
We will soon be rotten
We will all be forgotten
Half-remembered rumours of the old

So wouldn't it be easy with something to believe in
That could give us more than
"Here's my work, so where's my pay
To buy what I don't need?"?
Wouldn't it be easy to believe? (To believe?)
To believe? (To believe?)

Thieves believe
Everybody steals
I believe there's nothing to believe
But I love the manual
The instruction manual
Oh, liars swear that they never lie

So wouldn't it be easy with something to believe in
That could give us more than
"Here's my years, so now they're gone
It's time for me to leave"?
Wouldn't it be easy to believe? (To believe)?
To believe? (To believe?)
Wouldn't it be easy to believe?
Wouldn't it be easy to believe?

We are fresh strawberries
A fresh burst of red strawberries
Ripe, turning riper, so

Wouldn't it be easy
Ah, something could give us more than
"I don't know, no, I don't know
I don't know what I need"?
Wouldn't it be easy?
Oh, couldn't it be easy?
Oh, shouldn't it be easy to believe?1Embed
