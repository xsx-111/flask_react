Love Illumination Lyrics
When you're half way from a dream
Is it hard to work out what is real?
Is the real over there
More vivid than here ever feels?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright
You'll be alright

Is the Blackpool bright light
Brighter than the light in your home?
Were you born to be loved
But nobody else seems to know?
We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody to love
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason term
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright


We could love, we could love you
If you need somebody to love you
While you're looking for somebody
We're all looking for somebody
We're all looking for (All looking for)
Somebody to love

Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love elevation
Outside, fresh avaricide
But inside our love, you'll be alright
Sweet love illumination
Sweet, sweet love celebration
Cop car burn, reason turn
But it'll bring you up, you'll be alright

Sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet, sweet love
Sweet love5Embed
