Evil Eye Lyrics
Ooh, what's the colour of the next car?
(It's red, you bastard) Yeah, red, you bastard
Don't believe in God, but I believe in this shit
Not me, I like to bring them down
Not me, some fool who dum-dum-do
(Dum-dum-do) Not, not, not me

Some people get a freak out of me
Some people can't see what I can see
Some people want to see what I see
Some people put an evil eye on me
Ooh

Ooh, I have the evil eye
I, I, I see your soul
You wear it on your face
It's worn in what you do
Ooh, what's the colour of the next car?
(Yeah, it's red, you bastard) Yeah, red, you bastard
Don't believe in God, but I believe in this shit
(Not me) Not me, I like to bring them down
(Not me) Not me, some fool who dum-dum
(Dum-dum-do) Not, not, not me
Some people get a freak out of me
Some people can't see what I can see
Some people want to see what I see
Some people put an evil eye on me

It looks so clean but I can see
The crawling, crawling creatures
Suspended in solution
No, no, there's no solution

Some people get a freak out of me
Some people can't see what I can see
Some people want to see what I see
Some people put an evil eye on me
Some people want to see what I see
Some people put an evil eye on me
Some people want to see what I see
Some people put an evil eye on me3Embed
