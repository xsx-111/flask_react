Treason! Animals. Lyrics
Hey friends, when will you get here?
Hey friends, I need to hear voices
I don't care what you talk about
Hey friends, I just need to hear voices
Could you bring the manual?
Bring the repair manual
Something has really, really gone wrong
Here, here
Something has really, really gone wrong

I'm the king of the animals
I'm the king of the trees and animals
Self-crowned king of the trees and the animals
Well, I'm a king so give me a crown
I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown

Hey friends, when will you get here?
Hey friends, this is my kingdom
This is a tree, this is an animal
Ask any one of them
And they daren't deny it
Ask any one of them
And they daren't deny it
No, don't you dare deny it
This is a tree and this is an animal
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Something has really, really gone wrong
Well, I'm the king of the animals
I'm the king of the trees and animals
Self-crowned king of the trees and the animals
Well, I'm a king so give me a crown
I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown

I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown
I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown
I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown
I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown
I am an animal, oh, give me an animal crown
I'm in love with a narcissist
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my nemesis
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with a narcissist
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my pharmacist
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with a narcissist
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my analyst
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my nemesis
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with a nemesis
And I know for the mirror told me
I'm in love with my nemesis
And I know for the mirror told me
Hey friends, when will you get here?
Hey friends, I need to hear voices
I don't care what you talk about
Hey friends, I just need to hear voices
Something has really, really gone wrong1Embed
