The One Eyed King LyricsSitting by the old road again
Waiting for a letter for a friend
Thinking 'bout the old days again
Drifting down a river with no end
But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me
But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me
Passing by the cave on the cove
Standing in the darkness in the sun
Open up the window to your mind
So I can look inside and lend a hand
But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me
But the life I see, tells me nothing's wrong with me
Am I the one eyed king amongst the blind
Can I heal the wounds that leave behind
Let me be the saviour of your mind
For the army of emotions I commandEmbed
