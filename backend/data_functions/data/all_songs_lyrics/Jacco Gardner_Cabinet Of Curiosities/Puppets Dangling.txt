Puppets Dangling LyricsThe world goes crazy for a while
I'd been waiting hours for her smile
I just need to wake up to find
That my troubles are all making me blind
Oooooo
Aaaaaaa
I sometimes got the feeling that I'm locked inside again
And I've got to win before my world will go insane
I play against the stormy night and thunder in the sky
And I don't know the ending for the smoke inside my eyes
Puppets dangling on golden strings
Her controlled by many things
Pushed around by heavy winds
Trees stand tall and start to sing
(ALL X2)Embed
