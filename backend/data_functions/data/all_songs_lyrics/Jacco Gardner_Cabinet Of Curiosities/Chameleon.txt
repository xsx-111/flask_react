Chameleon LyricsAll the lights are flashing by
I'm hiding in my dream
Am I the only one with all these questions in my brain
I try to close my eyes
Until the answer came
I want to float away
But all these clouds just look the same
Are my dreams really gone like the girl with golden hair?
I'm always wondering
Are you really there?
You walk behind the hallways
Following my steps
It's right in front of me
But you know the way back
I'm a chameleon
I'm changing everyday
I'm sitting in my dream
Not sure where I will stay
All the stars are shining bright
I'm swimming in the deep
Please tell me where I stand or forever I will sleep
He doesn't seem to realize it's there
In the darkness down below he sits and stares
And all the colours you'll see wide and you'll get blind
You're always there to ask me questions in my mind
He doesn't seem to realize it's there
In the darkness down below he sits and stares
'm a chameleon
I'm changing everyday
I'm sitting in my dream
Not sure where I will stayEmbed
