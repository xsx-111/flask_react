Where Will You Go? Lyrics
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?

I know my dreams will comfort me
In times when no one's there to see
The words that fill my mind
Telling whatâ€™s behind
The eyes of a fool

Where will you go
When the sun goes out?
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?

My dreams are mystery to me
In nighttime dwell I want to be
I don't care what people say
Sleeping is a getaway
From life as a fool
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?
Where will you go
When the sun goes out?Embed
