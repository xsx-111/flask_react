Clear the Air LyricsWhen we are to meet again
This feeling's just the same
Every time your presence seems enough to change my name
Is it best to clear the air
Of sunshine for a while
Wouldn't it be better if the sunshine made you smile?
I can't see you
I would like to
Clear the air
It's not fair
Time will tell what happens if
The flowers disappear
If darkness holds til we will meet
Each other every year
It's alright if you take your time
Love will find its place in line
Just kill this mood or we'll be grey
After all that was has died away
I can't see you
I would like to
Clear the air
It's not fair
