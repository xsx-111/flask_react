Help Me Out LyricsI can see quite clearly
But in my mind, time is catching up on me
Time passes by quite quickly
Still I wait, in the highest tree
CHORUS
I need all the light that's hidden
Right behind the veil of winter
Help me out and make it disappear
I need another curtain
Just to make me feel alright alone
Let the sunlight find me
Just before I turn into stoneEmbed
