The Ballad of Little Jane Lyrics
Little Jane came home last night
Just before the velvet light of morning
Shes been gone for many hours in the garden
Picking flowers for her love

Every time
She comes home
No one's there
All alone

No one comes to find her there
You can try but be aware
She's been waiting every day for her Mr. Right to come and stay
Little Jane sits in the shadows waiting, looking out the window for her love
She might have to wait forever on her own because he's never at the door
(Ahhhh ahhhhhh ahhhh ahhhhhhhh)

Every time
She comes home
No one's there
All alone
No one comes to find her there
You can try but be aware
She's been waiting every day for her Mr. Right to come and stay
No one come to find here there
You can try but be aware
Do you really love her so?
When your there shell never let you go
(Ahhhh ahhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhh)Embed
