Up to the Surface LyricsI came up to the surface
Released the air
With no words to remember
What happened there
I saw life in the shadows
On foreign lines
I knew peace in the terror
There was a night of war away
A row of islands all ablaze
The sullen circle round the end
In darkness I revolve again
No home in the city or here on land
Cold eyes all around me and where I stand
A frozen planet, how could life remain?
You left me alone
Came up to the surface
Released the air
With no words to remember
What happened there
I saw life in the shadows
On foreign lines
I knew peace in the terror
Of the mindEmbed
