Darkened Rings LyricsAwake all night
Look through my life
Some darkened rings
With a few bright highlights
Took it all down
A life written's sound
Life that was spent living line by line by
Awake all night
Look through my life
Some darkened rings
With a few bright highlights
Awake all night
Look through my life
Some darkened rings
With a few bright highlights
Took it all down
A life written's sound
Life that was spent living line by line by
Took it all down
A life written's sound
Life that was spent living line by line by
Line by, line by, line by...
By lineEmbed
