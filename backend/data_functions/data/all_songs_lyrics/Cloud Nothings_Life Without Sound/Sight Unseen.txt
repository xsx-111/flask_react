Sight Unseen LyricsBefore we were talking
Before anyone knew
How the working components
Evolved in the room
"Carried how long within me?"
That was all that she said
"Carried how long within me
This idea's end?"
And look
I'm moving out of view
The world won't follow you
So occupy and enter slowly
Go, another minute alone with
Another minute alone with
Another minute alone with
The world of sight unseen
In the hours surrounding
All the fire, all the sea
The following is an account
Of all that I have seen
There were cold notes of envy
Over a sounding of sun
And it gave me the feeling that I had lost all I could love
And look
I'm moving out of view
The world won't follow you
So occupy and enter slowly
Go, another minute alone with
Another minute alone with
Another minute alone with
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseen
Of sight unseen
Of sight unseen
The world
The world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world
The world of sight unseen
Finally gone but I'll remember all that I have seen
Finally gone but I'll remember all that I have seen
Finally gone but I'll remember all that I have seen
Finally gone but I'll remember all that I have seen
Telling you though you won't forget the days of calm and green
Telling you though you won't forget the days of calm and green
Finally gone but I'll remember all that I have seen
Finally gone but I'll remember all that I have seen
In the, the world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseen
The world
The world of sight unseenEmbed
