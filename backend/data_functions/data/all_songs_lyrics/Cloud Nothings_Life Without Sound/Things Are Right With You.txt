Things Are Right With You LyricsBelieve it's time for coming out
No use in life without sound
Patiently waited alone and now
Follow a line to sort it out
Became aware of everything
Woke to a new surrounding
Saw what I'd done and who I'd be
I wasn't comfortable with me
And part of what I've lost
Borrowed and turned inert
Because of what I thought
It's people who should hurt
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
You give up what you know
Can't explain where to go
And you move in a world that moves on its own
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
Believe it's time for coming out
No use in life without sound
Patiently waited alone and now
Follow a line to sort it out
Became aware of everything
Woke to a new surrounding
Saw what I'd done and who I'd be
I wasn't comfortable with me
And part of what I've lost
Borrowed and turned inert
Because of what I thought
It's people who should hurt
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
You give up what you know
Can't explain where to go
And you move in a world that moves on its own
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
You give up what you know
Can't explain where to go
And you move in a world that moves on its own
Feel right feel right feel right
Feel lighter
I know that things are right with you
I know that things are right with you
I know that things are right with you
I know that things are right with youEmbed
