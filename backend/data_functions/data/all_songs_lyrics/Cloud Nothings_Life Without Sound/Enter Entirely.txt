Enter Entirely Lyrics
I thought I knew a way to be
But I'm not right here
Feeling out on a limb
Because I'm out of my mind
But it's fine

I've had a lot of time alone, disintegrating
Watching all of the hours with a bottle of wine
What a line

I couldn't see a way to go
Obscured by feeling
Just a body alive ignoring all of the signs
That it's time

To make a repair of surroundings
To take a car out to the sea
With nothing there but me and shadows
And in nothing I believe

And now the lights are turning on here
A mind has fallen
And taken everything it knows now
About belonging
There's someone I would like to be if I could be but
The path is frightening
So when I find a way that I would like to see
I enter entirely
My world looks like I had only dreamed
Cutting up pieces of life and reality
I thought I knew what I could be
And now I'm there
And when I think about the time
I start to see her there


Moving on but I still feel it
You're just a light in me now
Moving on but I still feel it
You're just a light in me now
Moving on but I still feel it
You're just a light in me now
Moving on but I still feel it
You're just a light in me now
We're moving on but I still feel it
You, you're a light in me now
We're moving on but I still feel it
You, you're a light in me now
We're moving on but I still feel it
You, you're a light in me now
We're moving on but I still feel it
You, you're a light in me now
Light out loud4Embed
