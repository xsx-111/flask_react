Strange Year LyricsI'll feel right later, for now I'm on you
Cut even container, I'm out on that too
My conscience is greater than lashes and fume
One part of a layer relying on you
Down, I'm seeing you
Down, I'm seeing you
Down, I'm seeing you
Down, I'm seeing you
Using my life I've fallen behind
Try to go back from older inside
Nothing reverses errors in time
Nothing reverses starting decline
I'll feel right later, for now I'm on you
Cut even container, I'm out on that too
My conscience is greater than lashes and fume
One part of a layer relying on you
Down, I'm seeing you
Down, I'm seeing you
Down, I'm seeing you
Down, I'm seeing you
Using my life I've fallen behind
Try to go back from older inside
Nothing reverses errors in time
Nothing reverses starting declineEmbed
