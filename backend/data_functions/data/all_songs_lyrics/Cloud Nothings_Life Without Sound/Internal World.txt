Internal World LyricsSay what you are to anyone
And you reveal you're weak, here
Where would you go to lose all your angles?
How would you make it complete?
You nullify and cut 'em off
Review the light supreme
Who would you follow
Any way they wanted
If at the end you'd be free?
And if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
Nobody is inanimate
Nobody's just one here, here
Where would you go to lose all your angles?
How would you make it complete?
You have a face for everyone
You have a face for me, yeah
Who would you follow
Any way they wanted
If at the end you'd be free?
And if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But if it looks like my anymore
Internal world, the one worth living
But I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
I'm not the one who's always right
