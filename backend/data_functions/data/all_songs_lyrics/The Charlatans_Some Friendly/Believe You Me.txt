Believe You Me LyricsWith all the world developments
Why do they make me laugh at you?
And all the world can take you for
Is something else, you're so low
There's someone else inside of me
Who doesn't make me want to kill
And all the time you're pushing me
I never knew that you were ill
And all the time you think you're it
When you've got nothing else to give
Open it up and take it out
I'll never know what's under that
(Who was that) who killed your lover?
(Who was that) who killed your lover?
It wasn't me
It wasn't believe you me
Not me, not me, not me, not me
Who killed your lover
Who killed your lover
Not me, not meEmbed
