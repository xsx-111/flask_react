Flower LyricsDon't bring me flowers to my bed
I don't wish you to know
It's time to find myself again
As cold as houses on your street
As hollow as my own
I hope you wish them all away
Time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
It's time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
Don't bring me flower to my bed
She got what she deserved
I told her I am of my time
As cold as houses on my street
As hollow as my own
I hope you wish them all away
Time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
It's time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
Time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girl
It's time to say goodbye
Bye to the bad bad girlEmbed
