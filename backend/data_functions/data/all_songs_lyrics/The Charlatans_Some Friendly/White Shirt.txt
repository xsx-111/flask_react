White Shirt LyricsWhen my white shirt lets me down
Like one we race against the wind
You said that I've seen better days
I wash her silver hair away
I'm going to be
(I'm going to be)
In heaven when you say
(In heaven when you say)
I'm too young to waste to ever be denied
(You're too young)
She laughed and then she died
Heard you said to me today
You're safe but you're so far away
You're beautiful how could you be so green
Tomorrow it holds the cause again
I'm going to be
(I'm going to be)
In heaven when you say
(In heaven when you say)
I'm too young to waste to ever be denied
(You're too young)
She laughed and then she died
And someone said to me
You've taken this too far
But I can't be asked to change
You're so vain
You're open all day
I'm glad I got it sorted now
Heard you said to me today
You're safe but you're so far away
'Cause I'm beautiful how could you be so green
Tomorrow it holds the cause again
Again, again, again
I'm going to be
(I'm going to be)
In heaven when you say
(In heaven when you say)
I'm too young to waste to ever be denied
(You're too young)
She laughed and then she diedEmbed
