Then Lyrics
I wanna bomb your submarines
You don't do anything for me

You were sometimes hard to find
You were never safe to be with, then

You, you're nothing next to me
I'm a phenomena you see

You were sometimes hard to find
You were never safe to be with, then

Furious again, furious again

You don't do anything for me
WeÂ´re a phenomena you see

You were sometimes hard to find
You were never safe to be with, then
Furious again, furious again

And you
You give it all to me
You never listen to a thing I said
You're furious, I'm glorious
You never hurt me that muchEmbed
