Samaritans Lyrics
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, just lie
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, don't whine
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls

The mask of masculinity
Is a mask, a mask that's wearing me
The mask, the mask, the mask

I'm a real boy, boy, and I cry
I love myself and I want to try
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, just lie
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, don't whine
Grow some balls, he said
Grow some balls

The mask of masculinity
Is a mask, a mask that's wearing me
The mask, the mask, the mask

I'm a real boy, boy and I cry
I love myself and I want to try
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father cry
This is why you never see your father
I kissed a boy and I liked it
Man up, sit down
Chin up, pipe down
Socks up, don't cry
Drink up, don't whine
This is why, this is why, this is why
This is why, this is why, this is why5Embed
