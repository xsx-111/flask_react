Love Song Lyrics
I wrote a love song
'Cause you're so loveable
I carried a watermelon
I want to be vulnerable
I will not go to bars
Or jump in strangers' cars
Or mine sweep for wines
And lines and lines and lines and lines and lines and lines
It's not about the sex and sex and sex and sex and sex and sex
I want to be your best ever friend
Forever best friend

This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)

I fucking love you
I really love you
Look at the card I bought
It says "I love you"
You try and you try and you try and you try
To make me change
I hope and I pray and I pray and I pray
You'll stay the same
I wish-ish-ish-ish-ish
I wish you'll always stay
So I push-ush-ush-ush-ush
I push you away

This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)

You give me power
You give me power
You're like a gun or a knife
Be my wife

This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love (love!)
This modern love
Modern love
