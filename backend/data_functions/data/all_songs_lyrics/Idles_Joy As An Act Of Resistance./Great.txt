Great Lyrics
(listen to more Jungle)
Blighty wants his country back
Fifty-inch screen in his cul-de-sac
Wombic charm of the Union Jack
As he cries at the price of a bacon bap

Islam didn’t eat your hamster
Change isn’t a crime
So won't you take my hand sir
And sing with me in time

G R E A T
G R E A T

Blighty wants her blue passport
Not quite sure what the union’s for
Burning bridges and closing doors
Not sure what she sees on the seashore

Islam didn’t eat your hamster
Change isn’t a crime
So won't you take my hand sister
And sing with me in time
G R E A T
G R E A T

You can have it all, I don’t mind
Just get ready to work overtime
‘Cause we’re all in this together3Embed
