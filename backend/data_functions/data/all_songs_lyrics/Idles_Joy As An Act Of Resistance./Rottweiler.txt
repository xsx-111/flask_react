Rottweiler LyricsThere's a snake in my boots
There's a rat in my cage
There's a shark at my feet
That's been circling for days
There's a vulture at my breakfast table
People think I'm insane
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
Rottweiler
There's a snake in my boots
There's a rat in my cage
There's a shark at my feet
That's been circling for days and days
There's a vulture at my breakfast table
People think I'm insane
There's a ghost in my bed
There's milk in my coffee
Rottweiler

Keep going!
Keep fucking going!
Keep going!
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em!
Go!
Smash it!
Ruin it!
Destroy the world!
Burn your house down!
