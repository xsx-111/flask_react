Gram Rock Lyrics
I'm sorry your grand-dad's dead
Ah, lovely spread

I scored a win
Badda badda bing
I'm the king
I scored a win
Badda badda bing
I'm the king
I scored a win
Badda badda bing
I'm the king
I scored a win
I scored a win

I'm sorry your mother's dead
Ah, lovely spread

I scored a win
Badda badda bing
I'm the king
I scored a win
Badda badda bing
I'm the king
I scored a win
Badda badda bing
I'm the king
I scored a win
I'm the king
Yeah (Yeah!)
Uh-huh

I got new shoes
'Cause I mean business
I mean business
I got new shoes
'Cause I mean business
I mean business, uh-huh

Ten points to Gryffindor
Ten points to Gryffindor
Ten points to Gryffindor, uh-huh
Ten points to Gryffindor
Ten points to Gryffindor
Ten points to Gryffindor, uh-huh
Yeah (Yeah)
Uh-huh
