One and Done Lyrics
I was dreaming of you
You're in my dreams

My old pal looks shaky with a cigarette in his hand
Salt and pepper sprinkled on his face and on his head
Looks like he might start crying, is it something that I said?
Let’s take a walk around the block, this fleeting feeling's infinite

Around here we’ve been wondering what tomorrow’s going to sing
On the final field recording from the loud Anthropocene
I’ve seen the sparkle of the diamonds on the watch of the emcee
It’s not keeping time, just shining

It’s not the first time you said "one and done"
And oh my god, and oh my god
Stood in your prom dress all covered in blood
What you sacrificed will never be enough


This whole town looks empty, but we knew it wouldn’t last
Behind bulletproof windows they’re still wiring the cash
Whatever they could scrape up, whatever that they had
There’s a lot of mouths to feed through this famine
This room seems even smaller now than I remember it
Hung mirrors on the walls and the ceiling
There’s no disguising it, there’s no denying it
This little box fits everything there is

It’s not the first dance you said "one and done"
And oh my god, baby, oh my god
Came to the wedding, you were looking rough
Watch the masochists all celebrating love

Come up!
Come up!1Embed
