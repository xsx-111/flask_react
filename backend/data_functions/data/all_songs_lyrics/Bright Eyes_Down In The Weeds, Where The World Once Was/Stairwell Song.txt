Stairwell Song Lyrics
Underneath an awning concentrating on the rain
Hearing laughter in the stairwell, it reverberates
They’re talking ’bout the weekend, all the plans that they have made
Said it’s just nice to have something to anticipate

We were dressed alike
Though you were one of a kind
For an enigmatic guy
You seemed relatable

You were smart, but so foolish with your heart
Eyed the exit from the start
In the end, couldn’t tell what you pretended
Always wild with your sly renegade smile
Perfectly disheveled style
What a waste, I regret it to this day


When I’m trapped inside my bedroom planning out my last resort
I have a great imagination so I just teleport
And I’m back with you in Benson, sitting on that rotting porch
Where we only drank the good stuff that we could afford
Could be so damn mean, but you were always sweet to me
You swept me off my feet and we went flying
Tried your best to hide all the sadness in your eyes
But I caught you every time that that was possible

You were kind, existential and refined
Always something on your mind
Even then, our love was not in question
Nothing changed, you just packed your things one day
Didn’t bother to explain what happened
You like cinematic endingsEmbed
