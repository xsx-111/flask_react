Pageturners Rag Lyrics
¡Buenas noches damas y caballeros!
Estamos llenas de emoción de que estén aquí con nosotros esta noche
Acompañanos mientras caminamos por el largo pasillo y salimos por las puertas de la memoria y el olvido
Démosle la más cordial bienvenida al escenario a Your Most Vivid Nightmares
Interpretando su más nueva composición, ¡Pageturners Rag!

It felt good
It was very moody
Some people cried more than others

But then, you know, like, the days after
I couldn't sleep

Either they've died, or they aren't around, or they don't exist
I was thinking, I was thinking about how you look tonight
Ta-da!
I think about how much people need
What they need right now to feel like
There's something to look forward to
We have to hold on
We have to hold on
And uh, took pictures of the kids in front of it over the years, but
Never did anything to it
And, and so the cool part of this, honestly, he said he liked red
And so I always buy red roses at the Dundee florist 'cause they
If you buy two roses in there, they're a little spendy, but they last, like, two weeks and they're pretty
Uhm, so, get this
When we went back to Cary — and we always go by Matty's old house
Uhm, and they had
Seen that the rose bush was gone 'cause they had done...
Put some paneling up in the house
We go back
The first time, the house looks great, and they sell it
The next time we go back, we drive by
The rose bush was growing in the same spot againEmbed
