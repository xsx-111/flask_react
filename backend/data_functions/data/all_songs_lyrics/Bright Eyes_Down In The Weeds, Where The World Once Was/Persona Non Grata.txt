Persona Non Grata Lyrics
Getting dressed for a date, put on blue aftershave
Wore a kilt like a Celt, hid the way that I felt
Combat boots, fallen leaves, West Village Halloween
To a Bollywood song, taking shots 'til we're gone
Unwelcome in the autumn, persona non grata
I'm the last of the best, I'm your thoughts in the swamp
There's a playground of children in the shadows of buildings
There's a line out the church where your homelessness works
Where the stained glass of crimson meets Ezekiel's visions
Saw a valley of bones where no man shall be saved

And now you
You come to me, asking that
And now you
You come to me and you're asking that
Oh, how can we reconcile?

Left your innocence there in Tian'anmen Square
You were filled with despair, underfed and depressed
Vacant lot where a prison stood, God knows you never would
Lie to yourself, but you do every time
Made a life of deception and passive aggression
Gonna scream when I sing, I'm gonna die in the ring
Turn me on, you're a knockout, climb up onto my cloud
Do your worst to me now before I change my mind
Now you, you wanna be true
To me once again
And you want me to be true
To you once again
Oh yeah, you, you wanna be true
To me, once again
And you want me to be true
To you, once again4Embed
