Calais to Dover Lyrics
Under a microscope of apoplectic vision
My face on a slide show, I looked totally unhinged
Forgot the Latin word, the name for this condition
Said I felt sick to get attention

Now this winter got an excuse to not go home
Rented a house out on the coast
Flying away, I heard a memory, your voice over the engine
So full of remorse and apprehension

Now that you’re gone
Now that I’m out here on my own
It won’t be long
‘Til I have to pay for what I’ve done
Tell me to stop
Tell me to watch the way I talk
Because nothing is changing
Don’t want to state the obvious

Threw up on the ferry ride from Calais back to Dover
As pale as the white cliffs that we faced
Wasn’t afraid, eventualities, just knew that it was over
No brushes with death could keep us sober
If I was in London I’d hold you to everything
If we were in Cardiff I’d just sing
But I’m stuck in Omaha obsessed with my inventions
There isn’t a name for this condition

Tell me I’m wrong
Tell me you understand my love
Tell me what’s off
What would you like to turn back on?
Tell me what’s gone
Make me a list of what you lost
Because everything’s changing
Don’t want to state the obvious


Tell me what’s wrong
Tell me I’ll pay for what I’ve done
Tell me what’s up
Pain like a big red rubber ball
I wish it would stop
I wish I could tell you it was gone
But nothing is changing
Sorry to state the obvious
Now that you’re gone
Tell me you understand my love
Tell me what’s wrong
Make me a list of what you lost
That’s all that I want
I’ll pay for what I’ve done
Nothing is changing
To state the obviousEmbed
