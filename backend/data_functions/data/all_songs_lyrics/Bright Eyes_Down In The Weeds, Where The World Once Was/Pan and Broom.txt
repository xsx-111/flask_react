Pan and Broom Lyrics

Out of the blue
Saw you fall down the stairs, it was me pushing you
Innocence, tell me the truth
Is that blood on your hands or just chocolate and fruit?

That isn’t what I heard
This world went down in flames and man-made caves
An island of lepers
That’s no kind of place to stay

Came into view
I just fly through the light like the dust in the room
Reminisce, walk through the zoo
And I sweep up my dreams with a pan and a broom

Not sure what comes after
Life just went down a drain of rainy days
Way up in the rafters
I float where the organ fades
If it’s not all that important, then
Why make a fuss at all?

Just whistle a tune
While you’re digging a grave on a hot afternoon
Happiness left here too soon
With a map and a bag on a plane to Tulum
Best medicine’s laughter
What a practical joke we have to play
Let’s wait for the rapture
Man, the phone banks were talking snakes

If it’s not all that important, then
Why make a fuss at all?Embed
