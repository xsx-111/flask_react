Comet Song Lyrics
The city shines, a silver street lamp glistens in the snow
Shiver as I’m walking by just knowing what I know
I guess this wild wanderlust just got out of control
Wish I could apologize and come in from the cold

"Where are you going?" or "Where you've been?"
Questions that you’ll never ask again

I heard the words, I took my turn, another eulogy
Not sure I can hang if this is how it’s going to be
We reminisce on innocence then plunge into the sea
The Super 8 keeps flickering with choppy memories

Spent decades in search of what meant so much to you
Then sold the whole collection because the rent was due

You clenched your fist and threw the dish and called me Peter Pan
Your aim’s not very accurate and I thank God for that
Although I told you many times I'm not much of a man
You held out hope believing that at least I might pretend
Vacuumed up all of the fairy dust
Held Savasana on the floor
Just felt like dying when you thought of us
You clapped your hands and hoped for an encore

So young and sunburnt, we walked on an empty beach
The surface was so shiny with nothing underneath

There’s tulips in the wheelbarrow, there’s cherries in the tree
There’s a comet in the sky at least one night a century
And I will always wait for you if you will wait for me
Like a baby or apocalypse that we will never see

Little infant in a plastic box
Shedding incubator tears
She doesn’t know yet what a comet does
You’re approaching, even as you disappear

We used to have these, like, bands
There were thousands of them
Maybe you're alone, maybe you're not
Doesn't always matter
(Consider the source)
Sorry baby, I was dreaming of you
You were in my dreams
You want me? (I need you)
Yes, I love you
How much you love me, man?
(I do not talk about that
I think I will turn the microphone off)Embed
