Mariana Trench Lyrics
Well, they’d better save some space for me
In that growing cottage industry
Where selfishness is currency
People spend more than they make
So I wrapped my head in bandages
From the string of happy accidents
I guess maybe I asked for it
But who am I to say?

The closing bell death tolls, hear the market crash
A crying trader swears he’ll get out of the game
The cowboy drinks himself to death fresh out of rehab
While they’re loading all the rifles on the range

Look up at that Everest, look down in that Mariana Trench
Look now as the crumbling 405 falls down when the big one hits
Look out for the plainclothes, look out for what the wiretap knows
Look out on the ever-widening money trail and where it goes

It takes a lot of gall to try to please
These dehumanizing entities
I befriended all my enemies
They had my back against the wall
Oh, a coward is what a coward does
I suppose maybe I always was
But I’m sick of it, I’ve had enough
And now I’m ready for the war

The lion bows his head down to the ringmaster
With the tightrope stretched so high above the crowd
All these faces are contortionists, it must have hurt
Because they all looked as unhappy as a clown

Look long at that Stonehenge, look quick, is it something you missed?
Look into that smoldering building’s bombed-out fog until it finally lifts
Look up at that big wave, look down at your other brother's grave
Look hard for a harder something to sacrifice, that’s what it takes
That’s what it takes

That's what it takes
Mmm
That's what it takes, ah
That's what it takes, ah
Ah, ah, ah

Look up at that Everest, look down in that Mariana Trench
Look now as the crumbling 405 falls down when the big one hits
Look out for the plainclothes, speak soft what the wiretap knows
Look out on that ever-widening money trail and where it goes
Where does it go?1Embed
