Hot Car in the Sun Lyrics
Parisian revelry, unapologetic apathy
I guess it’s the way it has to be
Made my bed and I brushed my teeth, didn’t think about dying
Got up to face another day

Maybe you’re the same
Maybe you’re afraid too
I love you
I am you

Chopped the celery and made the soup, didn’t have much else to do
I was dreaming of my ex-wife’s face
It’s just painful to walk around, it’s just painful to talk out loud
I know this pain is not my own
Felt so hot in the parking lot, the car windows were all rolled up
Just a dog dying in the Chevrolet

Baby, it’s okay
I love you
Baby, it’s okay
Because I wanted to
Love you
Well, they gouged out my eyes, but I could still see, so it didn't seem that important to sleep anymoreEmbed
