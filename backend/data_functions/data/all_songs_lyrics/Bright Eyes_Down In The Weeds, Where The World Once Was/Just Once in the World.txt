Just Once in the World Lyrics
Found the throughline for all humankind
If given the time, they’ll blow up or walk on the moon
It’s just what they do
For personal gain, on Thanksgiving Day
I joined the parade, I stood at the top of the float
And threw out a rose
Watched a blast from the past, Indigenous dance
Started to laugh and then I just started to cry
This world is waving goodbye

So cut a rug, let’s throw a party
Birthday cards for everyone
Swallow hard and say you’re sorry
Just admit what you have done

I studied your work like architecture
Cathedral of words, the meaning’s not easy to tell
Comes back around on itself
Admirers, your biographer, the odometer
There’s no way to turn back the clock
It’s going to run until it stops
So excited to play, turned up all the way
Electric, ecstatic, psychotic jumped into the drums
Was pandemonium
So if it’s time let’s go together
I will be your ballast now
Let’s sail into that stormy weather
No matter how it turns out

I just want to stand by your side
(Guard my darling bride)
When everyone calls you a lie
I’ll be your shield
(They don't know you)
There’s still some truth worth defending
Let’s stroll to the edge of the cliff
(Fear imbalanced bliss)
Stop here and give me a kiss
Now we’re walking on air
(Breeze and lightness)
There’s no hell beneath our feet

If it ever occurred, just once in the world
A love as absurd as ours I would scream what we lost
From the mountaintopEmbed
