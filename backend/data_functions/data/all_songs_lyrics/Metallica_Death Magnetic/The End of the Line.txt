The End of the Line Lyrics
Need more and more, tainted misery
Bleed, battle scars, chemical affinity
Reign, legacy, innocence corrode
Stain, rot away, catatonic overload

Choke, asphyxia, snuff reality
Scorch, kill the light, incinerate celebrity
Reaper, butchery, karma amputee
Bloodline, breeding fine, death contagious deity

Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime, nevermind
You've reached the end of the line
The end of the line

Time, choke the clock, steal another day
Die faithfully, narcissistic fade away
Twisted, jump the rail, shout at the crowd below
Breaker, chase the ghost, from latest high to all time low
Hooked into this deceiver
Need more and more
Into the endless fever
Need more and more

New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime, nevermind
You've reached the end of the line

Drop the hourglass of time
Spilling sand we will not find
As we gather here today
We bid farewell, the slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master
The slave becomes the master, yeah

The slave becomes the master
Need more and more
Right now, and ever after
Need more and more
New consequence machine
Burn through all your gasoline
Asylum overtime, never mind
Dead hour-glass of time, sand we will not ever find
We gather here today, say goodbye
Cause you've reached the end of the line

The end of the line
The end of the line
The end of the line
You've reached the end of the line1Embed
