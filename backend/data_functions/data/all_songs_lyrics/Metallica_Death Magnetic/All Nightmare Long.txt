All Nightmare Long Lyrics
One, two
One, two
Luck runs out

Crawl from the wreckage one more time
Horrific memory twists the mind
Dark, rutted, cold and hard to turn
Path of destruction, feel and burn
Still life, incarnation?
Still life, infamy?
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run, what's to come, what's to be

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out
Luck runs out

The light that is not light is here
To flush you out with your own fear
You hide, you hide but will be found
Release your grip without a sound
Still life, immolation?
Still life, infamy?
Hallucination, heresy
Still you run, what's to come? What's to be?

'Cause we hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

Then you crawl back in
Into your obsession
Never do return
This is your confession
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long
Feel us breathe upon your face
Feel us shift, every move we trace
Hunt you down without mercy
Hunt you down all nightmare long, yeah
Luck runs out
You crawl back in
But your luck runs out

Your luck runs out10Embed
