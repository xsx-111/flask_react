Cure for Optimism LyricsUp there a mountain rises
Down here an ocean dives
A stranger with a head full of lead
Photographs me
Steel bars and a doctor's note
Don't give up
They can plead and beg but don't let them fix your head
Outside a path to knowledge
Inside a waste of cells
A serpent with a mobile phone
Sweet talks me
Steel bars and a doctor's note
Don't give up
They can plead and beg but don't let them fix your headEmbed
