Disappear LyricsWe made the world believe we didn't care
We gate crashed parties and just stood and stared
We moved to London and stayed in all year
Standing next to you I disappear
You made a choice for us to live it up
I've got a voice inside me saying give it up
Let's get out of here, let's find a new career
You be famous and I'll disappear
I erase myself again
I erase myself again
I erase myself again
I erase myself again
I need security, you favour chance
I ponder everything while you advance
You bring the world to me and I just sneer
In your shadow I disappear
I erase myself again
I erase myself again
(I'm here)
I erase myself again
(I'm here, you're never standing still)
(I'm here)
I erase myself again
(I'm here, you're never standing still)
I'm here, I'm here, you're never standing still
I'm here, I'm here, you're never standing still
I'm here, I'm here, you're never standing still
I'm here, I'm here, you're never standing still1Embed
