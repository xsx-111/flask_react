All of the smarter kids they stay inside
But out in the pouring rain
You're kicking me with that look of sheer disdain
The fat controller man
He doesn't understand he's my biggest fan
So I'll stay here on the floor
It's better to be ignored than to be adored
Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing
Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing
Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children
Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children (now)
And you do
Good morning lucky man
I hope you enjoyed your sojourn in Japan
It's such a perfect scene
Back here in Golders Green - cut...end of dream
Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing
Church spires ticking
Hose pipes hissing
Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children
Don't want to smother you
Just want you to be the mother of my children (now)
And you doEmbed
