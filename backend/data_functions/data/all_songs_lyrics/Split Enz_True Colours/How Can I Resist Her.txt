How Can I Resist Her LyricsBlonde hair, blue eyes
She came on like a white lie
My wicked angel in mortal disguise
There's one in every crowd
Gonna make me shout aloud
How can I resist her
Haven't even kissed her
All I wanna do is
Pleasing you and say yes
Oh tell me "How can I resist her?"
Demon in lipstick, a beauty of nature
I'm only human and sometimes I hate you
Trembling at the knees
I can only say "Yes Please?"
How can I resist her
Haven't even kissed her
All I wanna do is
Pleasing you and say yes
Oh tell me "How can I resist her?"
How can I resist her?
Oh tell me "How can I resist her?"
How can I re, how can I re, how can I re...
How can I resist her?
Divine delinquent
Delicious and perverse
I want to touch you
Just once before I burst
How can I resist her?...
Oh tell me "How can I resist her?"
How can I re, how can I re, how can I re, how can I re
Oh how can I resist her?Embed
