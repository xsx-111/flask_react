I Got You LyricsI got you
And that's all I want
I won't forget
That's a whole lot
I don't go out
Not now that you're in
Sometimes we shout
But that's no problem
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
Look at you
You're a pageant
You're everything
That I've imagined
But something's wrong
I feel uneasy
You show me
Tell me you're not teasing
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell me you're not lying
There's no doubt
Not when I'm with you
When I'm without
I stay in my room
Where do you go
I get no answer
You're always out
It gets on my nerves
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying
But I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell me you're not lying
I don't know why sometimes I get frightened
You can see my eyes, you can tell that I'm not lying1Embed
