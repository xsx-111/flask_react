Two of a Kind LyricsDon't know about you
But I think that we're two of a kind
Because often as not, we agree do we not, don't you find
We got psychic communion
So I fail to see, why you and me
Can't be happy, happy
I don't want to irritate you
I don't need to read your mind
Honey can I help it if we are two of a kind
Time and again
All the best of good friends fall out
Black attracts like attracts trouble, resentment and doubt
You and me we got a problem
But I fail to see, why you and me
Can't be happy, happy
I don't want to irritate you
I don't need to read your mind
Honey can I help it if we are two of a kind
I don't want to irritate you
Don't think of it as a bind
Honey can I help it if we are two of a kind
(Do-do-do-doom do-do-do-do-do-doom do-do-doom)
We're two of a kind
And we're perfectly safe mind
Though I fail to see, why you and me
Can't be happy, happy
I don't want to irritate you
I don't need to read your mind
Honey can I help it if we are two of a kind
(Da-da-da-da...)
We're two of a kind...Embed
