Things LyricsYou stand around, scream and shout, for your pleasure
You hand me round, all your friends, makes them happy
And you ask me what it's all for
It's as simple as the ABC law
What the hell you asking me for
Cos everything I do I do for you
We'll entertain, every night, where's the party
Ask me to sing, pass the drinks, where's the money
And you ask me what it's all for
It's as simple as the ABC law
What the hell you asking me for
Cos everything I do I do for you, you, you
Everything I do I do for you, you, you
We'll entertain, every night, where's the party
Ask me to sing, pass the drinks, where's the money
And you ask me what it's all for
It's as simple as the ABC law
What the hell you asking me for
Cos everything I do I do for you
Cos everything I do I do for you
Everything I, everything I, everything I do I do for youEmbed
