Missing Person LyricsHome to sweet home, it just occurred to me
To be on my own, in search of bitter treats
I get so removed but you never notice it
Step in my shoes, you'll see that I don't fit
I walk home the wrong way
Hoping I'll go astray
I'd like to be a missing person
Eyes open wide, but all I see is black
You thought I was alright, just wait till you get back
There'll be no one home, and they'll stay up all night
Everyone I know, I'm wishing you goodnight
I walk home the wrong way
Hoping I'll go astray
I'd like to be a missing person
I wander the highways
Asleep in your doorways
I'm wanted, but I'm a missing person
And I fly by night, fighting to get away
On the neon lights I slip down alley ways
Only safe and sound when silence brings a chill
Now my back is turned, I know I can't stand still
I walk home the wrong way
This time I'll go astray
I'd like to be a missing home
I wander the highways
Asleep in your doorways
I'm wanted, but I'm a missing personEmbed
