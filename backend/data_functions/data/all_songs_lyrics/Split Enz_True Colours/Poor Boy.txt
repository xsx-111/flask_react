Poor Boy LyricsMy love is alien, I picked her up by chance
She speaks to me in ultra-high frequency
The radio band of gold
Gonna listen til I grow old
Oo hoo hoo what more can a poor boy do?
Oo hoo hoo what more can a poor boy do?
Oo hoo hoo hoo
The crackle of the radio
The message in the evening sky
You're looking at an interplanetary Romeo
I'll never see her face
Between us there's too much space
Oo hoo hoo what more can a poor boy do?
Oo hoo hoo what more can a poor boy do?
Oo hoo hoo hoo
(What more can a poor boy do?)
Keep losing you
What more can a poor boy do?
What more can a poor boy do?
What more, What more
What more can a poor boy do?
What more, What more
What more can a poor boy do?Embed
