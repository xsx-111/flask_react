Shark Attack LyricsLoves got teeth and she bites so hard
Leaving you for dead like a deadly shark
And she doesn't leave a lot to be saved
I was swimming in the harbour of your smile
Splashing in the ocean like a child
I didn't know what dangers lurked there
Just beyond the waves - Shark attack!
Well she chewed me up and she spat me out
I didn't want to meet a maneater
Shark attack!
Please don't mess around with me
I'm a shark fatality, in the sea
I'm the one with the bleeding heart
I thought you were a real lifesaver
And life for once would do me a favour
But babys just a butcher, and her teeth are razor sharp
Shark attack!
Well she chewed me up and she spat me out
I didn't want to meet a maneater
Shark attack!
And I'm lost at sea and I'm an amputee
And there was slaughter in the water when I fought her
Shark attack!
Hey!... Hey!.... Hey!..... Hey!!
Shark attack!
Well she chewed me up and she spat me out
I didn't want to meet a maneater
Shark attack!
Well I'm lost at sea and I'm an amputee
And there was slaughter in the water when I fought her
Shark attack!
Shark Attack! (repeatedly)
