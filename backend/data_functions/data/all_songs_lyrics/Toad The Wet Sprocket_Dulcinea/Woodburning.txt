Woodburning LyricsSay what I need I kick you down
No I'm fine, and don't you hang around
And I find myself here in another home
Where everything moves so slow
So tired
Take the longest day, throw it all away
I can't stand it but I can't do anything
Everyday's the same, nothing ever change
I can't stand it but I can't do anything
You should know by now we're all liars
Take me where you go, only higher
Take the longest day, waste it all away
I can't stand it but I can't do anything
Everyday's the same, nothing ever change
I can't stand it but I can't do anything
Can't do anything
Anything you want
Anything you want
Anything
Take the longest day, throw it all away
I can't stand it but I can't do anything
Everyday's the same, nothing ever change
I can't stand it but I can't do anything (x3)
Here in another home
Where everything moves so slow
So tiredEmbed
