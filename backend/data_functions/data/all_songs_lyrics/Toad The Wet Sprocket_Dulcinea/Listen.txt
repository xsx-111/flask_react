Listen LyricsWell I wonder, do we learn?
Seems we're making the same wrong turns
Call you sacred, call you obscene
Call you faithless, call you anything
Call and you listen
Listen (x3)
I'm a liar, so it seems
My desire could justify anything
So is there nothing that lies in between
This cold silence and a scream?
Scream, listen
Listen (x3)
Caught in headlines
We are frozen and cannot hide
There's no break, no time
If you can, I might
Call and you listen
