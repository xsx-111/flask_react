Fly from Heaven Lyrics
Paul is making me nervous
Paul is making me scared
Walk into this room and swaggers
Like he's God's own messenger
Change the name of my brother
Change the things that he said
Says that he speaks to him
But he never even knew the man
But I'd give my life for him

Like water through my hands
You give him any ending
But if he's all you say
Would he fly from heaven
To this world again
To this world again

Take whatever you're needing
Take whatever you can
We are broken from within
Run to another land (another land)

Like water through my hands
Or is it just beginning
But if he's all you say
Would he fly from heaven
To this world again
To this world again
They took my brother
The ripped him from me
To twist his words
As they did his body
Deny his family
Deny his beauty
To lay him down at the feet
Of those he couldn't save
Couldn't save
Couldn't save

Will it be the end
Or is he still ascending
But if he's all you say
Would he fly from heaven
To this world again
To this world againEmbed
