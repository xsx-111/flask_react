Inside LyricsFree my heart to feel again
Free my mind to understand
To run unfettered
Pull the blinders from my eyes
Let me see these endless skies
And drown here where I stand
In the beauty of the land
And all my life
It lay inside
For all my life
Tear this anger from my soul
Wash me clean and leave me whole
Leave me higher
Work my hands to make them strong
Lift my arms to carry on
That anywhere I go, to never be alone
And all my life
It lay inside
For all my life
We were always leaving
Since we started breathing
And running back, no wonder
We are torn asunder
To give me life
To give me life
To give me lifeEmbed
