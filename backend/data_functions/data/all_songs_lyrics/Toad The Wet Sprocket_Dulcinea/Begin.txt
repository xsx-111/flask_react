Begin LyricsAre you given vision, are you second sight?
Are you older than your life?
Eighty days of sorrow, endless more in sight
Still you, child, burn bright
And you see me crying again
And you hold out your little hand
Led me shaking to his room
I thought I'd never see again
Close the door behind you, turning out the light
Press a flashlight up against the wall
You say "This is how we knew him
In a little egg
It opened up and this is daddy now."
Now you're stepping back towards me
Till the room is bathing in light
And the answer there before me
There's no ending when we die
Are you sleeping here beside me?
Are you shining bright as the sky?
Are you breathing now inside me?
There's no ending when we dieEmbed
