Nanci LyricsI can't believe you
You bend your words like Uri Geller's spoons
Not quite safe here
When every judgement seems to smack of doom
Are you ok? I'm just fine
You take Nanci, for me Loretta's fine
A legal precedent could set us straight
But no one's brought up suit
And I'm assuming if they did
The point would still be moot
Are you joking? No I'm just fine
You take Nanci, for me Loretta's fine
No, I've changed my mind
I'll take nanci, for you Loretta's fine
And still we walk without quite seeing things
And I'll admit there's not that much to see
I will follow through
And expect that you will follow suit
And I can't believe you
You bend your words like Uri Geller's spoons
Not quite safe here
When every judgement seems to smack of doom
Are you ok? I'm just fine
You take Nanci, for me Loretta's fine
No, I've changed my mind
I'll take Nanci, for you Loretta's fine
Loretta's fine
Loretta's fineEmbed
