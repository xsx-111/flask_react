Stupid LyricsFour times he came by, I did not look
Talked about the reservoir, his thumbs were hooked
On his carpenter's belt, and he squinted in the sun
Smiled wide many times, I think I smiled back once
And it's frightening, oh
I didn't expect that from you
(Sun gets in your eyes)
It's blinding
Serious, are you seriously
I am feeling really stupid now
Last time on the fly, work had all been done
Sanding down the ceiling so it ends up in the rug
We were waiting in the bedroom till he finished up
One short hi and no goodbye
She said she knew him once
And it's frightening, oh
I didn't expect that from you
(Sun gets in your eyes)
It's blinding
Serious, are you seriously
I am feeling really stupid now
Stupid now
And it's frightening, oh
I didn't expect that from you
It's blinding
I can't see a thing I see I see
And I am really feeling stupid
I am really feeling stupid now
I am feeling really stupid nowEmbed
