Windmills Lyrics
I spend too much time
Raiding windmills
We go side by side
Laughing til it's right

There's something that you won't show
Waiting where the light goes

Take the darkest hour
Break it open
Water to repair
What we have broken

There's something that you won't show
Waiting where the light goes
Maybe anywhere the wind blows
It's all worth waiting for

Call on the porters to lighten the load
Tell all the passengers we're going home
I spend too much time
Seeking shelter
World without end couldn't hold her

There's something that you won't show
Waiting where the light goes
Maybe anywhere the wind blows
It's all worth waiting for
Anywhere the wind blowsEmbed
