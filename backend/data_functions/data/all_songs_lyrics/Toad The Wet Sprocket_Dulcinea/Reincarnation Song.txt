Reincarnation Song LyricsI thought I'd be alright today
Thought I'd be alive today
Give me your eyes, I'll show you things
You never dreamed you thought you'd see
I find myself in light I'd seen
In sleep sometimes or mescaline
And like the sun, you can't stare into
Very long without it blinding you
I thought this light would comfort me
I thought it would be easy
There's a tugging at my sleeve
And so much baggage I brought with me to leave
Something so big I can't understand
From trying to I would go mad
So I hurry back to little earth
For another life, another birth
Another life, another birth
Mother?Embed
