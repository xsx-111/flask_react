Carnt Sleep Lyrics
You know the hurt's so deep that I can't sleep or eat
And what I'm hoping for is, to feel your kisses sweet
If we could just talk things might be a little more clear
I really need the chance to explain the way I feel

I can't sleep (Can't sleep), thinking of you constantly
I can't sleep (Can't sleep), wishing you were here with me
I can't sleep (Can't sleep, where are you, baby)

When I get home from work, sit down and watch TV
The night falls just like a bad dream

I can't sleep (Can't sleep), thinking of you constantly
I can't sleep (Can't sleep), wishing you were here with me
I can't sleep (Can't sleep, where are you, baby?)
I can't sleep (Can't sleep), thinking of you constantly
I can't sleep (Can't sleep), wishing you were here with me
I can't sleep (Can't sleep, where are you, baby?)Embed
