Etienne Gonna Die LyricsYou only call? Well, let's go visit Mr. More. Your eight hundred, and I'll raise twenty-five hundred bucks
I can't stand it
South. I'm going south
South Street Seaport, the man says. Can't stand the heat, you can't stand it
You wanna play cards? The bet is two and a half thou
The bet? I'll tell you what the bet is. And I'll raise you six thousand dollars
You son of a bitch, you've been steamrolling over me all night! What are you trying to tell me? One card, you've got a flush, a full, what? I think you're bluffing, pal. I think you're trying to buy it
Then you're going to have to give me some respect, or give me some money
I think you're bluffing
What are you, Joe Capp? I didn't ask what you think. Raise, call, or fold
I should raise your ass. But I'm just gonna call
My marker's good for the money
What is this marker? Where are you from?
Where am I from? I'm from the United States Of Kiss My Ass!Embed
