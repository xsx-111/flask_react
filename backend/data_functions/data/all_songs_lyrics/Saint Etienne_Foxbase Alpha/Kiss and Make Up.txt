Kiss and Make Up LyricsWithout beforehand thinking
Sometimes I say things
I could never hate you
I could never hate you
I do not mean one
Word of what I say
I don't hate you
I don't, I do not
Let's kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's you and I
Kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's you and I
Kiss and make up
Without beforehand thinking
Sometimes I say things
I could never hate you
I could never hate you
I do not mean one
Word of what I say
I don't hate you
I love you
Let's kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's you and I
Kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's you and I
Kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's you and I
Kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's kiss and make up
Let's you and I
Kiss and make upEmbed
