Speedwell Lyrics(The vocals for this song are some lovely over-the-top male soulful pose singing. There are a few real words:)
Oh / yeah!
Didn't know / the reason why, / yeah, / yeah
Yo te quiero / Me haca falta tu amor /
Te necesito / te adoro /
Lo unico que yo quiero que tu hagas es a conocerme /
??? / ??? /
Tu seras para mi / yo sere para ti /
Lo unico que yo quiero que tu hagas es a conocerme /
(English translation: I love you, I need your love, I need you, I adore you, the only thing I want you to do is know me... you will belong yo me, I will belong to you, the only thing I want you to do is know me.)Embed
