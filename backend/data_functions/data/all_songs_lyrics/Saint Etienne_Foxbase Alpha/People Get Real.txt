People Get Real Lyrics(Intro announcement:)
Get on the floor and look real sexy!
Saw you
And when I saw you
I thought "This is real, this is real!"
Kissed you
And when I kissed you
I whispered "Forever, forever!"
I love the way
I love the way you move
I love the way
I love the way you move
Just lose yourself
Lose yourself in circles of sound
People get real
People get real
People get real!
Knowing
The way the way we are feeling
You told me that we'd turn clean
??? we turned clean
Talking
Taking advantage
The other side of your dreams
Of your dreams
Don't tell me
This is precious!
Don't tell me
This is soulful!
Well you have to be
Have to be kidding me on!
People get real
People get real
People get real!
So don't stop
Don't stop believing
No and don't stop
Don't stop believing
Just keep on, keep on, keep on believing it's here
People get real
People get real
People get real!Embed
