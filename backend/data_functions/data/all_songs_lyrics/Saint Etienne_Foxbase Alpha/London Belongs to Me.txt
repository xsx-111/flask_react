London Belongs to Me LyricsTook a tube to Camden Town
Walked down Parkway and settled down
In the shade of a willow tree
Someone hovering over me
Close my eyes, breathe out slowly
Today the sunshine (sunshine) loves me only
To the sound of the World of Twist
You leant over and gave me a kiss
It's too warm to even hold hands
But that won't stop us from making plans
Close our eyes, breathe out slowly
Today London (London) loves us only
Do you ever wonder where we've been?
Do you ever wonder where we're going?
Just close your eyes, just close your eyes
Just close your eyes (close your eyes)
And breathe out slowly (breath out slowly)
Tonight the world (the world) loves you only
Just close your eyes, just close your eyes
Just close your eyes, just close your eyesEmbed
