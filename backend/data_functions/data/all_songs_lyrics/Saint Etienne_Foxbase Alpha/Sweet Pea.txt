Sweet Pea LyricsSweet pea, apple of my eye
Don't know when and I don't know why
You're the only reason I keep on coming home
Sweet pea, what's all this about?
Don't get your way, all you do is fuss and pout
You're the only reason I keep on coming home
Unlike the Rock of Gibraltar
I always seem to falter
And the words just get in the way
Oh, I know I'm gonna crumble
I'm trying to stay humble
But I never think before I say
Sweet pea, keeper of my soul
I know, sometimes, I'm out of control
You're the only reason I keep on coming
You're the only reason I keep on coming, yeah
You're the only reason I keep on coming homeEmbed
