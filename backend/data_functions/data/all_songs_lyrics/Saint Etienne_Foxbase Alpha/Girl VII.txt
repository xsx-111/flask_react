Girl VII LyricsI'm writing you now from somewhere you won't find me
A different place, a different time
Together that summer, we raised some hell, yeah
But I couldn't forget, you're a kiss and tell
Carrie's got a boyfriend, Carrie's got a boyfriend
Carrie's got a boyfriend, Carrie's got a boyfriend
Carrie's got a boyfriend, Carrie's got a boyfriend
Carrie's got a boyfriend, Carrie's got a boyfriend
