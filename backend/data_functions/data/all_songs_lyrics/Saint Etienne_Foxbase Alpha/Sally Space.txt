Sally Space LyricsI know what you know
I'm never gonna let you go
You know and I know
They'll never gonna let you go
You'll never believe it
Come on, come on, let's go
You'll never believe it
Come on, come on
You'll never believe it
Come on, come on, come on
How would I feel
If you left me now?
How would I feel
Would some people wanna knock me out?
Never believe it
Come rain or snow
You'll never believe it
Come on, come on
You'll never believe it
Come on, come on, come on
And the rain falls down
And the rain falls down
And the rain falls down
And the rain falls down
And the rain falls down over me
And the rain falls down over me
And the rain falls down over me
And the rain falls down over meEmbed
