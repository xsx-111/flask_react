Nothing Can Stop Us Lyrics(Annoucement sample:)
"Thankyou, every - come on, give her a proper Liverpool hand, you can do better than that!
And now ladies and gentlemen, what you've been waiting for:"
(sung:) I've come a long way
(spoken:) I've come a long, long way since the day you walked into my life
(sung:) You walked into my life
(spoken:) You smoothed out all the rough edges with your sweet love and devotion
(sung:) I was tired
In love like a fool
(spoken:) I was tired of living the life of a fool
I was wondering where I'd gone wrong
(sung:) But I know
It's gonna work out fine
(spoken:) But I know it's gonna work out fine, when I see that look in your eyes
(sung:) Yeah!
I've never felt so good
I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now! (no no, no no)
(sung:) I've heard some people say
(spoken:) Yeah, nothing can stop us now
I've heard people say that a man who needs a woman is weak
(sung:) So wrong, oh so wrong
(spoken:) but they're so wrong, because nobody can hide from love
(sung:) Do, do you want to know?
(spoken:) Do you want to know, do you want to know something else that's true?
(sung:) It's true, it's true, the touch of your hand, oh
(spoken:) Just the touch of your hand, and I know we can make it
(sung:)
I've never felt so good
I've never felt so strong
Nothing can stop us now!
I've never felt so strong
I've never felt so good
Nothing can stop us now!
(whispered:) (nothing! nothing!...)Embed
