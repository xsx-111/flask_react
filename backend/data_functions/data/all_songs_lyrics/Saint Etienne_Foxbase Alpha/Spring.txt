Spring Lyrics
Dry your eyes, boy, there's no need to be sad
Forget about yesterday and the bad times that you've had
You've loved and lost and now you're feeling so blue
But can't you see it's me who really loves you
]
With the love I've got you'll forget about her
And find it easy to live without her

It's only springtime, ooh
You're too young to say you're through with love
It's only springtime and I'll be different boy
I promise you, I swear to you

Once more you tell me about her new friend
You say your heart's been broken again
How many times have you looked into my eyes
Don't you realise we're two of a kind
]
With the love I've got you'll forget about her
And find it easy to live without her
It's only springtime, hey
You're too young to say you're through with love
It's only springtime and I'll be different boy
I promise you, I swear to you

I've been watching all your love affairs
Three years now, don't you think I care
How many times have you looked into my eyes
Don't you realise we're two of a kind

It's only springtime
You're too young to say you're through, love
It's only springtime and I'll be different
I'll be different, boy, yeah
It's only springtime
You're too young to say
You're through, love, through with love
It's only springtime
I promise you, I swear you, ooh, I promise you
It's only springtime, ooh, ooh
It's only springtimeEmbed
