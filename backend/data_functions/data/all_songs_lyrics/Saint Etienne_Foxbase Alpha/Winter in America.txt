Winter in America LyricsWhen I come home in the evening
Cry at the silence waiting for me
And he brings me a warm cup with coffee
Instead of the love you know that I need
Wait, wait
Sometimes in winter, love can go astray
Lonely, don't you get lonely, don't you get lonely for me
He cradled my head as he held me
I swore I could feel the earth turning round
But love seemed to go with the season
Now touching you feels like rain coming down
Sometimes in winter, love can go astray
Lonely, don't you get lonely, don't you get lonely for me
Little girl, she stands alone
This is search until we find, gee
Now we're on the road to hell
Sometimes in winter, love can go astray
Lonely, don't you get lonely, don't you get lonely for me
For me, for me, for me
Deepest winter will set inEmbed
