Growing Old Is Getting Old LyricsSo we all are growing old and it's getting old
Pressure on our hollow bones and the varicose
Suddenly, we decompose, but we're not alone
So we all are growing old...
Maybe we're sealed in silence
And maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold, but I...
Memorized your smile lines when lips divide
Kept alive your childlike reaction time
We're allowed to expire with ourselves in mind
So we all are growing old...
Put out the fear of silence
And put out the need for guidance
And put out your own devices
And don't be afraid of the cold, and...
We sing, we sing, we sing
We fight, we fight, we fight
And then we cry, we cry, we cry
Then we slide, we slide, we slide into the light

Do we sing, we fight, we cry?
We slide, we slide, we slide into the light
Maybe we're sealed in silence
Maybe we feel a guidance
Maybe your own devices
Will keep you afraid and cold, well
Put out the fear of silence
Put out the need for guidance
Put out your own devices
Don't be afraid of the cold
Afraid of the cold, afraid over time
You've got nowhere to go but here2Embed
