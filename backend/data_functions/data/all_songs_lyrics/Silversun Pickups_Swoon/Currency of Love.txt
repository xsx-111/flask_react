Currency of Love Lyrics
Read between the lies
Of homespun advice
Nothing that you say
Let's carry on here
Seething day to day
It's not possible to fray
View it crumbling, wait
Please carry on here

Let's redesign the goings-on
Hey optimism anyone?

We believe the currency of love
We believe the push and pull's enough
Carefree, the beat'll pass it on
Please believe the currency of love

Watch your vital signs
Complete the no-holds guy
Value of the advised
Let's carry on here
Resupply
Okay fine, maybe you're right
It's so much more than I can take
Please carry on here

Let's redesign the goings-on
Hey optimism anyone?

We believe the currency of love
We believe the push and pull's enough
Carefree, the beat'll pass it on
Please believe the currency of love

Entertain you, rearrange you, forever claim you
It's demanding, not understanding, but everlasting
Let it soothe you, creep into you, and all that moves you
'Cause you're seeking, 'cause you're needing, so start believing

We believe the currency of love
We believe the push and pull's enough
Carefree, the beat'll pass it on
Please believe the currency of loveEmbed
