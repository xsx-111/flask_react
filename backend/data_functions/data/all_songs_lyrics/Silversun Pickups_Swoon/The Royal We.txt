The Royal We Lyrics
We are ready for the siege
We are armed up to the teeth
Be careful how you live and breathe
Release what's broken underneath

How many times do you wanna die?
How many ways do you wanna die?
To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

We can laugh about it now
But we hope everything works out
Be careful how you lick your wounds
Believe that change is coming soon

How many times do you want to die?
How many ways do you want to die?
To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Very carefully look over your shoulder

You used to do a little, but a little won't fly
Right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time
Can it please you still?
Were you named in your father's will?
Or does it make you ill?
Let us bruise their knees
We will aim straight for the feet
You will be relieved, so relieved, so relieved
To your full desire
Feel the sparks of the friendly fire
Misery inspires
Your throat has been cut several times before
Never noticed the size of the flow
It can't be ignored

To feel safe again look over your shoulder
Carefully look over your shoulder

You said you believe it, but believing won't fly
Right before you hit your prime
That's when we fell in love but not the first time
And when it's all over and you open your eyes
You'll see the room turned on its side
And you'll be lying by a note on the floor, signed:
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
The royal we
Love, the royal we1Embed
