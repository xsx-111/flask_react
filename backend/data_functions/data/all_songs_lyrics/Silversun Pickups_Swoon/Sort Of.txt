Sort Of LyricsDo you think I'm sort of alive?
Should I set these motives aside?
Do I feel? Well sort of, benign
When you walk your body through mine

What's keeping my tongue tied?
I see when you roll your eyes
I swear any moment you will hear
My spirit explode

When there's fire on the ground
Should it turn my whole world around?
When the wheel's in the lake
Should I think it's a big mistake?
When there's smoke in the sky
Please wake me, I don't know why
When your hand stretches out
Is it way beyond, way beyond my reach?
Do you think it's sort of a crutch
When you try to move me to touch
Do I shake? Well sort of, but not much
When the shades are summoned and crushed
What's keeping my tongue tied?
I see when you roll your eyes
I swear any moment you will hear
My spirit explode

When there's fire on the ground
Should it turn my whole world around?
When the wheel's in the lake
Should I think it's a big mistake?
When there's smoke in the sky
Please wake me, I don't know why
When your hand stretches out
Is it way beyond, way beyond my reach?
Reach
Keep reaching
For me
Does it make you nervous
When you hear my bones
Animate my body
Without my soul?

What's keeping my tongue tied?
I see when you roll your eyes
I swear any moment you will hear
My spirit explode
When there's fire on the ground
Should it turn my whole world around?
When the wheel's in the lake
Should I think it's a big mistake?
When there's smoke in the sky
Please wake me, I don't know why
When your hand stretches out
Is it way beyond, way beyond my reach?1Embed
