Draining Lyrics
You ask me to be stone again
Been wading out here for awhile
At least the weight could be the end
But not likely

And it's draining
And it's draining

You see my shadow coming in
Dirty sheets pulled to your chin
Maybe now we can begin
But not likely

And it's draining
And it's draining
And we're evading
And it's draining

You've asked me before
You've asked me to consider operating
We've been here before
We've been here though the delivery's no good
And we'll leave it alone
We'll leave it, that's when we start repeating
And don't ask anymore
Don't ask me, the delivery's no good

And it's draining
And it's draining
And we're evading
And it's draining
And it's draining
And it's drainingEmbed
