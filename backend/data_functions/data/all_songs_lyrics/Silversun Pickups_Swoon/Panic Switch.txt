Panic Switch Lyrics
Time is never worth my time
Blue shine bleeds into my eyes
I still sleep on the right side
But white noise can't leave the scene behind

Could I be anything you want me to be?
If so, is it meant to be seen?

When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?
When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

I'll try to hold on tight tonight
Pink slip inviting me inside
Want to burn skin and brand what once was mine
But the red views keep ripping the divide
If I go everywhere you want me to go
How will I know you'll still follow?

When you see yourself in a crowded room?
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?
When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?

I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating...


I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
I'm waiting and fading and floating away
Waiting and fading, waiting and fading
When you see yourself in a crowded room?
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol-whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Can you fall asleep with a panic switch?
When you see yourself in a crowded room
Do your fingers itch? Are you pistol whipped?
Will you step in line or release the glitch?
Do you think she'll sleep with a panic?2Embed
