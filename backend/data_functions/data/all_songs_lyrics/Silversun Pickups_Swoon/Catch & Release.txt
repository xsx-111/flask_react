Catch & Release Lyrics
Pardon me
Wanna live in a fantasy
Quietly
Show you everything you’ll ever need
I hope you’ll take it
I know you’re faking just a little bit
C’mon and taste it
Just get excited cause you’re giving in

Come and see
How the wind in your hair will feel differently
Catch and release
The lure above

Here we are
In the bathwater overflow
Later on
Don’t say I didn’t tell you so
Maybe I didn’t but you’ve taken it
Knew you were faking just a little bit
Now that you’ve tasted
No need to fight it cuz you’ve given in
Follow me
Down the streams of sweat on your body
Can’t believe the lure was enough

Knew you'd see
How the wind in your hair now feels differently
Catch and release
The lure above

Who knows how this feeling grows
Was it truly worth
Truly worth the starting
Who knows why the engine’s blown
Hope it’s truly worth
Truly worth the parting

Follow me
Down the streams of sweat on your body
Can’t believe the lure was enough

Do you see
How the wind in your hair now feels differently
Catch and release
The lure above
Guess the lure was enough
Guess the lure was enough
Yes the lure was enough1Embed
