The Falconer Lyrics
The falconer is sitting on
His summer sand at dawn
Unlocking flooded silver cages
And with a silvered in her eyes
All the lovely faces
And the lovely silver traces erase
My empty pages

The falconer is sitting on
His summer sand at dawn
Beside his singing silver waves
And his dancing rebel race
That compose ahead of timeless time
A sound inside my candle light

Father, child
Angels of the night
Silver frame
My candlelight
Father, child
Angels of the night
Silver frame
My candlelight
The falconer is sitting on
His summer sand at dawn
Unlocking flooded silver cages
And with a silvered in her eyes
All the lovely faces
And the lovely silver traces erase
My empty pages4Embed
