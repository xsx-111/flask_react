Afraid Lyrics
Cease to know, or to tell, or to see
Or to be your own
Cease to know, or to tell, or to see
Or to be your own
Have someone else's will as your own
Have someone else's will as your own
You are beautiful, and you are alone
You are beautiful, and you are alone

Often the adolescent play
Reward your grace
Often the adolescent play
Reward your grace
Confuse your hunger, capture the fake
Confuse your hunger, capture the fake
Banish the faceless, reward your grace
Banish the faceless, reward your grace2Embed
