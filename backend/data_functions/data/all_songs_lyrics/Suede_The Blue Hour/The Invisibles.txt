The Invisibles Lyrics
The world waits for you when
And the dawn breaks for you when
And the media will watch
And she will change her mind
I tried to win for you when
I shed my skin for you when
I loved you like my own
I fed you like a child

Stay in bed and feed the day
With my imagination, honey
Falling through the cracks in people's kindness
And the world won't step aside
I tried to make you want me
I left my home at seventeen
But everywhere I looked I saw
Another me

And we are the invisibles
Plain and lonely
It's funny how it's always out of reach
I hear the wood pigeons and
I call my father in and
He sits and hears me sing
But never wonders why
Why do I call out in the night
He found the photos set alight
Everything about her
Makes me want to smile

I'll stay in bed and feed the day
With my polite conversation, father
Papering the cracks in others' silence
But I still won't step aside
I tried to make her want me
I tried to play her politics
But every step I took
I had to swallow this

But we are the invisibles
Strange and lonely
It's funny how it's always out of reach
It's funny how it's always out of reach
It's funny how we're always out of reachEmbed
