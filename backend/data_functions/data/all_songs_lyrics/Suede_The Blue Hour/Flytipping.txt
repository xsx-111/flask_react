Flytipping Lyrics
We'll play on the road
Flytipping, careful as you go
And we'll watch as the lorries
Transport their precious loads

With a bag in our hands
Flytipping, me and my patient man
Just by the hard shoulder
This few who've understood

What is my name, what is yours?
Do we own these things, what has it all been for?
Flytipping on the road of course
What is yours and what is us?
Do we fool ourselves with all those pretty words?
Flytipping on the road with her

And I'll take you to the Fir trees
As the paper drifts like falling snow

Under the trees
Two hunters looking for ivory
Discard their possessions
Cast them to the breeze
'Cause the worms in the ground
And the crows as they circle round
Don't need these things to cling to
For a homestead playground

What is my name, what is yours?
Do we own these things, what has it all been for?
Flytipping on the road of course
Shiny things that turn into rust
So we show ourselves with all this pretty stuff
Flytipping feels like just enough

And I'll take you to the verges
By the nettles, by the roundabout
And I'll pick you wild roses
In the tunnels like the underpassEmbed
