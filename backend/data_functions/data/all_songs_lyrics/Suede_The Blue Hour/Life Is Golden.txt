Life Is Golden Lyrics
The same blood runs through your veins
The same strange way of talking
The same thoughts sink through your pillow
The same crooked smile

You're not alone
Look up to the sky and be calm
You're not alone
Look into the light and be heard
You're never alone
Your life is golden
Golden

The same blood runs through your veins
But you have the light of your mother
She holds her love to her
Tender breast

You're not alone
Look up to the sky and be calm
You're not alone
Look into the light and be heard
You're never alone
Your life is golden
Golden
You're not alone
When the the world puts all the winter in you
You're not alone
I'm there in the words that you use
You're never alone
Your life is golden
Golden

And they won't love you tonight
Clap along to the resurrection
Carve your name in my tender skin
With your beautiful words
With your beautiful words

You're not alone
Look up to the sky and be calm
You're not alone
Look into the light and be heard
You're never alone
Your life is golden
Golden
You're not alone
'Cause the same thoughts I have in my head
You're not alone
With the city wind in your hair
You're never alone
Your life is golden
