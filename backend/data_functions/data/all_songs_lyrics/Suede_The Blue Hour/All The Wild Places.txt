All The Wild Places Lyrics
Take her cold hands
Place the snowdrops in her palms
And pushing through the wire
I have no choice but to follow you
Feel the weak sunlight on my skin
As I take my spade and place her
Forever by the birch trees

And there was another
But she wasn't tamed
With the buzz of the flies
With a flick of her mane
And there was another
But she wasn't you, you, you

Out of all the wild places I love
Out of all the wild places I love
Out of all the wild places I love
You are the most desolate

Faith is scattered like the birds
She would never bend to their
Commandments in life
Her freckled skin couldn't bear the weight
Take her cold hand by the lake
Place the spade into my amorous arms
As I lie my coat down for her one more time
And there was another
But she wasn't changed
With the buzz of the flies
With the flick of her mane
And there was another
But we won't see her again, again, again

Out of all the wild places I love
Out of all the wild places I love
Out of all the wild places I love
Yours is the most desolateEmbed
