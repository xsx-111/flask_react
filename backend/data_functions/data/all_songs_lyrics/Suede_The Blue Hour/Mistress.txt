Mistress Lyrics
On a day without a night
Eyes the green of seawater
And skin so white
You're nothing like my mother
Do you hold him like her?
Do you need him like her?
Is he all that you've got?
Oh

So you stayed with him again
You fled with him
And travelled in his car now, you're late
To be with him and hold him
He loves you like words
He needs you like words
You're not all that he's got
But you're all that he wants

Mistress stay with him
Don't tell the neighbours
They don't mean a thing
Now you're in love
You're in love
By the camber of the road
Celebrate your differences
Free your ghosts
Be with him and hold him
He doesn't love you like her
He doesn't need you like her
You're not all that he's got
But you're all that he wants

Mistress stay with him
I won't tell the neighbours
They don't mean a thing
Now you're in love
You're in love
You're in love
(He said)
Mistress stay with me
Don't tell the people
They don't need to see
You're in love
You're in love
You're in love
