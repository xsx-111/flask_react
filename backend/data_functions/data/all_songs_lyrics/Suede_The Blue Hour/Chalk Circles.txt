Chalk Circles LyricsRing-rounds, stairways, roundabouts
I will pick you up
Watching traffic heading south
I will pick you up
With your money in your face
I will pick you up
Friendship bracelets on your wrist
I will pick you up
Oh with our feet in the snow
Oh where nobody goes
Oh we'll feel like giving
Go where the silence goes
Oh where the strange ones will play
Oh chalk circles and clay
Oh we'll feel like giving
Go where the silence goes
Go where the silence goes
Ring-rounds, stairways, roundabouts
I will pick you upEmbed
