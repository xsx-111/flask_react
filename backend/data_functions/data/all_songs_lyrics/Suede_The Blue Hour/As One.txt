As One Lyrics
Oh I'm your blue eyed boy
I'll suffer your indifference and
You can teach me pretty words
We will feed the sparrows

Here I am
Here I am
Talking to my shadow
Head in my hands
Here I am (here I am)
Here I am (here I am)
Run to the hill
Counting the hay

He leads me through swaying nettles
Growing by the underpass
When he smiles he looks like a fox
But when he holds me we will be as one
As one
As one
As one

Here I am
Here I am
Talking to my shadow
Head in my hands
Here I am (here I am)
Here I am (here I am)
Run to the hill
Counting the hayEmbed
