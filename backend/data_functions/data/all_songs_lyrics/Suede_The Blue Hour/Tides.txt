Tides Lyrics
Tides are pulling
Pulling me back to you
Dragging me under
Making me new
It's making me scared
I don't know where it's going

Clothed in pale gray
Rolling like driftwood
Waving at planes
I feel it against my paper cuts
And I'm holding onto nothing
Clinging to the voids as I'm riding the waves
It's making me new again

Like a rain of bombs we'll fall to you
Through the blue, through the blue

Tides are pulling me
I'm lost in the pale rain
I'm clutching at debris
I'm trying to stay awake
The water level rises
I'm miles from the shore now
And I'm riding the waves
Dragging me under again
Like a rain of bombs we'll fall to you
Through the blue, through the blue
Like a rain of bombs we'll drop from the sky
A rain of fire, a rain of fire

Tides are pulling
Pulling me back to you
Taking my hand
Dragging me under
It's wonderful
It's wonderful
Pulling me under
Pulling me through

Tides are pulling
Pulling me back to you
Taking me over
Making me new
It's wonderful
It's wonderful
Pulling me under
Pulling me back to youEmbed
