Hellbelly LyricsI'm not afraid to die
I'm just scared of going to hell
Your car salesman smile
Says it all
You just wanna be
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Old, twisted and white
Dead crow on a fence is you style
You play with your kids
Says it all
You just wanna be
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Fire, fire, fire, hell
Fire, fire, fire, hell
Fire, fire, fire, hell
Fire, fire, fire, hell
You're a tin god
Take a look at those gaps in your palms
Gimme those nails
Bang them in
Bang them in!
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the suffering
Jesus without the sufferingEmbed
