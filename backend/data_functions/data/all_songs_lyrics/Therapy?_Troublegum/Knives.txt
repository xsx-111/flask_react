Knives LyricsMy girlfriend says
That I need help
My boyfriend says
I'd be better off dead
I'm gonna get drunk
Come round and fuck you up
I'm gonna get drunk
Come round and fuck you up
And you can't help my life
But you can hide... the knives
My girlfriend says
That I'm confused
My boyfriend says
That I'm bad news
All people are shit
Bad trip tattoed on my brain
All people are shit
Bad trip tattoed on my brain
And you can't help my life
But you can hide...
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
I wanna crawl up inside you and die
And you can't help my life
But you can hide the knives
And you can't help my life
But you can hide... the knivesEmbed
