Unrequited LyricsDon't wake me
I'm so empty
I, I, I tried
I'm sorry
I've seen you without me
I've seen you without me
You can say what you want
I've seen you without me
I've seen you without me
I've seen you without me (I know that you'll understand)
I've seen you without me (I know that you'll understand)Embed
