Screamager Lyrics
With a face like this I won't break any hearts
And thinking like that I won't make any friends

Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to think about anything like that
Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to know about anything like that

I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you

Your beauty makes me feel alone
I look inside but no one's home

Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to think about anything like that
Screw that
Forget about that
I don't want to know about anything like that

I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you
I've got nothing to do, but hang around and get screwed up on you

But get screwed up on you
But get screwed up on youEmbed
