Lunacy Booth LyricsReveal yourself to me like cheap pornography
Picking at my guilt with promises of hell
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
Glad my mirror's broken, my image is a burden
I want to lose myself in the coming of the Lord
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
Reveal yourself to me (I wanna lose myself)
Reveal yourself to me (I wanna lose myself)
Reveal yourself to me (I wanna lose myself)
Reveal yourself to me (I wanna lose)
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed)
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
(Christ) sin (revealed), it's all that you know
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as me
You're just the same as meEmbed
