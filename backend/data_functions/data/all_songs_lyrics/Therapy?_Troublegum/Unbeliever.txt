Unbeliever LyricsDon't belong in this world or the next one
Wasting every day to my own end
Feeling awkward, feeling clumsy, hating
Everything I've ever done before
Then you leave me
Like the others
Leave me too much time... on my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
Had enough of reinventing memories
Living in the shadow of your charm
The shrapnel of your insults burried deeper
Than confidence can ever overcome
Then you leave me
Like the others
Leave me too much time... on my own
On my own
On my own
I'm on my own
Choking on anticipation waiting
On you to say something to bring me back
All I want's a trace of recognition
Your silence is as heavy as my eyes
Then you leave me
Like the others
Leave me too much time... on my own
On my own
On my own
On my own
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own
On my ownEmbed
