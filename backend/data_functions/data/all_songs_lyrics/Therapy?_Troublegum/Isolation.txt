Isolation LyricsEvery evening, every day
Calling for love that's from above
Everyone wanting it for real
Expecting devotion and love
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Surrender to self preservation
And others who cannot themselves
Life has been touched to perfection
A face is like anything else
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Mother I tried, do believe me
I'm doing the best things that I can
I'm ashamed of the things that I've been put through
I'm ashamed of the person who I am
But if you could just see the beauty
These things I could never describe
Pleasurable ways of distraction
This is my wanting cry
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
Isolation, isolation
