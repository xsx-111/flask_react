Turn LyricsTurn and face the strange
The door is open, you're awake
You're storming heaven without thought
You're storming heaven without God
Remember, I know where you live
And I know you're on your own
I may forget, I don't forgive
I'm always home
You turn and face the strange
You turn and face yourself
I know when you lie
The brightness darkens in your eyes
This is yours to take control
This is yours, now hold your own
Remember, I know where you live
And I know you're on your own
I may forget, I don't forgive
I'm always home
You turn and face the strange
You turn and face yourself
Barging into the presence of God
Barging into the presence of God
Barging into the presence of God
Barging into the presence of God
(You turn) Barging into the presence of God
(You turn) Barging into the presence of God
(You turn) Barging into the presence of God
(You turn) Barging into the presence of God
(You turn) Barging into the presence of GodEmbed
