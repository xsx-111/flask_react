Trigger Inside LyricsHere comes a girl with perfect teeth
I bet she won't be smiling at me
I know how Jeffrey Dahmer feels
Lonely, lonely
I was awkward as a child
Blueprint for my wretched life
Confidence I've been denied
Lonely, lonely
Something in my head
It won't switch off when I'm alone
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I get the feeling I've been cheated
My hands are shaking, my head's a mess
Trying to wring some words from my breath
I die before you, you're not impressed
Lonely, lonely
I look uglier when I cry
Want to punch that look from your life
One in the eye for the beautiful people
Lonely, lonely
Something in my head
It won't switch off when I'm alone
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I get the feeling I've been cheated
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I got a trigger inside
I get the feeling I've been cheated
Cheated
Cheated
Cheated
Huh!Embed
