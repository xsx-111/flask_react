Die Laughing LyricsGimme something to breathe
Give me a reason to live
Close your eyes and see
What you have inside
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane
Now the dream is gone
And your friends just tell you lies
Then you realise
You're gonna die anyway
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane
Lost in a world with no reality
I'm frightened to move
I'm frightened to speak
And I will kill for a good night's sleep
I'm feeling, I'm feeling dead, dead, dead, dead
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane, I can't remember my own name
I think I've gone insane
I can't remember
I can't remember
I can't remember
I can't rememberEmbed
