Nowhere LyricsHeaven kicked you out
You wouldn't wear a tie
Staring at some pictures by yourself
At something that you want to have but will never get
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
You get drunk every night
You can't get drunk on life
Shouting at the world you'll never change
But it's what's inside you've got to rearrange
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Heaven kicked you out
Heaven kicked you out
Breaking up for what you never have
Losing everything all things you ever had
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhere
Going nowhereEmbed
