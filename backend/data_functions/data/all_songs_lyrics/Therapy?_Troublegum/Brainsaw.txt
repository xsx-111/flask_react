Brainsaw LyricsJudas, judas, I thought you were my friend
Judas, judas, you're just the same as them
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
Liar, liar, you said you'd stay with me
Liar, liar, laughing as you leave
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I thought you were my friend
You're just the same as the rest
I thought you were my friend
You're just the same as the rest
User, user, you sucked it all from me
User, user, your bullshit I believed
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm alone
I'm in hell and I'm aloneEmbed
