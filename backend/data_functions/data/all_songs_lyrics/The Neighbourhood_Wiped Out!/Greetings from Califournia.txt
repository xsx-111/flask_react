Greetings from Califournia Lyrics
Ooh, I know once you come to California
You won't ever look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in

Hands up, it's a stick up
Nobody's leaving this room for a minute
Everyone's breathing these fumes that are in it
Sick of the people who make the decisions
Put your hands up, it's a stick up
Hopefully God is still down to forgive us
Nobody's breathing, who let the evil in?

What's in the water?
Are you bothered?
What's the problem here?

Ooh, I know once you come to California
You won't ever look back
Ooh, Just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in
I can feel it go down
I can feel it go down all the way, all the way
Give it to me slow now
Give it to me slow then wash away
It comes and comes away

Ooh, I know once you come to California
You will never look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder

Handcuffed and I thought of you
I made love and I thought of you
My daddy died, I just thought of you
My sister cried and my mama too
I got a place and I thought of you
I tried to decorate and I thought of you
I'm seeing red but I'm singing blue
I never knew what black and white would fade into
Anybody, somebody, please
I'm begging, I'm even on my knees
I've got a dozen insecurities
But I don't think you should be worried for me
No, I don't think you should be worried for me
Ooh, I know once you come to California
You won't ever look back
Ooh, just a little bit can make you wonder
You got it in19Embed
