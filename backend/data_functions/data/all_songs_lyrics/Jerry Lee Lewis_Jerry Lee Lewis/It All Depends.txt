It All Depends LyricsThe kind of life you're living
Since  you left me
I'm  sure is not the life
You thought you chose
That honky-tonky world
Is  not so flashy
Bright  lights and booze is
All it really knows
Long  ago, you held
High baby's bottle
But the one you're holding now
A different kind
You  just set away to
Be somebody's baby
And it all depends on
Who will buy the wine
Whoever sets them up
And tips the waitress
Your kind of love
Just well be blind
You'll never know who's
Lips you'll soon be kissing
And it all depends on
Who will buy the wine
Whoever sets them up
And tips the waitress
Your kind of love just
Well be blind
You'll never know who's
Lips you'll soon be kissing
And it all depends on
Who will buy the wineEmbed
