Ubangi Stomp LyricsWell I rocked over Italy and rocked in Spain
Rocked in Memphis, it was all the same
Well, I rocked through Africa and roll of the ship
And seen them natives doin' a hot-lookin' skip
I parted the weeds and looked over the swamp
I seen them cats doin' the Ubangi stomp
Ubangi-stomp with rock and roll
Beats anything that's ever been told
Ubangi stomp, Ubangi style
When it hits, it's gonna drive a cool cat wild
Well I looked up the chief, he invited me in
He said, a hey big jam session's 'bout to begin
He handed me a tom-tom, I picked up that beat
That crazy thing sent shivers to my feet
I rocked and I rolled and I skipped with a smile
Done the Ubangi stomp till I rolled over dead
Well we rocked all night and part of the day
Had a good rockin' time with the chief's daughter May
I was makin' a time and a-gettin' to know
Then the captain said, son, we gotta go
I said that's alright, you go right ahead
I'll do the Ubangi stomp 'till I roll over deadEmbed
