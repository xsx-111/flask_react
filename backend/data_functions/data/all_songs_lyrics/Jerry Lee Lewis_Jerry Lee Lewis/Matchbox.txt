Matchbox LyricsI've been a-sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes
I've been sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I got a long way to go
I'm an ol' poor boy ain't got no home
I'm an ol' poor boy and I'm a a long long way from home
Everything I do certainly turns out mighty wrong
Well, if you don't like my peaches, honey, please don't shake my tree
If you don't like Jerry's peaches, don't pull around on this tree
I got news for you baby
I'll leave you here in misery
Yes I'm a-sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes
I've been sitting here wondering, will a matchbox hold my clothes
I ain't got no matches, but I got a long way to goEmbed
