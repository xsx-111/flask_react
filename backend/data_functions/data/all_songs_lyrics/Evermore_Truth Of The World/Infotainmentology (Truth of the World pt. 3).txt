Infotainmentology (Truth of the World pt. 3) LyricsTruth of the world
Truth of the world
Thanks for tuning in again
This is Donovan Earl your friend
With a promise not to pander
To the radical propaganda
We're making no apology
We bring you infotainmentology
So if you don't want to
Let your health
Confront lies your wealth
Truth is it's on the shelf
Fast acting on your sorrows
A little pepper for tomorrow
We give you the truth
In a pill you can swallow
Everybody says
Stay tuned in
Truth lies within
So get ready for the spin
In a world of doubt of fear
Don't believe everything you hear
Unless you heard it here
We pay a lot for the economy
By printing more money
Then go on a spending spree
Cos freedom don't come for free
But you can watch it all on Pearl
Every night on truth of the world
So where have you been?
Now politics is in
Join the party that's going to win
Cos' everybody's doing it
It's fun so don't going ruin it
They've been endorsed
By truth of the world
We interrupt this bulletin
Something just came in
There's a killer loose
On our streets again
A man on the ground
Said she's 81 with a walking frame
And the sound of shotgun
Lock your doors
Let no-one in
But most importantly
Stay tuned in
Truth of the world
Truth of the world
Truth of the worldEmbed
