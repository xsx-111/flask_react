The Lonely Ones LyricsDid you hear about the lonely ones
Who spend their days hid from the sun
Where the spotlight never shone
Where no one's eyes ever will fall or rest upon?
So we feed them their dreams
Between the lines upon the screens
Just a lonely boy in a lonely home
He's the lonely one, not the only one
Just a broken boy, in a broken home
He's the broken one, the unspoken one
Just a broken girl, living in a broken world
She's the broken one, not the only one
Lonely boys, lonely girls
They're all tuning in to Truth of the WorldEmbed
