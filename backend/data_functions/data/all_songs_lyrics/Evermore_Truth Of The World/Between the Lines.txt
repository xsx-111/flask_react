Between the Lines LyricsI caught a glimpse of past and future but I did not understand
Darkness and light, blindness and sight, not everything is so black and white
Separate the truth from lies with the stories written between the lines
Only you can tell the wrong from right
The more you look the more you find
Close your eyes and drift away where the lights are taking you no one can say
In the depths of the your mind, looking for a sign written in between the lines
With canyons stretched below us, the stars will be our guide
We'll tear the mountains from the sea and fall into the sky
We'll drift into the airwaves between the earth and moon, where satellites are sending visions down into your room
Separate the truth from lies with the stories written between the lines
Only you can tell the wrong from right
The more you look the more you find
Close your eyes and drift away where the lights are taking you no one can say
In the depths of the your mind, looking for a sign written in between the linesEmbed
