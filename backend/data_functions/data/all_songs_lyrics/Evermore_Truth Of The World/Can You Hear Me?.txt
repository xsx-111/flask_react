Can You Hear Me? LyricsCan you hear me?
The first thing that I notice, the radio went dim
I feel the pressure rising as the water's creeping in
Rushing through the window in a flood of images
Is this my imagination, can you tell me if it is?
Drowning in the static of a thousand whispered doubts
I need to break the silence before my oxygen runs out
So can you hear me?
"Can you hear me?"
As I call in to this dark and lonely passage, am I getting it through?
Because all I want to do is get a message from me to you
The clock is running backwards, the roof is caving in
I can't see where I'm going, and I can't go where I've been
It's like I'm out there somewhere in the some distant memory
Sitting in the corner watching my life on TV
I'm fighting catatonic to be heard above the noise
And all that I have left is the echo of my voice
Can you hear me?
"Can you hear me?"
As I call in to this dark and lonely passage, am I getting it through?
Because all I want to do is get a message from me to you
Peace be the day dawning
Light in the winter I am falling

"Can you hear me? Wherever you are?
The clouds are lifting, the sun is breaking through
We are coming out of the darkness
We are coming into a new world"
As I call into this dark and lonely passage, am I getting it through?
In closing the show, another crash on our roads
There's broken glass on the ground, but no body's been found
This is Donovan Earl, until next time you're on Truth of the WorldEmbed
