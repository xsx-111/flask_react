Plugged In Lyrics"The world we are now seeing is a vision
Does it seem strange, unbelievable?
Sunshine, trees, hills and valleys, flowers and flowing streams
This world of tomorrow is a world of beauty
These eternal things, wrought by God, are lovely and unchanging"
"Come, let's travel into the future, what will we see?"
Just a lonely boy... I just want some more...
"A greater world, a better world, a world which always will move forward
Man has forged ahead, new and better things have sprung from his industry and his genius"
The past and future... Welcome to the show...
"The greater and better world of tomorrow"
Can you hear me?... Someone listen... Tell me, tell me...
"And now we have arrived in this wonder world of the future"Embed
