Girl with the World on Her Shoulders LyricsCriminals, doctors, cynics and believers
Preachers, teachers, murderers and bankers
The faithless and the Pope
The weight of our hope
On the girl with the world on her shoulders
The actor in the wings, to the
Mocking bird that sings
From the bottom of the sea, to the penthouse suite
As I turn to walk away, I overheard her say
"We're all in here together"
Love, hate, coincidence, fate
We trust, we lie, we live and we die
No matter who you are just cannot escape
That we're all in here together
Love, hate, coincidence, fate
We trust, we lie, we live and we die
I overheard her say
"you just cannot escape
We're all in here together."
The ships on the harbour, the city's so tall
All that rise will eventually fall
There's nothing you can do
No nothing at all, for the girl
With the world on her shoulders
Making our way through space and time
Warmed by the sun, making love to the moon
We're spinning each day
And we make some mistakes
But we're all in here togetherEmbed
