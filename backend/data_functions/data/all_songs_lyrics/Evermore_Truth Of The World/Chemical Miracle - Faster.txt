Chemical Miracle / Faster LyricsPhysical, mathematical, cynical, political
Spiritual, ritual, chemical, miracle...
My friends, how do you feel?
"Feeling all right"
Well you could always feel a little bit better
Do you feel a little dizzy?
"Yes, a little dizzy"
Do you feel a little tired?
"Yes, a little tired"
This'll make you feel better
Really feel better tonight
It's called Truthogen
"they call it Truthogen"
It's called Truthogen
And it's your new best friend
Tonight, I know where I should go
As it all becomes so slow...
Tell me, where did you go?
You said, "Life just seemed too slow."
Distant voices telling me to go... Faster
Just a little faster, just a little faster
Just a little faster, just a little faster...
And the faster I go, never, never, never
Seemed so slow. And the faster I go
Never seemed, never seemed so slow
Never seemed so slow...
Everything I've ever seen
And all the place I have been
