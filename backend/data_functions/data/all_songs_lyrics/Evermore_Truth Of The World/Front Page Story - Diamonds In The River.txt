Front Page Story / Diamonds In The River LyricsThis ain't no front page story
There's no fight, no hear, no glory
There's no politician caught with his pants low
There's no supermodel slipping at the fashion show
There's no overnight miracle for sale
There's no bubblegum pixie thrown in jail
This ain't no front page story
I could try and tell it but I know they'll ignore me
Tell me little soldier, future gone to rust
Your finger on the trigger, who is there to trust?
There's diamonds in the river, there's oil in the dust
And all that they've delivered
Is a history writ in blood
Tell me, tell me, how long will this go on?
They're coming in there thousands
Tipping up the scales
Wheels are set in motion
Woman, child for sale
They came with guns and blew away
The little light you'd stored away
Everything left in disarray
Under a sky gun-metal grey
Tell me, tell me, how long will this go on?
This is no bed time story
This is no distant memory
There's no hollywood ending
This is real...
Tell me, tell me, how long will this go on?Embed
