Join the Party Lyrics(This message brought to you by The Party, in association with Truth Core)
Come on, join The Party
Pick up the phone
We know you're home
Come on, join The Party
Were watching you
We think you'll do
Come on, we'd like to meet you
We'll keep you warm
Just fill out this form
Have you ever wanted, to lose yourself, in the crowd
To be one of the number, feel the music, who you wonder, hear the sound
(The Party welcomes you)
You're on your way, come and join the campaign, we want you
The Party welcomes you
There are others out to get you, don't worry, we'll protect you, that's the truth
The party welcomes youEmbed
