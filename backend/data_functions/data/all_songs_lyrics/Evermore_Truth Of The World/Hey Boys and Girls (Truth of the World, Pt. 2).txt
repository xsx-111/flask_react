Hey Boys and Girls (Truth of the World, Pt. 2) Lyrics
(Yeah)
We're interrupting transmission
Because we happen to know
There's something that you've been missing
Welcome to the show
We're all set to go

So come on (come on)
Come on (come on)

What d'ya wanna hear first
The bad news or the worst?
We're here to entertain
So disconnect your brain

Hey boys and girls
This is truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
You're all truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
Believe truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
Trust in truth of the world
We got the guns and the glory
And this bullet comes with a kiss
We got celebrity stories
So get a load of this
This you can not miss

So come on (so come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)
Come on (come on)

What d'ya wanna hear first
The bad news or the worst?
We're here to entertain
And anaesthetise your brain

Hey boys and girls
Watch truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
Nothing like truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
Stay with truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
Be right back with truth of the world

Truthagen, truthagen, truthagen makes me happy
My mom got me Truthagen, truthagen, truthagen
Now I'm awesome, wow
We have it for lunch and tea every day, truthagen

What do you want to hear first
The bad news or the worst?
We're here to entertain
And keep you coming back again

Hey boys and girls
Enjoy truth of the world
Hey boys and girls
Keeping up with truth of the world

We got celebrities
In the club with neo-Nazis
Got by the paparazzi
Don't worry, we just planted some trees
(Hey boys and girls)
La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la
(Hey boys and girls)
La la la la la la la la, La la la la la la la
Hey boys and girls, Join in
La la la la la la la
