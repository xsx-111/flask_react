Bad To Be Good LyricsThere's an alley cat slowly walkin' down a dirty street
Watching a cop on the take marching to his city beat
You got five fingers Johnny stealing everything in sight
You gotta be bad to be good in the dead of the night
Wow, kick it
You're dancing in fire, baby
When you're takin' it to the streets yeah to the streets
Better watch your back baby, better be fast on your feet
Yes on your feet
'Cause they're wheelin' dealin' cheatin' stealin'
Child you're gonna learn
You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that so say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night
When you got nothin' baby
You got nothin' to lose, nothin' to lose
It's an eye for an eye baby
And a tooth for a tooth, ain't it the truth
If you got nine lives you might survive
'Cause nothings free on the other side
You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that so say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
In the dead of the night
Wheelin' dealin' cheatin' stealin' just to stay alive
I've got love for sale, yes for sale
On the New York subway line
Watch the working girls hanging out
Turning tricks underneath the lights, oh the lights
One step from hell the poor men sell their soul
For a taste of wine
You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that so say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
If you know what I'm talkin' about
What's that so say it again
You gotta be bad to be good
Bad to be good
You gotta be bad to be good
Bad to be good
What's that so say it again
When it's said and done and you're on the run
And the only law comes under the gunEmbed
