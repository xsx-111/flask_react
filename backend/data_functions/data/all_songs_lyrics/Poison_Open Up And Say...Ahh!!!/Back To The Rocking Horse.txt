Back To The Rocking Horse LyricsLike this
All the king's horses
And all the king's men
Ain't got a hope in hell
Of puttin' my pieces back together again
I've seen things in my life that should never be seen
I'm talkin' things that'd make your skin crawl
I just wanna go back to a simpler time
Where nothin' really mattered at all, no
You see, I can't sleep all night long
Tossin' and a turnin', thoughts they keep a churnin'
I can't sleep all night long
As a matter of fact I just wanna get back
I'm back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, I'm back to the rockin' horse
And start all over again, get back
Parents think I'm crazy
And the doctor says I cracked it
But they don't understand me
'Cause I just wanna get back, yes
You see, I can't sleep all night long
Tossin' and a turnin', thoughts they keep a churnin'
I can't sleep all night long
As a matter of fact I just wanna get back
I'm back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, I'm back to the rockin' horse
And start all over again, one time
Well, the whole world thinks I'm crazy
And the doctor says I cracked it
But they don't understand me, no
'Cause I just wanna go back
You see, I can't sleep all night long
Tossin' and a turnin', thoughts they keep a churnin'
I can't sleep all night long
As a matter of fact I just wanna get back
I'm back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, I'm back to the rockin' horse
And start all over again, yeah
I'm back to the rockin' horse
Back to where it all began
Take me back, I'm back to the rockin' horse
Start all over again, baby, like thisEmbed
