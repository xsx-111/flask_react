Fallen Angel LyricsShe stepped off the bus and out
Into the city streets
Just a small town girl, with her whole life packed in
A suitcase by her feet
Somehow the lights didn't shine as bright as they did
On her mama's TV
And the work seemed hard, days seemed longer
Than she ever thought they'd be
But you know, you gotta stick to your guns
When it all comes down
'cause Sometimes you can't choose it
It's like heads they win, tails you're gonna lose
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her life
Now, she found herself in the fast lane
Livin' day to day
Turned her back on her best friends, yeah
And let her family slip away
Just like a lost soul caught up in a Hollywood scene
All the parties and the limousines
Such a good actress hiding all her pain
Trading her memories, for fortune and fame
Just a step away from the edge of a fall
Caught between Heaven and Hell
Where's the girl I knew a year ago?
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
She wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her
Too much, too soon
Just a little too late
Ooh 'cause when her ship came in
She wasn't there, it just wouldn't wait
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her
Win big, mama's fallen angel
Lose big, living out her lies
Wants it all, mama's fallen angel
Lose it all, rolling the dice of her lifeEmbed
