Good Love LyricsI call my baby on the telephone
Said hurry home quick, I'm all alone
Now giddyap, hurry, don't be late
'Cause b-b-baby, I just can't wait, no, no, no
Talkin' dirty right in my ear
Making herself so perfectly clear
Needs some good love
Roll her over in the middle of the night
Rock my baby 'til the morning
Gettin' hot, good love, oow
Good people say I'm a sinnin' man
But if they knew my baby they would understand
The neighbors keep yellin' 'bout all the noise
Say, "The things you're doin' ain't natural, boy, no, no, no"
Talkin' dirty right in my ear
Making herself so perfectly clear
Needs some good love
Roll her over in the middle of the night
Rock my baby 'til the morning
Gettin' hot, good love, oow
Talkin' dirty right in my ear
Making herself so perfectly clear
Needs some good love
Dad thinks I have gone crazy
And my poor boss swears I'm losin' my cool
But I just want to play with my baby
If you only knew what she would do, yeah
Talkin' dirty right in my ear
Making herself so perfectly clear
Needs some good love
Roll her over in the middle of the night
Rock my baby 'til the morning
Gettin' hot, good love
Hoppin’, bobbin’ in the middle of the night
Rockin’ and a rollin’ 'til the morning
Gettin hot, hot, wild, good love
So damn hotEmbed
