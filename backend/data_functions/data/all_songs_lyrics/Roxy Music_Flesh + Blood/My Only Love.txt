My Only Love LyricsDo I ever wonder?
More than words can say
Heaven knows it's
Hard enough to pray
Let me tell you something
There's a change in me
Even now you're gone
You'll always be
My only love
My only love
Only Love
My only love
Does it seem so funny
For a fool to cry?
Do you know
The meaning of goodbye?
There's a river flowing
By a willow tree
When you need to know
Remember me
My only love
My only love
Only Love
My only love
Let me tell you something
More than words can say
But they're all I have
No other way
There's a river flowing
By a willow tree
When you find you're there
Remember me
My only love
My only love
Only love
My only love
My only love
Only love
My only love
Only love
My only love
Only love
My only love
Only loveEmbed
