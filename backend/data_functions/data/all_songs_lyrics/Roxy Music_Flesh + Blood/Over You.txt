Over You LyricsOh, baby
This is nowhere
Wish I was somewhere
Over you
Your sweet lips
Tell me there's no chance
No more romance
Over you
Oh, baby
How can I go on?
Crying so long
Over you
Where strangers
Look for new love
I'm so lost in love
Over you
Oooh, ooh
Some day
Yes, it might come, babe
When I'll be, babe
Over you
And always
Up to that moment
I will try to say
I'm over youEmbed
