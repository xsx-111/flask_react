Eight Miles High LyricsEight miles high
And when you touch down
You'll find that it's
Stranger than known
Signs in the street
That say where you're going
Are somewhere
Just being their own
Nowhere is
There warmth to be found
Among those afraid
Of losing their ground
Rain gray town
Known for its sound
In places
Small faces unbound
Round the squares
Huddled in storms
Some laughing
Some just shapeless forms
Sidewalk scenes
And black limousines
Some living
Some standing aloneEmbed
