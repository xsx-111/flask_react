Gravedancer LyricsIn this two bedroom tomb I'm sitting all alone
With the television static and refrigerator drone
I'm waiting for those blessed arms
That seem to wrap around me
Six or seven times
Praying for them to come home
I could cut myself to pass the time
Haven't felt anything in days
A six year old girl dances on my ceiling
She might as well be dancing on my graveEmbed
