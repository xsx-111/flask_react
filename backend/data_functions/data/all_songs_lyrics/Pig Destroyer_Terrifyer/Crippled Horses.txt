Crippled Horses LyricsPush my fingers past her ear
Watch them disappear
Into her brown hair
I wish the rest of me could go with them
Her bedroom is quiet
But my heart screams
A horrifying sound
Like a hundred crippled horses
Lying crumpled on the ground
Begging for a rifle
To come and put them downEmbed
