Restraining Order Blues LyricsThe bullet hole looks so right in your head
Like it had been missing all along
The blood streaked across your face
Like some twisted lover's deformed lipstick trace
Staring at your reflection
Wondering how you're still alive
Wondering if she's somewhere
Laughing
Deciding whether to let you dieEmbed
