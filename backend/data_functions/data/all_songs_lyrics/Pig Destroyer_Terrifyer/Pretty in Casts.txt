Pretty in Casts LyricsMaybe she'll
Snap her wrists doing cartwheels
Or her ankle
Dancing drunken at some rave
Maybe she'll go through a windshield
And have twinkling bits of glass stuck in her face
She's so pretty in her casts
Damaged so perfectly
She's so pretty in her casts
Prettiest thing I've ever seen
I only get to hold her when she's injured
I only get to kiss her where she's soreEmbed
