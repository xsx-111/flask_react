Dead Carnations LyricsBuildings collapse
In the distance behind you
But I'm hypnotized
By your quivering voice, your fluttering eyes
That I don't see them fall
They could crack open all the cages
Set every demon free
Send a bullet screaming to the president's head
Crack it open
For everyone to see
I'm dead to this world
So bury me deep in your arms tonightEmbed
