Thumbsucker LyricsMy eyes have changed color
Some sick yellow that I've never seen
That I've never seen
My stomach is knotted with hunger
For the taste of her sex obscene
Her sex obscene
She whispers
Such sweet
Death threats
In my
Daydreams
So punish me for weakness
Blame me for everything
I don't like the suffering
I like the sympathy it bringsEmbed
