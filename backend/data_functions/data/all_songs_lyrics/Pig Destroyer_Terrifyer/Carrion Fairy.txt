Carrion Fairy LyricsYesterday she showed me her bruises
Pulled her sweater up underneath her breasts
They were scattered 'cross her rib cage
Like a little patch of violet rorshach tests she said
Just 'cause I can't crawl inside you
That doesn't mean I'm not your parasite
She used to be so radiant
So sexy when she laughed
Now her eyes look like gravesites
As she speaks in epitaphsEmbed
