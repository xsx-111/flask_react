Torture Ballad LyricsThe tape across your mouth says more
Than your words ever could
You're squirming and screaming
As I tease your eyes
With glowing needles
Crawl slug
Drag your shattered legs behind
I know no matter how much I hurt you
She'll always love you more than me
But all of this isn't for the sake of her love
It's for the sake of my jealousyEmbed
