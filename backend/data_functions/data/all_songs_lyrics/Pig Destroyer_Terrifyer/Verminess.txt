Verminess LyricsWhen she touches me it's like a rodent sifting through garbage
But it's better than just rotting away
The dead honeybees suckle withered flowers
'cause they don't know what else to do
When she kisses me her lips are like chalk
Beneath empty socket eyes
Compassion takes too much effort I supposeEmbed
