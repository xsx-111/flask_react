Terrifyer LyricsThese strange thorned vines
Spring from the ground
They wind around me
As they bind me down
She moves across the rosegarden
Suspended in a dark cloud of flies
Her toes drag
The tops of the flowers
And leave them blackened
And shriveled
In her wake
Her hands dangle from thin strings of skin
Her forearms they're like gun barrels smoking crimsonEmbed
