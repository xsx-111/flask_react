Soft Assassin LyricsYour heart looks delicious
She says licking her lips
As her kamikaze fists
Crash into floating ribs
I stare at you the way you stare at your mirror
So please show me no mercy
Don't be a soft assassin
I scream
Though I'm laughing inside
I know you can't destroy me
But you're adorable when you tryEmbed
