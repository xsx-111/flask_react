I Am the Mob Lyrics
I put horses' heads in people's beds
'Cos I am the mob
When duty calls, gonna bust some balls
'Cos I am the mob
Don't try and tell me it's not one for the money
Two for the money, three for the money
Am I your Easter bunny, come on
I try my level best, my best to please
But I'm gonna put a bullet between your knees
Baby come on oh just tell them

Stop blowing the Don, put his kecks back on
'Cos I am the mob
Stop muckin' around with the brand-new sound
'Cos I am the mob
Don't try and tell me it's not one for the money
Two for the money, three for the money
Am I your Easter bunny, come on, oh baby come on
I try my level best, my best to please
But I'm gonna put a bullet between your knees
Baby come on just please tell them
That Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Missus


Oh tell them, just tell them
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Missus

Oh, Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
Luca Brasi, ah, he sleeps with the fishes
I am the mobEmbed
