Goldfish And Paracetamol Lyrics
A dead loss, no songs no fun, just glum
Lying next to someone so don't mention the War
Don't question where we stand nor where we fall
North, South, East where's best?
If I head left
It turns out directionless
So, needle point aside I always find
Embroidery leaves me blind 'cos I'm too weary to rest
Since I noticed coming second best is close to ideal

What fools boredom breeds so much to do
So many goldfish to feed and paracetamol
I'll take them all they line my stomach wall
'Cos I'm too weary to rest since I noticed
Coming second best is close to ideal (la la la....)

With customary thirst I search a water glass
But gin hits first oh don't believe the hype
Expectancy will always spoil a party it's torniquet (by crochet)
My waters break don't drive for pity's sake
'Cos I'm too weary to rest since I noticed
Coming second best Is close to ideal (la la la....)Embed
