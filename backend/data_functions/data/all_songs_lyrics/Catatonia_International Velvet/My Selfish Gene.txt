My Selfish Gene Lyrics
You, me and destiny
Guess that it was never meant to be
All you did was give me allergy
I'm not looking for your sympathy

You, me and destiny
I am courted by uncertainty
Lost my will to live unselfishly
Altruism stinks of fallacy

My selfish gene it fills my spleen with bile
And all the while I thought you gave a damn

You, me and destiny
Guess that it was never meant to be
All you needed was some courtesy
And I'm not waiting for an apologies

My selfish gene it fills my spleen with bile
And all the while I thought you gave a damn
Way back then I thought you gave a damnEmbed
