Strange Glue Lyrics
It was strange glue that held us together
While we both came apart at the seams
She said your place or mine
While we've still got the time
So I played along with her schemes

But I don't have the right to be with you tonight
So please leave me alone with no saviour in sight
I will sleep safe and sound with no body around me

When faced with my demons
I clothe them and feed them
And I'll smile, yes I'll smile as they're taking me over

And if I cannot sleep for the secrets I keep
It's the price I'm willing to meet
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me


But i don't have the right to be with you tonight
So please leave me alone with no saviour
I will sleep safe and sound with no body around me
When faced with my demons
I clothe them and feed them
And I'll smile, yes I'll smile as they're taking me over

And if I cannot sleep for the secrets I keep
It's the price I'm willing to steal
Oh the end of the night never comes too quickly for me
And I'll smile
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me
I'll smile, smile, smile as they're taking me over
I'll smile
The end of the night never comes too quickly for me
Never comes too quickly for meEmbed
