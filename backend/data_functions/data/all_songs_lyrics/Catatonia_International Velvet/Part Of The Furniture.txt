Part Of The Furniture Lyrics
I'll be your Baba Papa
I'll be you Baba Papa
If you'd be a Baba Papa to me
I'd be your table and chair
Phillipe Starke and Bill Amberg
If you'd be a Baba Papa to me

And I'd be your angel
Ride you until you're warmer
Be your cradle
Swing you until you fall

I'd be your son and your heir
Destitute but debonair
Though ill advised and ill in debt
I'd never be drained or misled
I saw your dreams and infatuated with this freedom
Say the words and I could be them

And I'd be your angel
Ride you until you're warmer
Be your cradle
Swing you until you're tired out
