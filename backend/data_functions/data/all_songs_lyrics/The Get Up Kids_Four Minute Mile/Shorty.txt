Shorty LyricsIt's certainly true, there's better things to do
And though I don't know everything
I wouldn't tell you anything if I did
The last time I saw you act like this, we were kids
The last time I saw you act like this, we were kids
What am I to do?
My heart goes out to you
Though I don't know everything
I wouldn't tell you anything if I did
Over reacting, over again
Just between friends
What am I to do?
I won't come between you two
(What was I to say?)
(What was I to do?)
I gave it, I gave it all
All I could, all I could
Over reacting, over again
Just between friends
I'll bet you never find another friend like meEmbed
