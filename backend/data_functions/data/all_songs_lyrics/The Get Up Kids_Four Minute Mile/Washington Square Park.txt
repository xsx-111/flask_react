Washington Square Park Lyrics
It's better than nothing
It's better than you can get
What more could you want?
What more could you ask for?

Living day by day is more than I can say about my life, my life
Living in denial, wipe that stupid smile away

Through that ring again, through that sick machine
Doesn't make you any stronger than you or anything you choose
It's not abuse that many people live through
It's better than nothing
It's better than you can get

Living day by day is more than I can say about my life, my life
Living in denial, wipe that stupid smile awayEmbed
