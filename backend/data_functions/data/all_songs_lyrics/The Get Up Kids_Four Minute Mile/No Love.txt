No Love Lyrics
If I gave everything, would you still listen to me?
If I gave everything, would you still listen to me?
It could be so much better than this
It could be so much better

I don't want you to love me anymore
I don't want you...

To love me any more than enough
I can't be held accountable if you can't make up your mind
Tonight, as much as I would like to
I can't put my hands all over you
If I put myself in that position
Myself to be immune to you
To keep my heart from breaking
If you can't make up your mind

If I gave everything, if I gave
If I gave everything, if I gave

I don't want you to love me anymore
I don't want you to love me anymore
If I came home one last time
Think of what the two of us could do
If I came home one last time
Think of what the two of us could do
I guess we'll never knowEmbed
