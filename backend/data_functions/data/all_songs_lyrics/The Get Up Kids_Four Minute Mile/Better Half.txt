Better Half Lyrics
I saw my better half
The better half of a decade
Slip through my hands
Inside her hands
Inside my pockets
When she reached for her advantages
I should have done something

I saw my baby boy digging his own hole
Keeping alive family traditions
When he lied about intentions
I should have done something
I should have done something

Well, I blame myself for everything
It keeps my conscience clean
I've got bandages to prove it
To prove it

I saw my better half
The better half of a decade
Slip through my hands
Inside her hands
Inside my pockets
When she reached for her advantages
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done something
I should have done somethingEmbed
