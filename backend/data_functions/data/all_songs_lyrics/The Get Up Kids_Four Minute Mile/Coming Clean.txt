Coming Clean Lyrics
I found my place in the sun
Lied my way there
I look in your eyes
I'm coming clean

I've made up my mind
I've made up my mind
To lie would be to compromise
To lie would be to compromise
And I won't try

I'm sorry
I hope you, I hope you'll forgive me
But what you want from me
Is killing me

I've made up my mind
I've made up my mind
To lie would be to compromise
To lie would be to compromise
And I won't tryEmbed
