Last Place You Look LyricsThe grass is always greener
As I'm sure that you've found
And if I find my way back on the last leg of this trip
I'm betting on finding you there
As long as it's constantly changing
As long as it's constantly sound
There's no sense of impending danger
There's no sense in hanging around for the winter
If I'm not gonna be in your arms, your arms around me
What have I got if you're there?
We'll be home in December
The leaves don't fall from the trees
As long as you remember, you are always with me
We'll be home in December
The leaves don't fall from the trees
As long as you remember, you are always with me
It's not my place to find it
Not something that I get to choose
Don't be scared â€˜cause you're not something I'm willing to lose
I'll bet you find it in the last place you look
I'll bet you find it in the last place you lookEmbed
