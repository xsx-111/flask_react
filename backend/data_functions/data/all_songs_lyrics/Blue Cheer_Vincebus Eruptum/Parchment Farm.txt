Parchment Farm LyricsI been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
I been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
I been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
Ain't ever done nobody no wrong
Oh Lord, I bet I'll be here for the rest of my life
Oh Lord, I bet I'll be here for the rest of my life
Oh Lord, I bet I'll be here for the rest of my life
All I did was shoot my wife
She was no good!
I done picking that cotton in a leather foot sack
I done picking that cotton in a leather foot sack, yes I have
I done picking that cotton in a leather foot sack
A goddamn shotgun at my back
I been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
Ain't ever done nobody no wrong, no!
I done sitting over here on the longest time
I been sitting over here on the longest time
I done sitting over here on the longest time
All I did was drink my wine
I swear I'll be here for the rest of my life
Yeah, I know I'll be here for the rest of my life
I know I'll be here for the rest of my life
All I did was shoot your wife
She was no good, you can take my word for it!
I been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
I been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
I been sitting over here on Parchment Farm
All I did was shoot my arm
Oh, no!Embed
