Doctor Please LyricsHelp me please, Doctor
Doctor, won't you please
I need your pain killer, Doc
Shot inside of me
Well I ain't got no money, child
But I been here before
Cash me in, Fill me up
Why don't you throw me out the door!
Well help me, Doctor
Well why won't you
Why don't you
C'mon and help me please
Won't you please
Whoa, I need your good living
Shot inside of me, Yeah!
I got this funny feeling
Feeling inside my head
Without your good living, Doc
Well I believe that I'll be dead
Doctor don't you turn me down
And won't you hear what I say
I need your good living, Doc
And I need it right away!
Well help me, Doctor
Well why don't you
Why won't you C'mon and help me please
Won't you please
Without your good living
No! What would I be!
Alright!
I got this funny feeling
Feeling inside my head
Without your pain killer, Doc
Well I believe that I'll be dead
Doctor don't you turn me down
Don't burn me away
I need your pain killer, Doc
And I need it right away
Well help me, Doctor
Well why won't you
Why don't you
C'mon and help me please
Won't you please
Without your pain killer, Doc
