Second Time Around LyricsListen here baby
Cause you outta time
I'm so sorry
It's the end of the line
I don't know what to say
I don't know what to do
All I know, Can not leave with you
I'm so sorry I'm bringing you down
Well I'll make it up next time I'm around
Next time baby, I'll make it up to you
Yeah, Yeah!
I told you once, I told you twice
You better straighten up child
You better fly right
But you don't wanna listen to a thing I say
I'll put you away child for one more day
Now I'm so sorry I'm bringing you down
I'll make it up next time I'm around
Well alright, this time baby, I'll make it up to you
Yeah!
Listen here, babe
It's the end of the line
I'm so sorry that you outta time
I don't know what to do
I don't know what to say
All I know, try to leave that way
Now I'm so sorry I'm bringing you down
I'll make it up next time I'm around
Next time baby, I'll make it up to you
That's what I say, right!Embed
