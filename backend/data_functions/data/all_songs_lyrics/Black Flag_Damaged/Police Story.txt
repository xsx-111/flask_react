Police Story Lyrics
This fucking city
Is run by pigs
They take the rights away
From all the kids

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Walking down the street
I flip them off
They hit me across the head with a billy club

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

Nothing I do
Nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked
They put me away
Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way

No fuckin' way
Motherfuckers gonna pay
Motherfuckers gonna pay

I go to court for my crime
Stand in line, pay bail
I may serve time

Understand we're fighting a war we can't win
They hate us, we hate them
We can't win, no way2Embed
