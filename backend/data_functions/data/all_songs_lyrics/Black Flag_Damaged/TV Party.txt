TV Party Lyrics
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!
TV party tonight!

We're gonna have a TV party tonight (Alright!)
We're gonna have a TV party alright (Tonight!)

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight (Alright!)
We'll pass out on the couch alright (Tonight!)

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't wanna know
We're dedicated
To our favorite shows
That's Incredible!
Hill Street Blues!
Dallas!
Fridays!

We sit glued to the TV set all night (And every night!)
Why go into the outside world at all? (It's such a fright!)

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

TV news shows what it's really like out there (It's a scare!)
You can go out if you want (We wouldn't dare!)

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Don't talk about anything else
We don't wanna know
We're dedicated
To our favorite shows
Saturday Night Live!
Monday Night Football!
Jeffersons!
Vega$!

I wouldn't be without my TV for a day (Or even a minute!)
I don't even bother to use my brain anymore (There's nothing left in it!)

We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV and have a couple of brews

Hey, wait a minute! My TV set doesn't work (It's broken!)
What are we gonna do tonight, this isn't fair! (We're hurtin'!)

We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV and just a couple of brews

What are we gonna talk about?
I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows!
No That's Incredible!
No Monday Night Football!
No Jeffersons!
No Fridays!
No TV Party tonight2Embed
