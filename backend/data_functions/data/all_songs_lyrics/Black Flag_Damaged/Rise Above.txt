Rise Above Lyrics
Jealous cowards try to control
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
They distort what we say
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Try and stop what we do
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
When they can't do it themselves
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

Society's arms of control
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Think they're smart, can't think for themselves
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
Laugh at us behind our backs
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
I find satisfaction in what they lack
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use
We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us, it's no use

We're born with a chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
I am gonna have my chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
We're born with a chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
And I am gonna have my chance
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!

We are tired of your abuse
Try to stop us it's no use

Rise above! Rise above!
Rise above! We're gonna rise above!
We're gonna rise above! We're gonna rise above!5Embed
