Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie Lyrics
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
(One, two, three, four)

Sitting here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off


I gotta go out
Get something for my head
If I keep on doing this
I'm gonna end up dead


I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved
With an atom bomb

Sitting here like a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off
