Six Pack Lyrics
I've got a six pack and nothing to do
I got a six pack and I don't need you

$35 and a six pack to my name
Six pack!
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame
Six pack!
They say I'm fucked up all the time
Six pack!
When the dudes a waste of time
Six pack!

I know it'll be OK
When I get a six pack in me
All right!

My girlfriend asked me
Which one I like better
Six pack!
I hope the answer won't upset her
(Bitch)
Six pack!
I was born with a bottle in my mouth
Six pack!
Now I've got six so I'll never run out
Six pack!
I know it'll be OK
When I get a six pack in me
All right!

$35 and a six pack to my name
Six pack!
Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame
Six pack!
They say I'm fucked up all the time
Six pack!
What they do is a waste of time
Six pack!
Six pack! six pack! six pack!

What do they know about partying, or anything else
Hey! Where's the beer bong?
I need to get fucked!Embed
