Ada LyricsAda, did you know
You are the mud in which I lie
And Ada, did you know
You are the sun in which I reside
And Ada, did you know
You are the hole in which I hide
And Ada, did you know
You are the crown in which I cry
And Ada, didn't you know
You are the dream in which I die
And Ada, I feel like a silver moon
Ada, I feel like a silver moon
Ada, I feel like a silver moon
Ada, I feel like a silver moonEmbed
