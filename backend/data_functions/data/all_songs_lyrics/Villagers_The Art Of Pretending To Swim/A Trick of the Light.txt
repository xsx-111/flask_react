A Trick of the Light Lyrics
My heart is spilling over
Crashing on the ground
I can't see what's around me
But soon I'll come round
My faith is in the balance
Of a million tiny words
So I return to silence

And if I see a sign in the sky tonight
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light
May never come but I'm willing to wait
What can I say? I'm a man of the faith
And there's an ocean in my body
And there's a river in my soul
And I'm crying

It's time that I let go
Of things I can't control
This path that I've taken
Is the only one I know
Well I've come so far to get here
And I've got so far to go
So I'll take what I can get
In matters of the soul
And if I see a sign in the sky tonight
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light
May never come but I'm willing to wait
What can I say? I'm a man of the faith
And there's an ocean in my body
And there's a river in my soul
And I'm crying

And we are the dawn
And we carry the sun
And we are the dawn
And we carry the sun

And if I see a sign in the sky tonight
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light
May never come but I'm willing to wait
What can I say? I'm a man of the faith
And there's an ocean in my body
And there's a river in my soul
And I'm crying (Feel alone)
And if I see a sign in the sky tonight (See it coming)
No one's gonna tell me it's a trick of the light (Feel alone)
May never come but I'm willing to wait (See it coming)
What can I say? I'm a man of the faith (Feel alone)
And there's an ocean in my body (See it coming)
And there's a river in my soul (See it coming)
And I'm crying2Embed
