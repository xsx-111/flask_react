Long Time Waiting LyricsThis is enough to give your money a run
Procrastinating till the kingdom come
You tell yourself that you do what you can
Well, what will you do when the shit hits the fan
They're out to get you, all of them, excuse me but
Nobody said it was gonna be easy
I see you crying, just give me your hand
You can't sit back when you're taking a stand
If you believe that your time is coming
But you're counting on your savior to come
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time
If you believe that it's for the taking
But somebody's gonna do it for you
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time
I could do without this talk of getting ahead
When it's a battle just to get out of bed
My will is strong but it's starting to break
There's only so much a body can take
I get your message but I don't like the tone
You can only help yourself, and you alone
If you believe that your time is coming
But you're counting on your savior to come
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time
If you believe that it's for the taking
But somebody's gonna do it for you
You're gonna be a long time waiting
You're gonna be a long time
I don't need no validation
From anyone at any cost
A trophy consolation
For something that I never lost
I need, I need to know
How to feel the way you say, you say you do
So I can give some validation to you
I don't need no validation
From anyone at any cost
A trophy consolation
For something that I never lost
I need, I need to know
How to feel the way you say, you say you do
So I can give some validation to you
No I don't need no validation
From anyone at any cost
A trophy consolation
For something that I never lost
If you believe that your time is coming
But you're counting on your savior to come
You'll be a long time waiting
You'll be a long time
If you believe that it's for the taking
But somebody's gonna do it for you
You'll be a long time waiting
You'll be a long timeEmbed
