Real Go-Getter Lyrics
Give all you got
If you're feeling like you've had enough
There's only one way and it's always up
It's always tough
But if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me

Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter

You hold me down
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
If you're feeling like you've had enough
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
There's only one way and it's always up
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
It's always tough
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
But if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
You hold me down
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
If you're feeling like you've had enough
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
There's only one way and it's always up
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
It's always tough
(Things have got better, I'm a real go-getter)
But if it's good enough for you
It's good enough for me
Things have got better I'm a real go-getter
Things have got better I'm a real go-getter
Things have got bet-Embed
