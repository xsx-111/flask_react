Love Came with All That It Brings LyricsShe was just doing her thing
That love came with all that it brings
Her longbows were lost in the rain
When she severed her heart
With the blade
And hell is a place that's reserved
For people it fully deserves
So she's packing her bags just in case
They've saved her her own special place
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Love came with all that it brings
Including the fact that it stings
Like a motherfucker
Love came with all that it brings
And just as the fat lady sings
We want more
Love came with all that it brings
Including the fact that it stings
Like a motherfucker
Love came with all that it brings
And just as the fat lady sings
We want moreEmbed
