Sweet Saviour LyricsAwaking from another dream
I saw your picture on the screen
It took me to another place in time
Below the woven tapestry
Of transcendental memory
The fountain of potential in its prime
And never did a soul touch your body so divine
And never did a heartbeat so fast eclipse mine
And on it flowed into the night
With seemingly no end in sight
I drank it all, I could not stand
And from the floor I played my hand
And I swear I saw eternity
And his sister saying
Softly somewhere, oh sweet saviour
Save me, oh sweet saviour, save me
And never did a soul touch your body so divine
And never did a heartbeat so fast eclipse mine
I've been praising you now
For what feels like eternity
Sweet saviour, don't do this to me
Sweet saviour
And never did a soul touch your body so divine
And never did a heartbeat so fast eclipse mine
I've been praising you now
For what feels like eternity
Sweet saviour, don't do this to me
Sweet saviour
I've been loving you now
For what feels like eternity
Sweet saviour, don't do this to meEmbed
