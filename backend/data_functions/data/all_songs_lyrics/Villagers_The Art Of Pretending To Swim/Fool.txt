Fool Lyrics
Like any modern dog
I choose what I can see
From any infomercial to the bodies on the street
And for now I keep my head down
But one day I will precede
My reputation

‘Cause I’m a fool, love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there’s no need to worry

And the world is passin’ by you
But you’ll miss it if you blink
And the future has been written
But the pen ran out ink
And the dopamine is dripping back
Into the kitchen sink
Send your location

‘Cause I’m a fool, love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there’s no need to worry
So here is my bleeding heart
Will you be my falling star?
Will you take the pain away?

There’s money in the morning
And I’m looking at my screen
And fail to accept that there’s a problem to the scene, too
There’s a problem

‘Cause I’m a fool, love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there’s no need to worry
I’m a fool, love
For the burden
Of the promise of eternal life in heaven
Of the kind of anaesthetic for the journey
To where there’s no need to worryEmbed
