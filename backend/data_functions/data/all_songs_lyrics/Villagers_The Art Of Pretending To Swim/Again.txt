Again Lyrics
Again
Again

I've found again (Again)
A space in my heart again (Again)
For God again (Again)
In the form of art again (Again)

I let it flow (Again)
Into a bottomless hole again
As I feel it ripple and ready its soul again (Again)
Alone again (Again)
Home

We fall again (Again)
Under the spell again (Again)
And crawl again (Again)
Into the shell (Again)

And let it flow (Again)
Into a bottomless hole again
As I feel it ripple and ready its soul again (Ripple and ready its soul)
Alone again (Again)
Home
Again
Again
Again
Again

I let it flow (Again)
Into a bottomless hole again
As I feel it ripple and ready its soul again
Alone again
Home

Again
