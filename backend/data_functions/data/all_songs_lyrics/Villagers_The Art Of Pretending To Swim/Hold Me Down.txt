Hold Me Down LyricsI've seen the down
But there's something in the way
And I can't get out
I'm in a room
But I don't know how I got here
Or what I'm allowed
So come inside
Pick a fight
Ruffle my feather
I'll be waiting here
Patiently
Wondering whether
Hope is a lie
Hold me down till I can't understand who I am
Pull me out of this home
Pull me down till your body spills into my soul
The sun goes out
And I need it like I need
A hole in my head
My voice is shut
But I can't remember
Or sing a word that I said
So count me in
Take me on
Kill all my memory
I can't believe
Can't go on
Never be care-free
If hope is a lie
Hold me down till I can't understand who I am
Pull me out of this home
Pull me down till your body spills into my soul
Then leave me be
Alone to dream
Another Love
Is calming meEmbed
