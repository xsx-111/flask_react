Back Down South Lyrics
Come on out and dance
If you get the chance
We're going to spit on the rivals
All I want to know
Is how far you want to go
Fighting for survival
Underneath the stars
Where we parked the cars
Ain't showing signs of stopping
Pretty little girls
Naked to their curls
Ready to lay in a coffin

If you want to go
I'm going to go
I've got a fire burning
Go on take my hand
When we see the band
Baby's going to be a big one, oh yeah
Baby's going to be a big one

When we see the lights
And we hear the fights
It's going to be a stunner
I've got something here
If you give me one more beer
I'm going to call the runner
I don't want to say
What I have to say
Babe, I'm a kicking off now
If you want to go
I'm going to go
I'm going back down South now 
If you want to go
I'm going back down South now
Come on take my hand
I'm going back down South now
When we see the lights
And we hear the fights
I'm going back down South now
All I want to know
Is how far you want to go
I'm going back down South now, oh yeah
I'm going back down South now4Embed
