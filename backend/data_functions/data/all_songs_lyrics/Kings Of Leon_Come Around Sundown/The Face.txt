The Face LyricsBeneath the dance hall lights
You seem a girl so sound
Lights up the ground
If you give up New York
I'll give you Tennessee
The only place to be
The cowboy's burning eyes
Don't like the sight of me
Just straight enough to breathe
I like your point of view
So don't you shy away
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
You had me holding of
All the time and place
Ride out the wave
Bury yourself away
The one and only face
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave
Ride out the wave7Embed
