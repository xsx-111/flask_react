Pony Up Lyrics
I got razor sharp mind that wants to cut you down
A little place in mind maybe I could bed you down
Pony up, we got a ways to go
Set me up my friend, I'm running low
Oh, if you take my hand I'm going to get you out to here
The crash of bottles breaking and the swinging chandelier
In a rain of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight coming and I watched her go
In a rain of bullets and blood and snow
I saw the midnight come and I watched her go

Yeah, I watched her go
I watched her
I watched her goEmbed
