Birthday Lyrics
It's in the way she often calls me out
It's in the cut of your pretty gown
Your come on legs and your pantyhose
You look so precious with your bloody nose

We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather round
Like it's your birthday
I don't want to know
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming along with you

Walking her home with the grassy hill
Falling and laughing at the drinks we've spilled
Just one of those nights that I had to share
Chasing the death without a care

We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather round
Like it's your birthday
I don't want to know
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming along with you
You know I love the way you curve

We're gonna come together
We're gonna celebrate
We're gonna gather round
Like it's your birthday
I don't want to know
Just what I'm gonna do
I don't care where you're going
I'm coming along with you4Embed
