Mary Lyrics
(Haa-ah)
(Haa-ah)
(Haa-ah)
(Haa-ah)

Mary, if you want to
I'll waive my right
I'll be on the corner, just passing time

No, I won't
Ever once
Make you cry
Just a kiss
Oh, I'll miss
You're goodbye
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi

(Haa-ah)
(Haa-ah)
(Haa-ah)
(Haa-ah)
We'll go to the disco
We'll be the sight
Oh, and we'll dance like we're boyfriends
In sheer delight

Oh, I won't
Never once
Make you cry
With the kiss
Oh, I'll miss
Your goodbye


Oh, I won't
Never once
Make you cry
Just to kiss
Oh, and I'll miss
Your goodbye
Hi, hi, hi-hi, hi, hi

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi
Oh, oh, oh
Hi, hi, hi-hi, hi, hi
Oh, oh, oh
Hi, hi, hi-hi, hi, hi
Oh, oh, oh
Hi, hi, hi-hi, hi, hi
Oh, oh, oh
Hi, hi, hi-hi, hi, hiEmbed
