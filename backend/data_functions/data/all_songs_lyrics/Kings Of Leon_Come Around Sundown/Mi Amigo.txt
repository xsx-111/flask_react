Mi Amigo Lyrics
I got a friend
Shows me all the good times
Tells me I look better
Chews me up and spits me out
And then walks my ass home
And sings a song
When I'm gone, gone, go on
That little friend
Shoots me up and downtown
When I can't get me drunk enough
To pick me out the pieces
Of a place I call home

To sing a song
Until I'm gone, gone, go on
No
Go on 

I've got a friend
Helps me to get up again
Showers me in boozes
Tells me I got a big old dick
And she wants my ass home
To sing a song
Until I'm gone, gone, go on
You know, son
Go on,  on5Embed
