Celebration Lyrics
Hang your weary head you seem defeated
Like the little girl you've been with cheated
And in the conversation had to go too far
Now your dropped off drunk in the back of your heart

So dry your lily eyes don't be so cruel
Using all you know it's meant for fools

See you're smoking up in the parking lot
Shake your little butt, show them what you got
 Hot and the men all want and the chase is on 
Now your flag is flying in the dark and cold


It's in a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air

Are you all giving up? Don't want to know now
And everybody sees everybody in your town
Oh, and the small town girl she went and got a bar
She going to shake it off she gonna give them what she's got

This is a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air
This is a celebration
There's something in the air
A little celebration
There's something in the air1Embed
