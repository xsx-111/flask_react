Pickup Truck Lyrics(1st Verse)
Walk you home to see, where your livin' around, and I know this place
Pour yourself on me, And you know I'm the one, that you won't forget
(2nd Verse)
And in your denim eyes, I see something's awry, and I see you're weak
When he comes around, see your fixin' to shine, and my face won't speak
(Chorus)
Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said, 'you call that a pick up truck?'
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
Kickin' screamin' & rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know ohhhhh
(3rd Verse)
Tremblin' misery, and as cold as a hole
I hug your bones and skin, cracklin' woods gone white, and my eyes swoll up now
I can see the light
(Chorus)
Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said, 'you call that a pick up truck?'
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
Kickin' screamin' & rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know ohhhhh
Hate to be so emotional
I didn't aim to get physical
But when he pulled in and revved it up
I said, 'you call that a pick up truck?'
And in the moonlight I throwed him down
Kickin' screamin' & rolling around
A little piece of a bloody tooth
Just so you know I was thinking of you
Just so you know ohhhhh3Embed
