The Immortals Lyrics
The open road, the path of greatness
Is at your fingers
Go be the one, that keeps on fighting
Go be the stranger
Just put your foot, in front the other
Crow like a rooster
Be all in all, together something
Fear is a danger
I Say

Spill out on streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face

The windows are, the perfect picture
They're always changing
Go on get lost, jump in the waters
When they are raging
I Say
 (x2)
Spill out on streets of stars
And ride away
Find out what you are
Face to face
Once you've had enough
Carry on
Don't forget to love
Before you're gone4Embed
