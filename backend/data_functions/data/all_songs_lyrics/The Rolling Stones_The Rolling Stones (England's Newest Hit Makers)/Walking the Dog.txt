Walking the Dog Lyrics
Baby, back dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tip to toes
She broke the needle and she can't sew

Walking the dog
I am just a-walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Come on now, come on

I asked her mother for fifteen cents
I see you ever jumped the fence
I jumped so high, touched the skies
Didn't get back until a quarter to five

Walking the dog
I am just a-walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Come on, come on now
Tell me Mary, what's your twelve
How does your garden grow
What with silver bells and cockle shells
And pretty maids all in a row

Walking the dog
I am just a-walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Come on now, come on


Baby back, dressed in black
Silver buttons all down her back
High hose, tip to toes
She broke the needle and she can't sew

Walking the dog
I am just a-walking the dog
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Come on now, come on
Yeah, just a walking
J-j-j-just a walking
J-j-j-ust a walking
Now, if you do not know how to do it
I will show you how to walk the dog
Come on now, come on
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dog
Come on now
If you don't know how to do it
I'll show you how to walk the dogEmbed
