Powerful Man Lyrics
Davey broke the law again
Heard this time he's going to the pen
Guess I didn't need my lunch
'Cause I was going to miss him a whole bunch
Maybe he was out of line
But he was still a pretty close friend of mine
Maybe he had hurt me bad
But a brother is a brother and that is that

Mom's in a mood this week
'Cause she thinks that her family is going crazy
Guess it started with the baby
She went in for a hug, then it bit her on the cheek
That was pretty funny to me
But I guess I should have more sympathy
I never raised a kid
But I bet I'd do a good job if I did

Had a dream about a promised land
Walkin' 'round with a big gun in my hand
And when I look you in the eye
You're gonna tell me that you love me and hold me tight
'Cause you know that I have no fear
Ain't gonna walk into the river and disappear
I'm gonna be a powerful man
Red blood running down the broken sand
I couldn't tell you
What it means to me1Embed
