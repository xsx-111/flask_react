Sportstar LyricsSport star
If you want me, I'll call
If you want me to fall
I'll fall
My dream
Let me play on your team
I'm clean
Let me tie your Nike's
Holding on for sport star
Let me wear your jersey
If you want to hurt me
Hurt me
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
I play how I wanna play
I say what I wanna say
Sport star
In the back of my car
Could you hit me too hard?
You're scarred
Sport star
I can hear your echo
Pass go
Driving on my white throne
95 to sport star
If I make it back on
I don't wanna live long
Just strongEmbed
