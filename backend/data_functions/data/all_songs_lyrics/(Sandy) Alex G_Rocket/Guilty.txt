Guilty LyricsAre you guilty?
Are you waiting to be found?
Do you think that you'd be happier
With no one else around?
Are you hiding?
Will the trial never come?
Baby, I've got news-
Is the truth trapped
Behind iron lock and key?
Have you buried all the evidence of
What you used to be?
Has the question
Become darker than the answer?
Baby, I've got news-1Embed
