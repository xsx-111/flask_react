Proud Lyrics
I'm so proud of you
And everything that you do
Doesn't matter what they say
They ain't worth a dollar in change
Wish I could be strong like you
Wish I had something to prove
Wanna be a star like you
Wanna make something that's true

If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby down without no money in her bank

I wanna be a fake like you
Walk around with rocks in my shoes
I just wanna play the game
Big and fat and insane
I'm so proud of you
And everything that you do
Doesn't matter what I said
I'm better off dead
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby down without no money in her bank

If I sink
I don't wanna be the one to leave my baby out without no bottle to drink
If I fuck up
