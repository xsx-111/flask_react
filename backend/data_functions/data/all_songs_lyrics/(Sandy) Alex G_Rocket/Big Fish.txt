Big Fish LyricsIf I could say, I would say
If I could walk away
If I could talk, I would talk
I'd walk around the block
Look at the way he walks in
Look how he tucks his shirt in
Let me behave in my way
Don't ask me questions, Pa
You know I'm a big old fish now
Don't ask me questions, Pa
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
You know I'm a big old fish now
Go get your rod
Get my rod
Let's cast 'em off the dock
I caught a big fat monkey
Look at him squirming and jumping
Kill it in time to prepare
Pull out the bones and hair
Now comes my favorite part
Bubbling in the pot1Embed
