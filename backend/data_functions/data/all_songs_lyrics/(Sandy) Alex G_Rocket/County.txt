County LyricsLocked up for nothing
Stealing or something
In with this kid who seemed
Normal and quiet
I'm playing poker and
He's two cells over
Cops rush the hall, I saw
Blood on the wall
Turns out the kid had a
Few bags of heroin
Deep in his stomach
He swallowed a razor
See I got some stories
Hey, why don't you write that
Into a song maybe?
Your fans will dig that1Embed
