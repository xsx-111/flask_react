Brick Lyrics
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying

You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying

You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying
You think I don't but I always fucking do
Every time you tell me something untrue
Puts a brick in the wall between me and you

I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lying
I
I know that you're lyingEmbed
