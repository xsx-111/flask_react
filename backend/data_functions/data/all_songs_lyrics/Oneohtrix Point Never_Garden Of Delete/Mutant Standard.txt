Mutant Standard LyricsI'm just gonna start off by doing some stupid stuff because that's what I do, it's in me, my blood
I've got a little black mark right there
That's nasty...but I'm not nasty
Are you sure about that?
Yeah
That's how he rolls
So, follow me

I'll start by knocking on these people's windows
This is not my house, this is somebody else's
C'mon
It's starting, get ready
Hey!
Oh yeah? Hey!
Hi!
