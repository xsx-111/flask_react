Animals LyricsWe sit by the side
And observe all the animals
I try not to laugh
Cause I know
It's the end of us
I fry from the heat
But the sun
Isn't killing me
We run from our death
When we cum
Are we really free?
Primal rage
Life in a cage
It's nothing
(I can live)
You sit in your throne
You decide
"Off with his head"
She kneels at your feet
She feels cold;
"Something more to eat?"
Queen dies in her sleep
There's no time
King must not weep
We look at our phone
Every morning
Battery is dead
Kiss the sky
Tear in your eye
It's nothing
(I can live without)1Embed
