Lift LyricsWhere are you at?
Meet me outside
Now that I'm here
There's no lift without you
Where are you at?
I'm the one
Bird without flight
Now that I'm here
There's no lift without you
Bird without flight
This I lift without you
Eyes that we play
And we're old again
(Together)
Eyes that we play
And we're old again
That we play
That we'll be old
If there's no love
That can be worse than nothing
If there's no love
That can be worse than allEmbed
