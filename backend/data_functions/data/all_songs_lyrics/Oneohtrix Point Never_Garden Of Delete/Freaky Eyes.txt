Freaky Eyes LyricsOh ya
Relax
I know
6178461212
You and me
Not far from dream
Here and there
Deep within
You give so many reasons
For the weakness you hide
But I know just how you live inside
The freaky eyes had
The freaky eyes had
The whole plan
I have no head
If you're cold and you can't feel
You might find you've already died
All of these weird objects are reflections of you
And they try to change perception when you're nearEmbed
