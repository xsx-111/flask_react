Sticky Drama LyricsSticky drama is the girl for me
She's so sticky from the memories
Is he famous? Are you white?
How I lust her in your eyes
Sticky drop
Know it's some special fade in
They're here to see you: V-I-Penis
Sophisticated, she did it
Ooh, get high

5391514 and they can barely stand up
Sticky drama is
The girl for me
Sticky drama's the girl
Anyway
Sticky drama is the girl for me
She's so sticky from the memories
You know it's so faded
They're here to seem famous
Today she's dead
Get high
Look out "the world"
(This is what's wrong with the world, people tend to be so mean to each other)
Get the fuck down
I wanna see you falter

Potassi uhhhm?
Dagger prometheus
Time after time
Time after time
This is deep so far
It could be anything
It could represent water
I don't know

Time after time
Time after all2Embed
