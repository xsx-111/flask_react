I Would Die 4 U Lyrics
I'm not a woman
I'm not a man
I am something that you'll never understand
I'll never beat you
I never lie
And if you're evil I'll forgive you by and by, 'cause...

You: I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You: I would die for you

I'm not your lover
I'm not your friend
I am something that you'll never comprehend
No need to worry
No need to cry
I'm your messiah, and you're the reason why, 'cause...

You: I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You: I would die for you, woo!

You're just a sinner, I am told
Be your fire when you're cold
Make you happy when you're sad
Make you good when you are bad
I'm not a human
I am a dove
I'm your conscience
I am love
All I really need is to know that you believe

Yeah, I would die for you, yeah
Darling, if you want me to
You: I would die for you
Yeah, say one more time
You: I would die for you
Darling, if you want me to
You: I would die for you
2, 3, 4, you!

I would, die for, you
I would, die for, you
You: I would, die for, you
You: I would, die for, you12Embed
