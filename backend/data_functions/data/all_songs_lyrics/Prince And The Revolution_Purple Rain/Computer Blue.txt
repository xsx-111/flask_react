Computer Blue Lyrics
Wendy?
Yes, Lisa?
Is the water warm enough?
Yes, Lisa
Shall we begin?
Yes, Lisa
Where is my love life?
Where can it be?
There must be something wrong with the machinery
Where is my love life?
Tell me, where has it gone?
Somebody, please, please tell me what the hell is wrong
'Til I find the righteous one
Computer blue
'Til I find the righteous one
Computer blue

Oh
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah5Embed
