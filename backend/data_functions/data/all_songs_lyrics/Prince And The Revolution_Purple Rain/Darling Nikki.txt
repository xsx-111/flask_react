Darling Nikki Lyrics
I knew a girl named Nikki
I guess you could say she was a sex fiend
I met her in a hotel lobby
Masturbating with a magazine
She said, "How'd you like to waste some time?"
And I could not resist when I saw little Nikki grind

She took me to her castle
And I just couldn't believe my eyes
She had so many devices
Everything that money could buy
She said, "Sign your name on the dotted line"
The lights went out
And Nikki started to grind

Nikki

The castle started spinning
Or maybe it was my brain
I can't tell you what she did to me
But my body will never be the same
Her loving will kick your behind
Oh, she'll show you no mercy
But she'll sure enough, sure enough
Show you how to grind
Darling Nikki, oh

Woke up the next morning
Nikki wasn't there
I looked all over, and all I found
Was a phone number on the stairs
It said, "Thank you for a funky time
Call me up whenever you wanna grind"

Oh, Nikki, oh
Come back, Nikki, come back
Your dirty little Prince
Wants to grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind

Hello, how are you? I'm fine. 'Cause I know
That the Lord is coming soon, coming, coming soon7Embed
