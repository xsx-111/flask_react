Arms Aloft LyricsSometimes there's no star shining
Scounting the edge of the universe
Sometimes you can't see the horizon
Between the ocean and the earth
And just when you're thinking about slinkin' down
I'm gonna pull you up, I'm gonna pull ya round
May I remind you of that scene
The spirit is our gasoline
May I remind you of that scene
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen
May I remind you of that scene
Let a million mirror balls beam
May I remind you of that scene
And you say, "Living ain't nothing but hassles"
In a manila envelope rain
And driving coal all night to Newcastle
It's getting to be a repetitive strain
And just when you're thinking about
Going down the drain
May I remind you of that scene
The spirit is our gasoline
May I remind you of that scene
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen
May I remind you of that scene
Let a million mirror balls beam
May I remind you of that scene
I'm gonna pull you up
I'm gonna pull ya round
May I remind you of that scene
The spirit is our gasoline
May I remind you of that scene
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen
Let a million mirror balls beam
The spirit is our gasoline
May I remind you of that scene
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen
They say the stars can't see their rays
Nor can they count their numbered days
No flower can say what perfume is
We got all this and bird and diz
May I remind you of that scene
We were arms aloft in Aberdeen
May I remind you of that scene1Embed
