Midnight Jam LyricsAll transmitters to full
All receivers to boost
This is London Calling
This is London Calling
All right everybody
Once again, I'm tuning in to the best tunes you
Can find anywhere in the world
At any time, any place
Now I'd like to let it rip
On a whole different tip
Now we gonna turn over the controls at the tower here
To the great originator, Mr. U-Roy, let it roll
Meanwhile
We've got a ticket
And there's a train
It's the Indestructible Beat of Soweto once again
Since the last programme
I've been around the world touring with the group
You name in every jail in Germany, I've been there
Let's chill it out a little bit with this very unusual songEmbed
