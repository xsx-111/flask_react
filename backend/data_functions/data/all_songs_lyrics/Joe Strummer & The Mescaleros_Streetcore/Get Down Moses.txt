Get Down Moses LyricsOnce I got to the mountain top, tell you what I could see
Prairie full of lost souls running from the priests of iniquity
Where the hell was Elijah?
What do you do when the prophecy game was through?
We gotta take the walls of Jericho
Put your lips together and blow
To the very top
Say the truth crystallizes like jewels in the rock, in the rock
Get down Moses, part another sea
Carve another tablet out of LSD
Get down Moses, out in Tennessee
Get down Moses, down in the street
The blood is washing down all the gravel to our feet
Get down Moses, down in the pit
Lying in a dream, cross a battlefield
Crashing on a downtown strip
Looking in the eyes of the diamonds and the spies and the hip
Who's sponsoring the crack ghetto?
Who's lecturing? Who's in the know and in the don't know?
You better take the walls of Jericho
Put your lips together and blow
Goin' to the very top
Where the truth crystallizes like jewels in the rock, in the rock
Get down Moses, from the eagle aerie
You gotta to make new friends out of old enemies
Get down Moses, back in Tennessee
Get down Moses, down with the dreads
They got a lotta reasoning in a dreadhead
Get down Moses, down in the street
Get down Moses, part another sea
Carve another tablet out of LSD
Get down Moses, out in Tennessee
Get down Moses, down in the street
The blood washing down all the gravel to our feet
Get down Moses, down in the pit
Get down Moses
Get down Moses
Get down Moses
We need to eat
We gotta chew it over with our wisdom teeth
Get down MosesEmbed
