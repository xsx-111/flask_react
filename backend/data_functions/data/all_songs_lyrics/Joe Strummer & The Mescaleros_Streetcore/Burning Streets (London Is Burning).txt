Burning Streets (London Is Burning) LyricsThe sirens' risin'
There's a distant blues dance on a crowded street
The temperature's a-risin'
Soon you're gonna be runnin' down
Those burnin' streets, come on
The century that's hardly on its feet
And the late news breaks early
Does the sun rise from the west or from the east?
An' it takes every day to be survivin' in the city
London is burnin'; don't tell the Queen
Somebody tried to speak garage and they burnt down Bethnal Green
Piccadilly's yearning, like a reggae beat
Soon you're gonna be runnin' down
Those burnin' streets, come on
And you're waitin' for your flag to be unfurled
And the late news breaks early
So how should life be lived around the world?
(If London is burnin')
An' it takes every day to be survivin' in the city
Ready to face that dawn with no pity, come on!
Yeah, ah-come on (London is burnin')
Yeah, ah-come on (London is burnin')
(Soon you're gonna be run down)
(Soon you're gonna be run down)
Those burnin' streets, come on!
Does the universal cop have a beat?
And the late news breaks early
Did you ever buy that bar on Lucky Street?
An' it takes every day to be survivin' in the city
Ready to face that dawn with no pity, come on!
Yeah, ah-come on (London is burnin')
Yeah, ah-come on (London is burnin')
Too many guns in this damn town
At the supermarket, you gotta duck down
Baby flak jackets on the merry-go-round
(London is burnin')
There's too many guns in this damn town
(London is burnin')
Baby flak jackets on the merry-go-round
(London is burnin')
Too many guns in this damn town
(London is burnin')
Baby flak jackets on the merry-go-round
(London is burnin')Embed
