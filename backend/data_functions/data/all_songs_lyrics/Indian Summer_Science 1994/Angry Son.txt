Angry Son LyricsMending slowly, all wounds, effortlessly as the burden of his sunken child is lifted but effortlessly again carried
Faintly to the stone heart of an angry son, an angry son who has done his swallowing, his memories are bitten pills
So many bitten pills that he has collected, like the fallen pieces of the broken ground which he now moves on
This ground so unsettled, so endlessly unsettled, he recounted with the weight of the sunken earth
And still he moves on
This is Earth, Earth which he has moved on and collected, settled to his own liking
And still he moves on
A voice in the back of his head reminding him that this is stolen, that this is not his
All these moments, this precious time spent, moments in gravity
All this anxious waiting, all this time spent waiting
All this pain that you know, all this effortless moving, all this pain that you will ever know
In waking hours, time spent in these moments
Though he is living, silently in moments and forgiving relevance, it is in his heart he is holding
And calling behind sadness of empty fields
It is in these moments of time well spent, in these moments of gravity
This time well spent
A look to heaven, sighing tears of angel's and a night sky
Racing
Racing, yelling softly
This is the moment
This is the moment
A look to heaven, sighing tears of angel's and a night sky
This is the moment
Holding moments and forgiving relevance, it is in his heart
Calling behind the sadness of empty fields
In these moments of time, time well spent, time knows better
Behind tired eyes, behind tired eyes, I think he's waiting
Knowing your destiny, he calls him the angry son
This is the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment
This is the moment of truth
It's hard to say
Running out of time
They don't know me
Its hard to say
They don't know me
This is the next last moment
I am the angry son
I am the angry son
I am the angry son
I am the angry son
This is the moment
This is the moment
I am the angry son
I am the angry son
I am the angry son
I am the angry son
Sighing tears of angel's and a night sky, this is the moment3Embed
