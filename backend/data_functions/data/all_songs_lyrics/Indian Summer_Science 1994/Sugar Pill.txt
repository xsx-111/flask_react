Sugar Pill LyricsYou can cut this in half, you can make it whole
Cut it and make it whole
Whole, whole
Cut it and make it whole
One down
One down on me to go
Cut it and make it whole, whole
I knew, I know
Whole, yeah

Yeah, the pill
Yeah, the pills
Just give me the pill if this makes you happy
Just give me the pill
Just give me the pill if this makes you happy
Just give me the pill
Just give me the pill, the pill
Just give me the pill, pill
Just give me the pill, the pill, yeah
Just give me the pill if this makes you happy
Just give me pills
Just give me the pill if this makes you happy
Just give me pills
