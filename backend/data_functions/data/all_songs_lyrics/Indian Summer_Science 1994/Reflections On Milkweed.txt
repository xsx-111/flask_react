Reflections On Milkweed LyricsOnce again
I'm riddled with the task of peretrobating my thoughts
Back to the foundation
In which my paranoia was forged
So i long the thoughts of end
Solely secluded- its a lie
To each his own, to each his own
Or so I've been told
Along the scenes past
A journey never ending
This tiresome moment nulled
Why then- have I mass beliefs and opinions
That do not come from wit of my mind, my soul, my heart
Courage and strength are shields of which ive never bore in the battle of wills and mights of mortal men
Coming down
So content, delirium in the fetal position
I've lost my will to fight
Drained my will to live
Die before my time
Sink slowly
I will rise
Sinking once again
I will never travel brandishing a sharp tongue at a fear piercing my own heart
A glimpse of motion, a glimpse of motion
I perceived in journey, I perceived in journey
A glimpse of motion, a glimpse of motion
I perceived in journey, I perceived in journey
A glimpse of motion, a glimpse of motion
I perceived in journey, I perceived in journey
A glimpse of motion, a glimpse of motion
I perceived in journey, I perceived in journeyEmbed
