I Think Your Train Is Leaving LyricsI think your train is leaving
Looks like it may
I think your train is leaving
Train don't leave, don't leave
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
Framed and willing
On a 10-minute scale
That one left a mark, yeah
That one left
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
Bright eyes
Hold my..
(Bright eyes hold my blue book...)
Bright eyes..
Hold my..
Hold it...1Embed
