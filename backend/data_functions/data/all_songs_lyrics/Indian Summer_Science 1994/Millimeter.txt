Millimeter LyricsAre you breathing or are you just reloading?
I don't see how, I don't see how
I don't see how you can be so damn happy
I don't see how, I don't see how
I don't see how you're standing at all
I don't see how, I don't see how
I don't see how you believe in nothing
I don't see how, I don't see how
I don't see how you can start anywhere
Are you breathing or are you just reloading?
Are we dead? Are we here?
Why is it that you're so calm?
Are you reloading? Are you rebuilding?
Why the fuck are you so calm?
Are your hands tied? Are your hands tied?
What is it that you're waiting for?
Without you, it's nothing
What is it that you're waiting for?
I am your... killer
I am your killerEmbed
