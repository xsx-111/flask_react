Struggle LyricsWell it's a struggle, baby it's a struggle, yeah yeah
If it's a struggle between love and hate, baby's gonna have to wait
Yeah yeah huh yeah, ooh yeah struggle
I'm in the middle, you're not the only one
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
It's a struggle, it's a struggle, baby, baby, baby, yeah
Well it's a struggle to make ends meet honey
Under pressure to express yourself
Then admit it, don't deny yourself, yeah yeah
Hard to fight, struggle, struggle
You and me should never feel neglected
Overlooked, overworked, overhooked, yeah
Doing as you're told, hell on hold
Through the night, without a fight
You gotta face the day
If you struggle baby, it only tightens up, yeah yeah
Uh yeahEmbed
