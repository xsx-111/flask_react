It Means a Lot LyricsTell by her movement
A flick of the hand
You know where you stand
What does it mean
It means a lot
Ah hug oh yeah
What does it mean
Tell me
Tell from a distance
Tell from a glance
(It means a lot)
Tell by the way she dance
(It means a lot)
(It means a lot)
Call it love
Takes two
(It means a lot)
What does it mean
(It means a lot)
Takes two
If she is shy
If she should blush
(It means a lot)
It should tell you enough
(It means a lot)
We'll call it love
(It means a lot)
Takes two baby
(It means a lot)
Oh What does it do for you
Does the same thing for me
Trial by jury
Trial by judge
Get this things out of court
Let's call it love
What does it mean
(It means a lot)
Call it affection
We call it love
(It means a lot)
Heaven's above
(It means a lot)
Ooh cool it
(It means a lot)
It means a lot
It means a lot
Ain't no illusion
Little lie
It means a lot
Don't get too excited baby before the factsEmbed
