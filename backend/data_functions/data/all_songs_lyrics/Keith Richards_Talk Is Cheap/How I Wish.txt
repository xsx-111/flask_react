How I Wish LyricsRichards-Jordan
How I wish that you were here again
How I wish that you were here again
Uh if I could see you and touch you with my hand
If I could feel you, but I know damn well I can't
How I wish that you were here again
How I wish I had you near again
If I could see you, oh just now and then
Oh if I could feel you but, I'd do my time again
(Oh honey, honey, honey, yeah)
If I could kiss you, caress you now and then
Ooh just to thrill you, I'd do life again, yeah
(Oh honey, honey, honey, yeah)
How I wish that you were here again
(Oh honey, honey, honey, yeah)
How I wish that you were here again
(Oh honey, honey, honey, yeah)
(Oh honey, honey, honey, yeah)
(Oh honey, honey, honey, yeah)Embed
