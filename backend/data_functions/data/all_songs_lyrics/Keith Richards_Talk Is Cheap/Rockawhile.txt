Rockawhile LyricsRockawhile
Baby stay yeah
I don't need to lie
You can believe it or leave it
Baby won't you stay with me
And rockawhile
Hold your breath - Babe
Close the shop, close the shop, Yeah
Rock a while
Baby come up here and
Rock a while
Stay with me, C'mon, Yeah
Tell me what you want now
I don't need to lie to you
Stay with me
Baby, baby stay with me and
Rockawhile

It's no cheaped shot there
Baby's just a square, yes she is

Rockawhile
Come over
Just Rockawhile
Have to rock in style
No strings attached
Just me and
Rockawhile
Just you
C'mon now baby stay with me
Stay yeah
Tell me what you wanna do
Stay yeah
And Rockawhile
No strings attached
Stay with me awhile
Tell me all your troubles againEmbed
