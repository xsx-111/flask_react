Whip It Up LyricsWhip
Whip it up
Whip
Whip it up
Don't know what you dream at night honey
Close your eyes and see
Leave the rest to me
I'll be stealin' in if you give me half a chance
C'mon baby let's get this dream to dance
Whip it up
C'mon Whip
Whip it up
Whip it up, Whip it up
Well it seems so sad to me, the way we carry on
Why, why baby can't we get along
I ain't deceivin' you if you ain't deceivin' me
Then someone else has lied to us Yeah
Don't deny it
Save it for another day
Don't save it for me
If I ain't good enought for you
Then maybe baby you ain't good enough, good enough for me
Whip it up baby
Just a flick of the wrist
Twist of the mind
Whip it up
Whip it up
Whip
Whip it upEmbed
