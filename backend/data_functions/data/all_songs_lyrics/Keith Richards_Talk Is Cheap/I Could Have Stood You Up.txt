I Could Have Stood You Up Lyrics(Verse One)
Well hung, friend of mine
He's size 8, I'm size 9
Shucks my dear
I'm gonna get a lick from you
One thing, one thing too
One thing to remember, that I could have
Yes I could have, uh yes I could have
I could have stood you up but I did, did, didn't, yeah yeah
Short fuse
Lights blew out
Power came back
Hear them shout
Shucks my dear, gotta get a lick from you
One thing, one thing too
One thing to remember that I could have
Yes I could have, baby but I could have
I could have stood you up but I did, did, didn't yeah yeah yeah
My shoes walk down the street
Only trouble is they ain't on my feet
Dig them kicks, they belong to me
One thing, one thing too
One thing to remember that I could have
Baby could have, yeah I could have
I could have stood you up but I did, did, didn't, didn't yeah
Rip it up, rip it down
Change the shape of the whole damn town
Shucks my dear, I'm gonna get a lick from you
One thing, one thing too, one thing to remember that I could have
Yes I could have, yeah but I could have
I could have stood you up but I did, did, did, did, did, did, did
I could have stood you up but I did, did, didn't yeah yeah1Embed
