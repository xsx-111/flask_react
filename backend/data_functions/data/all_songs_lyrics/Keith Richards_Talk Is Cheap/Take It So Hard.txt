Take It So Hard LyricsGiving up lovin', easy to do
People so pitiful they never come through
Honey, honey, honey, I ain't that way
(You want a little bit) once in a while, come on and get a bit
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah) you shouldn't take it (yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
Take a look around you, tell me, what do you see ?
People with little bits try, tryin' to smile
Most of what you've gotten is free (yeah)
(Yeah) you shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah) you shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
Yank it up baby or go get yourself a new name
You want a little bit once in a while, yeah you got a taste for it
You shouldn't take it (yeah) you shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
(Yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
You shouldn't take it so hard (yeah)
