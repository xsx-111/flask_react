Rhythms Lyrics
Mad in a way, but I don't say
It's what you're used to
Got the words, but can't convey
I know you'll turn it all around
It's the rhythm that you're going through
Get it back and you're not obliged to say
Not intact, but you're better off anyway
Somehow, it's never up to me

What if I would say simple words, I can't relate
I don't place upon your view
It's the rhythm that you're going through

I know what I want
You just take me through the motions
I know what I want
And that's more than you can say

Since you found me out
Since you found me out
Since you found me out
Since you found me out
Your story still remains
It's so unlike you, still, you stay the same
But all the while, you're counting on your day to come
But nothing ever told you
You would say that it's only for a day
Yesterday's last week, tomorrow's on its way
I'm falling faster all the time

What if I would say simple words, I can't relate
What came easy is now too late
And it was always standing right in front of me

'Cause I know what I want
You just take me through the motions
I know what I want
And that's more than you can say

All the time you thought worth saving
Still ends up with memories fading
After all that you wouldn't do
It makes no sense, it's the rhythm that you're going through
I know what I want
You just take me through the motions
I know what I want
And that's more than you can say
I know what I want
You just take me through the motions
I know what I want
And that's more than you can say

Since you found me out
Since you found me out
Since you found me out
Since you found me outEmbed
