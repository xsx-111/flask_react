Heart Attack Lyrics
Remember when there was nothing else to do
But lie in bed and
Wonder how it was always up to you
And no one else and

Early mornings, made by warnings
What's the point of the alarm that I'm ignoring?
It's even raining, I'm not complaining
But waking up is hard to do, so

Turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times today
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do

Remember when we would hang out everyday?
And we would rather
Not be told what to do or what to say
'Cause nothing mattered

Never boring, slept in mornings
Not ashamed of the habits that I'm forming
It's not important if days are shortened
I can't make time when nothing's new
'Cause waking up is hard to do, so
Turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times today
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two
Forget reality, waking up is hard to do

What's a day when it all ends up the same
And lasts forever
Can't complain when there's nothing there to blame
And things can't be better

Summer evenings, teenage grievings
Got no problem with the life that I've been leading
No concentration on hesitation
I can't make time when nothing's new
'Cause waking up is hard to do, so

Turn my head, it's back to bed with no delay
Can't be bothered by the phone ten times today
Why get up? My morning doesn't even start 'til two
Forget reality, waking up is hard to doEmbed
