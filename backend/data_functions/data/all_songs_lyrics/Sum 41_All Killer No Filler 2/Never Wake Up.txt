Never Wake Up Lyrics
Jump all you can and you got out your right foot
The sooner you get out in your hideaway
I might be left dead, side of the road
Serves a place and time

(Oh-oh-oh) I plan on never waking up
(Oh-oh-oh) I plan on never waking up

Jump all you can and you got out your right foot
The sooner you get out in your hideaway
I might be left dead, just get out the way
Serves a place and time

(Oh-oh-oh) I plan on never waking up
(Oh-oh-oh) I plan on never waking up
(Oh-oh-oh) I plan on never waking up
(Oh-oh-oh) I plan on never waking upEmbed
