Gemini LyricsWatching, waiting, rising, falling
Listening, calling, drifting
Touching, feeling, seeing, believing
(I see your shadow coming closer every day)
Hoping, sending, leaving
I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
If I tried to write a million words a day
I see your shadow coming closer
(I could not say why you and I are Gemini)
Then watch you drifting away
Watching, waiting, rising, falling
Listening, calling, drifting
Touching, stealing, seeing, believing
Hoping, sending, leaving
I couldn't say why you and I are Gemini
We are travelling a million worlds away
I see your shadow coming closer
Then watch you drifting away2Embed
