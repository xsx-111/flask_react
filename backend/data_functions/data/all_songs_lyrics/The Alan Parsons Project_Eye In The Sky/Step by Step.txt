Step by Step LyricsI was just a joker in a serious game
I didn't have the heart to play
But sooner or later
I'll find a reason to throw it away
Risin' on the crest of a natural wave
That never seems to break my way
I'm livin' without it
But I got to do something about it
Step by step little by little
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step take it line by line
(One day at a time)
Move move move, move a little closer
Step by step the deal is mine
I was just a runner in a one horse race
Livin' on the don't pass line
Sooner or later
I got to lose cause I'm wasting my time
Lady luck must have been a wonderful girl
She's never been a friend of mine
I'm living without her
But I still got that mountain to climb
Step by step little by little
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step take it line by line
(One day at a time)
Move move move, move a little closer
Step by step the deal is mine
Step by step little by little
(Move a little closer to me)
Step by step take it line by line
(One day at a time)
Move move move, move a little closer
Step by step the deal is mine2Embed
