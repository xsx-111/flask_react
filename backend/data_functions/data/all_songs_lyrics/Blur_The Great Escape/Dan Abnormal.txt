Dan Abnormal Lyrics
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Meanie Leanie, come on down
Come and entertain the town
It's Friday night and we're all bored
Time's been called, there is no more
Time's been called, it's such a bore

Dan Abnormal, not normal at all
It's not his fault, we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault, Dan watches TV
TV, TV, TV

The Meanie Leanie stays up late
Mopes around, gets in a state
He's the killer in your arcade
Shooting gangster ready-made
'Cause that is where the future's made

Dan Abnormal, not normal at all
It's not his fault, we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault, Dan watches TV
TV, TV, TV (teleport me)
TV, TV, TV (teleport me)
Dan went to his local burger bar
"I want McNormal and chips
Or I'll blow you to bits, give us it"

It's the miseries at half-past three
Watching video nasties
He has dirty dreams when he's asleep
'Cause Dan's just like you and me
He's the Meanie Leanie (All together now)

Dan Abnormal, not normal at all
It's not his fault, we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault, Dan watches TV
Dan Abnormal, not normal at all
It's not his fault, we made him this way
He'll imitate you, try to ape you
But it's not his fault, Dan Abnormal's me
