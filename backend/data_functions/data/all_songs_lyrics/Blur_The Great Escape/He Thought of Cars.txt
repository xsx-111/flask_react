He Thought of Cars Lyrics
Moscow's still red, the young man's dead
Gone to heaven instead
The evening news says he was confused
The motorways will all merge soon
Lottery winner buys the moon
They've come to save us, the space invaders are here

He thought of cars
And where, where to drive them
Who to drive them with
But there, there was no one, no one

There's panic at London Heathrow
Everybody wants to go up into the blue
But there's a ten-year queue
Columbia is in top gear
It shouldn't snow this time of year
America's shot, she's gone and done the lot, oh dear

He thought of planes
And where, where to fly to
And who to fly there with
But there, there was no one, no one
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la

He thought of cars
And where, where to drive them
And who to drive them with
But there, there was no one, no one

La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la3Embed
