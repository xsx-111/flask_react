Yuko & Hiro Lyrics
This is my work place and these are the people
I work with Yuko & Hiro, we work together
We work for the company that looks to the future
We work hard to please them, they will protect us

I never see you
We're never together
I'll love you forever

I drink in the evenings, it helps with relaxing
I can't sleep without drinking, we drink together
From Monday to Saturday, I go to my workplace
But on Sunday we're together, Yuko & Hiro

I never see you (I never see you)
We're never together (We're never together)
I'll love you forever (I'll love you forever)

Wareware wa kaisha de
Hataraiteiru
Itsumo karera ga
Mamotte kureru
Issho ni hataraku
Mirai no tame ni
I never see you (I never see you)
We're never together (We're never together)
I never see you (I never see you)
We're never together (We're never together)
I'll love you forever (I'll love you forever)

Wareware wa kaisha de
Hataraiteiru
Itsumo karera ga
Mamotte kureru
