Fade Away Lyrics
They stumbled into their lives
In a vague way became man and wife
One got the other
They deserved one another

They settled in a brand new town
With people from the same background
They kept themselves busy
Long hours left them dizzy

Now when he's in, she's out

All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away
He's not making plans, 'cause now he understands
All I want to do is fade away

He noticed he had visible lines
She worried about her behind
Their birth had been the death of them
It didn't really bother them
Now when she's in, he's out

All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away
She's not making plans, 'cause now she understands
All I want to do is fade away

When he's in, she's out

All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away
They're not making plans, 'cause now they understand
He must learn to forget, because this is all you'll ever get
All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away
They're not making plans, 'cause now they understand
All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away
All I want to do is fade away2Embed
