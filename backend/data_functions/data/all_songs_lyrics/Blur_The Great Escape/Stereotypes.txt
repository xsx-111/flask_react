Stereotypes Lyrics
The suburbs, they are dreaming, they're a twinkle in her eye
She's been feeling frisky since her husband said goodbye
She wears a low cut T-shirt, runs a little B&B
She's most accommodating when she's in her lingerie

Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya

Yes, they're stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time, you know
You should be going on another bender

The suburbs, they are sleeping, but he's dressing up tonight
She likes a man in uniform, he likes to wear it tight
They're on the lovers' sofa, they're on the patio
And when the fun is over, watch themselves on video

The neighbours may be staring
But they are just past caring
Yes, they're stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time, you know
You're going on another bender
Yes, there must be more to life than stereotypes


Wife-swapping is your future
You know that it would suit ya

Yes, they're stereotypes, there must be more to life
All your life you're dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time, you know
You should be going on another bender
Yes, there must be more to life than stereotypes
All your life you're dreaming and then you stop dreaming
From time to time, you know
You should go on another bender
Before you come to an end-ah7Embed
