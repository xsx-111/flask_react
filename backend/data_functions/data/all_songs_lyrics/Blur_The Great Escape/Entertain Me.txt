Entertain Me Lyrics
The weekend is back, but so is he
Head to the floodlights, see the fraternity, they're waiting
I hear them up in the north, down in the south
And all that is spewing, spewing out of his mouth is

Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me

At his and her dating, bored minds agree
Requirements to be stated and replies awaited
She wants a loose fit, he wants Instant Whip
Guesstimates her arrival, will she want it really badly?

Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me

A car, a house, both in a street
The boredom of a sober week
The weekend's here, hip-hip-hooray
To make the blues just go away
Entertain me (A car, a house, both in a street)
Entertain me (The boredom of a sober week)
Entertain me (The weekend's here, hip-hip-hooray)
Entertain me (To make the blues just go away)
Entertain me (A car, a house, both in a street)
Entertain me (The boredom of a sober week)
Entertain me (The weekend's here, hip-hip-hooray)
Entertain me (To make the blues just go away)
Entertain me
Entertain me
Entertain me
