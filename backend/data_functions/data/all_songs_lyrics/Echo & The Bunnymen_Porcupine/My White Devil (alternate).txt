My White Devil (alternate) LyricsJohn Webster was
One of the best there was
He was the author of
Two major tragedies
The White Devil and
The Duchess of Malfi
The White Devil and
The Duchess of Malfi
Change in the nether
Do I get the choice
Chance in forever
When do we get the spoils
Now that love is upside-down
It's down to us to say that
Our monkey brains
Content to laugh
When laughing wanes
It's time to change
Make on the when
I will be then
You on the then
We will be then
Here it comes again
Knocking on its feet
Here it comes again
Knocking on its feet
Don't say it's life on the barrier
Don't say it's life on the barrier
Don't say it's life on the barrier
Is it enough now
To tell me you matter
When you haven't a clue how
To bring me to tears
How many leaves must you crumble
Till you believe what I told you
That's a a stumble
Change in the nether
Do I get the choice
Chance it forever
When do we get the spoilsEmbed
