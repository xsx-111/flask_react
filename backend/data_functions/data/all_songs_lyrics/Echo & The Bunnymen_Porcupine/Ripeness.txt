Ripeness LyricsI found a thing in a bedroom
Change the shape of the world
For long enough
Got the boat til as far as I could
Afford it to take me
It was far enough
Mature you said at the wrong time
Broke my aging skin 'cause age was mine
Had a field day
Smelt like roses
Harvesting my thoughts 'cause it was time
When you grasped the question
Did you miss the meaning
When you met your challenge
Did you go out fighting
We will discover
Ripeness twice over
Sing your song
Worth its weight
In god gold
Curse its fate
When you grasped the question
Did you miss the meaning
When you met your challenge
Did you go out fighting
How will we recover
Ripeness when it's over
I lost something in a big room
Change the shape of the world
For long enough
When you grasped the question
Did you miss the meaning
When you met your challenge
Did you go out fighting
When you climbed on top
Did you fall on shadows
And then clambering off
Did you fall on rainbows
How will we recover
Ripeness when it's over
How will we recover
Ripeness when it's over
Neither kinder nor the kinder
Are you fuel for the fire
Neither uber nor the over
Must have others to inspire
I've discovered my Nietzche
I've discovered my Nietzche
Death should be unleashed
Or something
Do tell me
What's the difference?
Do tell me
What's the differenceEmbed
