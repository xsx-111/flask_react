The Back of Love LyricsI'm on the chopping block
Chopping off my stopping thought
Self doubt and selfism
Were the cheapest things I ever bought
When you say it's love
D'you mean the back of love
When you say it's love
D'you mean the back of love?
We're taking advantage of
Breaking the back of love
We're taking advantage of
Breaking the back of love
Easier said than done you said
But it's more difficult to say
With eyes bigger than our bellies
We want to but we can't look away
What were you thinking of
When you dreamt that up?
What were you thinking of
When you dreamt that up?
Taking advantage of
Breaking the back of love
When you're surrounded by a simple chain of events
(Behind my eyes, behind my eyes)
(Your eyes don't lie)
Eventually you'll shack those shackles off
(Dreams above those eyes)
(Those eyes)
We can't tell our left from right
But we know we love extremes
Getting to grips with the ups and downs
Because there's nothing in between
When you say that's love
D'you mean the back of love
When you say that's love
D'you mean the back of love?
Taking advantage of
Breaking the back of love
What were you thinking of
When you dreamt that up?
We're taking advantage of
We're breaking the back of love
Breaking the back of loveEmbed
