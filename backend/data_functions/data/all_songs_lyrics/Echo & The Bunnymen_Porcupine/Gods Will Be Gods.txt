Gods Will Be Gods LyricsHow can you pretend
When there's so much at stake
That it's a different world
And your hands don't shake
At the end of the room
And the foot of the bar
We knew that soon
We'd be making our mark
Why do you defend
The part you have to take
With your fingers on the world
Hoping your hands don't shake
When you get the time
Why not think about
Connecting yours and mine
And turning in to out
Back to the bar
I was feeling it
The hole in the floor
Was where I would sit
Positions will be lost
And things will fall in place
The falling will not stop
Till we have found our face
Oh will you mention
Oh will you mention
My name to one
Oh will you mention
My name to me
Gods will be gods
But my lord forgot
I was made out of skin
Bones will be bones
But when I came home
There was no one in
So where were you staying
While I was out playing
Was nobody laying the foundation
The fulfilling of our killing
How can you pretend
That there's so much at stake
And it's a different world
And everything shakes
I am the unknown
You're the after taste
I am total love
I am total hate
Let's face facts
We won't mind
Of us
We will...Embed
