The Cutter Lyrics
Who's on the seventh floor
Brewing alternatives
What's in the bottom drawer
Waiting for things to give

Spare us the cutter
Spare us the cutter
Couldn't cut the
Mustard

Conquering myself until
I see another hurdle approaching
Say we can, say we will
Not just another drop in the ocean

Come to the free for all
With Sellotape and knives
Some of us six feet tall
We will escape our lies
Spare us the cutter
Spare us the cutter
Couldn't cut the
M-m-mustard
Am I the happy loss
Will I still recoil
When the skin is lost
Am I the worthy cross
Will I still be soiled
When the dirt is off

Ocean
Watch the fingers close
When the hands are cold

Am I the happy loss
Will I still recoil
When the skin is lost
Am I the worthy cross
Will I still be soiled
When the dirt is off
Am I the happy loss
Will I still be soiled
When the dirt is off4Embed
