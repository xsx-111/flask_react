Higher Hell LyricsSmack in the middle of today
Got to learn new words
Merely got to simply say
I think we all misheard
Cracked in the middle of me
Have to find my heart
Smiling equates with happy
But I know they're miles apart
Just like my lower heaven
You know so well my higher hell
When confronted by
Continuing the course
Will you open up
Or do I have to force
The words right out
Of your stubborn mouth?
Stunted of course
Guilty in their growth
Just like my lower heaven
You know so well my higher hell
Crashed through the floor today
I couldn't find my legs
Suppose you live and learn
Learn it again and again
Smack in the middle of today
Got to find new words
Merely got to simply say
I think we all misheard
Just like my lower heaven
You know so well my higher hell
(When confronted by continuing the course)
(Will you open up or do I have to force)
(The words right out)
(Of your stubborn mouth)
(Stunted of course)
(Guilty in their growth)Embed
