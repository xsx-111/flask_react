In Bluer Skies Lyrics
What needs must be
I realised
I'm walking out
From blackened skies
You say belief
Is in our eyes
But how can I believe
In blind lies

I'm counting
On your heavy heart
Could it keep me
From falling apart

Have we been born to follow
Tied to a bitter rein
Or will we begin to grow
Bound by this simple chain
Will we evolve tonight
Sparkle like brittle stars
Can we dissolve tonight
Held by your hungry arms
I'm counting
On your heavy heart
Could it keep me
From falling apart

I would be ready
Ready to go
Was your heart heavy
Heavy with sorrow
Had you been heavy
We could have both been grown
Now your heart's heavy
Heavy with sorrow

I'm counting
On your heavy heart
Did it keep me
From falling apart

What needs have been
You'll realize
I've found myself
In bluer skies
I know belief
Is in your eyes
We can't believe
In blind lies

I'm counting
On your heavy heart
To keep me
From falling apartEmbed
