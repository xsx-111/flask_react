Ova Nova Lyrics
I'm chilled, I'm chilled, I'm fresh, I'm home
I'm tradition I'm chilled I'm hungry for my choice
Your request as love suggest if I can’t do this
Everything you want

You’re fruit you’re fruit never played your name
Cause flesh just selection radio 
You’re break you’re eyes you’re passenger 
Now everything now coming my way
(And you are mine and you are mine)
Change your mind
(And you are mine and you are mine)
Change your mind
(And you are mine and you are mine)

You’re hope you never have to knows your name
 what you did 
Have to tell the time 

Change your mind
Change your mind
That’s a paradox of choice
And that’s the business of options
(Wanna go, wanna go, wanna go)
Hope for the future collective nation
(Everybody everybody everybody everybody)
Change your mind
Change your mind
Change your mind, try
Change your mind
Change your mind, tryEmbed
