Twenty Three Blue LyricsLittle imitation plastic wood (go?)
The wind is coming, wait
Time moved slowly on the island
Pale the dagger, pale the digger, on-puller
Of the white line (...?)
Nothing is a problem
The sound of you, like geese
The sound of you, ringing
Crystal do it in a flat bed
Shapes I never seen like days before
Cover the city tonight
Sleep, hey
Cold head
Blue coming wrap around us
Come on take me home
Walking slow
Breathing upstairs and laughter
Rippling...
Footsteps in grey
For listening
Dipped in black
Smiling
Descends the stairs
Winter walks in
Phone rings, I hesitate
Then hang, then answer
Can we come to see you later .?
Do you feel the cold of winter
Touching steaming paper
Itâ€²s up to you
Before the world wakes up
Do u feel the cold of winter
Do u feel the cold of winter
Do u feel the cold of winter
Do u feel the cold of winter
Do u feel the cold of winter
Wearing black
Between the trees
Very, very blue
Left foot, try to stop
Walking through the wind
Cold knuckles
Slow browns and greys
Laughed post to faceman (?)
Selling Monday in the market
Winter streets dries bones
Do u feel the cold...Embed
