Survival Lyrics
I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint, it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell

So, here's my story (My story)
No risk, no glory (No glory)

A little up and down, and all around
It's all about survival

I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint, it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell

So, here's my question (My question)
Does your criticism (Criticism)
Have you caught up in what you cannot see?
Well, if you give me respect
Then you'll know what to expect
A little up and down, and all around
It's all about survival
Up and down and all around
It's all about survival

I'll never be an angel
I'll never be a saint, it's true
I'm too busy surviving
Whether it's heaven or hell
I'm gonna be living to tell

So, here's my story (My story)
No risk, no glory (No glory)

A little up and down, and all around
It's all about survival
Up and down, and all around
It's all about survival
Up and down, and all around
It's all about survival
Up and down, and all around
It's all about survival
(Up and down, and all around)
I'll never be an angel
(Up and down, and all around) Survival
(Up and down, and all around)
I'll never be a saint, it's true
(Up and down, and all around) Survival
(Up and down, and all around)
I'll never be an angel
(Up and down, and all around) Survival
(Up and down, and all around)
I'll never be a saint, it's true
(Up and down, and all around) Survival2Embed
