The Bones of You Lyrics
So I'm there
Charging around with a juggernaut brow
Overdraft speeches and deadlines to make
Cramming commitments like cats in a sack
Telephone burning and a purposeful gait
When out of a doorway the tentacles stretch
Of a song that I know
And the world moves in slow-mo
Straight to my head like the first cigarette of the day

And it's you, and it's May
And we're sleeping through the day
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

Do I have time? A man of my calibre?
Stood in the street like a sleepwalking teenager? No!
And I dealt with this years ago
I took a hammer to every memento
But image on image like beads on a rosary
Pull through my head as the music takes hold
And the sickener hits: I can work 'til I break
But I love the bones of you
That I will never escape
And it's you, and it's May
And we're sleeping through the day
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

And I can't move my arm
For fear that you will wake
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away

And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away
And it's you, and it's May
And we're sleeping through the day
And I'm five years ago
And three thousand miles away9Embed
