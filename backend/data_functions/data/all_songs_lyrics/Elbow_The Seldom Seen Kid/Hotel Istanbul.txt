Hotel Istanbul LyricsHotel Istanbul and I was folded at the table
Well, the cabaret was dull
And yes the yellow moon half-empty
So I slid between the bars
And I cast away my runes
On the cab ride via Mars
And I landed in this room
Pissed, I twist the mystery radio dial
I found a voice that almost raised a smile
It was just like yours
And I fantasize translation
And it's just like you
To call when I'm exposed
Damn your eyes
So blue
To have you near me
One red flare
If you're there
And you can hear me
Hotel Istanbul and I was notifying strangers
That my pugilistic flare could mean a consequential danger
But the maitre'd was deft and I was parting from my breath
His way of asking me to leave
It was a very sorry scene
Pissed, I just insist that no one cares
That love has only thrown me down the stairs
Then I hear your voice
Full of love and understanding
And I know your voice
Will always call me home
Damn your eyes
So blue
To have you near me
One red flare
If you're there
And you can hear meEmbed
