The Fix LyricsThe fix is in
There's a nag gonna dance home at Epsom
The fix is in
Can't wait to see how it upsets 'em
Too many times we've been postally pipped
We've loaded the saddles, the mickeys are slipped
We're swapping the turf for the sand and the surf and the sin
'Cause the fix, the fix is in
The fix is in
The odds that I got were delicious
The fix is in
The jockey is cocky and vicious
The redoubtable beast has had Pegasus pills
We'll buy him the patch in the Tuscany hills
And the Vino di Vici will flow like a river in spring
Now the fix, the fix is in
The fix is in
The snaps of the steward so candid
The fix is in
Yes, our pigeons have finally landed
The Donahue sisters will meet us in France
In penguins and pearls, we'll drink and we'll dance
'Til the end of our days 'cause it ain't left to chance that we win
'Cause the fix, the fix is in1Embed
