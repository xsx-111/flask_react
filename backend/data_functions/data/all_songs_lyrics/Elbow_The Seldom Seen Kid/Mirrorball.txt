Mirrorball LyricsI plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face
That wouldn't let me sleep
And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you dear
Everything has changed
My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore dear
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirrorball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed

So lift off love
Lift off love
And we took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirrorball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
So lift off love
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)4Embed
