One Day Like This Lyrics
Drinking in the morning sun
Blinking in the morning sun
Shaking off the heavy one
Heavy like a loaded gun
What made me behave that way?
Using words I never say
I can only think it must be love
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
Someone tell me how I feel
It's silly wrong but vivid right
Oh, kiss me like the final meal
Yeah, kiss me like we die tonight
Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with you half awake
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day
When my face is chamois-creased
If you think I wink, I did
Laugh politely at repeats
Yeah, kiss me when my lips are thin
Cause holy cow, I love your eyes
And only now I see the light
Yeah, lying with me half awake
Stumbling over what to say
Oh, anyway, it's looking like a beautiful day

Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right
Throw those curtains wide!
One day like this a year would see me right4Embed
