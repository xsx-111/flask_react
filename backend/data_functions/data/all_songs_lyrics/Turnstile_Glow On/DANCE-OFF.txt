DANCE-OFF LyricsWe came in through the same door
I don't know what we came for
If we don’t let our feelings show
Then it's easy come, easy go
I guess we'll never know
And so it’s goodbye
It was a good time
The world is changing
Or is it me who's not the same?
And it's a dance-off
You're going your way, I'm going mine
But are we alive?
I know we came in through the same door
But I don't live there anymore
Ring the bell, nobody's home
Now now now easy come, easy go
I guеss we'll never know
And so it’s goodbyе
It was a good time
The world is changing
Or is it me who’s not the same?
And it's a dance-off
You’re going your way, I'm going mine
But are we alive?
And so it's goodbye
It was a good time
The world is changing
Or is it me who's not the same?
And it’s a dance-off
You're going your way, I'm going mine
But are we alive?Embed
