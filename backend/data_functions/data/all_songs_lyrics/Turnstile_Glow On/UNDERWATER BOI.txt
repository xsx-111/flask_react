UNDERWATER BOI LyricsFallen by the wayside
Never on the timeline
I just need to know I'm
Working for the big prize
When I get to heaven will I know?
Boi has got a long way to go (underwater)
Swimming through the seasons of cold (underwater)
Living with a pain he don't know (underwater)
Boi has got a long way
Ride alone beside me
Here but gone tomorrow
No goodbyes, I'm always here but gone
Fallen by the wayside
Never on the timeline
I just need to know I'm
Working for the big prize
When I get to heaven will I know?
Boi has got a long way to go (underwater)
Swimming through the seasons of cold (underwater)
Living with a pain he don't know (underwater)
Boi has got a long way
Boi has got a long way
Boi has got a long way
Boi has got a long way2Embed
