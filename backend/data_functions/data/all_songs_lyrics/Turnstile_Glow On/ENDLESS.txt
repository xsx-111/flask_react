ENDLESS Lyrics
Brain is in the clouds
Shot down every time I come around and try to get it off the ground
Following a feeling in my heart
Even if it all just falls apart
When I hit a wall I gotta
Break in, break in

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Brain is in the clouds
Shot down every time I come around and try to get it off the ground
Following a feeling in my heart
Even if it all just falls apart
When I hit a wall I gotta
Break in, break in

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah1Embed
