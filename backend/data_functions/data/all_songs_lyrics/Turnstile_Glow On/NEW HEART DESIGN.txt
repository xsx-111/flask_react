NEW HEART DESIGN LyricsDo I really have a say?
Change is guaranteed to roll in like waves
Running all around to redefine and rebegin
Praying for a chance to lock in
When my eyes get blurred I'm losing my design
In a crowd, I'm lonely all the time
You know you really gotta leave
But the sugar never tastes half as sweet
18 years and ain't it funny how it feels
When you start to find out life's real
When my eyes get blurred I'm losing my design
In a crowd, I'm lonely all the time
When the lines get blurred I'm losing my design
In a crowd, I'm lonely all the time
