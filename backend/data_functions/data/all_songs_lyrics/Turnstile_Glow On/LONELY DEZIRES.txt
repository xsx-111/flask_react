LONELY DEZIRES Lyrics
Not on strings anymore
It's these things that I live for
My lonely desires

Not machine anymore
It's these dreams that I live for
My lonely desires
Lonely desires
Lonely desires

Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow on
Glow onEmbed
