MYSTERY Lyrics
There's a gun to my head
Are you gonna get it right?
And I believe in holding on to life
But I'm afraid, too

And it's been so long
Is all the mystery gone?
And it's been so long
All the mystery
All the mystery

There's a clock in my head
Is it wrong, is it right?
I know you're scared of running out of time
But I'm afraid, too

And it's been so long
Is all the mystery gone?
And it's been so long
All the mystery

Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
Ohhh
And it's been so long
Is all the mystery gone?
And it's been so long
All the mystery4Embed
