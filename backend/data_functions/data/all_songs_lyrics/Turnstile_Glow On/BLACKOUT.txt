BLACKOUT Lyrics
Blackout in the middle of the light
And now I'm back down with a feeling, and I collide
You know it won't be long until the end
Let the spotlight shine on me again

Blackout in the middle of your life
Just like a blackout in the middle of the night
You know it won't be long until the end
Let the spotlight shine on me

And if it makes you feel alive
Well, then I'm happy I provide
And when you see me on the floor
It's just the part of my show, show, show, show, show
Oh, yeah

And if it makes you feel alive
Well, then I'm happy I provide
And when you see me on th–µ floor
It's just the part of my show
It's just the part of my show
It's just the part of myEmbed
