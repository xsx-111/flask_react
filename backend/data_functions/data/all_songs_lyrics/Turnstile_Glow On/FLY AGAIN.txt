FLY AGAIN LyricsOh, do you really wanna fly again?
Oh, will you ever get that high again?
Didn't I give a damn good try, oh, didn't I?
Didn't I build a world with my design?
Still can't fill the hole you left behind (Long nights)
Still can't fill the hole you left behind (Long nights)
Still can't fill the hole you left behind
Oh, do you really wanna fly again?

Still can't fill the hole you left behind (Long nights)
Still can't fill the hole you left behind (Long nights)
Still can't fill the hole you left behind
You left behind
You left behind
Still can't fill the hole you left behind
Still can't fill the hole you left behind2Embed
