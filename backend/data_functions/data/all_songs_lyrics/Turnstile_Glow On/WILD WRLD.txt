WILD WRLD LyricsOh, you better hide, outside it's a mad scene
Stepping on each other with all eyes up on the big screen
Running like we got somewhere to go
Every high is followed with a low, low, low, low
Wild times
So easy to find in such a wild world
In such a wild world
In such a wild
No one makes it out the fire
Faces passing by, what's inside is invisible
Lost another friend to a fight that I'll never know
Running like I got somewhere to go
And every high is followed with a low, low, low, low
Wild times
So easy to find in such a wild world
In such a wild world
In such a wild
No one makes it out the fireEmbed
