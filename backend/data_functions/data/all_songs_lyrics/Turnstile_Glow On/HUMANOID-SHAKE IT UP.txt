HUMANOID/SHAKE IT UP Lyrics(I'm ready)
Ain't nobody getting in (locked down)
Ain't nobody getting out (locked down)
Ain't no other way around (locked down)
Now you're in a lockdown (locked down)
Ain't nobody getting in (locked down)
Ain't nobody getting out (locked down)
Ain't no other way around (locked down)
Now you're in a lockdown (locked down)
Stuck inside your frame it's got you now
Shake it up
Shake it upEmbed
