T.L.C. (TURNSTILE LOVE CONNECTION) LyricsI want to touch
A level up
Want more connection
And that's enough
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.LC. for me
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C. for free
I want to trust
Less loneliness
A little charm
A constant rush
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.LC for me
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C
A little T.L.C. for free
I need more
"Boom boom boom"
"Boom boom boom"
"Boom boom boom"
