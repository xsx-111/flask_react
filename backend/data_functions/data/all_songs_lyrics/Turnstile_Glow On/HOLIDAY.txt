HOLIDAY LyricsNow it's a holiday
Now it's a holiday
Make a little room I wanna free up from the vine
I wanna celebrate
Close enough to feel and now it's time to disappear
I wanna celebrate
So I can never feel the cold
I can never feel the cold
I can never feel the cold
I can never feel the cold
Now it's a holiday
Now it's a holiday
Too bright to live, too bright to die
I wanna celebrate
Beauty is built not from outside
And I imagine it
So I can never feel the cold
I can never feel the cold
I can never feel the cold
I can never feel the cold
And I can sail with no direction
And I can sail with no direction
And I can sail with no direction
And I can sail with no direction
And I can sail with no direction
And I can sail with no direction
What
And I can say with no direction (hey)
And I can say with no direction (yeah)
I can say with no direction (hey)
I can say with no direction
Like it's a holiday1Embed
