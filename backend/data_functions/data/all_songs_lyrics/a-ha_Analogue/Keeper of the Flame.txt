Keeper of the Flame LyricsGive it up for rock and roll
Give it up for rock
Give it up for how it made you feel
Give it up for vinyl days
Kicking back from school
Turn it up to make it real sweet
Give it up for rock and roll
Give it up for Bob
Give it up for how it made you see
Give it up for Silvertone
Give it up for gold
Adolescent daydreams
Incidental incidents
Instrumental instruments
The plan you hold is too grand to entertain
Monumental monuments
Sentimental sentiments
You could have been the keeper of the flame
You could have been the keeper of the flame one day
Incidental incidents
Instrumental instruments
Swallowed by the place from which you came
Monumental monuments
Sentimental sentiments
You should have been the keeper of the flame
Give it up for summer days
Laying in the grass
Everything is happening in your head
You raise your fist up in the air
Clench your teeth and say
Four more years and I am out of here
Four more years and I am out of hereEmbed
