Holy Ground LyricsTake your pride and lift it high
I have come to say goodbye
You’ve got your life and I’ve got mine
Sometimes hard to draw that line
I like to walk and my way is my own
You taught me how, don’t you know
And there must be some place to meet
I'll take off my shoes, I’ll walk barefoot when I do
Standing there in front of you
Want to be honest, I want to be true
I like to walk and my way is my own
You taught me how, don’t you know what we found
Brother maybe
We’re on holy ground
(Brother, take your pride and lift it high)
Take your pride and lift it high
(There must be some place somewhere some time)
I must leave without you, good advice
I grow stronger where the mountains rise
Standing there in front of you
I want to be honest, I want to be true
In front of you
(Brother, take your pride and lift it high)
And I praise you
(There must be some place somewhere some time)
We’re on holy ground
(Brother, take your pride and lift it high)
Take your pride and lift it high
(There must be some place somewhere some time)
And I praise you
Take your pride and lift it high
I am here to say goodbyeEmbed
