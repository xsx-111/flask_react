The Summers of Our Youth LyricsThere's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
It happens all the time
Just let the plot unwind
As we look back and see
Our yesterdays entwine
The beauty and the truth
The summers of our youth
And you can go there any time
The movies on your mind
And you can see it clearly
Where we overstepped the line
What you going to do when lights go out
What you going to think it's all about
What you going to do when time is up
What you going to do to make it change the way you feel
Our life's a precious gift
You've felt it once or twice
But everything comes once
But once a million times
But you can find it anywhere
You know I speak the truth
I wish there was a way back
To the summers of our youth
What you going to do when time is up
What you going to do to make a start
What you going to do when lights go out
What you going to think it's all a-, think it's all aboutEmbed
