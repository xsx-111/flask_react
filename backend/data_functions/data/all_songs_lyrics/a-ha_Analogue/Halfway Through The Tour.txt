Halfway Through The Tour LyricsHalfway through the tour
We’ll be somewhere else tomorrow
Halfway through the tour
We’ll be somewhere else tomorrow
And you know I can’t wish for more
Than walking out that door
And make it for home tomorrow
Halfway through the tour
Halfway through the tour
Houses set back from the road
Halfway through the tour
Across a dry expanse we go
And you know I can’t wish for more
Than walking out that door
And make it for home tomorrow
Halfway through the tour
But when the crowds engage
And brings you to a place
That you know
Everyone can be a part of
Everyone can be a part of it
Halfway through the tour
While there’s money to be made
Halfway through the tour
From the public eye we fade
And you know across a dry expanse
We’re flying by the seat of our pants
We’ll be somewhere else tomorrow
Halfway through the tour
I can’t do much more
Than make it for home tomorrow
