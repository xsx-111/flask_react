White Dwarf LyricsThere's a big black picture
And it's hanging on your wall
With stars and all the planets
The milky way and all
And in the left hand corner
Perhaps a small white dwarf
Ready to explode, implode
I really can't recall
But it's out there
And I'm down here
And so far from it all
Everything's expanding
In a constant state of change
Everything's demanding
In a constant state of pain
You radiate away
Your last remaining heat
Your atmosphere has blown away
When you admit defeat
But it's out there (don't know where we are)
And I'm down here (don't know why we are)
And so far from it all
Your time
Your grace
Your story in place
Your life-span erased
There's a big black picture
And it's hanging off your wall
With stars and all the planets
The milky way and all
And in the left hand corner
Perhaps a small white dwarf
Ready to explode, implode
I really can't recall
But it's out there (don't know where we are)
And I'm down here (don't know why we are)
And so far from it all
And I'm out here (don't know where we are)
Down where (don't know why we are)
I'm so far from it allEmbed
