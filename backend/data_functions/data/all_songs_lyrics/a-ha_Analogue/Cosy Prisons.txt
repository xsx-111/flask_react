Cosy Prisons LyricsTake a moment if you dare, catch yourself a breath of air
There's another life out there and you should try it
Dead ends hide on every street, look before you place your feet
Cracks and fissures keep the beat and you're inside it
Every thought you never dared to think
Every mood you always knew would sink
Every line you spoke out loud in a jest
All the time you took to be your best is soon forgotten
The sun must never touch your skin, it could expose the dark within
You're paranoid about the paranoia
And panic hits without a sign, you worry about it all the time
Every perfect moment is a hidden warning
Cause everything makes your pretty head spin
Nagging thoughts are starting to sink in
With everything this way it's better to forget
Than end up in a place with something to regret
Your transatlantic shopping spree, your health forever guarantees
Organic bio life's a breeze in cozy prisons
But hiding out in a salad bar isn't going to get you far
And bottled wine is vinegar tomorrow
And everything around it makes your pretty head spin
It's piling up high and you're back where you begin
Moments you tried so hard to forget
Are promising to have been the best one's yet
Yeah, every time you shut your eyes it appears
Every time you trace your steps back here
None of your convictions have the same old ring
But no doubt you found a place for everything cozy prisons
So if you're careful you won't get hurt
But if your careful all the time then what's it worth?Embed
