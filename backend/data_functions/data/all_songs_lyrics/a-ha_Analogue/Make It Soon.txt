Make It Soon LyricsI watch my love, she's sleeping, the air around her deepened
Tomorrow she will smile again, tomorrow she'll get wild again
My love and the moon, take your time, make it soon
I didn't mean to hurt you, it's what I use the words to
Every time we lose our way get so many things to say
My love and the moon, take your time, make it soon
I see you and I hear you call but sometimes when I lost it all
I go out of my mind to see what I can find, I can find
I watch my love, she's sleeping, the air around her deepened
Tomorrow she will smile again, tomorrow she'll get wild again, my loveEmbed
