In The Wind Lyrics
You've been gone for a long, long time
You've been in the wind, you've been on my mind
You are the purest soul I've ever known
In my life
Take your time, let the rivers guide you in
You know where you can find me again
I'll be waiting here till the stars fall out
Of the sky

When you left, I was far too young
To know you're worth more than the moon and the sun
You are still alive when I look to the sky
In the night
I would wait for a thousand years
I would sit right here by the lake, my dear
You just let me know that you're coming home
And I'll wait for you

Years have gone, but the pain is the same
I have passed my days by the sound of your name
Well, they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby, oh-ho?
Death is a wall, but it can't be the end
You are my protector and my best friend
Well, they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby, oh-ho?

How do they know? Well, they don't...2Embed
