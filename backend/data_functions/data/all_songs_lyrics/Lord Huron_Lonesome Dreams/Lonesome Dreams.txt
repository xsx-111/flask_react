Lonesome Dreams Lyrics
I land on an island coast
Where the only souls I see are ghosts
I run through a wooded isle
And I chase the sunlight mile after mile
And I feel like I know this place
As the tree line breaks into wide-open space
I stare at a bright red sun
Though I search all day, I never find anyone

I walk on a winding road
In the deep of the night near the edge of the known
I pass by a moonlit lake
And a cold wind blows and my bones start to shake
And I feel I should know this place
As the road winds on into wide-open space
The wind plays a haunting tone
As I make my way through the night all alone

I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
And a road that don't never end
I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
What am I destined to be? It's a mystery, baby
Just please don't leave me alone, yeah

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I lie under starlit sky
And the seasons change in the blink of an eye
I watch as the planets turn
And the old stars die and the young stars burn
But I don't really know this place
And it's lonesome here in the wide-open space
Can it be as real as it seems?
Maybe this time, I won't wake from the dream

I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I've got no friends
Just the rocks and the trees in my lonesome dreams
And a road that don't never end
I been dreaming again of a lonesome world
Where I'm lost and I'm on my own
What am I destined to be? It's a mystery, baby
Just please don't leave me alone, yeah


Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh9Embed
