The Man Who Lives Forever Lyrics
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

They said we're all gonna die, but I'll never believe it
I love this world and I don't wanna leave it
Said that death is a deal that you cannot refuse
But I love you, girl, and I don't wanna lose you

Don't want a long ride
I don't wanna die at all
I wanna be the man who lives forever
I ain't never gonna die and I want you to come

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

They said life is a tale, it begins and it ends
And forever's a word that we can't understand
Well, I know that my life's better when we're together
So why can't our story just go on forever?
Don't want a long ride
I don't wanna die at all
I wanna be the man who lives forever
I ain't never gonna die and I want you to come

Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh

They said life without end wouldn't have any meaning
The journey to death is the point of our being
Well, the point of my life is to be with you, babe
But there ain't enough time in the life that they gave me

They said we're all gonna die, but I'll never believe it
I love this world and I don't wanna leave it
Said that death is a deal that you cannot refuse
But I love you, girl, and I don't wanna lose you

(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever
(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever
(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever
(Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh ooh) I wanna be the man who lives forever

And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights (forever together, forever alive)Embed
