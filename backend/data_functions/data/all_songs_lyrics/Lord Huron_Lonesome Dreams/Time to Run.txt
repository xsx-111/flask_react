Time to Run Lyrics

It's time to run
They'll string me up for all that I've done
I'm going soon
I'm gonna leave tonight by the light of the moon
I did it all for you
Well, I hope you know the lengths I've gone to
What's a man to say?
They'll be looking for me, should be on my way

(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) I ain't ever gonna let 'em take my life from me

I've no regrets
I will not ask for your forgiveness
Lower your defense
Run away with me, it'll all make sense
I did it all for you
Don't spurn me after all I've gone through
No time to rest
Gonna find me a life, baby, way out west
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
(Ooh, oh) But I ain't ever...


I will run, but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds
I will run, but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds

It's time to run
Well, I hope you understand what I've done
Run away for you
I'm gonna count the days till you make it through
I did it all for you
Well, I hope you live the life you want to
My time is spent
Baby, please don't tell 'em just where I went

(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) But I ain't ever gonna let 'em take my life from me
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
(Ooh, oh) I wanted everybody else in the world to know
(Ooh, oh) But I ain't ever...1Embed
