Brother Lyrics
~chanting~

How long have I known you, brother?
Hundreds of lives, thousands of years
How many miles have we wandered
Under the sky, chasing our fear?
Some kind of trouble is coming
Don't know when, don't know what
I will stand by you, brother
Till the daylight comes or I'm dead and gone

I've shared my life with you, brother
Since I recall, you've been my friend
You say we're not like the others
Still, we must die; all things must end
I know we can't stop what's coming
But I will try, oh, how I'll try
Will you fight with me, brother?
One last time, one last fight?

Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end

Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers till the end
Don't run away - our time will come, but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you till the endEmbed
