Lullaby Lyrics
You arise along with the sun
Where have you been, darlin'? What have you done?
You were out finding trouble again
There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands
Come inside and lie down to sleep
You ain't gonna run and you know that you're beat
Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do

Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever

Lord knows you've been 'round in your day
But this kind of trouble, won't just go away
Darlin', now you're adrift in the deep
So just lay down your head and I'll sing you to sleep


Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh oh
Oh oh-oh, oh oh ohEmbed
