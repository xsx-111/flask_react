She Lit a Fire Lyrics
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh

I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains, I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh eh, hey, eh eh

Where could that girl have gone?
Where? I've wandered far
Where could that girl have gone?
She left no trail, but I cannot fail; I will find her

(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
Where could that girl have gone?
Where? I've wandered far
Where could that girl have gone?
She left no trace, but I know her face; I will find her

Hey-eh, eh, eh eh
Hey-eh, eh, eh eh

When last I saw her, she was dancing all alone
Perhaps my chance was then; I'll never know
I'll search the world until there's no place left to go
And if she leaves it, I will follow, I will follow


(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
(Hey-eh, eh, eh eh)
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains, I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
