The Ghost on the Shore Lyrics
I'm just a man, but I know that I'm damned
All the dead seem to know where I am
The tale that began on the night of my birth
Will be done in a turn of the earth

Lie where I land, let my bones turn to sand
I was born on the lake and I don't want to leave it
Every eye on the coast ever more
Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore

Under the waves and the earth of an age
Lie a thousand old northerners' graves
Deep in the night when the moon's glowing bright
They come rising up into the night

Die if I must, let my bones turn to dust
I'm the lord of the lake and I don't want to leave it
All who sail off the coast ever more
Will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore

I'm goin' away for a long time
I'm goin' away for a long time
Lie where I land, let my bones turn to sand
I was born on the lake and I don't want to leave it
Every eye on the coast ever more
Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore

Die if I must, let my bones turn to dust
I'm the lord of the lake and I don't want to leave it
All who sail off the coast ever more
Will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore

I'm goin' away for a long time...7Embed
