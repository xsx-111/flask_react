I Will Be Back One Day Lyrics
I wanna live in a land of lakes
Where the great waves break
And the night runs right into the day
Wanna be with ones I left
But I’m way out west
And the years keep on slipping away
Wanna run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins
Where the fires of my ancestors burned
I remember that fateful day
When I ran away
And you told me I couldn’t return

You made me swear I’d never forget
I made a vow I’d see you again
I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake


I've been running a long, long time
Trying to flee that life
But I can’t seem to leave it behind
Wanna visit the windswept shores
Of a time before
When the moon and the stars were aligned
I remember the bright spring day
When you sparked that flame
And a fire that continues to burn
I remember the day I left
Headin’ way out west
When you told me to never return

You made me swear I’d never forget
I made a vow I’d see you again
I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake

I will be back one day
And I’ll find you there by the great big lake1Embed
