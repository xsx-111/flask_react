Mb. Indifferentia LyricsYou lay awake at night, but stay in your bed
Trying to undermine the voice in your head
Knowing you ought to, but still find a reason
Silently laying low, morbid fear will justify your treason
Look the other way to see
Comfort in the pain to be
The end of a life is close at hand
You're standing tall
Keep out of trouble, do your worst
Do nothing at all
Keeping watch, seeing ghosts
Drifting out of sight, laying low
Covered in dark and dead cold night
Covered in dark and dead cold night
A cry for help, the help is near
You sing a song so you can't hear
Upon your touch a death undone
May cause a strain, agonizing death has won
The end of a life is close at hand
You're standing tall
Look the other way to see
Comfort in the pain to be
Keep out of trouble, do your worst
Do nothing at all, do nothing at all
Lack of remorse, no help to give
Lack of remorse, no help to find
Reeking betrayal, no reaching hand
Reeking betrayal, we're going blind
Lack of remorse, no help to give
Lack of remorse
Reeking betrayal, no reaching hand
Reeking betrayal, we're going blind
Lack of remorse, no help to give
Lack of remorse, no help to find2Embed
