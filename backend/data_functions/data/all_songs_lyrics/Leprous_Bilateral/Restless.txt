Restless Lyrics
Reap the day
You're left with regret
Sleep your way, you're free
Render a purpose to be at ease
Find out who you want to be

Restless
Compress the day
Suffer and pray you will be
Restless
Prepare to win
Beware the sin you will see

Be aware of your own self-destruction
Keep it out of your head
The revelation
The beacon of truth
I would have lived to be dead

Sitting down with a hollow heart
Paradoxical breath tomorrow
Dynamic living to feel joy
You must embrace the sorrow
Restless
Compress the day, suffer and pray
You will be restless
Prepare to win, beware the sin you will see

Dynamic living to feel joy
You must embrace the sorrow
