Forced Entry Lyrics
Open wide
Go to rest
Wait for my words
To explain your quest
No mistake
Not a trace
Seeing that
You won't be failing the test

Rest in peace
No remorse
Let me connect my soul to yours
Help
Help me survive
See that I will not fade away
You have become what I needed to reach this day

I've forced my way
I've forced my way

Let me
Let me stay
Don't let
Don't let go
Teach me the things
You will need me to know
Take your
Take your time
I will give
I'll give you mine
Give me the essence
That I need to grow

Rest in peace
No remorse
Let me connect my soul to yours
Help
Help me survive
See that I will not fade away
You have become what I needed to reach this day

I've forced my way
I've forced my way

Take my crime
See the sands of time
Take my crime
See the sands of time
Take my crime
Bring me home
Shut the door
Send me a glimpse of the future once more
Settle down
Go to rest
Sit back, relax
Let me enter the core
Once more
The core
Once more

I've opened the door
I've forced my way
I've forced my way
I've forced my way

Send your sign
Made of hate
Knowing how long you've made me wait
Tasteful tear
Full of fear
Nowhere to flee
Now it's all too late2Embed
