Waste of Air LyricsYou are a waste of air
Made to please your own
You are not welcome here
Should be kept alone
You will never win
Never do you dare
You've let yourself in
Time to disappear
Burning flames are cold inside you
Yet heat makes you stronger
Lying until the lie is true
Can't hold it much longer
Unbearing like the sight of you
My eye is my traitor
Search to be somebody who
Unveil your creator
Burning flames are cold inside you
Yet heat makes you stronger
Lying until the lie is true
Can't hold it much longer
Unbearing like the sight of you
My eye is my traitor
Search to be somebody who
Unveil your creator
Burning flames are cold inside you
Yet heat makes you stronger
You are a waste of air
Made to please your own
You are not welcome here
Should be kept alone
You will never win
Never do you dare
You've let yourself in
Time to disappear
Unbearing like the sight of you
My eye is my traitor
Search to be somebody who
Unveil your creatorEmbed
