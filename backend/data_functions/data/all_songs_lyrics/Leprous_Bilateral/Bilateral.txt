Bilateral Lyrics
Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war

Rarely seen as result of confidence
Gains derived from destruction
Two easy ways out will collide

Pick your fight, stand your ground
Common way, though unsound
Pick your fight, stand your ground
Common way, though unsound
Pick your fight, stand your ground
Common way, though unsound
Pick your fight, stand your ground
Common way

Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war
Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war

Hostile tradition
Hard to convert
Primitive instinct to fight
Vindictive reason
Enmity profound
Fundamental spite
How many souls is success meant to pay?
Who will be left to take part?
Where can defeat be the, be the final accord?
What will it do to your heart?

Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war
Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war
Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war
Withered words, say no more
Tend your wounds, end this war1Embed
