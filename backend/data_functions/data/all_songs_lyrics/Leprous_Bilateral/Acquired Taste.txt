Acquired Taste Lyrics
Dive deep into the
Subconscious layers
Be careful not to sink
Stay out, be free
Don't enter this abyss
That's where I go to think
Enjoy the restrictions
Be glad you can feel the sting
Silent compassion
Won't lead to anything

Out of the dark
Nowhere to start
Tainted words
Pieces apart
Acquired taste

In control of it all
What were you thinking?
As if you can put an end to this
Rest now, tomorrow
You can make it all OK
Prepare a day you will not miss
Bring forth your gift
Made from pure belief
Be sure no one finds out
Be sure no one finds out why

Stay in the cold
You will see
Someone else will leave your mark
To be sold
So you're free

You'll be drawn out of the dark
Nowhere to start
Tainted words
Pieces apartEmbed
