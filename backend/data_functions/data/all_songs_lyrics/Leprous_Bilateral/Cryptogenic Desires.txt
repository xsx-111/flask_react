Cryptogenic Desires LyricsPetty ways
In the outskirts of nowhere
State of apathy
Pretty days to come
Letting loose
Impulse of euphoria
No one knows where from
All the fires
All the feelings in vain
Cryptogenic desires
Welcomes the outstanding pain
Exit your abyss
Let go of it all
Released you are from your hives
The past is forgotten
The future is where
We spend the rest of our livesEmbed
