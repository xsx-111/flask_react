Mediocrity Wins Lyrics (2x)
The beautified unspoken words make no sense
Deciphering the shallow mind's consequence
Just see to that all empty thoughts will duplicate
Leaving behind a shitload of things to hate
Re-using sampled values made for me
I buy your manufactured ways to be
Believe the loudest voice will know what's right
The power lies within the will to fight

Take your bets
Make a choice
Sing the song with your own voice
Sober truth
A lie begins
Take your place
Mediocrity wins

Seek comfort in the promise you'll never break
Be sure the ground you stand on isn't fake
Beware interpretations of your mind
By now I realize, at rest I'm blind
 (2x)
Tiresome disputation boring me
Ascending dullness growing exponentially
Digest the essence of what should have won
Antagonistic radical conviction
Given the chance to improvise something new
Driven by lust to free my mind from me and you
Directed inspiration taking over now
Turning my focus over from why to how

And I will never
 (2x)
Take your bets
Make a choice
Sing the song with my own voice
Sober truth
A lie begins
Take your place
