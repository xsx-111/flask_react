Thorn LyricsHostile surroundings, nourish-less soil
Taking its toll on my pride
Bittersweet feeling, devouring beast
Eating its way from the inside

Poisoning whatever's on my mind (Denying me to prosper)
Closing in on all that lies behind (No use to fight this way)
I try to sleep, but nothing gets me by
(Repulsive) thorn inside me forcing me to lie
Regret the future, regret the future today
Thoughts are inutile, ready to strike
Building on hopeless betrayal
Bipolar issues sneaking my way
Knowing that I will fail
Ripping me up with its venomous fang
Prospering on my despair
Sharing its secrets of pain yet to come
And no one but me can hear
Parasite of my desire to live
Controlling when I suffocate
Leaching on beauty, nothing to give
Converting it into pure hate
Poisoning whatever's on my mind (Denying me to prosper)
Closing in on all that lies behind (No use to fight this way)
I try to sleep, but nothing gets me by
(Repulsive) thorn inside me forcing me to lie
Regret the future, regret the future today1Embed
