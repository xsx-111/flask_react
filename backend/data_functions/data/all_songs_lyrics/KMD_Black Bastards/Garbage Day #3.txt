Garbage Day #3 Lyrics
Ha, niggity   
 
 
 
We did one  
 
We gonna do a niggity ‘noth-ah one right niggity nowNothing too 
 
 
 
 
But it came out- 
 
It sounds dope though
In the background with like little 
Shit that you can’t really hear 
 
No no no
But we weren’t ready 
 
 
 
We did already
Shouldn’t even heard it 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Uh
HuhWhere the hell's my coat, where's my coat?
Ah, Goddamn it
I haven't seen you two in years (Over)
Kind of a late visit, I was getting ready for the hay
Something to wake you up
Not the three of us anymore, is it?
N-O
No
Come on chump, come on
Hey you guys should let the cops handle it, if you fight these guys you’re gonna end up in jail
You can't get away with that
Ha, who says I can't?
Me, copper
Ugh, uh
 After I kick his ass
*Gunshots*
*Scream*
Yo, what up black
What’s going on man my name’s Jamal
