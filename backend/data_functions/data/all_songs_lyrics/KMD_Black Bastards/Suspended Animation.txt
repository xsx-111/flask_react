Suspended Animation Lyrics"You know what?"
"Suspended animation of a grey expansion casting shadows over the sun" (2x)
"I want to get high, so high" (2x)
"Hit the weed spot to be blessed by Buddha"

I gets blessed and you never hear a verb flinch
A nerve pinch, 'cause I've been smokin' herb since
I've been splittin' blunts, I lick 'em then I'm spittin' once
It's nasty, shit tastes like cancer in my tongue and fronts
I'm fired up, I gots to get fried up
I've been sober since the last blunt dried up
So light up, get the Philly broke, smoke a toke pipe
Full, cause when I pull, I pull until I choke like
*cough* And that's the only shit I'm chokin'
Duckin' hookers, saying "Yo, why you be buggin'?"
I'm fuckin' stuck in (Suspended animation)
For one I'm done casting shadows over the sun for fun
I got game to keep the chickens' heads roosted
This shit be boostin' until I hear some Whitney
"I don't want to hurt anymore" Houston
So bitch, hit the blunt and lose the Triple Fat Goose then
You're high killa, even if there's lace in it
Play some jams with some motherfuckin' bass in it!
"Suspended animation of a grey expansion casting shadows over the sun"
"I'm alright now cause the sensimilla fill me" - KRS (4x)
"I want to get high, so high" (4x)
"Hit the weed spot to be blessed by Buddha"
"Casting shadows over the sun"

Ya black bastard, you!

You don't quit, keepin' it on
Subroc, my word is bond and I'm gone!3Embed
