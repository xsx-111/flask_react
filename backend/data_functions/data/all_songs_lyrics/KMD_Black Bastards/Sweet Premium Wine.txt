Sweet Premium Wine Lyrics
"Forget it, here let's have a drink"
"You're drinking too much of that wine of yours"
"I'm fine, why don't you and I have a drink?"
"But of course, there's no wine in the world like.. (sweet premium)"

Sweet Premium, Sweet Premium
Sweet Premium, Sweet Premium
Sweet Premium, Sweet Premium
Sweet Premium, Sweet Premium
Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!
Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!

Check it out!
Sweet Premium
See me, I'm chillin' like the maniacal villain that I am
Pull a scam
This is my kind of jam, buddy pal
See, first name Al, last name Key-holic
I never fill my toilet with guts
What's up? Why they shut down do-the-butts store for?
If I had a dime for every quarter last year
I'll pay some ol' dude to get beer for me from 7-11
Zev and crew - mad ho, he say
Fuck some odd D-A rap wrecked over lean break
He shoulda saved it for eight bucks in his pocket
He coulda used the loot for ice on his eye socket
Old daddy looked like his age matched his ounces (Yeah!)
I guess that's how the B-Boy bounces
As he bops, and drops the empty bottle, near the sewer
I dose like two or twenty with my crew, aw yeah
I knew a old lady, who swallowed St. Ides
I don't know why she swallowed St. Ides
Some use the EZ wides, others strip the Phillie sheets
I feel like Big Willie
Watch my brothers get illy with the sweets
Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!
Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!
Hey, you know what this is?
Sweet Premium Wine!
Hey, you know what this?
Sweet Premium wine!
Yo, yo, movin' on.. in!

You know I'm complex-cated like a Rubik's Cube puzzle
Who said I drink? I don't drink, I guzzle till I'm distorted
I'm known as the brain boggler
No Listerine! I'm the alcohol gargler
Don't drink that, that ain't OE in it
Gary Peter plays too much, it's old pee in it
I'll be livin' in the bottle
I be in it to win it, or maybe even steal it
Yo, let me top the bottom
It better be cold, let me feel it
I got stress, I sip booze to heal it
Take your time, relax your mind
I relax fine with premium wine
Your body, yeah, now that's what I'm talkin'
I be watchin' you watchin' me hawkin' that ass
I bag it and dip
I'll still be bad as hell if I slip, stagger or trip
Don't try to flip on me
First, I'll warn you
Then burst a whole wine bottle on you
Won't wanna be ya, see ya flat on concrete
You know the time, you know the grind
I caught that nigga sweet
Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!
Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet! Sweet!
Hey, you know what this is?
Sweet Premium Wine!
Hey, you know what this?
Sweet Premium wine!
Hey, you know what this?
Sweet Premium wine!
Hey, you know what this?
Sweet Premium wine!

And we don't stop
Zev is in the house
Niggas gettin' mad fucked up
And you know what to do
"Want some more wine?"
"I got some Sweet Premium... do you reckon you can get it?"
"Sweet premium, you bastard, die!"
"Uh! I'll kill you, bastard!"4Embed
