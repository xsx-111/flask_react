Plumskinzz (Loose Hoe, God & Cupid) Lyrics
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..
Uhhhhh, uhhhhh, uhh uhh uhh uhh uhh
Good moring guys

Sho' nuff as the 7-11 wins
I's in for Plumskinnz from begin (Like when?)
A rooster a-booster, vickin' all the hens (With a grin)
Thick chicks, and even sticks got friends (Least ten)
Up high, the up high I'm covered
With the innocent fuzz from the peaches says the streets
(Head to toe)
Down low, on the down low
I know the right juice from the darkest fruits got roots (A superhoe)
Mind wanderin', mind playin' tricks
I want the Nestle Quik picks my best of games to kicks
Tongue tied up, tongue tied up, confidin'
Thinkin' if I could I'll stoop to trickin' much nooks
Beware the grocer when ya press 'em with your thumbs, though (Oh?)
See, no grocer wants bruised plums, yo (so?)
Once bruised one time, 'tis forgotten
And once the plums is rotten, the skinzz'll cut your gums
At the corner store, a sign reads:
"For Sale: Plumskinzz Fruit Cocktail"
Only ones runnin' to the corner is pale males
Open all night, the corner plumskinzz is stale
Back to the honeyplum that's swift with gift
And if the plum is pit, I guess I'll just plead fifth
I'll say, "Sweet young, can your tongue have some?
You got some peach(fuzz)"
("Yeah, you know me!") Well, I'm down with O.P.Plumskinzz
Don't drool with all the juice you dribble
Scribble the beeper code, so the X can gets a nibble
Trust, just in case ya asked why
Behind my button-fly is a fruit fly huntin' for those plumskinzz
I said a hip, hop
You're so god damn stupidEmbed
