It Sounded Like A Roc Lyrics
There it is, there it is, boy
Oh, yeah
There it is, there it is, buddy
Aaah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, they seem to know the time but, um, let's see...

It's my thing, yo, it's my thing, the way I swing
Not even an orangutan  can hang on my DING-DING
Saved by the bell rang
I talk, yell, whisper, mumble street slang
With no doubt, you tumble if I flip
Don't make me shout with my vulgar lip
A hip-hugger, I'll mug ya, if fun to know
Slow and steady wins a race, I keeps a steady pace
In a chase, I'm bookin', cookin' feet don't fail me
5-0's can't see me, catch me to jail me
Walk the plank, ya damn dime droppers
Snitches get stitches, why, oh, why does my trigger finger itches?
Corrupt! I follow my nose, it always knows it
Open the draw bridge, close it, close it!
A doo doo lyric, I snuck in 'cause I chose it
Long ding-a-ling dong there, big booties grows it
Up (Up!) up and awaaaay, we go across the border
To Mexico, suck my toe
Doo doo brown's my color
No watered down, no cut
A jewel to a fool is like pearls to big butt
Swine, I strut on the sidewalk and don't touch the line
Escalate, never decline
I'm gonna get mine, don't try to take mine
No, my kneecaps ain't blacker than my black behind
The bush, I touch tush
So beware of the grin of my evil eyeball glare
I's a wiseguy, yeah, a smart alec
Like it or kiss me where the sun don't shine like metallic
KA-BLAOW!
"It sounded like a rock" (x3)
(They thought I didn't know)
"It sounded like a rock"

One double 9 tre, dumbells I lift it
Just for the taste of it, coke I won't sniff it
Ya party pooper, you never stop my frontings
Like Jesse Owens, Iâ€™ll dust ya, I run things
Popcorn mama you can sniff my sock
I's a hard headed nigga, my head is (like a rock)
So, so, leave me, B-boy, I'll be boppin'
When I chug-a-lug alone it ain't no stoppin' hoppin'
Skin to skin, now I must stall
Jimmy hats ain't even made like rubbermaid, at all
If I be over stressed over tryin' under arms
Cookin' like onions, you'll be cryin'
Boo-hoo-hoo but I gets the hoorays
From sunrise to sunset for days
All in the Kool-Aid, don't know the flavor
Taste buds shot, waistlines duds
I left the slammer on bad-ass behavior
Call me Sub, I roll underground like C.H.U.D.s
Cease with the wack, I'm never ever booty over that
I got my cootie shots for the cootie for the body
The hottie, I might use Karate
Snap back 15 minutes I'll be off duty
KA-BLAMM
"It sounded like a rock" (4x)

It's a break, Zev love X and Subroc for ninety tre
Crew massive deep
Constipated monkeys deficatin' that old hard shit
And ya don't quit

It sounded like a what?
It sounded like a boulder
It sounded like a Land, yo, slide up over
I need my room, to huff and puff
These bastards be soft like marshmallow fluff
Step up, wrong move you catch a back smack
Or a blackout, so be out, black!
Let's play catch, a bad one ya caught it
I'll take your thumping heart and smote it
Then I grab my wood (my dick) grab my rope
Over there ya got that same ole shit, here ya don't
Oh, no, you don't, gimme that, back
Now you sing the blues while your eye's black
Don't need to flaunt, no need to front
I see right through, you very blunt
Attitude nonchalant, I do what I want
If I be ghost, expect me back to haunt
KA -BLAWW
"It sounded like a rock" (4x)

Constipated monkeys doo-doo! Droppin' shit like that...3Embed
