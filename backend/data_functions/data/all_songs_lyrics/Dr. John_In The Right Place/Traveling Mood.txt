Traveling Mood Lyrics

Feeling' kinda sad and lonely
Lost my sweet one at home
Gonna find my baby
I don't mean maybe
Gon' find her
I said I'm gon' find my baby
Gon' bring her home with me

Said that she'd never leave me
Now she's gone away to grieve me
I was fast asleep, when she begun her midnight creep
Gon' find her
I'm gonna find my baby
I'm gonna bring her home with me

Goin' down to Texas
Goin' to Georgia
Oklahoma, Mississippi, Florida
Goin' to Alabama, goin' to Louisiana
Gonna see
I'm gonna find my baby
I'm gonna bring her home with me

Let's all set out travelin'
Gonna cover many miles of travelin'
Gonna find my baby
I don't mean no maybe
Gonna find her
Gonna find my baby
I'm gonna bring her home with meEmbed
