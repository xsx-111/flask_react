Life Lyrics
Mother
Just look what they done
Done to yo' boy
Mother, mother
Just look what they done
Done to yo' boy

Mother, mother
I have felt the mark
Of ten thousand teeth
I done seen my body
Lyin' stiffly at my feet
As I've seen my soul
Creepin' out of my chest
Bow my head towards the east
Got victims by the west

Mother, mother
Just look what they done
Done to yo' son
But it ain't so bad
I'm a drinkin' while
They just havin' fun
Father, father
Just look what they done
Done to yo' son

I see visions of dumplings
Dancin' in my head
But I'm not gonna worry
Might wake up in the mornin' dead
But if I die
Stoned before I wake
Lord, grant me one last wish
Please unveil my fate
(I didn't know what I was told
About the work of the Devil and now I know)
Father, father
Just look what they done
Done to yo' son
(I didn't know what I was told
About the work of the Devil and now I know)
But it ain't so bad
I'm a drinkin' while they just havin' fun
(I didn't know what I was told
About the work of the Devil and now I know)
Father, father
Just look what they done
Done to yo' son
(I didn't know what I was told
About the work of the Devil and now I know)Embed
