Same Old Same Old Lyrics

She asked me what's happenin'
Hmmm, they said rain
Then you asked me what's goin' on
And I miss the time

Time is moving on
Pretty soon I'll be gone
I can't find the bread
Am I gonna have enough to eat
Got no strength to go on back to work tomorrow
Gotta make enough bread to buy the bread
To have enough strength to go on back to work another day
Yeah, anyway
Same old, same old, me
Same old stuff
Same old working on
Never enough
Full blooded, get down
Same old, same old, me
Same old stuff
Same old working on
Never enough
Full blooded, get down
She ask me what's happenin'
Hmm, they say rain
Then you asked me what's goin' on
And I miss the time
Same old, same old, me
Same old stuff
Same old workin' on
Never enough '
Full blooded, get downEmbed
