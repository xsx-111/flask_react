Just The Same Lyrics

Right or wrong
My love is strong
Win or lose
Baby, what's the use?
I love you, I love you (baby)
Just the same
I love you (yes I will)
Just the same

Laugh or cry
I give it a try
Asleep or wake
It's just a give or take
Ya know I love you, I love you
Just the same (baby)
I love you
Just the same

I always knew
The time might come
Baby, when you'd rule me
Ya turn around and screw me
But just as sure
As the ever-sittin' sun
Baby if ya run from love
And when ya runnin's done

Right or wrong
My love is strong
And win or lose
Baby what's the use?
I love you, I love you
Just the same
Baby, I'll love you
Just the same
