Peace Brother Peace Lyrics
Peace brother peace
The doctor's comin'
O peace brother peace
Yes, the doctor's comin'
Everybody (oh no no yeah)
Bringin' peace all over this world
Peace brother peace
The doctor's comin'
O peace brother peace
Yes, the doctor's comin'
Everybody
(oh no no yeah)
Bringin' peace all over this world

Everywhere I see this world in sick condition
And what the world needs now
Is the feel of revision
Let's put a stop to all your war hate and greed
'cause bein' in love, is somethin' everybody needs
Yes it is

Peace brother peace
The doctor's comin'
O peace brother peace
(the doctor's comin')
Everybody
(oh no no yeah)
I ain't no fortune teller, tryin' to be a nice fella
I ain't no astrologer, tryin' to be a philosopher
I ain't no politician, just worryin' about the world's condition
Just got lo reach the soul, and here' my prescription

Peace brother peace
(The doctor's comin')
O peace brother peace
Yes, the doctor's comin'
Everybody, oh no no yeah
Bringin' peace all over this worldEmbed
