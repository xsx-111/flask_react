Cold Cold Cold Lyrics
Ya told me ya loved me
Ya know you told me a lie
I thought I was your somethin' special
I thought I was your only guy
You said that I was way more
Better than the finest of gold
I guess that I was on the biggest thrill
Of the biggest lie that you ever told

It's too cold, cold, cold
The way you wreck my soul
And it's too cold, cold, cold
The way you wreck my soul

The taste of yo lips
You do me up, alright
To let me love you, baby
Like you used to do each and every night
When you first arrived
Down on my country set
All the fellows in the neighborhood
They started diggin' you, they ain't stopped
Yet
It's too cold, cold, cold
The way you wreck my soul
And it's too cold, cold, cold
The way you wreck my soul

Baby and I just can't dig it
You been rippin' and runnin' with Tom, Dick
And Slim
And it hurts me to my heart
(Knowing that they ain't givin' you no money
Child
For what you givin' them)
And it's too cold, cold, cold
The way you wreck my soulEmbed
