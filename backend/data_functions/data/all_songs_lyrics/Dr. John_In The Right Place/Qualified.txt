Qualified LyricsLookey here
Better hurry up and check it out
Lookey here, lookey here
Your steak ain't no hipper than my porkchop
Your Cadillac ain't no hipper than my bus stop
Your champagne ain't no hipper than my soda pop
Lookey here, I'm ready to take care of business
Have no fear, I'm already here
I'll Tell you now (I'm qualified)
You know that I'm qualified
(You know that I'm qualified)
Your top hat ain't no better than my ginger brown
And your sharkskin ain't no badder than my Levis jean
The money you got, it ain't no better than a higher spending man's
All I've got is a little bit of common sense
I believe in my heart, the best teacher is experience
I'll tell you now (I'm qualified)
You know that I'm qualified
(You know that I'm qualiied)
You may find me in a project slum
Be hanging out with all the skid row bums
I may be sick and I may seem dumb
That don't mean you know where I'm coming from
Look out kid
Just make a little room
Your social life ain't no better than my hot dog stand
Your edu-ma-cation ain't no hipper than what you understand
Your woman next door, she ain't no hipper than a hot loving band
I got the power to control
I can see clean through your blindfold
And I want to tell you now (I'm qualified)
You know that I'm qualified
(You know that I'm qualiied)
(Fadeout)
Look at me, I'm filling up in class
And you better watch out, I'm stepping up fast
Can't hang a jacket on me, I've been hanging out in the projects
Hangin' out with all you rednecks
You rubbernecks and rejects...Embed
