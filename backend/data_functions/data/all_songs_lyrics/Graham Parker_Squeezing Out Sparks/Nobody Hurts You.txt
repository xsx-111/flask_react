Nobody Hurts You Lyrics
I try to pull my weight, study my geography
It doesn't seem to get me anywhere
I hold a picture up, everybody thinks it's me
I get a thrill out of tampering with the atmosphere
Hey baby, I'm out of favour
Can't always be the right flavour
It just seems that no matter what you do
Someone, somewhere's suddenly gotta punish you

Nobody hurts you
Nobody hurts you
Nobody hurts you
Nobody hurts you
Harder than yourself
Harder than yourself
Harder than yourself
Harder than yourself

I once had this dream, woke up with the daily news
And it looked like forever
I had a coffee fix, every item there to choose?
All my love came by letter
Suffocating in suburbia
The new estates build claustrophobia
Grandfather's money only in the finest stuff
That's enough, that's enough, that's enough

You make me tag along, run into the rent-a-crowd
But they're just imitation
I try to write the song, you and me are laughing loud
But it comes out frustration
Noone's going to illuminate you
All the odds are stacked against you
You're just cavin' in, right there in front of me
It's a picture I don't ever want to see
