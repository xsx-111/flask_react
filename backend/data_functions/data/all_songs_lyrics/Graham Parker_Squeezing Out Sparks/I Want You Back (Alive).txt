I Want You Back (Alive) LyricsOhh-oh-oh-oh, let me tell you now, uh-huh, uh-uh-uh
When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always make me stand up in a crowd
Someone picked you from the bunch, and that was all it took
And now it's much too late for me to take a second look
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
Oh I do now
Oh oh baby
Oh I do now
Oh oh baby
Tried to live without your love, one of those sleepless nights
But that just shows you, girl, that I know wrong from right
And every street you walk down, I leave tearstains on the ground
Following you girl, I can feel you all around, let me tell you now
Oh baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darling, I was blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
Uhh-huh
Mmmm-mm
Ohh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You're all I want
You're all I want
You're all I need
Oh yeah, one more time
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh baby, I was blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
Forget what happened then and let me live again
Ah yeah, one more chance, baby, baby, baby
Forget about the cost and give back what I lost
Oh yeah, one more chance
Won't you please let me back in your heart
Oh darling, I must have been blind to let you go
Now that I see you in his arms
Let me tell you, baby
Now that I see you in his arms
Oh I do now
Oh-oh baby
I want you backEmbed
