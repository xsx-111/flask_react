Protection Lyrics"So all of you be damned we can't have heaven crammed."
So Winston Churchill said; I could have smacked his head
And all of those infected waiting to be collected
I must get out at any price before the feeling gets too nice
CHORUS
Just can't get, just can't get no protection
Just can't get, just can't get no protection
Just can't get, just can't get no Can't get no protection
Protection, protection
Every bomb is detonated every switch is thrown
And everybody tells me don't be scared act as if you never cared
So I wear a blank expression to conceal my real impression
Turn off all the information radios just pick up that station
REPEAT CHORUS
So turn off this sound I'm ready to go down
I don't know myself, I don't you either
You're full of disease it's something I discovered
I know you've been mixing with Big Brother's brother
It ain't the knife in the heart that tears you apart
It's just the thought of someone
It's just the thought of someone
It's just the thought of someone sticking it in, sticking it in
So if you think that's funny I'm not really laughng honey
Your love letters are confetti I ripped them up my hands were sweaty
And then those ghastly faces recur in nightmare places
Happy hours come and go much too short and much too long
CHORUS
Turn off all the information radios just pick up that station
Protection protection protection
It ain't the knife in the heart that tears you apart
It's just the thought of someone sticking it in
Protection protection Switch it off switch it off switch it off
Protection Switch it off switch it off switch it off
Protection protection You want to hide? You want to hide?
You want to hide, hide, hide? Protection REPEAT AND FADEEmbed
