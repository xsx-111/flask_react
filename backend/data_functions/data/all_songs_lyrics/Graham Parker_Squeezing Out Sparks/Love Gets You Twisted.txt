Love Gets You Twisted LyricsLove gets you twisted, love gets you twisted all the way
The hearts are enlisted, the hearts are enlisted to break each day
I try to straighten out but I'm too wrapped up to see
I don't know how it's supposed to be
Love gets you twisted, love gets you twisted inside out
I knew that it existed, I knew that it existed I had no doubt
When she's in my arms I get tangled up it's true
I can't see the other point of view
When love gets you twisted, love gets you twisted
Love gets you twisted
Screw yourself up, screw yourself up
Screw yourself, screw yourself up
I try to straighten out but I'm tangled up it's true
I can't see the other point of view
Love gets you twisted
Love gets you twisted
Love gets you twisted
Screw yourself up
Screw yourself up
Screw yourself, screw yourself
When love gets you twisted
When love gets you twisted
When love gets you twisted
REPEAT AND FADEEmbed
