Saturday Nite Is Dead LyricsEverybody just looks ugly now information don't compute
I draw a blank every time I think
The football crowd is going to give me a boot
CHORUS
And Saturday night is dead Saturday night is dead
It don't matter what they say
You've got to use your own head some day
Saturday night is dead Saturday night is dead
Yeah it's dead
The ultraviolet light hurts me so
It used to be my friend
I used to know a good place to go
But now it's nothing like it was then
CHORUS (WORD VARIATION)
And Saturday night is dead
Saturday night is dead
It don't matter what they say
I'm going to the funeral Sunday
Saturday night is dead
Saturday night is dead
Yeah it's dead
It must have been murder it ain't no accident
Oh no it means nothing to me
The clock goes tick tick tick in my head
Saturday is dead
Saturday is dead
I look inside to find a place to hide
But there ain't no place I know
It's just as well that I'm stupefied
It makes it easy
It makes it easy to deliver the fatal blow
Deliver deliver deliver
CHORUS (FIRST VERSION)
Saturday night is dead REPEAT AND ENDEmbed
