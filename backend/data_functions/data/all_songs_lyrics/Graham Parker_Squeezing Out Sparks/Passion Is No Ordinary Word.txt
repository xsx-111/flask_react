Passion Is No Ordinary Word LyricsIt worked much better in a fantasy
Imagination's one thing that comes easy to me
Cause this is nothing else if not unreal
When I pretend to touch you, you pretend to feel

Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Ain't manufactured or just another sound
That you hear at night 
Ain't got no idols for the screen today
Although they make a lot of noises they got nothing to say
I try to look amazed but it's an act
The movie might be new but it's the same soundtrack

Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Ain't manufactured or just another sound
That you hear at night 
Say how it feels real useless ain't it
Wait until it bites right down inside you
The world is easy when you're just playing around with it
Everything's a thrill and every girl's a kill
And then it gets unreal and then you don't feel anything
You don't feel anything
You don't feel anything
An object of desire you don't desire to be
I bet the shop window dummies give in just as easily
I try to stop but have to make you drop down to the floor
Moaning in the darkness as we fake some more
Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Ain't manufactured or just another sound
That you hear
Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Passion is no ordinary word
Ain't manufactured or just another sound
That you hear at night 
Just another sound that you hear at night
Ain't just another sound (REPEAT AND FADE)Embed
