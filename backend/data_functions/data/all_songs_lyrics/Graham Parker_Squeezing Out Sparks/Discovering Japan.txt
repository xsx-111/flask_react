Discovering Japan LyricsHer heart is nearly breaking, the earth is nearly quaking
The Tokyo taxi's braking, it's screaming to a halt
And there's nothing to hold on to when gravity betrays you
And every kiss enslaves you
She knows how hard her heart grows under the nuclear shadows
She can't escape the feeling repeating in her head
When after all the urges some kind of truth emerges
We felt the deadly surges
Discovering Japan
Discovering Japan
The GIs only use her, they only ram right through her
Giving an eastern promise, that they could never keep
Seeing a million miles, between their joke and smiles
She heard their hard denials
As the tears dropped sideways down her face, face
I woke up talking in the tongue of a different race, race
And as the flight touches down my watch says 8:02
But that's midnight to you
Midnight to you
Midnight to you
I dreamed headlong collisions in jet lag panavisions
I shouted sayonara it didn't mean goodbye
But lovers turn to posers show up in film exposures
Just like in travel brochures
Discovering Japan
