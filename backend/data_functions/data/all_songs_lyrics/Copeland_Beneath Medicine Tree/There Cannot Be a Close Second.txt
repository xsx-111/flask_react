There Cannot Be a Close Second LyricsYou've got an extra special heart
A perfect light that shines through
And it seems the hardest part
Is shining back at you
Shining back at you
So forgive me
'Cause I don't know what to do
When you look at me
There can be no hesitation
There cannot be a close second to you
I don't know what to do
When you look at me
(When you look at me)
When you look at me
I've got a perfectly normal heart
Bruised and broken from within
At times, I don't know how to start
To let you in here
To let you in here
(To let you in here)
So forgive me
'Cause I don't know what to do
When you look at me
There can be no hesitation
There cannot be a close second to you
I don't know what to do
When you look at me
There can be no hesitation
There cannot be a close second to you
Sometimes, I don't know how to start
To let you in here
(To let you in here)
To let you in here
So forgive me
'Cause I don't know what to do
When you look at me
There can be no hesitation
There cannot be a close second to you
I don't know what to do
When you look at me
There can be no hesitation
There cannot be a close second to youEmbed
