She Changes Your Mind LyricsShe changes your mind
When you see the joy in her eyes
It makes you feel
It makes you feel
She draws your eyes
From all the things that made you numb
And makes you feel
And makes you feel
If I could open up my heart and let her out
I would never have to sing her name aloud
It was your hello that kept me hanging on every word
And your goodbye that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner
It keeps me listening for your voice around each corner
And I'll sing songs to help me stay up all night long
'Cause I don't want to go to sleep
And I'll sing songs and hope you're listening carefully
And know exactly what I mean
You know exactly what I mean
(When I say)
If I could open up my heart and let her out
I would never have to sing her name aloud
It was your hello that kept me hanging on every word
And your goodbye that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner
It keeps me listening for your voice around each corner
It's the song you must seek out
When your night has just begun
In the distance, you can find
The lips from which was sung a melody
It was your hello that kept me hanging on every word
And your goodbye that keeps me listening for your voice around each corner
I was hanging on every word
And your goodbye
It keeps me listening for your voice around each corner
It keeps me listening for your voice around each cornerEmbed
