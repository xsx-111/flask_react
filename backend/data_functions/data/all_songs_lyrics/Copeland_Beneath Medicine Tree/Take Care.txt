Take Care LyricsI'll take care of you, oh
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
It was a straight-faced lie I believed
It was a straight-faced lie, you would ever leave me
So for now, I'll keep believing your words
And soon enough, my strength will return
I'll take care of you, oh
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing, oh
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
Let me draw the blinds for you
You can watch the sunset from the bed in your hospital room
Until you're sleeping
And I'm sure I don't understand how I found a love so pure
I'll take care of you, oh
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing, oh
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
Don't lift a finger
Let me show you
The only way to let this go
Don't lift a finger
Let me hold you
Hold you here until the pain, it has all gone
I'll take care of you, oh
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing, oh
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll take care of you, oh
Have faith that when you call my name
I'll be there
I'll be right there
So keep breathing, oh
Keep that sweet heart of yours beating
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right there
I'll be right thereEmbed
