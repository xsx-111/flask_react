When Finally Set Free LyricsFeel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
Reminding us how far we've come
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
We have time to start all over again
Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
Reminding us how far we've come
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
We have time to start all over again
Feel the pain teaching us how much more we can take
Reminding us how far we've come
Let the pain burn away from our hearts
We have time to start all over again
But if you would shine your love down here
And make our hearts as perfect as new
Oh, if you would shine your love down here
I promise I'll reflect it right back at you
Oh, I promise I'll reflect it right back at you
Oh, I promise we'll reflect it right back at youEmbed
