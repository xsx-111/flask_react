California LyricsI miss the way you sing low
So I can't hear your voice over the radio in my car
But you know every word they say
You knew just the right things to say
When the distance ripped us farther and farther and farther away
I'll see you soon
If you're coming back this way again
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Maybe I fell too fast
Maybe I pushed you away
Now you're gone and I'm afraid
That you're never coming back this way again
I'll see you soon
If you're coming back here
I'll see you soon
Just say that you want to see me too
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention
Come back from California
All of us here in Florida are starved for your attention
We're starved for your attention
You know, I won't mind if you monopolize all of my time
I won't say a thing at all
I won't say a word, no
So come back from California
Come back from CaliforniaEmbed
