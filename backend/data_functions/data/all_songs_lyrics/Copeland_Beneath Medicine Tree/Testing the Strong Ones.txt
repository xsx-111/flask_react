Testing the Strong Ones LyricsThere's an angel by your hospital bed
Desperate to hear his name on your breath
As he looks down, you're not making a sound
Open your eyes and look at me
I'll bring to you whatever you need
I'll tell you I'm sorry
That I can't take this pain away from you
I'd put it on my own body
If I knew how to
Can't you see?
I've gotta bust you out of here somehow
I've never seen your heart this tired
Never seen your spirit held down
I know that you say
"This is what you get for being a bad child."
But I know this will be your reward
In just a little while
In just a little while
It's testing the strong ones
It's scarring the beautiful ones
It's holding the loved ones, one last timeEmbed
