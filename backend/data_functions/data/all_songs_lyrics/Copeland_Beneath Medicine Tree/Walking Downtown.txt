Walking Downtown LyricsWe were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
Through the night, we were waiting for a sign
Maybe rendered in the darkened sky
Drawn by imaginary lines
Connecting radiant points of light
(Please don't go)
'Cause you showed up with your hair down
I might not sleep tonight
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
Lift your gaze from the pavement
From the streets that we've crossed a thousand times before
Dry your eyes
There are birds singing on lamp posts
They don't know what all your crying's for
(Please don't go)
And I'm sure that I've not seen
The Christmas lights this bright before
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)
We were walking downtown
Yeah, my favorite part of town (walking downtown)1Embed
