Brightest LyricsIf you find yourself here
On my side of town
I pray that you'd come to my door
And talk to me like you don't know
What we ever fought about
'Cause I don't remember anymore
I just know that she warms my heart
And knows what all my imperfections are
And she said that I was the brightest little firefly in her jar
And I just know that she warms my heart
And knows what all my imperfections are
And she said that I was the brightest little firefly in her jarEmbed
