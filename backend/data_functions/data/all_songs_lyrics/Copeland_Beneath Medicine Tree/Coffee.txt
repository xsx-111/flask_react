Coffee LyricsThere's plenty of time left tonight
I promised I'd have you home before daylight
We do the best we can in a small town
Act like big city kids when the sun goes down
If it's not too late for coffee
I'll be at your place in ten
We'll hit that all-night diner
And then we'll see
There's so many things I have to say
I'll stay up all night to hear about your day
We do the best we can in a small town
Act like kids in love when the sun goes down
If it's not too late for coffee
I'll be at your place in ten
We'll hit that all-night diner
And then we'll see
There's a love that transcends all that we've known of ourselves
And I'll wait for it to come
I'll wait for it to come
Well, it's got to be strong to touch my heart through its shell
And I'll wait for it to come
I'll wait for it to come
If it's not too late for coffee
I'll be at your place in ten
We'll hit that all-night diner
And then we'll see
There's a love that transcends all that we've known of ourselves
And I'll wait for it to come
I'll wait for it to come
Well, it's got to be strong to touch my heart through its shell
And I'll wait for it to come
I'll wait for it to come downEmbed
