Tragedy LyricsCould be tomorrow, could be today
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
A chill in the wind and it's blowing our way
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
Sooner or later there'll come a time
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
That cold wind will blow and you know that's a crime
Tragedy is on the rise
Tragedy before your eyes
Tragedy for everything
Tragedy, if we don't give a damn
God knows your secret, He knows our fate
(Knows this has been a tragedy)
He knows the reason, it' not too late
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
Don't let the snake hunt, he might break you down
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
You lost a fortune before and you found
Tragedy is on the rise
Tragedy before your eyes
Tragedy for every man
Tragedy, if people don't give a damn
Could be tomorrow, could be today
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
A chill in the wind and it's blowing our way
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
Sooner or later there'll come a time
(It's gonna be a tragedy)
That cold wind will blow and you know that's a crime
Tragedy is on the rise
Tragedy before your eyes
Tragedy for everything
Tragedy, if we don't give a damn
Aah, he knows the reasonEmbed
