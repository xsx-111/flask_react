Rejoice LyricsYou're cool you, although we spend the days in conversation
I wouldn't fool you, stolen in your hour of celebration
Ooh ooh - shout out to the world to rejoice
Can you find a reason to?
Remember fortune would laugh at the sound of our voices
And the faded freedoms too
Do I confuse you, although my life will end in resurrection
I won't refuse you, should you heed before you need direction
Ooh ooh - shout out to the world to rejoice
For the word is overdue
3 times I call you, I waited to hear you rejoice
For the vale I see is through
And so rejoice, rejoice.......Embed
