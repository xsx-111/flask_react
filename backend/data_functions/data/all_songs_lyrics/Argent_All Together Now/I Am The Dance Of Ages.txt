I Am The Dance Of Ages LyricsI am the dance of ages
The drummer and the wine
Heartbeat in the sand
Rings inside your hand
I am the body power
The rhythm of your joy
The spiral in the air
The wine inside a prayer
Ride on the rising tide
Walk on the water
Spray with each burning day
High, going higher
I am the shout of thunder
A cannon in the wind
Tearing up the skies
Blinding out the lies
I am the beat of anger
The temple of your hate
Horseman in the night
Hell-hound in the night
Ride on the rising tide
Walk on the water
Spray with each burning day
High, going higher
I am the dance of ages
The drummer and the wine
Heartbeat in the sand
Rings inside your hand
I am the body power
The rhythm of your joy
The spiral in the air
The wine inside a prayer
Ride on the rising tide
Walk on the water
Spray with each burning day
High, going higherEmbed
