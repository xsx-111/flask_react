Closer To Heaven LyricsThere's no time to be lonely
No time to be sad
Remember when you're angry Lord
It's better to be mad
Now there is only one bluebird
That is gonna fly away
Heaven
Closer to heaven
Closer to heaven
Every minute, every hour of every day
Heaven
Closer to heaven
Closer to heaven
Every minute closer to your dying day
Now you might now be a rich man
Don't let your feelings show
We call you with nothing Lord
That's the way we go
Now there is only one bluebird
That's gonna fly away
Fly, fly the world with the lord
Won't be there ...
Won't be there ...
Heaven
Closer to heaven
Closer to heaven
Every minute, every hour of every day
Heaven
Closer to heaven
Closer to heaven
Every minute, every hour of every day
Heaven
Closer to heaven
Closer to heaven
Every minute closer to your dying dayEmbed
