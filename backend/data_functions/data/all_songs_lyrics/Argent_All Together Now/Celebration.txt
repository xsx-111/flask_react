Celebration LyricsCelebration
An invitation
To come and join in
A ring of hands together
Down the mountains
Around the fountains
All come singing
A ring of hands forever
Tonight I feel excitement
Coming in the air
Like a dog tryin' to
Bark on the wind
Bright light burnin' torches
Dacning everywhere
Take my eyes
Pull my heart
As they sing
Celebration
An invitation
To come and join in
A ring of hands together
Ring of hands
Ring of hands
Ring of hands together forever
And if I dance beside you
Steppin' at your feet
Take adventage of joy in my eyes
We can reach the rooftops
Spinning like a wheel
In this afternight we can ride
Celebration
An invitation
To come and join in
A ring of hands together
Ring of hands
Ring of hands
Ring of hands togetherEmbed
