You Want Her Too Lyrics
She makes me go so wrong
(Yeah you kept me awake you know you did)
I've loved her oh so long
(So why don't you come right out and say it, stupid?)

She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too

My intentions are quite sincere
(That's not what you said the other night)
And all you can do is sneer
(So go ahead and kid yourself, you're right)

She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too

I've got a better chance than you do
I know that you want her too
You're such a hopeless romantic
She told me you're so predictable and nice
She only did you a favor once or twice (once or)
Once or twice
She makes me go so wrong
(So why don't you lie back and enjoy it?)
My conscience is clear and strong
(Yes, she says I'm just the boy for it)

She makes me do things I don't want to do
I don't know why I should be telling you
I know that you want her too
I know that you want her too
I know that you want her tooEmbed
