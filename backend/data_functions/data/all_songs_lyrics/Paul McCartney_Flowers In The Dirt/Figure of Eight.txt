Figure of Eight Lyrics
Well, you've got me dancing in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late
Round and round the ring I go
I want to know
I want to know, hey

Why can't we travel a continuous line?
Make love a reliable covenant all the time
Up and down the hills I go
I got to know
I got to know

Is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yeah, we'd better take good care of each other
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight

Well, figure it out for yourself, little girl
It don't go nowhere at all
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall
You've got me running in a figure of eight
Don't know if I'm coming or going, early or late
Round and round I go
I want to know
I want to know

Say is it better to love one another
Than to go for a walk in the dark?
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?
Yes, we'd better take good care of one other
And avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eightEmbed
