Distractions Lyrics
What is this thing in life that persuades me to spend
Time away from you?
If you can answer this, you can have the moon
This is the place to be, any way you can see
There's a lovely view
Why are there always so many other things to do?

Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractions

The postman's at the door
While the telephone rings on the kitchen wall
Pretend we're not at home and they'll disappear
I want to be with you, tell me what I can do
Nothing is too small
Away from all this jazz we could do anything at all

Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions

I'll find the peaceful place
Far away from the noise of a busy day
Where we can spend our nights
Counting shooting stars

Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone I think of you
And the things we'd do if we could only be through
With these distractions

Like butterflies are buzzing around my head
When I'm alone, I think of you
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free
From these distractionsEmbed
