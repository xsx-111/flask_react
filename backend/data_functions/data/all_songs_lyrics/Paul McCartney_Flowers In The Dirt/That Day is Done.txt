That Day is Done Lyrics
I feel such sorrow
I feel such shame
I know I won't arrive on time
Before whatever out there is gone
What can I do, that day is done

It's just a promise, that I made
I said I'd walk in her parade
Hot scalding tears I thought would flow
Still in my heart they'll never show

That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done

Well I recall the time and place
When they announced her precious face
I thought at once my heart would burst
Still, every time is like the first

There was applause when she stepped up
I wished that I could interrupt
I made no sign, I made no sound
I know I must stay underground
That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is done

That's why she walks, or so they say
She always knew just what I needed
Now if she would just look my way
One time before they proceed

She sprinkles flowers in the dirt
That's when a thrill becomes a hurt
I know I'll never see her face
She walks away from my resting place

That day is done, that day is done
You know where I've gone
I won't be coming back
That day is doneEmbed
