We Got Married Lyrics
Going fast, coming soon
We made love in the afternoon
Found a flat, after that
We got married

Working hard for the dream
Scoring goals for the other team
Times were bad, we were glad
We got married

Like the way you open up your hearts to each other
When you find a meeting of the minds
Just as well love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had

Further on in the game
Waiting up till the children came
Place your bets, no regrets
We got married
We got married
We got married
Nowadays every night flashes by
At the speed of light
Living life, loving wife
We got married

Ohh, I love the things that happen when we start to discover
Who we are and what we're living for
Oh just because love was all we ever wanted
It was all we ever had


It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at it
It's not just a loving machine
It doesn't work out if you don't work at itEmbed
