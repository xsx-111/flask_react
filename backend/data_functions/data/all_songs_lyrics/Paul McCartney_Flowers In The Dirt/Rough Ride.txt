Rough Ride Lyrics
I needed loving, I needed a friend
I needed something that would be there in the end

Of the rough ride to Heaven
Want to get inside, what will I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you

I knew you'd help me, I knew you could
You knew I didn't want to be misunderstood

On the rough ride to Heaven
Want to be inside, what'll I do?
Oh, on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to be inside to be with you

I'm not asking for an easy passage
So I hope you understand
I'm not after any special treatment
But I wouldn't mind a hand
On a rough ride, on a rough ride
On a rough ride
On a rough ride
Rough ride to Heaven
If I want to get inside, what will I do?
Whoa oh
What will I do? What will I do?
Rough ride
A rough ride
A rough ride
A rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside, what will I do?
Hey on a rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside to be with you
A rough ride to Heaven
I want to get inside
Want to be with you
Rough ride to Heaven
Ooh I want to be inside with you
On a rough rideEmbed
