The Ghost of a Smile LyricsYou gotta walk that mile honey child
You gotta walk that mile honey child
Well I'll show you what is hip
As we walk down Leeson strip
And I'll do it for the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
You can't take it with you when you go
You can't take it with you when you go
You gotta walk, walk that mile
And I'll be with you honey child
And I'll do it for the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
Don't wait too long
Don't wait too long
Don't wait too long
Or I'll be gone
Don't wait too long
Don't wait too long
Don't wait too long
Or I'll be gone
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smile
Just the ghost, the ghost of a smileEmbed
