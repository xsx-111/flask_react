Sayonara LyricsOkay, it's time for Sayonara
So long, Yankee, break my heart
There's nothing left for us to say now
Even the best friends gotta part
I walked into the nearest bar
I sat and looked toward the sea
I wandered drunken down a beach
The waves just whispered misery
She had a red red scarf around her neck
Her eyes were green, her hair was black
She had a red red scarf around her neck
Her eyes were green, her hair was black
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Ooh she gave me Hong Kong Flu
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu
(Som-yat-zu, som-yat-zu)
(Som-yat-zu, som-yat-zu)
I got new papers in a bordello
With some luckies in my I.D
My heart was pounding like a hammer
Thai Thai Thai Thai Thai! I am free
She kissed me softly on the lips
She took my hand without a sound
This was our happy ever after
So, motherfucker, kiss the ground
She had a red red scarf around her neck
Her eyes were green, her hair was black
She had a red red scarf around her neck
Her eyes were green, her hair was black
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Ooh she gave me Hong Kong Flu
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Ooh she gave me Hong Kong Flu
Ooh she gave me Mekong Whiskey
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu
Put me on a breeze to Katmandu
Put me on a breeze to KatmanduEmbed
