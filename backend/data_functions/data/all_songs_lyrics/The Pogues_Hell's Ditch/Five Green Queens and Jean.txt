Five Green Queens and Jean LyricsI recall the moment
Before it slipped away
When five green queens on a black bin bag
Meant all the world to me
And I recall the moment
More distant than it seems
When five green queens on a black bin bag
Meant all the world to me
And I recall the moment
Much closer than it seems
When five green queens on a black bin bag
Meant all the world to me
And I recall the moment
Before it slipped away
When five green queens on a black bin bag
Meant all the world to me
