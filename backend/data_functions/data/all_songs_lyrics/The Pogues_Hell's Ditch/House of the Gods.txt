House of the Gods LyricsFinally found a place they could never reach
Sipping singha beer on Pattaya Beach
Singha beer don't ask no questions
Singha beer don't tell no lies
Singha beer don't ask no questions
Singha beer don't tell no lies
There's a guy next to me won't tell me his name
Buys me Mekong whiskey just the same
Singha beer don't ask no questions
Singha beer don't tell no lies
Singha beer don't ask no questions
Singha beer don't tell no lies
I'm just a wally hanging out on Pattaya Beach
Just a wally, just a wally
I'm just a wally hanging out on Pattaya Beach
Just a wally, just a wally
Met a girl said she's really going to blow my mind
She says she don't mean sex and I say alright
Turns out she's a bloke, tries to give me head
I have to run out screaming to the street instead
She's just a wally hanging out on Pattaya Beach
Just a wally, just a wally
She's just a wally hanging out on Pattaya Beach
Just a wally, just a wally
Singha beer don't ask no questions
Singha beer don't tell no lies
In the house of the gods
Where no mongrels preach
I watched the sun going down
On Pattaya Beach
I'm just a wally hanging out on Pattaya Beach
Just a wally, just a wally
I'm just a wally hanging out on Pattaya Beach
Just a wally, just a wallyEmbed
