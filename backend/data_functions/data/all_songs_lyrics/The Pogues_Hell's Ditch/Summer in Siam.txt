Summer in Siam LyricsWhen it's summer in Siam
And the moon is full of rainbows
When it's summer in Siam
And we go through many changes
When it's summer in Siam
Then all I really know is that I truly am
In the summer in Siam
In the summer in Siam
When it's summer in Siam
And the moon is full of rainbows
When it's summer in Siam
And we go through many changes
When it's summer in Siam
Then all I really know is that I truly am
In the summer in Siam
In the summer in SiamEmbed
