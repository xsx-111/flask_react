Ohm LyricsSometimes the bad guys come out on top
Sometimes the good guys lose
We try not to lose our hearts, not to lose our minds
Sometimes the bad days maintain their grip
Sometimes the good days fade
Hurts the brain to think, hurts the head to drink
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The higher we go, the longer we fly
'Cause this is it for all we know
So say good night to me
And lose no more time, no time
Resisting the flow
I heard you calling from far away
I thought I heard you cry
Having the voice to make it right
So I just cry
I felt her slipping, slipping away
Before I could even see
Tried once more, lost my grip, you were gone
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The longer it takes, the looser the ties
'Cause this is it for all we know
So say good night to me
And lose no more time, no time
Resisting the flow
Doo doo doo doo
But nothing ever stays the same
Nothing's explained
The stronger the wind, the faster we'll fly
'Cause this is it for all we know
So say good night to me
And lose no more time
No time
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow
Resisting the flow2Embed
