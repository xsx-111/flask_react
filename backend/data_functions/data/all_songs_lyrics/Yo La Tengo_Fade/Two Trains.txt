Two Trains LyricsBlack and white
The background shifts
Erasing time
Retracing steps
What are you going to do?
Before the fall
Before the flood
After the sinking feeling and the final cut
What are you going to do?
We’re all waiting for you
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Outbound train is always late
We stay lost inside our day
Inbound train, engine glows
Approaches home, never slows
Outbound train is flashing red
We stay lost inside our head
Inbound train, engine blows
Approaches home, never slows
What are you going to do?
We’re all waiting for you
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo dooEmbed
