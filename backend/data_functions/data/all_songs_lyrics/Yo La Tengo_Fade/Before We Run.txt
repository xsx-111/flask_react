Before We Run LyricsHold it in your arms
Be still, be there
I’ll hold you in mine
Before we run, we can start to sing
I know it’s hard, believing in all of this
And then we run, running away from the end
Running away from the end, running away to stay
Orange clouds before the sky rolls back
Before we lose our earth
Before we escape, cross the dotted line
Too fast, and wise
Slowly like the storm
Be still, be there
Running away from there
Running away from there
Running until we’re there
Take me to the place, the lonely place
Take me out beyond the stress
Speak to me words we can’t erase
Take me there, it’s only usEmbed
