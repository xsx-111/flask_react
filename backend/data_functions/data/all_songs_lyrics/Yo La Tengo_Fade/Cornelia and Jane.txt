I hear the whispering
Just out of view
Still unknown
What’s inside of you
Outside your window
Neighbors peer in at you
How can we care for you?
How can we hold onto you?
Caught up in motion
Swirling around
Sometimes you’re standing still
On uneven ground
Too many sirens
They keep you up at night
Sit back and hold your ears
How will we hold back your tears?
I hear them whispering
They analyze
But no one knows
What’s lost in your eyes
Sending the message
It doesn't get to you
How can we care for you?
Slipping away
Fade deep inside of you
But how can we hold on to you?EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy
