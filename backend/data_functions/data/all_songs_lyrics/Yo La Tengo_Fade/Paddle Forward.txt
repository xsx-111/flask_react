Paddle Forward LyricsSOS, we’ve come unmoored
Rip tide pulling, pulling away from the shore
We feel safe inside, not a wave in sight
Hang on tight, the water’s fine
Rock the boat, we've come unmoored
Slipped the cleat, lost at sea
Crack in the centreboard
But we feel safe for now
As long as time allows
Hang on tight
Rushes by too fast
Never seems to last
Hanging ten
Waiting here before the mast
Ship of fools, we've come undone
Riptide pouring, pouring on in from the shore
We feel safe inside
Not a wave in sight
Hang on tight, there’s still time
The water’s fineEmbed
