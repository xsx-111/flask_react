The Point of It LyricsWhen you’re screaming in my ear
What’s the point of it?
When you’re sure no one will hear
Or nothing you’ll remain
Say that we’re afraid
Say that we would run
Maybe that's okay
If we’re not so strong
That’s the point of it
When you choose to hide your eyes
Take me out of here
Find the comfort in my life
Before it disappears
Say that we’re afraid
Say that we’re not the ones
Maybe that’s okay
If we’re not so young
That’s the point of it
When I‘m standing next to you
That’s the point of it
When you still run by us too
That’s the point of it
Say that we’re afraid
Say the night is close
Honey, that’s okay
If we’re getting old
If we’re not so strong
If our story’s told
That’s the point of being bornEmbed
