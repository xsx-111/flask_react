Stupid Things LyricsEvery stupid thing that happens to you
Every silly thing I say
Days just fade away
Slide into grey
Every little thing just creeps up on you
A bumpy road
Happens every day
And it takes my breath away
Nice and warm
We always wake before we fall
I always know that when we wake up
You're mine
We wake up
You're mine
Living with the time that holds us down but
How can that be sung
Where does that time go before our eyes
Every stupid thing that happens to you
The silly things I say
Not so hard to see
But it seems so out of reach
Nice and warm
We always wake before we fall
I always know that when we wake up
You're mine
We wake up
You're mine
Nice and warm
We always wake before we fall
I always know that when we wake up
You're mine
We wake up
You're mineEmbed
