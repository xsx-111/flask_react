Is That Enough LyricsThings we did unthinking
The joke we left unsaid
Unsure how and when we were misled
And if that matters
It's to very few
And all that matters
For me is you
Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
If it's unclear the way I feel for you
I wonder if you're sleeping
I wonder how you know
I wonder why I hate to let that show
It's unimportant
As far as I can tell
What's important
I can't see so well
Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
If it's unclear the way I feel for you
It's true
What can't come back's what we can't bear to lose
I'm getting smarter
Nearly everyday
Waiting, waiting
To see my way
Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
There's just no way that it's enough
Is that enough, oh
Is that enough, well
It's not enough, no
If it's still unclear, the way I feel for you
It's sad but not untrue
What can't come back's what we can't bear to lose2Embed
