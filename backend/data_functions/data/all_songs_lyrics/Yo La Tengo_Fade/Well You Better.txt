Well You Better LyricsHeard your voice in my head too soon
Pass girl, say it, it all cocoon
Oh baby, make up your mind
Please make up your mind
So we left a stone unturned
Maybe that's a lesson learned, yeah
Please make up your mind before it's too late
I didn't wish you'd turn that much
That's where I draw the line as such
Oh baby, make up your mind
Please make up your mind
There's always more to see
But it'll keep go another day hard
Baby, make up your mind before it's too late
We got out of line
It all worked out this time
And everything's fine now
Please make up your mind
Please make up your mind
But if it's up, it's up to me
I'm not sure that I'll come see, yeah
You better make up your mind before it's too late
Baby, make up your mind 'fore it's too late
You better make up your mind 'fore it's too late
Baby, make up your mind
Baby, make up your mind
Oh baby, make up your mind 'fore it's too late1Embed
