All Night Petrol Lyrics
Come on, baby, take me to your heart
Just take a ride up in my car
I'll just refuel before we start
The day is night before we part

What about the living?
What about the dead?

You think you got no place to go
And your daddy's kicked you on the road
You need a lover, not a foe
So you just relax and then unload

What about the living?
What about the dead?

So you think you're foolish, playing hell
All night petrol beats you with its smell
You take a burning lamp and tell time
Slumped upon the floor where we once fell
What about the living?
What about the dead?


You want me? No
You let me go?
You won't say "no", ah, yeah, yeah

You think you're foolish, playing hell
All night petrol beats you with its smell
You take a burning lamp and tell time
Slumped upon the floor where we once fell

What about the living?
What about the dead?Embed
