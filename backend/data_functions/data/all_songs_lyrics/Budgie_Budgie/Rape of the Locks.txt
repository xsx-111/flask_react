Rape of the Locks Lyrics

You say my hair is much too long
And you are right, and I am wrong
I got a way of walking
I got a way of talking
You got a way of living
Don't try to make me live with you
Oh, you

You've got it in for me in blood
To get my hair cut here tonight
How can you love somebody
When they don't love nobody?
It doesn't really matter
It's coming in to trap me, yeah
Oh, yeah


I grow my mind inside my head
I grow my hair to keep it fed
I got a way of talking
I got a way of talking
Somebody, try to save me
Gotta believe me, baby, please
Oh, please
I'm gonna live a lot of life
With golden locks around my eyes
How can you love somebody
When they don't love nobody?
It doesn't really matter
It's coming in to trap me, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah

Said lover
You wanna cut my hair
You wanna cut my hair

You wanna cut my hair
You wanna cut my hair
You wanna cut my hair
You wanna cut my hair
