Nude Disintegrating Parachutist Woman Lyrics
Moving, drifting
Dangling, lilting
These visions of a mystery girl
She's coming out of cloud nine, yeah
Laughing, going
Nude, yeah, yeah
Disintegrating parachutist woman

Woman, climbing
Drifting, wild one
These visions of a mystery girl
And she's coming out of cloud nine, yeah, yeah
I can see her
Nude, yeah, yeah
Disintegrating parachutist woman


I got a feeling, yeah, I got a feeling inside
I got a feeling that I can't hide
I got a feeling, I got a feeling inside
I got a feeling that I can't hide

Moving, drifting
Dangling, lilting
These visions of a mystery girl
She's coming out of cloud nine, yeah
Falling, seeing
Nude, yeah, yeah
Disintegrating parachutist woman

Nude, yeah
Disintegrating parachutist woman, nude1Embed
