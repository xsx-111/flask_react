The Author Lyrics
Happiness is what you want, all I get is pain
But if I left you pretty baby, would you have me back again?
You need somebody, baby, to tell you what to say
You need somebody, baby, to show you all the way
Need somebody, baby, tell you what to say
You need somebody, baby, to show, show you all the way

Hey, woman, wipe off the ink from your eyes
Hey, woman, why do you think you're so wise?
Hey, lover, what do you punish me for?
Hey, woman, what passes behind the door?

Give me a bite of the apple
My hands are tied
Give me your inky pen
And come on back, come on back to me, yeah

Hey, woman, why don't you love me again?
Oh, woman, I wanna be your best friend
Ooh, lover, what do you punish me for?
Hey, woman, past is now behind the door
Give me a bite of the apple
My hands are tied
Give me your inky pen
And come on back, come on back to me, yeah


Well, baby, how do you like my heart?
Woah, baby, how did that come? Love me, yeah
Love me, baby, like I said
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh1Embed
