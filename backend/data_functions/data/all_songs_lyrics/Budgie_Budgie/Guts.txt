Guts Lyrics
Got me living in sin
You've got me breaking my heart
You've got me out on a limb
And I am falling apart
The sun is burning my face
My insides running a race
I need somebody with soul
You are my life and my goal

I need your love
Love

I want somebody who's good
I need somebody who's right
I need a lover who will
Not a lover who might
I wanna love you again
And then again and again
I'm gonna empty you out
I wanna be with you now

I want your love
Love
Love
Love me, yes, yeah
You'd better love me
You'd better love me, yes, yeah
Love, you'd better love me


I need somebody who's good
Need somebody who's right
Need a lover who will
Not a lover who might
Wanna love you again
And again and again
Gonna empty you out
I wanna be with you now

I want your love
Love

Love, love me, yes
You'd better love me, yes
Lord, you've gotta help me
Love me, yeah, yeah, you love me, yes
Love, you love me, yeah
You've got me living in sin
You know what, know what to do
You've got me out on a limb
I feel it coming in two1Embed
