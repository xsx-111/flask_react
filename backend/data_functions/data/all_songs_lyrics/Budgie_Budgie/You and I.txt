You and I Lyrics
I went out some night
All was bright on a night like this
Everywhere I went
Love was spent on a night like this

But you and I are high in the sky
And time flies by on the wind

I was having fun
You were won in the afternoon
In this room
Full of gloom on another noon

But you and I away in the sky
And time flies by on the windEmbed
