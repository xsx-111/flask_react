Really Wanna See You Lyrics
Well, honey, I was just thinking about you and how you got married last June
I wonder how that worked out for you
So I just thought I would call
‘Cause I went to a party, someone gave me some blow
Tears came right to my eyes, and the phone was right there
So I just thought I would call

‘Cause there were times that I feel like I can’t go on
When I would reach for you, but you were gone

So honey, I just thought I would call to see how you were doing
Well, I really want to see you again
‘Cause I just thought I would call to see how you were doing
Because I really want to see you again

There were times I was such a bitch, I can be so insensitive
I really wanna make it up to you now
So I just thought I would call
So, I was cleaning up my room, I found a magic 8-ball
I asked if I'd ever get to kiss your lips again
Oh, it said I better not tell you right now, so I had to call
‘Cause there were times I was not there for you at all
Oh, you would reach for me, and I’d be long gone

So honey, I just thought I would call to see how you were doing
Well, I really wanna see you again
I just thought I would call to see how you were doing
Because I really wanna see you right now

Well, I really wanna see you, I really wanna kiss you again
Right on the mouth and tell you all the things I should have told you then
I want to see you, I want to see you again

Because I went to a party, someone gave me some blow
Tears came right to my eyes, remember how I used to get so emotional
Honey, and the phone was right there so I thought...
Oh, I guess I just thought...

I just thought I would call to see how you’re doing
Well, I really wanna see you again
And I just thought I would call to see how you were doing
Well, I really wanna see you again
Baby, I need to see you right now, pleaseEmbed
