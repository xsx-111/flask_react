Hurts So Bad Lyrics
I haven’t felt this way in so long
Why does it gotta be right now?
Well, I said never meant to hurt nobody ever
I don’t see what’s wrong with two people loving each other

It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
I would die
It was all I ever wanted from you

I get an ache in the pit of my stomach
Must be something that you said to me
‘Cause I swore that I’d go to  bed, I must got it bad
‘Cause I got up and I pushed every button that your elevator had

It hurts so bad (hurts so bad)
It hurts so bad (hurts so bad)
It hurts so bad (hurts so bad)

Why does it matter if you don’t care at all?
I just want to let you know that I won’t be bothering you, baby
I’ll just smoke cigarettes and stare at the wall like it was a TV
Just like I did when I turned seventeen
That’s how you make me feel, baby
It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad
It hurts so bad

It hurts so bad (hurts so bad)
It hurts so bad (hurts so bad)
It hurts so bad (hurts so bad)Embed
