Chris Isaac Lyrics
Well, "For Whom The Bell Tolls" is over
And now I can sack and just fade to black
Well, you know I don’t drive
But, honey, if I did, I’d play that track all the way back
From driving to your house just to say hey
Instead of giving up, I'll see you maybe someday
I’ll buy a pickup truck, paint it flat black and go out on my own
Trying to make amends to myself for all of the chances I’ve blown
Instead of just sitting on my ass waiting for the day
I finally grow up and get my way

But what the hell was I hoping for?
And what the hell was I waiting for?
Well, I guess I could just do my best to ignore you, honey

But when I was seventeen I’d follow you around with my head jammed way up your ass
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to still be able to conjure up energy like that
‘Cause he tries to get on my guitar
I wonder if he knows that it ain’t there
I wonder if he knows that I really don’t care

But what the hell was I hoping for?
And what the hell was I waiting for?
Well, I guess I could just do my best to ignore you, honey
But I knew what I was getting into
Sitting in your basement playing “Forever Blue”
Back when I thought that every man that I met would be the one to say
"Oh, honey, it’s okay, I’ve been lonely, but I can wait"
Well, I’ll be lonely
But I can wait

And then I tell myself that this time could really be it
But I remember the way
You’d call me up drunk like every six months to say you’ve been thinking of me
I hear Chris Isaak on the radio, telling me it’s true
That you still love me darling, but if I know you
Oh you’re still feeding me that same line of shit you always do

Oh, what the hell was I hoping for?
And what the hell am I still waiting for?
Well, I guess I could just do my best to ignore you, honey
Well, I guess I could just do my best to ignore youEmbed
