Head Lyrics
I don’t think too much these days
Not after downing that swallow of Cabernet
I don’t even try that hard to stay awake
I just want to watch my mind go blowin’ away
‘Cause I know the sooner I go to sleep, the sooner I can dream
Well, maybe if I get lucky tonight you’ll be there waitin’ ready for me

Don’t stop get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop getting undressed
Don’t step get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop giving me head

Well I learned to live without you, but I don’t want to
‘Cause I need you more than I would ever let on
Some mornings I still wake up all kinds of confused
‘Cause I fell asleep with your record on again
Well, I try to find you in a picture or an old diary
Maybe if I think about you hard enough you’ll be there waiting on me
Honey, get down on your knees, and

Don’t stop get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop getting undressed
Don’t step get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop giving me head
Don’t stop get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop getting undressed
Don’t step get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop giving me head
Don’t stop get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop getting undressed
Don’t step get in my bed, well, honey, don’t stop giving me headEmbed
