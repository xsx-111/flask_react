To Love Somebody LyricsWhat does it mean to love somebody?
Or at least hope that they’ll be around?
Well, I know I can't ask you for anything, honey
But you’re all that I think about
And I never did want that much from you
Or at least not everything
I never did want you to be mine
Well, at least not all the time
But now I want to be on your mind
Well, I want to be on your mind
Hey
What does it mean to love somebody?
What does it mean to love someone?
What am I doing when I'm hoping that you'll call?
And only you will call me, honey
Well what does that mean at all?
And I never did want you in my way
At least not everyday
I never did want you to be mine
Well, at least not all the time
But I want to be on your mind
I want to be on your mind
It feels like I’m gonna die
If I can’t talk to you
It feels like I’m gonna die
Honey, if you don’t fill my wound up
Well, I feel like I’m gonna die either way
I feel like I’m gonna die either way
I feel like I'm gonna die
What does it mean to love somebody?
Or at least hope they'll love you too?
Why do I feel so wide open?
Oh, honey, tell me not to be a fool for you
‘Cause I never did want that much
I never did want you all the time
Oh, baby, only half the time
Now I want to be on your mind
Well, I want to be on your mind
Oh, honey, let me melt in your mouth tonight
Let me hold you in my palm like a prize tonight
Honey, let me love you all the time
Well, promise that you’ll only love me half the timeEmbed
