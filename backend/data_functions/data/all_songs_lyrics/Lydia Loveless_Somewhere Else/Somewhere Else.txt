Somewhere Else LyricsAll I’m looking for is good things to be a part of
I waved the flag for the home team too long
Then again, things ain’t looking too good on the other side
The grass is greener, but it’s tended by wolves
Say I want to go
Then I want to stay at home
I don’t want to do anything at all
Well, I want to be somewhere else tonight
Well, I want to be somewhere else tonight
Well, you give me more love than a woman can stand
I keep trying 
‘Cause I guess I’m just the spoiled brat my daddy said that I was
Yeah, that used make me so fucking angry
Now I say I want to leave
And then I say that you’re all I need
And I don’t want to be with anybody at all
I just want to be somewhere else tonight
Well, I want to be somewhere else tonight
So I apologize for my one-track mind
Well, I never meant to make you go and put your whole life on the line
Because I love you baby and that ain’t no lie
Well, I just want to be somewhere else tonight
When I die they can say it was no surprise
Ain’t that the girl who tried to drown herself her whole damn life
When I go out by the hills of east Ohio
Because I never meant to stay away this long, oh no
Now I want to be somewhere else tonight
Well, I want to be somewhere else tonight
So I apologize for my one-track mind
Well, I just wanted to 8675309 ya honey
Because I love you baby and that ain’t no lie
I just want to be somewhere else tonight
I want to be somewhere else tonight
I want to be somewhere else tonight
I want to be somewhere elseEmbed
