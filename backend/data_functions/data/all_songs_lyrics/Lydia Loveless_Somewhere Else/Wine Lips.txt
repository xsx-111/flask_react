Wine Lips Lyrics
Ain’t there a corner around the corner
I’ve got a bad idea
Ain’t there somewhere you and me can be alone
Honey, this isn’t a party if it’s chaperoned

That’s all I really wanna do
Is be somewhere it’s just me and you
That’s all I really wanna do
I keep losing my grip on you

Wine lips, wine lips, I want to kiss your wine lips
Wine lips, wine lips, I want to kiss your wine lips

Why don’t you smile at me like that no more?
Can’t you see I’m on fire?
Why don’t you think that I’m a fun-loving gal?
Honey, I’m still the only girl that you dream about

That’s all I really wanna do
Is be somebody that you could talk to
That’s all I really wanna do
I went too far like I always do
Wine lips, wine lips, I want to kiss your wine lips
Wine lips, wine lips, I want to kiss your wine lips

I’ve got a bad idea
That’s all I really wanna do
Is be somebody that you could talk to
That’s all I really wanna do
Go tell your mama that my French has finally improved

Wine lips, wine lips, I want to kiss your wine lips
Wine lips, wine lips, I want to kiss your wine lips
Wine lips, wine lips, yeah, I want to kiss your wine lips2Embed
