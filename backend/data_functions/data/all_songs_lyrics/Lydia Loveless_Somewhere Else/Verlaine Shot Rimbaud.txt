Verlaine Shot Rimbaud Lyrics
Well, Verlaine shot Rimbaud because he loved him so
And honey, that’s the way that I love you
Well, Verlaine shot Rimbaud because he loved him so
And honey, that’s how I want to go

I want to love you like a father loves a son
Tell you it's wrong if you were to lie to me honey
After everything I did for you
Don’t have to kick nobody out of the house
They can stick around and watch us duke it out
I just like you so much better when we’re coming to blows

Well, Verlaine shot Rimbaud because he loved him so
And honey, that’s how I love you
Well, Verlaine shot Rimbaud because he loved him so
And honey, that’s how I want to go

I don’t care if I feel half alive
I’d waste away with you in some sort of nasty dive
I just want to know that I’m the one that makes you write that shit
And I’d like to make you so angry that you leave
And you come crawling back to me down on your knees
And you’re begging me, “I just want to be the one you love“
Well, I just want to be the one you love
I just want to be the one you love

Well, Verlaine shot Rimbaud
Oh, Verlaine shot Rimbaud
That’s how I want to go
Verlaine shot Rimbaud
That’s how I want to go

And I just want to be the one you love
Honey, I just want to be the only one you love
I just want to be the only one you love
No, I just want to be the only one you love
So take me home
That’s where I want to go with you
So take me homeEmbed
