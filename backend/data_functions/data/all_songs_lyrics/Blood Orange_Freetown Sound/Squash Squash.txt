Squash Squash Lyrics
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

Making out that youâ€™re still fine
Dreaming of a life of staying in

You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in

Begging, begging for the ending
But ended up with something
Something that is true
Begging, begging for the ending
I ended up with something
Something that is true, true

You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
Silence on my estate1Embed
