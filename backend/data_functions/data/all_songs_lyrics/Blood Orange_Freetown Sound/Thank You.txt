Thank You Lyrics
Thank you for the promise of your faith
Thank you for your all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape

What's good has gotten me with everything I know
Everything I know has tested me for now
I'm used to thinking about the high state of God
And how we can break down, and what's it all about

Anything you want to do (I feel it coming, too)
Anything because of you (I feel it on your soul)
Anything you want to do (Can't even tell you what's wrong)
Anything because of you
I know it's hard to talk, but I can see you try
I know you've had to walk alongside your foe

Thank you for the promise of your faith (your faith)
Thank you for all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape
Yeah man, c'mon
All the nonsense got to cease

Thank you for the promise of your faith
Thank you for your all your praise
Even if you promise me away
Out of your gaze escape
...Why don't we...

Let me tell you what it's all about
A skin not considered equal
A meteor has more right than my people1Embed
