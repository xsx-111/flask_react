Augustine Lyrics
My father was a young man
My mother, off the boat
My eyes were fresh at 21
Bruised, but still afloat
Our heads have hit the pavement
Many times before
You stroke his face to soothe him
While knowing that there’s more

See, Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

And no one even told me
The way that you should feel
Tell me, did you lose your son?
Tell me, did you lose your love?
Cry and burst my deafness
While Trayvon falls asleep
The things that I can't do to you
The things that I can't do to you
See, Augustine
Late have I loved and chose to see
Skin on his skin
A warmth that I can feel with him

Nontetha
We heard it all from you
Nontetha
We waited here for you
Nontetha
We heard it all from you
Nontetha
We waited here for you
Nontetha
We heard it all from you
Nontetha
We waited here for you
Nontetha
Kushé-o aw di bodi
