Better Than Me Lyrics
Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind
Niggas in the back try and act blind
Seven ways to think about your eyesight

Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Ninety-nine percent, I know you're not fine
Now everyone could be mistakenly kind

Say what you will, what you want
Know it's not the time that you can
Receiving a gift of change with a kiss
When nights alone and nights you're bored
And can't resist or miss the chance of being who they think they think you are
How long before your journey will end in sweet stone?
Walls inside of me that then tell me to breathe
That shake your hand and thank the man for just letting it be

Know my worth and fake the blame
But I know she's better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me
Why choose love when hate comes first?
And I know they're better than me
Wait your turn and change your ways
But I know he's better than me

I know he's better
And I know and I know and I know
He's better than me
Change your ways
And i know he's better than me
I i.. know....
Better than me
And i know he's better than me
He's just better
He's just better than me5Embed
