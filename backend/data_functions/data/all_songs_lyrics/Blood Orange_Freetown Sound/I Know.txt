I Know Lyrics
I can never force your way
The way you speak about your face
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change
How can I be unafraid
When your chair's in when I'm awake?
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change

(What's with your evolving view?)
I know that it's not mine to change
(What's with your evolving view?)
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change

Choose your worth and say it's not there
Split your worries 'cause you know he won't care
Late nights hiding from the thoughts that scare
Choose your worth and say something
I know that it's not mine to change
I know that it's not mine to change
I know that it's not mine to change
I could never force your way
The way you speak about your face
I know that it's not mine to change
Know that it's not mine to change1Embed
