Juicy 1-4 Lyrics
Seen it all before
Could this take too long?
A prayer is all you need
And it's all that was told to me
Stripped of all that's left
Tell me what is right
And never let me ask
If it's all that was told to me

Couldn't see the changes even if I can't explain it
But the presence of a lover with the faces of a mother
It's warm
What is it we're lookin' for if common sense is just the law
And all my teacher preaches is maybe that something is wrong

Mary
Our lady Africa
You promised us a home
But never while we're young
Oh Mary
Our lady Africa
Please don't leave them alone
May your Son's law of love
Stripped of what is left
Tell me what is right
And never let me ask
If it's all that was told to me

Couldn't see the changes even if I can't explain it
But the presence of a lover with the faces of a mother
It's warm
What is it we're lookin' for if comman sense is just the law
And all my teacher preaches is maybe that something is wrong

Mary
Our lady Africa
You promised us a home
But never while we're young
Oh Mary
Our lady Africa
Please don't leave them alone
May your Son's law of love

Feeling old
Knowing that the dream you sold
How'd you make it to your goal?
Once ago
Time you know
Heat you felt when you were cold
It's real as gold
Chains and all
All the things that make us bold
Make us bold
Black is gold
Rightly so
Feeling old
Knowing that the dream you sold
How'd you make it to your goal?
Once ago
Time you know
Heat you felt when you were cold
It's real as gold
Chains and all
All the things that make us bold
Make us bold
Black is gold
Rightly soEmbed
