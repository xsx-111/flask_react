Better Numb Lyrics
Save your eyes
You learn to choose to free your mind
She's not right
You really think it's just the times

And does your mother know you cry?
Choosin' what you live for
It's never what you make your life

Save your eyes
Learn to choose to free your mind
She's not right
You really think it's just the times

And does your mother know you cry?
Choosin' what you live for
It's never what you make your life

Time we know
Everything is said before
She's not right
You really think it's just the times
And does your mother know you cry?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better numb?
