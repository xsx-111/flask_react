But You Lyrics
Can you feel the way they think about me?
Through the years
Told me I should just be myself
I'm better than they thought
If it's true why am I so fearful to the girl?
Tryna walk home slowly herself
Not to scare her off

And if you don't know what that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
'Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way

Can you see the nigga in my face?
And I stay, uh
Given in the place of our hands
It's just another thought
(Just another thought)

And if you don't know what that means (No, no, that means)
Don't tell me that it's true (No, no)
Teach yourself about your brother (Ah, ah)
'Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way, mhm
Could it be, or can it
Can you breathe without air?
All you ever wanted to know, uh
Life is just a dream if you could see without him
Tired of never wanting to know, mhm

If you don't know what that means
Don't tell me that it's true
Teach yourself about your brother
'Cause there's no one else but you
You are special in your own way, uh
You are special in your own way
You are special in your own way (Special, you're special)
You are special in your own way, way1Embed
