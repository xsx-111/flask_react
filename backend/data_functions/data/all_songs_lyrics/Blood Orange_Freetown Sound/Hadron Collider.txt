Hadron Collider Lyrics
A thousand halos in the sky

You're the face behind my face
That keeps me dreaming
You're a phase, inside a cage
That keeps repeating

We should be dancing with the angels
A thousand halos in the sky
But we're far from Heaven

You're the danger (Danger in my life)
And I'm dangerous (Dangerous one)
In my life
You're the page (Danger in my own time)
That keeps on burning

We should be dancing with the angels
A thousand halos fill the sky
But we're too far from Heaven
A thousand halos, you and I
But we're far from Heaven
And the door is open (Door is open)
A crack of light (Light)
The door was open (Door was open)
I could've stepped inside (Side)
Oh, to be brave, want to be brave
Oh, to be brave, want to be brave
To be brave
In this battle of the ages

We should be dancing with the angels
A thousand halos in the sky
But we're too far from Heaven
A thousand halos, you and I
But we're far from Heaven5Embed
