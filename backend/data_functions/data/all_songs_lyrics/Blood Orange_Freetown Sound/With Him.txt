With Him Lyrics
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
You chose to fade away with him
I chose to try and let you in
Hi, hello come on now
Come on, yes

Black is and black ain't
Black is blue, (hoo) black is red
Black is tan (Black will get ya)
Black is light (And black will leave you alone)
Black can get you over
And black can set you down
Black can let you move forward
And black will make you stumble around (Black is so hot)1Embed
