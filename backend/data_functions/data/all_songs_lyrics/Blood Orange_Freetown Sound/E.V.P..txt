E.V.P. Lyrics
Two step in the cut
Spotlights in the cut
Chances are you never saw
What made you who you are
So take a bow cause it's done
Your awful dreams are gone
And scars remain of running away
And hiding 'fore they come

See you want a place that stand still
A place to cure your ills
A place to save your face
And keep you calm when you're uphill
You'll never be the best
She'll never turn you on
And scars remain from running away
And hiding where you're from

Don't use my name
It makes me wonder
Will I ever be enough?
Don't call again
I couldn't answer
My deviation sets it off
Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings

Use my name
Call again

Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another? (Oh, mhm)
Do you ever think, boy? (Woo)
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings (Mhm)

Choosing what you live for
It's never what you make your life
How could you know
If you're squandering your passion for another?
Do you ever think, boy?
Or does it just feel better alone?
Feeling the comfort of sadness in a new set of surroundings10Embed
