Necromantical Screams LyricsNecromantical screams
Only you are deaf
Is there life beyond death?
You entreated death, the answer will come
Debris of faith, even you are false
Immortal morals, catch up with time
Vault of darkness, filled with hate
Deny life, addiction to death
Procession of damnation, expulsion of light
Hazardous ways into the rush
Soul is frozen and flesh is weak
Necromantical screams
Only you are deaf
Intelligence is mute
Respect and thoughts, buried long ago
Pleading for the end, blind and dumb
We won't feel, there could be more
I will remain alone in the dark
...Only you are deafEmbed
