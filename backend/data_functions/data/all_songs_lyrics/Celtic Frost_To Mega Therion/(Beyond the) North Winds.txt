(Beyond the) North Winds LyricsOn days of northern wind, past illusions surround my dreams
Drops of mute ocean's breath in the palm of my hand
The sound of silent waves still caresses all my thoughts
Where warm, mystic floods dominated the upper hemisphere
And dark ships sailed beyond those lost realms
Through gates to eternity, above the sleeping mind
Forever inconquerable seemed the walls of time
To those who always feared and always fled the dawn
But then, the guardian's growl invited the thirst for steel
Part god, part man, if I walked by their side
The old man's dream now has ended much too soon
Forgotten rests the wisdom that brought them once so far
Vanished until rebirth, we sleep the endless sleep
For one who knows, never tries to reappear...Embed
