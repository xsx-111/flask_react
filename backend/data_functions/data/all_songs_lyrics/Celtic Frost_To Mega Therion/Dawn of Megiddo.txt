Dawn of Megiddo LyricsHumilated in human form
We have to die to be reborn
Awaiting the final judgement
The dawn now lifts
Subjects of flesh
Slaves of lust
The cross has failed
You won't see the coming fall
A diviner's fire and soil
Flames, like flowers, like blood
Fires of freedom, flowers of doom
A surface of hateful hope
Oh, subjects of pain
Lovers of death
You will feel
The yearning flames
Flames like tongues, like cries
Pant for kisses, for bites
Seven steps and we're one
Humilated in human thoughts
The frost, it bites your inner heart
Frozens the flame in every eye
The lord will come, broken ice
The fire will burn, gleaming ways
We'll never be reborn
Prenatal death's redeemed (our lives)
(Into his hand) we demand our hearts
The lord and we are oneEmbed
