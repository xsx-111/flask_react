Fainted Eyes LyricsTry to see through fainted views
As reality disappears in haze
A journey between eternal walls
The senses unfold before my eyes
As the endless dreams begin to reign
And my hands slip off the edge
The waters grow dumb
While they descend (behind)
Fainted eyes
Drifting in the streams of wisdom
While recognizing all those banal tales
Sin beyond truth, (I see) glimmering splinters
Encountering my past in flickering whispers
While they drown behind their frontiers
And the rulers sink in agony
Fallacy and false idols
Unbelievable is the human direction
But the screams die away in the distance
Try to see through fainted views
But the dust still covers all my dreams
I wouldn't tell you anywayEmbed
