Monsters Lyrics
A tree for all these problems
They can't find you for the moment
Then for all past efforts
They're buried deep beneath
Your heart and somewhere in your stomach

And hatred for all others
When awful people, they surround you
Well, ain't they just like monsters
They come to feed on me
Giant little animals to feed

Though to say we got much hope
If I am lost, it's only for a little while, oh

A tree for all these problems
They can't find us for the moment
Then for all past efforts
They're buried deep beneath
Our hearts and somewhere in our stomachs

And hatred for all others
When awful people they surround you
Well ain't they just like monsters
They come to feed on us
Giant little animals for us
Though to say we got much hope
If I am lost it's only for a little while
Though to say we got much hope
If I am lost it's only for a little while

If I am lost, it's only for a little while
If I am lost, it's only for a little while2Embed
