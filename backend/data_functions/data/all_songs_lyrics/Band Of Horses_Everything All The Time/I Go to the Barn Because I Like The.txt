I Go to the Barn Because I Like The Lyrics
Well I'd like to think I'm the mess
You'd wear with pride
Like some empty dress on the bed
You've laid out for tonight

Maybe I'll tell you sometime
Time
Sometime
And you were right
Right
You were right

Outside
By your doorstep
In a worn out
Suit and tie
I'll wait
For you to come down
Where you'll find me
Where we'll shine
Outside
By your doorstep
In a worn out
Suit and tie
I'll wait
For you to come down
Where you'll find me
Where we'll shine
Outside
By your doorstep
In a worn out
Suit and tie
I'll wait
For you to come down
Where you'll find me
Where we'll shine
