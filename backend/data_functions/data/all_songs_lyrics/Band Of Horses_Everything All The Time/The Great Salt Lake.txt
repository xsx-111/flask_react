The Great Salt Lake Lyrics
Back of the boat was painted "Wrecking Ball"
There was country music playing
But he don't like it at all
And red fire popping on the rained-down wood
There was whiskey bottle spilling
And a lake that's made of salt
Look out back, well there's a note on the door
Saying, "Everybody listen, we'll be the next Omaha"

Now if you find yourself falling apart
Then I'm sure I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake

Falling apart
And I'm sure I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake

Your old man was but a wishing machine
It's time that you could spend
Now he's getting old
When Billy Lorett had found a watering hole
It's a place to lay south or the heads of coyote
Now if you find yourself falling apart
Well I'm sure
I could stand on
The Great Salt Lake

Follow me home
We want more
Follow me home
We all want more
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They know we all want more, oh-oh
If ever beat down
We know who we are
They know we all want more
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh3Embed
