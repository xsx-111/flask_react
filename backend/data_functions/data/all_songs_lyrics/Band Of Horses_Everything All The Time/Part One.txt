Part One LyricsTo the bottom, dear, I had to fall
You really caught me
You really caught me, dear
At the bottom where I fall
And slowly, dear, ask would you dance with me
Here's the shades down
The lights off
And I didn't know you
And everything I do
Done badly
Now I'll love you always
Even when I say
Distract me
And set out tonight at some strange place
If we have no friends here
Why have few to begin with?
To wake next to you in the morning
And good morning to you
How do you do?
A "good morning" to you
And more covers for you
Sleep soundly, dear
'Cause I have to go
And I'll love you always
And when we leave this place
And drive back to Carolina
And down to Savannah and stay1Embed
