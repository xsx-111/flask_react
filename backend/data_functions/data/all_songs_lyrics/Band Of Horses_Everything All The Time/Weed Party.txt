Weed Party Lyrics
Weed party
Yeehaw

I got you arrested because
Weed party come and gone
Gone
I am about to set this off
Till weed party's done
Is done

The wine is there to keep yourself
You got it wrong

So I brought you perplexing thoughts
Words were at a loss
A loss
It's a good day to skip because
Weed party is gonna call
It's called

The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
Parents aren't enforcing the laws
The wine is there to keep yourself
But don't you ever listen at all
Parents aren't enforcing the laws, oh1Embed
