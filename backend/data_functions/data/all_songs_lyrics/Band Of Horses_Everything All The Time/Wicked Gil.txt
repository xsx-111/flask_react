Wicked Gil Lyrics
I hate Gil really now
Hate you because
Go tippy toe
Shut off to the world
Shut off to all, you go
I barely told a lie
Now pray to be blind
And I'm gone for a while
Shut off the world
Shut off to all

I'm yours
I'm yours
There'll be evil people to say things they show
Say once before
I know evil people will say things
They don't know, oh

I begged Gil really why
Stay through the night
I'm here for a while
Shut off to the world
Shut off to all
I'm yours
I'm yours
There'll be evil people to say things they show
Said once before
I know evil people will say things
They don't know

Oh why do I even care
It's nothing now, ohEmbed
