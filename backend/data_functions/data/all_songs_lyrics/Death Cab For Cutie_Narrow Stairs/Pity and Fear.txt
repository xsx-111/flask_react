Pity and Fear Lyrics
I have such envy for this stranger lying next to me
Who awakes in the night and slips out into the pre-dawn light
With no words, a clean escape, no promises or messes made
And chalks it all up to mistake, mistake, mistake

And there are no tears, just pity and fear
And a vast ravine right in between

A storm at sea, the bow cracked and I was capsizing
And I sunk below where I swore I would never go
If you can't stand in place, you can't tell who's walking away
From who remains, who stays, who stays, who stays

And there are no tears, just pity and fear
And a vast ravine right in between
Spare no tears, just pity and fear
And I recall the push more than the fall
The push more than the fallEmbed
