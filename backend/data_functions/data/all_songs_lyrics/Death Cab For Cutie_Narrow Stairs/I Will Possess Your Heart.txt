I Will Possess Your Heart Lyrics

How I wish you could see the potential
The potential of you and me
It's like a book elegantly bound, but
In a language that you can't read just yet

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart

There are days when, outside your window
I see my reflection as I slowly pass
And I long for this mirrored perspective
When we'll be lovers, lovers at last

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart

You reject my advances
And desperate pleas
I won't let you let me down
So easily
So easily

You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart
You gotta spend some time, love
You gotta spend some time with me
And I know that you'll find, love
I will possess your heart

I will possess your heart
I will possess your heart12Embed
