Long Division Lyrics
His head was a city of paper buildings
And the echoes that remained of old friends and lovers
Their features bleeding together in his brain

And once it started was harder to tell them apart

He was always distracted by the very mention of an open door

'Cause he had sworn not to be what he'd been before

To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be a remain, remain, remain, remainder

The television was snowing softly as she hunted for her keys
She said she never envisioned him the type of person capable of such deceit

And then they carried on like long division
As it was clear with every page
That they were further away from a solution that would play

Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder
Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder
Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder
Without a remain, remain, remain, remainder

He had sworn not to be what he'd been before

To be the remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be the remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be the remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be the remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be the remain, remain, remain, remainder
To be the remain, remain, remain, remainder2Embed
