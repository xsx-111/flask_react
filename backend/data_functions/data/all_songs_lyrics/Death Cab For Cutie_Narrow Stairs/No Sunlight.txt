No Sunlight Lyrics
When I was young
Lying in the grass
I felt so safe
In a warming bath

Of sunlight
Of sunlight

Vast, open sky
Could do no harm
Like an embrace
From mother's arms

In sunlight
In sunlight
In sunlight
In sunlight

With every year
That came to pass
More clouds appear
'Til the sky went black
And there was no sunlight
No sunlight
And there was no sunlight
No sunlight anymore

You disappeared at the same speed
As the idealistic things I believed
When the optimist died inside of me

No sunlight
No sunlight
No sunlight
No sunlight

You disappeared at the same speed
As the idealistic things I believed
When the optimist died inside of me

No sunlight
No sunlight
No sunlight
No sunlight
No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight, no sunlight
No sunlight anymoreEmbed
