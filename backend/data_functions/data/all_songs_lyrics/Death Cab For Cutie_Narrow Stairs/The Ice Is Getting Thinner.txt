The Ice Is Getting Thinner Lyrics
We're not the same, dear, as we used to be
The seasons have changed and so have we
There was little we could say, and even less that we could do
To stop the ice from getting thinner under me and you

We bury our love in the wintry grave
A lump in the snow was all that remained
Though we stayed by its side as the days turned to weeks
And the ice kept getting thinner with every word that we'd speak

And when the spring arrived, we were taken by surprise
When the floes under our feet bled into the sea
And nothing was left for you and me

We're not the same, dear, and it seems to me
There's nowhere we can go with nothing underneath
And it saddens me to say what we both knew was true
That the ice was getting thinner under me and you
The ice was getting thinner under me and you4Embed
