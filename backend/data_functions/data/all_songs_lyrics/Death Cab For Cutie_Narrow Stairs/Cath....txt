Cath... Lyrics
Cath, she stands
With a well-intentioned man
But she can't relax
With his hand on the small of her back
And as the flash-bulbs burst
She holds a smile
Like someone would hold
A crying child

And soon everybody will ask
What became of you
'Cause your heart was dying fast
And you didn't know what to do

Cath, it seems
That you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed

But you said your vows
And you closed the door
On so many men
Who would have loved you more
And soon everybody will ask
What became of you
'Cause your heart was dying fast
And you didn't know what to do

The whispers that it won't last
Roll up and down the pews
But if their hearts were dying that fast
They'd have done the same as you
And I'd have done the same as you6Embed
