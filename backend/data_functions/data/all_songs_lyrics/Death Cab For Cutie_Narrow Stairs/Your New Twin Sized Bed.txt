Your New Twin Sized Bed Lyrics
You look so defeated, lying there in your new twin sized bed
With a single pillow underneath your single head
I guess you decided that that old queen
Was more space than you would need
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment
With a sign that says "It's free"

But I hope you have more luck with this than me

You used to think that someone would come along
And lay beside you in a space that they belong
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used?

Other than a sick desire for self-abuse

And I try not to worry
But you've got me terrified
It's like you're in some kind of hurry
To say goodbye, to say goodbye, to say goodbye
You look so defeated, lying there in your new twin size bed
You look so defeated, lying there in your new twin size bedEmbed
