Grapevine Fires Lyrics
When the wind picked up, the fire spread
And the grapevines seemed left for dead
And the northern sky looked like the end of days
The end of days
The wake-up call to a rented room
Sounded like an alarm of impending doom
To warn us, it's only a matter of time

Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn
Before we all burn

We bought some wine and some paper cups
Near your daughter's school when we picked her up
And drove to a cemetery on a hill
On a hill
And we watched the plumes paint the sky gray
As she laughed and danced through the field of graves
There, I knew it would be alright
That everything

Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright
Would be alright
And the news reports on the radio
Said it was getting worse
As the ocean air fanned the flames
But I couldn't think
Of anywhere I would've rather been
To watch it all burn away
To burn away

Burn
Burn

The firemen worked in double shifts
With prayers for rain on their lips
And they knew it was only a matter of time8Embed
