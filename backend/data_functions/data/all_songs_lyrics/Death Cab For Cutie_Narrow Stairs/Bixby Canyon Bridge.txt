Bixby Canyon Bridge Lyrics
I descended a dusty gravel ridge
Beneath the Bixby Canyon Bridge
Until I eventually arrived
At the place where your soul had died
And barefoot in the shallow creek
I grabbed some stones from underneath
And waited for you to speak to me

In the silence, it became so very clear
That you had long ago disappeared
I cursed myself for being surprised
That this didn't play like it did in my mind
All the way from San Francisco
As I chased the end of your road
'Cause I've still got miles to go

And I want to know my fate
If I keep up this way
And it's hard to want to stay
Awake
When everyone you meet
They all seem to be asleep
And you wonder if you're missing your dream
You can't see a dream
You can't see a dream
You just can't see a dream

A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream
A dream

And then, it started getting dark
I trudged back to where the car was parked
No closer to any kind of truth
As I must assume was the case with you7Embed
