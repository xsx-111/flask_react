You Can Do Better Than Me LyricsI'm starting to feel
We stayed together out of fear
Of dying alone
I've been slipping through the years
My old clothes don't fit like they once did
So they hang like ghosts of the people I've been
It's like my heart can't be tamed
I fall in love every day
And I feel like a fool
I have to face the truth
That no one could ever look at me like you do
Like I'm something worth holding onto
There's times I think of leaving
But it's something I'll never do
'Cause you can do better than me
But I can't do better than you
You can do better than me
But I can't do better than youEmbed
