Catch A Wave Lyrics
Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world

Don't be afraid to try the greatest sport around
(Catch a wave, catch a wave)
(Everybody tries it once)
Those who don't just have to put it down
You paddle out, turn around and raise
And baby that's all there is to the coastline craze

You gotta catch a wave and you're sittin' on top of the world

Not just a fad because it's been going on so long
(Catch a wave, catch a wave)
(All the surfers going strong)
They said it wouldn't last too long
They'll eat their words with a fork and spoon and watch them
They'll hit the road and all be surfing soon

And when they catch a wave they'll be sittin' on top of the world
Catch a wave and you're sitting on top of the world
So take a lesson from a top-notch surfer boy
(Catch a wave, catch a wave)
(Get yourself a big board)
But don't you treat it like a toy
Just get away from the shady turf
And baby go catch some rays on the sunny surf

And when you catch a wave you'll be sittin on top of the world
(Way up high, up on top of the world)
Catch a wave and you'll be sittin' on top of the world
(Way up high, up on top of the world)
Catch a wave and you'll..Embed
