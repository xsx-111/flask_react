A Darkness in My Soul Lyrics
Into the wild
Thoughts all end
Unearthly child
Plants and animals
Black and white
Journey on
Through day and night

There's a darkness in my soul
A darkness in my soul
A darkness in my soul
A darkness in my soul



No thought remains
Only a shell
And body stains
War is coming
I've got to find
The god inside
My other mind
