Spectrum is Green Lyrics
"Launch angels one, two and three. Destiny Angel, immediate launch"
"Spectrum is green"
"Harmony and Rhapsody Angels. Immediate launch, angels two and three"
"Spectrum is green"

Immediate launch, angels two and three
Standby Symphony and Rhapsody
Contact Scarlet immediately
And tell him to follow in the S.P.V

Spectrum is, spectrum is green 

When they reached their destination
They were hit by a detonation
The angels screamed as they hit the ground
But the thin green beam didn't make a sound


With an alien glint in Rhapsody's eyes
The angels gave Cloudbase a real surprise
And then came a thin beam of radiation
And they watched Cloudbase's recreation
