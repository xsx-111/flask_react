Destination Moon Lyrics
The networks of new passages
They fill the air around me
The sentinel is on my mind
He wanders out to meet me

Ooh, we're going to the moon
We're leaving so soon
I know I'm to blame
I call someone's name

The patterns of the rocks around me
Echoes through the mountains
Darkness falls, the sergeant calls
It's time to climb aboard now

Ooh, we're going to the moon
We're leaving so soon
I know I'm to blame
I call someone's name

Countdown begins, the world is trembling
Words are of no use now
Staring just above my head
I hear the radios howl
Ooh, we're going to the moon
We're leaving so soon
I know I'm to blame
I call someone's nameEmbed
