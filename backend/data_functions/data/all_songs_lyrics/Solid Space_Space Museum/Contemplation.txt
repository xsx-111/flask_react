Contemplation Lyrics
It's just a contemplation
I think in my head
Something to do tomorrow
Leave it instead
Sitting alone without you
I watch in despair
The birds that walked around me
Fly into the air

And the morning flies away
Over sea to see you another day

It's just imagination
Your face in the fire
Nothing my eyes can see but
The wind blows it higher
Now as the day grows nearer
I shiver inside
Devoting all my thoughts to
A car by my side

Darkness echoes in my mind
I'm scared of what I'll never find
Darkness echoes
