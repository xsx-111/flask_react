Radio France Lyrics
I see you walking past me everyday
And think of all the things we used to say
I sometimes wish I could get through to you
But all your schemes and lies obscure the view

Do you still believe that I feel anything
When all those years you turned your back and left me crying?
You know you'd just take a plane to anywhere
And laugh at me as I stand and stare

Living away from you had done me good
Just like the way you used to say it would
And now there's someone who can comfort me
Somebody who I know has eyes to see
