New Statue Lyrics
'Oh, I don't quite understand'
'The dormouse is asleep again. Have you guessed the riddle yet?'
'No, I give it up. What's the answer?'
'I haven't the slightest idea'
'Nor I'

Love set you going
Love set you going
And your bald cry
Love set you going
Love set you going
Like a fat gold watch

Our voices echo
Our voices echo
Our voices echo
New statue

In a draughty museum
Your nakedness shadows our safety
We stand around
Blankly as walls

One cry
And I stumble from bed
One cry
And now I wake to listen
