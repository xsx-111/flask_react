One Percent Lyrics
Every sound
Every sound from everyone, receiving you
Everyone, receiving you
Anyone
Not anyone of us who is in search
Everyone's receiving you

Come by the long way
Deep in the summer day
I'll be there with you
(That's where I heard it for myself)
On the training ground
For the new world
You heard it too13Embed
