Kansas Lyrics
I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

Am I incapable of healing
The memory of my fall from grace in your heart
I'm on my journey home
With no fuel alone
I think I'll coast a while

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream

'Cause I'm about to solve it
Put my engine back into overdrive
So I can breathe again, (photo) photosynthesize again (synthesize)
With the green hills of my home

I'm not gonna cry
I've got more time to give
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream
I'm not gonna cry
(Pave the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream
But if I got it right, you'd tell me
And if I was wrong, then I'd disappear
But I'm incapable

I'm not gonna cry
(Pave the way to me)
I got more time to give
(It's getting nasty)
I'm not gonna cry
Find another dream9Embed
