Magic City Lyrics
I'm on the high ridge looking down
While we're evolving in it all
If I get back then I'll be grateful
Look there's a billboard on the moon

Let me take you this far
This crossing isn't much to me
There's lightning in the storm clouds
And I'll send you there to stay

You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go

Magic City
Magic City
Magic City
Magic City

You put me up here in the penthouse
And painted me in red, white and blue
I filled the canyons with my ego
Look there's a billboard on the moon
You got me lost in Magic City
You got me questioning it all
I hope that I make it home by Wednesday
And this Magic City lets me go12Embed
