Souk Eye Lyrics
LA why you're so complicated for me, twilight
Waiting on the planet to turn to me, dark side
If loving you's a felony now, then I'm a renegade, riding
Trying to find tomorrow ain't easy 'til you dive in
(Swimming pools)

Why you rolling waves over me now, that's all I need, dreaming
Waiting on LA to come find me, be forgiven
I'll be a regular guy for you, I never said I'd do that
Why you looking so beautiful to me now when you so sad?

I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through

I wanna stay with you for a long time; I wanna be stone, love
I wanna see LA in your eyes when I'm leaving with your love

I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back, 'cause I got to run soon

I will always think about you
That's why I'm calling you back on my way through32Embed
