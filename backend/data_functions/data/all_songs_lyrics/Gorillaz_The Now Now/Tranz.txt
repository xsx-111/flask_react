Tranz Lyrics
Oscillate yourself tonight
When you're in your bed
Assimilate the dopamine
Passing through your head

When you get back on a Saturday night
And the room is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?

See yourself in Cupid's lake
Chipped in your head
Do you indicate to satellites
Passing by the edge?

When you get back on a Saturday night
And your head is caving in

Do you look like me? Do you feel like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you look like me?
Do you burn like me?
Do you turn into your effigy?

Do you dance like this forever?
Do you dance like this forever?

(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)
(Do you dance?)44Embed
