Lake Zurich Lyrics
Last chance to buy before you fly
Last chance to buy before you fly

Okay
In the morning it came to me
Build a tunnel from Zurich to New York
I find it hard to share this with anyone
Because even to me it sounded ridiculous
But one morning
After a long complicated night
I made my mind up, to share my vision with the world
Everything that follows
I'm not responsible for11Embed
