Fire Flies Lyrics
If you see me floating too many times
My face will be painted in these white brick lines

'Cause all my fears invaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

And if you say goodbye too many times
The sentinels will find me and switch me off this time

'Cause all my fear's evaded
All the crazies put on buses and sent up here to find you
Living on the limits

If all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fall of man
Every call and cost made to your heart
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
I was ever chasing fireflies

Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?
Sometimes I follow a firefly
It takes me into the night
Baby, I just survive
I'm love drunk, I'm sorry
Am I losing you?
If all you ever get from the summit is the count of the fall of man
(Takes me into the night)
Every call and cost made to your heart
(Sorry, am I losing you?)
You were in the kind of game that put the force in me
(Takes me into the night)
I was ever chasing fireflies26Embed
