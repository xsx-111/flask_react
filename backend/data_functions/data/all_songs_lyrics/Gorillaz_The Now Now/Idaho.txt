Idaho Lyrics
I landed on the silver lake
Washed up and feeling blue
Heard the sound of footsteps
Drifting softly to the moon
Looking for clear water
I had to take control
Out there in the wilderness
Another bullet hole

Playing it all for gods
Yesterday

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
Every day, I look out on the bus
Silver lining's getting lost

Floated out into the woods
To hear the old elk call
Touched a rainbow with my hands
I'm dry, I got 'em all
"Ride on," said the king of cool
You've got nothing to lose
Tinseltown is down the road
It's the bullet or the noose
If you're playing it all for gods
Far away

Idaho, Idaho
There's a beauty on the road
And every day, I look out of the bus
Silver lining's getting lost20Embed
