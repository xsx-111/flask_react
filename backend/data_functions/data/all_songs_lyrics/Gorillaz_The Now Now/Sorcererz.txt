Sorcererz Lyrics
Hey
What is this drumming I'm hearing now?
All over me

Everybody cool down
Everybody see yourself
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody hold on
Everybody hold on to your inner vision

Hey
What is this drumming I'm hearing now?
All over me

Everybody cool down
Everybody see yourself
Everybody on time
On time
Everybody mining
Everybody mining their own inner vision
Everybody lie down
Everybody pool light
Everybody on time
All the time
Everybody hold on
Everybody hold on to your inner vision

Everybody (Inner vision)

Everybody (Inner vision)
(Inner vision)

Everybody (Inner vision)
