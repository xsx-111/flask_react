Fill Your Heart Lyrics
Fill your heart with love today
Don't play the game of time
Things that happened in the past
Only happened in your mind
Only in your mind
Oh, forget your mind

And you'll be free, yeah
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah
And you can know it all if you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose

'Cause they are free, of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love cleans the mind and makes it free

Oh, happiness is happening
The dragons have been bled
Gentleness is everywhere
And fear's just in your head
Only in your head, fear is in your head
Only in your head, so forget your head
And you'll be free
The writing's on the wall
Free, yeah
And you can know it all if you choose
Just remember, lovers never lose

Because they are free of thoughts unpure
And of thoughts unkind
Gentleness clears the soul
Love will clean your mind and make you
Fuh-ree-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee, yeah!

Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah

Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Free-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
