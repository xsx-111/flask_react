Hallowed Be My Name LyricsGather round right now
And hear me whisper
The words of the prison
The words of laughter
The lords and the ladies
Were fixing their hairdos
Cursing their lovers
Cursing the bible
Hallowed be my name
Yelling at fathers
Screaming at mothers
Hallowed be my name
Come all you sinners
Come now in your glory
And my ears will listen
To your dirty stories
You're fighting to go up
'Cause you're on your way down
Cursing their lovers
Cursing the bible
Hallowed be my name
Yelling at fathers
Screaming at mothers
Hallowed be my name
Sluts and the hookers
Have taken your money
The queens are out dancing
But now they're not funny
'Cause there goes one walkin'
Away with your sonny
Cursing their lovers
Cursing the bible
Hallowed be my name
Yelling at fathers
Screaming at mothers
Hallowed be my nameEmbed
