Long Way to Go LyricsWe still got a long way to go
We still got a long way to go
We all got a long way to go
What's keeping us apart isn't selfishness
What's holding us together isn't love
Listen to the man who's been
Touched all his life
Yes he's the one they call the fool
Where is the saviour of the sidewalk life
And the road that takes us to the crusades
I've seen the shadows
As they're moving in my sleep
Leading the blind poet to his grave
We still got a long way to go
We still got a long way to go
Yes we all got a long way to go
Please don't waste your energy on me, my friend
Cause we still got a long way to go
We'll meet again someday
But right now just go away
Cause I still got a long way to go
The silence is speaking
So why am I weeping
I guess I love it
I love it to death
Yes we still got a long way to go
Yes we still got a long way to go
Yes we all got a long way to go1Embed
