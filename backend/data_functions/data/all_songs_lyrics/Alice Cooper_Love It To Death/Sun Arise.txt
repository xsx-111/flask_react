Sun Arise Lyrics
Sun arise, come every mornin'
Sun arise, come every mornin'
Sun arise, come every mornin'
Bringin' back the warmth to the ground

Sun arise, filling up the hollow
Sun arise, filling up the hollow
Sun arise, filling up the hollow
Bringin' back the warmth to the ground

Sun arise, she come every mornin'
Sun arise, each and every day
Sun arise, she come every mornin'
Sun arise, ever-y ever-y ever-y ever-y day!

She drive away the darkness everyday (hey!)
She drive away the darkness everyday (hey!)
She drive away your darkness everyday (hey!)
Bringin' back the warmth to the ground
