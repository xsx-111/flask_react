Caught in a Dream Lyrics
Well, I'm running through the world with a gun in my back
Trying to catch a ride in a Cadillac
Thought that I was living, but you can't really tell
Been trying to get away from that success smell

You know, I need a houseboat and I need a plane
I need a butler and a trip to Spain
I need everything the world owes me
I tell that to myself and I agree

I'm caught in a dream; so what
You don't know what I'm going through
I'm right in between so I'll
I'll just play along with you


Well I'm running through the world with a gun in my back
Trying to catch a ride in that Cadillac
Thought I was living but you can't ever tell
What I thought was Heaven turned out to be Hell
Whoa whoa, when you see me with a smile on my face
Whoa whoa then you'll know I'm a mental case
Whoa whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa whoa whoa


I'm caught in a dream; so what
You don't know what I'm going through
I'm right in between so I'll
I'll just play along with you
