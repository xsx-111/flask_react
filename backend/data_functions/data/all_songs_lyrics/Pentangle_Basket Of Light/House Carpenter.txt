House Carpenter Lyrics"Well, I once could have married the king's third son
And a fine young man was he
But now I'm married to a house carpenter
And a noisy, old man is he"
"But will you forsake your house carpenter
And a go along with a-me?
I will take you to where the grass grows green
On the banks of the river deep"
"But will you have to maintain me a-bound
To keep me at slavery?"
"Well, I have seven ships, they will soon be at land
And they at your command shall be"
She took her two babes by the hand
And gave them kisses three
Said, "Stay at home you, darling little babes
Keep your father sweet company"
Now, she dressed herself in her very best
Like a high-born lady was she
She shivered and she shimmered and she proudly stepped
As they walked by the banks of the sea
Well, she hadn't been gone but a short, short time
Until she wept for sor'
"I would give all the gold in this round world
Just to see my babes once more"
"Well, if you had all the gold and the silver, too
That ever did cross the sea
You never would be at land anymore
And your babes you will never more see"
Well, they hadn't been sailing but a short, short time
About two weeks, three or four
When the ship sprang a leak and they were doomed
And they were far away from the shore
"I see bright hills of Heaven, my dear
Where angels come and go"
"I see bright hills, that's Hell, my dear
Where you and I must go"
"Well, I wish I was back to my house carpenter
I'm sure he would treat me well
But here I am in the raging sea
And my soul is bound for Hell"Embed
