Once I Had a Sweetheart LyricsOnce I had a sweetheart, and now I have none
Once I had a sweetheart, and now I have none
He's gone and left me, he's gone and left me
Gone and left me in sorrow to mourn
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see
Last night in sweet slumber I dreamed I did see
My own darlin' jewel sat smilin' by me
My own darlin' jewel sat smilin' by me
But when I awakened I found it not so
But when I awakened I found it not so
My eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed
Eyes like some fountain with tears overflowed
I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain
I'll venture through England, through France and through Spain
My life I'll venture on the watery main
My life I'll venture on watery main
I'll set sail of silver and steer toward the sun
I'll set sail of silver and steer toward the sun
And my false love will weep, my false love will weep
False love will weep for me after I'm gone
(After I'm gone, after I'm gone, after)
(After I'm gone, after I'm gone, after)
(After I'm gone, after I'm gone, after)Embed
