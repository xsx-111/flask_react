Train Song LyricsFare thee well, little lady
Trains are gatherin' in
One and the two
Three and the four thousand miles
Miles from you
Lord, I tried my best
To be your man
Can you see, can you feel
That burnin' into my soul?
Don't you understand?
Love is a basket of light
Graspin' so tight
Shinin' bright
Just ain't right to be caught in the night
Caught in the basket of lightEmbed
