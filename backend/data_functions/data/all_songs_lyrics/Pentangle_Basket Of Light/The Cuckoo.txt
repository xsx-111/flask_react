The Cuckoo LyricsOh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird; she sings as she flies
She bringeth good tidings; she telleth no lies
She sucketh white flowers for to keep her voice clear
And the night she sings her "cuckoo" the summer draweth near
As I was a-walking and talking one day
I met my own true love as he came that way
Though the meeting was a pleasure, though the courting was a woe
For I found him false-hearted; he'd kiss me, and then he'd go
I wish I were a scholar and could handle the pen
I'd write to my lover and to all roving men
I would tell them of the grief and woe that attend all their lies
I would wish them have pity on the flower when it dies
I wish I were a scholar and could handle the pen
I'd write to my lover and to all roving men
I would tell them of the grief and woe that attend all their lies
I would wish them have pity on the flower when it dies
As I was a-walking and talking one day
I met my own true love as he came that way
Though the meeting was a pleasure, though the courting was a woe
For I found him false-hearted; he'd kiss me, and then he'd go
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird; she sings as she flies
She bringeth good tidings; she telleth no lies
She sucketh white flowers for to keep her voice clear
And the night she sings her "cuckoo" the summer draweth near
And the night she sings her "cuckoo" the summer draweth nearEmbed
