Light Flight Lyrics
Let's get away, you say, find a better place
Miles and miles away from the city's race
Look around for someone lying in the sunshine
Marking time, hear the sighs, close your eyes

Ba-da, pa-doo-da
Da-da, pa-doo-da, dao

Stepping from cloud to cloud, passing years of light
Visit the frosty start in the backwoods flight
Soaring rounds of visions, never mind the meaning
Hidden there, moving fast, it won't last

Ba-da, pa-doo-da
Da-da, pa-doo-da, dao

Time passes all too soon, how it rushes by
Now, a thousand moons are about to die
No time to reflect on what the time was spent on
Nothing left, far away, dreamers fade
Ba-da, pa-doo-da
Da-da, pa-doo-da, dao

Strange visions pass me by
Winging swiftly as a sigh
Over the water
Ahhh, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah
Ahhh, ah, ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ahhh, ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah

Swirling, the waters rise up above my head
Gone are the curling mists, how they all have fled
Look, the door is open, step into the space
Provided there, di-oh-da, di-oh-da

Ba-da, pa-doo-da
Da-da, pa-doo-da, daoEmbed
