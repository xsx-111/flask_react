Springtime Promises LyricsSummertime is with us once again
Flowers bloomin' everywhere again
And the cold days of winter are behind us now
And the springtime promises all come true
Trees and grass and bushes green again
The sky so blue I don't remember when
The cold days of winter took the sun away
But the springtime promises all came true
It's summertime now
So please don't throw it away
Winterworld is with us once again
Flowers dyin' everywhere again
And the warm days of summer will be far behind
And the springtime promises soon forgot
There're some bushes withered and the trees are bare
Dark and cloudy skies and people in despair
And the warm days of summer seem so far away
And the springtime promises still forgot
It's wintertime so you've gotta wait a while
For the springtime promises to come true
Now, the newborn year has come once more
Gentle showers awake us as before
It's the time when all promises are now made true
And the springtime sun returns anew
Soon the earth will turn to green again
Flowers will burst forth soon to bloom again
And the warm days of springtime tell us all is well
Can't you feel your promises will be true?
It's springtime now
Be happy todayEmbed
