Ten Days LyricsSo we've put an end to it this time
I'm no longer yours and you're no longer mine
You said this hill looks far too steep
If I'm not even sure it's me you wanna keep
And it's been ten days without you in my reach
And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep
But time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home
I've tried cutting the ropes and
And I let you go, but you're still the only one
That feels like home
You won't talk me into it next time
If I'm going away your hearts coming too
'Cos I miss your hands I miss your face
When I get back let's disappear without a trace
'Cos it's been ten days without you in my reach
And the only time I've touched you is in my sleep
But time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home
I've tried cutting the ropes
Tried letting go but you're still the only one
That feels like home
So tell me, did you really think...
Oh tell me, did you really think
I had gone when you couldn't see me anymore?
When you couldn't...
'Cos baby time has changed nothing at all -
You're still the only one that feels like home
And I've tried cutting the ropes
I let you go but you're still the only one
That feels like home
Yeah, you're still the only one that feels like home
You're still the only one I've gotta love
Oh yeah...Embed
