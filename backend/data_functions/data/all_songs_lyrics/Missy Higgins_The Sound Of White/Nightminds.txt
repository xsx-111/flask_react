Nightminds Lyrics
Just lay it all down
Put your face into my neck, and let it fall out
I know, I know, I know
I knew before you got home
This world you're in now
It doesn't have to be alone, I'll get there somehow
'Cos I know, I know, I know
When even springtime feels cold

But I will learn to breathe
This ugliness you see
So we can both be there
And we can both share the dark
And in our honesty
Together we will rise
Out of our nightminds
And into the light at the end of the fight

You were blessed by
A different kind of inner view, it's all magnified
The highs will make you fly
But the lows make you want to die
And I was once there
Hanging from that very ledge where you are standing
So I know, I know, I know
It's easier to let go


And in our honesty
Together we will rise out of our nightminds
And into the light at the end of the fightEmbed
