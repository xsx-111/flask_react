The Sound of White Lyrics
Like a freeze-dried rose
You will never be what you were, what you were
To me in memory
But if I listen to the dark
You'll embrace me like a star
Envelope me, envelope me

If things get real for me down here
Promise to take me to before you went away
If only for a day
If things get real for me down here
Promise to take me back to the tune we played
Before you went away

And if I listen to the sound of white
Sometimes I hear your smile and breathe your light
Yeah, if I listen to the sound of white
You're my mystery, one mystery
My mystery, one mystery

My silence solidifies
'Til that hollow void erases you, erases you
So I can't feel at all
But if I never feel again
At least that nothingness will end the painful dream
Of you and me
If things get real for me down here
Promise to take me to before you went away
If only for a day
If things get real for me down here
Promise to take me back to the tune we played
Before you went away

And if I listen to the sound of white
Sometimes I hear your smile and breathe your light
Yeah, if I listen to the sound of white
Sometimes I hear your smile and breathe your light
And if I listen to, the sound of white

I knelt before some stranger's face
But I'll never have the courage or belief to trust this place
But I dropped my head, 'cos it felt like lead
And I'm sure I felt your fingers through my hair

And if I listen to the sound of white
Sometimes I hear your smile and breathe your light
Yeah, if I listen to the sound of white
The sound of white
The sound of white
The sound of whiteEmbed
