Any Day Now LyricsHow long, how long, how long
Will we take to come undone?
If you know the answer tell me now
And I'll write up a calendar for our count down
'Cos what if what we see is all, is all we've got?

Say you've kept some fire aside
To set light to me some surprising night
And say you've locked some fire away
To set light to me some surprising day
Any day now...

How come, how come, how come
I'm now on a road holding out my thumb?
If you know my destination, please
Well, buy me the fastest car and throw me the keys
'Cos what if what we see is all, is all we've got?

Say you've kept some fire aside
To set light to me some surprising night
And say you've locked some fire away
To set light to me some surprising day
Any day now...
'Cos finger by finger we're losing grasp
And I'm questioning the reasons why nothing beautiful does last
Say you've kept some fire aside
To set light to me some surprising night
And say you've locked some fire away
To set light to me some surprising day
To me some surprising day
Any day now...Embed
