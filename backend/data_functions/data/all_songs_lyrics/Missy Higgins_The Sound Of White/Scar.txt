Scar Lyrics
He left a card, a bar of soap
And a scrubbing brush next to a note
That said, "Use these down to your bones"
And before I knew I had shiny skin
And it felt easy being clean like him
I thought "This one knows better than I do"

A triangle
Tryna squeeze through a circle
He tried to cut me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver;
The way things coulda gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar
When everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember
To never go that far
Could you leave me with a scar?

So the next one came with a bag of treats
She smelled like sugar and spoke like the sea
And she told me, "Don't trust them, trust me"
Then she pulled at my stitches one by one
Looked at my insides, clicking her tongue
And said, "This will all have to come undone"
A triangle
Tryna squeeze through a circle
She tried to blunt me so I'd fit

And doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver;
The way things coulda gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar
When everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember
To never go that far
Could you leave me with a scar?

I think I realised just in time
Although my old self was hard to find
You can bathe me in your finest wine
But I'll never give you mine
'Cause I'm a little bit tired of fearing that I'll be
The bad fruit nobody buys
Tell me, did you think we'd all dream the same?

And doesn't that sound familiar?
Doesn't that hit too close to home?
Doesn't that make you shiver;
The way things coulda gone?
And doesn't it feel peculiar
When everyone wants a little more?
And so that I do remember
To never go that far
Could you leave me with a scar?
Could you leave me with a scar?
Could you leave me with a scar?Embed
