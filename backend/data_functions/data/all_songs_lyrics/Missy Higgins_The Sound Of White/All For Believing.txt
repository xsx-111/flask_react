All For Believing Lyrics
Pull back the shield between us and I'll kiss you
Drop your defenses and come into my arms
I'm all for believing, I'm all for believing
I'm all for believing if you can reveal the true colours within

I know you blanket your mind so much that I am blind
But I, I see you've painted your soul into your guard
I'm all for believing, I'm all for believing

I need to know just how you feel, to comfort you
I need to find the key to let me in, into your heart
To find your soul

Pull back the shield between us and I'll kiss you
Drop your defenses and come into my arms

I'm all for believing if you can reveal the true colors within
An' say you will be there for me to hold
When the faith grows old and life turns cold
When the faith grows old and life turns cold
So if you're cold I will stay, maybe fate will guide the way
I believe in what I see and baby we were meant to be

(Baby we were meant to be)
Just believe
(I'm all for believing)
(Baby we were meant to be)
Just believe
(I'm all for believing)
(Baby we were meant to be)
Just believe, oh
Trust in meEmbed
