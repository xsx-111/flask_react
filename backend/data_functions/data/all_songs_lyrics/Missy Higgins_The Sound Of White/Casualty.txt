Casualty Lyrics
Give me my dream and give me a scene
Where you have a past of which you are clean
Oh, give me a lie
Tell me you fell 'cos of my grace
And not to help you erase her face
And oh, make it your best lie

'Cos I'm holding up a crystal glass, dove in my hands
And if it does fall
If you do fall, it's my fault

So I don't wanna be with one more casualty
'Cos all you're giving give me is pain
I'm not gonna be with one more casualty
'Cos all you see is a human bandage

Tell me I'd find you're happy inside
And if I end this you'll be fine
Oh, tell me a lie
Just look at me and say honestly
That I'm all you want, not what you need
And oh, make it your best lie, love


And I've been playing games
But now I've changed my ways
The character I always played
Helped me to forget my name
But now I know, so get out of my way...
'Cos I'm not gonna be one more casualty
It's been too long since I looked after me
 x2
Oh, I'm not gonna be with one more casualty
'Cos all you're giving me is pain
(All you seem to give me is your pain)
I'm not gonna be with one more casualty
'Cos all you see is a human bandage
(All you seem to give me is your pain)
I'm not gonna be, nah..
