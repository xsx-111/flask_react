This is How it Goes Lyrics
Suddenly I can't stay in this room
You'll never sway, and I have nothing left that I can think of to say
What do you want me to think of my thoughts?
Bear it in mind, if I cannot believe in me who will I then be?

So I'll run but not to far
In case you chase me, ohh

But this is how it goes, baby
I'll get angry at your words and I'll go home
And you won't call after me, yeah
'Cause I'll be back before you know, you know

So give me a toothful of that smile
And know-it-all eyes you show me just to prove that you don't need to lose it
You tell me I'm your fortress of desire
Ah, but is it a crime for me to say my own view and want then not to fear you?

So I'll run but not to far
In case you chase me, ohh
But this is how it goes, baby
I'll get angry at your words and I'll go home
And you won't call after me, yeah
'Cause I'll be back before you know, you know
Yeah, I'll be back before you know...

La-di da-di day, la-di da-di day do
La-di da-di day, la-di da-di day do
La-di da-di day, la-di da-di day do
La-di da-di day
Oh, la-di da-di day, la-di da-di day do
La-di da-di day
And so I'll run but not too far...

But this is how it goes, baby
I'll get angry at your words and I'll go home, yeah
And you won't call after me, yeah
'Cause I'll be back before you know, you know
Yeah, I'll be back before you know...

And so I'll run but not too far...Embed
