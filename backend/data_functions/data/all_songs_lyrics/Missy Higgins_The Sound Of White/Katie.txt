Katie LyricsKatie was a little girl who said, "I'll find a way"
Katie was a little girl who said, "It'll be okay"
Then one day she found a little bit of something she used to drown
She said "I'm alive and I am free
But you see I have control over me"

But will you draw the line?
Turn a blind eye to all the faces that you know?
And she said, "Go"

Katie was a little girl who never found the way
Katie was a little girl who never was okay
'Cause one day she found that little bit of something
She used to drown
And she said "I'm alive and I am free
But you see I have control over me"


She said, "I'm alive and I am free
But you see I have control over me"

But will you draw the line, yeah, yeah
Turn a blind eye to all the faces that you know
Yeah, will you draw the line, yeah, yeah
But she said, "Go"
And she said, "Go"
And she said..."Go"Embed
