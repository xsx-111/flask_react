The River Lyrics
She ran until her face was numb with cold
And wore a cotton gown that blazed the night untold
She ran until her feet refused to hold
So heavy a heart for someone merely ten years old

And when she reached the river her knees began to shiver
Her head with pounding voices from home
Behind her was a vision, a painful apparition
Of a darker world that no one should know

Somebody's bed will never be warm again
The river will keep this friend
The somebody's bed will never be warm again
No, never again

She dived beneath the water's icy skin
Hoping the cold would kill the smell of angry gin
And her eyes grew wider than they'd ever been
Just wishing the numbness to cut deeper with its pins

And as her body lay there she decided to stay there
Till darkness came to pull her away
And beautifully she sank as up-river was the bank
Where some bodiless troubles would stay
