Stuck in My Throat LyricsThese wars of words are pointless
Nothing gets accomplished, no
To see you bent and broken
You'd think I'd like it
But I don't
It disgusts me
That I can be
So petty and so weak
Yeah, You're sorry
Everyones always so sorry
Yeah
And I thought I heard you say
"To lose is not ok, win is the only way"
Guess what I did with my day
Well, I failed
Despite my reservations
I think it's time that we met, we met
And all these complications
Yeah they make me something i'm not
(This is a war)
You're kitten as a cat
I know where it's at
Yeah this is where it's at
Yeah
Yeah you're sorry
Everyone is always so sorry
Yeah
And I thought saw you stray
But I love you anyway
And I'd like us to be forever
That's what I tried to say
But it got stuck in my throat
And words are missing
Words are missing
Words are missing
Words are missing
Stuck in my throat
Now that I know it could only be you
I try to speak out
But the words are missing
Words are missingEmbed
