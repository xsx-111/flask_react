Wrong and Sorry LyricsWrong and sorry but i'm still pissed
And I don't want to know, if you still think
It's all my fault. Is it still my fault?
Yeh it's a shame, It's the shit when there's
No one to blame. I don't want answers or
Reasons now, It's not important now
Please come home
Your heart won't break
Please come home
Just for my sake
Tearing it down, All this guilt I've been
Dragging around, Comfy at last just to
Be myself, Same as everyone else
My pride and my love of
Material things are two steps away from
Being complete. I hope I'm never complete
Please come home
I'm still the same
Please come home
No grudge, No blame, And no painEmbed
