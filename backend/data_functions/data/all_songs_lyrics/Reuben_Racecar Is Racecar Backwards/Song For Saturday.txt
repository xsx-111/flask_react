Song For Saturday LyricsI've been finding out
All these conclusions that you come to
They're so paper thin
And I can see through
It's very excellent
Now that I'm better than you
I worked it out myself
Well someone has to
And then it happened
The whole city was up in arms
So give it a rest, yeah
I don't like it
It's very excellent
Now that I'm better than you
I worked it out myself
Song for Saturday
The threat of fear is always here
I keep you safe
I hold you near
The words you said
Become so clear
I'll raise my voice
So you can hear
My song
You can hear my song
You can hear my song
Yeah you can hear my song
My song for Saturday
I'll blame you anywayEmbed
