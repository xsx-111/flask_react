Oh the Shame LyricsStaring you out
Staring you out
And wearing you down
Yeah it's over now
We can talk about it
The smile in my eyes
Is a simple disguise
I have practised now
Finding my way around
The things that I've done
And who I've become
And oh the shame
I lie and I cheat
And I've turned down my dreams
Because I was too afraid
I wish that somehow
I could see now
All the faces I've betrayed
Two women in skin
All of my love
Oh this isn't something I usually do
That I'm proud of
I don't play enough
I'm taking the blame
And oh the shame
Oh the shame
Oh my god!
There it is
I said it
Yeah
It's just like wetting the bed
Shaving my head
And oh the shame...Embed
