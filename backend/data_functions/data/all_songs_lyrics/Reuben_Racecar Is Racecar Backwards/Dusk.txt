Dusk LyricsAn eventful year that it was
And if I'm still here it's because
The stars have gone out from behind your eyes
This pain is real this wound is life sized
And I can't believe it you need to pull through
And I hope you make it I'm waiting for you
So you are beginning to choke
But how can you not see the joke?
The sound of your voice still rings in my ears
It's tired and angry and quiet all these years
This situation it tears us apart
And we joke about it, we make jokes of ourselves!
But we know
But
But we know
But
But we know
But
But we knowEmbed
