Horrorshow LyricsThe rope round my neck
The streak in my hair
The spring in my step
From the socks that I wear
And when I play this song
It's like I'm still there
And you don't know what it means to me
Cos I try my best to be the best that I can
I want so much to be everybody's friend
Well if it's supposed to hurt
It hasn't done yet
The best of the few
That haven't been met
And the simplest thing could remind me of that
That soft-spoken lie
I'll never forget
Sing!
I try my best to be the best that I can
I want so much to be everybody's friend
Oh yeah, I try my best to be the best that I can
I try so hard to be everybody's friend
And I try
Yes I try
I want so much to be
It's in my heart to be
I try so hard to be
It's in my heart
I try my best
I try my best
And no, I don't sleep
I never rest
My aching heart
Is emptiest
When I'm alone
The way that I think
It seldom makes sense
The words don't come out
The way they were meant
So if I'm quiet
Please don't take offence
Cause you don't know what it means to me
No, you don't know what it means to me
No...Embed
