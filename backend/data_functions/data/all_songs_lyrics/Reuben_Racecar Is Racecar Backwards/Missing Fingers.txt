Missing Fingers LyricsWear something red and sexy
So I won't know it's you
It's been so long that I have
Forgotten what to do
Do I pick up the whole bill
Or split between the two
How will you ever see my scars?
Tourette's is a disease that makes you tell the truth
I have contracted it in the last days of my youth
What about those missing fingers
Think they've made lesser men
Grip hold of casted metal
Lets suck on our champagne
If I become a cripple what use will I be then
I can not even play guitar
Tourettes four letter words
Like life and love and lust
And at the base of it a thick layer of trust
Your wounded heart will heal if you don't let it rust
So love
And a little later
All of my thoughts
Are lost in the cross fire
And I'm tied in knots
Crossed my heart for you
But I got it all confused
What's a boy to do
Find it hard
Must be hard for you
Must it hard
Must be hard
I said it's hard
Must be hard
So much for that
So...
I'll let you goEmbed
