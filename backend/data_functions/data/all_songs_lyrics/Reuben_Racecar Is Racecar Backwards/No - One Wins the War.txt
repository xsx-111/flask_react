No - One Wins the War LyricsYou try my patience
I break your outer shell
It's inside, the sweetness
But you hide it so well
Hell Is For Heroes
They got another single out
My contemporaries
Top 40 smash - no doubt
In times of trouble
I am argumentative
And I know I'll suffer
For as long as I'm am
And at the first sign of an argument
The first sign of a fight...
I crack under pressure
And my head feels like it explodes
I won't get so angry
Just another one of my episodes
When I was younger
It seemed so obvious to me
With all my problems
War-like was how I had to be
But everything changes
And I find with least exception you
If everything changes
I guess that I do too
It's all lost now
So much has happened
And it's all a mess now
And all I've achieved
And to my shame
And to my discomfort
I (I have never) have never felt so relieved
That you will find me out
Yeah you will find me out
Yeah I'm ready!
At last I'm ready!
Yeah I'm ready!
Ready!Embed
