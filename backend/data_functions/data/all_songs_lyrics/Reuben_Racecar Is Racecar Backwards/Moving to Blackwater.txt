Moving to Blackwater LyricsHey you, talking sideways
I know you better than that
Got nothing to prove
So we've got nothing to loose
When the sand sinks straight to the bottom
And you forget that
I don't have all the answers
It's now or, it's never
This train won't wait forever
You see me, I'm laughing
It's not for, It's not for
Fun
It's not for fun
It's not for fun
And it feels like both boats are sinking
And I've got one foot in each
Should I abandon the plan?
Would any man understand?
And would I even make land if I swam?
Or just wash up on the beach
It's always out of reach and
My smile, is fragile
My heart is held together
With string and, sellotape
Be gentle please remember
With string and, sellotape
With string and, sellotape
With string and, sellotape
With string and, sellotape
Don't bleed, don't bruise
It's always, good news
Can't lose, can't lose
Don't bleed, don't bruise
It's always, good news
Can't lose, can't lose
I can't loseEmbed
