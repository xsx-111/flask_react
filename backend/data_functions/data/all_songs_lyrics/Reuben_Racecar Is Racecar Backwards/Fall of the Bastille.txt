Fall of the Bastille LyricsYou were left all by yourself
You were young what could you do?
The only girl you ever loved, stood up, abandoned you
And I'm pushing you
I'm shoving you
I wouldn't like to think that I was forcing you
Am I forcing you?
By pushing you?
Shoving you?
If you say "nothing left to lose"
Then you have not lost your voice
And if you've got the guts to choose
I will still give you the choice
You can fight, or you can fall
No one left to take the blame
One last chance to prove it all
And I just hope you don't fuck it up
Cause it's not too late to try
If you believe in anything
Pull the wool down from your eyes
Stop procrastinating
You can fight, or you can fall
No one left to pave the way
One last chance to prove it all
And I just hope you don't throw it away
When you called I was asleep
I'm unaware of any other impropriety
So act like you're on your own son
Cause one day you will be
And when you kick and when you scream
You will notice that I am not listening at all...
Because it's not too late to try
If you believe in anything
Pull the wool down from your eyes
Stop procrastinating
You can fight, or you can fall
No one left to take the blame
One last chance to prove it all
And I just hope you don't throw it away
And when this test is over
My arms begin to ache
It's too important
You can't be seen to break
And when this test is over
I will be your friend again
So just don't blow it
And do something stupid when
When all I wanted
Was not to have to hold your hand
And all I wanted
Was not to have to hold your hand
I don't, I don't careEmbed
