Our Song LyricsNo way I won't go
No way I don't show
Yeah I told you so
Yeah, I said no
All this smiling has become so meaningless
I refuse to play along
Cause I got bored of you
I am so bored
And I got bored of you
I am so bored
Shut my mouth I'm dumb
Close my mind I'm numb
Look what I've become
On my own
Always cruising for another big mistake
I'll make this one my own terms
Cause I got bored of you
I am so bored
Yeah I got bored of you
I am so fucking bored
Let's go!
Yeah, right!
Let's go!
Yeah!Embed
