Freddy Kreuger Lyrics
Well
This is, for my band
The ones who shared the struggle
The whining and the bitching
Sat on, my sofa
My friends all went to college
I still live in my dad's house!
Thinking, about it
And though you may regret it
You said it cause you meant it
Always, together
A touch of cabin fever
We find out how we really feel

(Girl) This girl that I'm so sick of
(Girl) This girl that I'm so sick of
(Girl) This girl that I'm so sick of
(Girl) This girl that I'm so sick of

When I, was fifteen
I swear it looked so easy
You go out and you get paid
Cut to, an LP
You slam it on the TV
And now its just another day down
And it's another month gone
God knows how many shows
Yeah we still keep moving on and on
But that's rock and roll I 'spose
Girl...
Girl...

This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of

My name is Freddy Kreuger
And I've got the elm street blues
I've got a hand like a knife rack
And I die in every film!
Yeah, yeah come on and!
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I'm so sick of
This girl that I don't loveEmbed
