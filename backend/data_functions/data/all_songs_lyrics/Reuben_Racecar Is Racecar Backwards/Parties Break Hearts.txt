Parties Break Hearts LyricsI got the situation under control
A little rubber and whole lot of soul
I see the girl who knows it's all rock and roll
And she'll be cryin' before it's over
And the word on everyone's lips is "oxygen"
And before I catch my breath it's time do drink and dance again
I like to hustle with the best of them all
From 54 right to the ugly bug ball
I party hardy, Marty, fit till I fall
I guess I'll see you when it's all over
I got some action and I'm ready to go
And I got a girlfriend but she don't gotta know, no
I'll take you down with me right after the show
And she'll be cryin' before it's over
And the word on everyone's lips is "oxygen"
And before I catch my breath it's time to drink and dance again
Said it's time to drink and dance again
And no mistake, you'll meet somebody new
They make the break it doesn't matter who
Stay awake is all I ever do... yeah, I'm watching you...PARTY!
And the word on everyone's lips is "oxygen"
And before I catch my breath it's time to drink and dance again
All of a sudden it feels like you are in love again and
Everything is outta sight but
The party will break your heart tonight
The party will break your heart tonight
The party will break your heart tonight
The party will break your heart tonightEmbed
