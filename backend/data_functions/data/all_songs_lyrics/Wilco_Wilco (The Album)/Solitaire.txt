Solitaire Lyrics
Once I thought the world was crazy
Everyone was sad and chasing
Happiness and love and
I was the only one above it

Once I thought without a doubt
I had it all figured out
Universe with hands unseen
I was cold as gasoline

Took too long to see
I was wrong to believe in me only

Once my life was a game so unfair
It beat me down and kept me there
Unaware of my naysayin'
Solitaire was all I was playing

Took too long to see
I was wrong to believe in me onlyEmbed
