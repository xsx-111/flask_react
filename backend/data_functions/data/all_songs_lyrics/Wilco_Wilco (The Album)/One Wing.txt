One Wing Lyrics
We once belonged to a bird
Who cast his shadow on this world
You were a blessing and I was a curse
I did my best not to make things worse for you

That isn't true
I always knew this would be our fate
This is what happens when wings separate
This happens, all dead weight, eventually

We may as well be made of stone
We can't be flown

One wing will never fly
Neither yours nor mine
I fear we can only wave goodbye

One wing will never ever fly
Neither yours nor mine
One wing will never ever fly, dear
Neither yours nor mine
I fear we can only wave goodbye
One wing will never ever fly, dear
Neither yours nor mine
I fear we can only wave goodbyeEmbed
