You and I Lyrics
You and I
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I
You and I

Me and you
What can we do
When the words we use sometimes
Are misconstrued
Well, I won't guess
What's coming next
I can't ever tell you
The deepest well I've ever fallen into

Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't wanna know
Oh, I don't need to know
Everything about you
Oh, I don't wanna know
And you don't need to know
That much about me
You and I
We might be strangers
However close we get sometimes
It's like we never met
But you and I
I think we can take it
All the good with the bad
Make something that no one else has but

You and I
