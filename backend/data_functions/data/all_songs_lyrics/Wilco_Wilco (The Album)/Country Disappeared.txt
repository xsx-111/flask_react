Country Disappeared Lyrics
Wake up, we're here
It's so much worse than we feared
There's nothing left here
The country has disappeared
The winter trees bleeding, leave red blood
The summer sweet dreaming, April blush
But none of that is ever gonna mean
As much to me again

Hold out your hand
So much you don't understand
So stick as close as you can
All of the best laid plans
You've got the white clouds hanging so high above you
You've got the helicopters dangling, angling to shoot
The shots to feed the hungry
Weekend news crew anchorman

So every evening we can watch from above
Crushed cities like a bug
Fold ourselves into each others guts
Turn our faces up to the sun

I won't take no
I won't let you go
All by yourself
Oh no, you need my help
When the cold night shakes you like a chandelier
The snowflakes break through the atmosphere
And melt on the blue breath of the auctioneers
And disappear

So every evening we can watch from above
Crushed cities like a bug
Fold ourselves into each others blood
And turn our faces up to the sunEmbed
