Bull Black Nova Lyrics
It's in my hair, it's on my clothes
It's in the river, over the road
It's shining down, my angry star
Hanging off the hood of my car
I'm not going far
Not going far

It's coming down, they're coming up the shoulders
What have they found? I wonder if they know
I'm in a bull black Chevy Nova
Silhouetted by the setting sun
This can't be undone
This can't be undone

If I'm the one, blood on the sofa
Blood in the sink, blood in the trunk
High at the wheel of a bull black Nova
And I'm sorry as a setting sun
This can't be undone
Can't be outrun

It's in my hair, there's blood in the sink
I can't calm down, I can't think
I keep calling, there's blood in the trunk
I can't calm down
I freak out
Black outEmbed
