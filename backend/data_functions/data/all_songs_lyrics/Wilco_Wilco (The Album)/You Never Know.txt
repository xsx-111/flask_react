You Never Know Lyrics
Come on, children, you're acting like children
Every generation thinks it's the end of the world
All you fat followers get fit fast
Every generation thinks it's the last
Thinks it's the end of the world

It's a dream down a well
It's a lone heavy hell
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore

It's a fear we transcend
That we're here at the end
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
You never know

Come on, kids, you're acting like children
Act your age
Get back to black metals and pearls
Oh, all you sword swallowers, pull yourselves together
Every generation thinks it's the worst
Thinks it's the end of the world
It's a secret I can't tell
It's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore

It's a long heavy hell
Synthesizer Patel
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
But you never know
You never know

I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
It's a secret I can't tell
It's a wish down a well
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
It's a fear to transcend if we're here at the end
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
I don't care anymore, I don't care anymore
But you never know
Oh, you never knowEmbed
