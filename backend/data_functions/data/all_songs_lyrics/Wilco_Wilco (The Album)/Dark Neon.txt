Dark Neon LyricsI was sitting safely, across the road
From a rusting scaffolding, picking my nose
When a bird spoke up from high on that dark neon
He said, "I bet theres some things that you should come clean of"
Ohhhh I didn’t know
Ohh where to begin
Like you dont not know
Ohh I set the emotion
I was beating up babies, babies I mean
That don’t look like babies, but they’re babies to me
I was looking around for my very own best friend
Couldn’t help feeling things would come to an end
I always let you go
And then you let me back in
This is a status quo
Oh nobody wins
I was feeling sorry
So sorry for myself
I was trying to take it easy, but that wasn’t helping
Birds spoke up, this time I think it was a dove
He said I bet theres some things that you should come clean of
Ohhh that’s so its so
Oh you look through my skin
Ohhh how did he know
Oh and what was he in
Keep fooling myself
I keep fooling myself
I keep fooling myself
I keep fooling myself
I might need your help
I keep fooling myself
I might need your help
I can't just keep fooling myself
I oughta let you go
Hun you let me back in
It’s the status quo
Nobody wins
Ohhhh!Embed
