Wilco (The Song) Lyrics
Are you under the impression
This isn't your life?
Do you dabble in depression?
Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh, this is a fact that you need to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wilco
Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

Are times getting tough?
Are the roads you travel rough?
Have you had enough of the old?
Tired of being exposed to the cold?
The stare of your stereo
Put on your headphones before you explode
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Wilco
Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby
There's so many wars that just can't be won
Even before the battle's begun
This is an aural arms open wide
A sonic shoulder for you to cry on

Wilco
Wilco will love you, baby

Is someone twisting a knife in your back?
Are you being attacked?
Oh this is a fact that you need to know
Oh

Wilco
Wilco
Wilco
Wilco will love you, babyEmbed
