Sonny Feeling Lyrics
I was on my way home
From high school
I stuck at the crossing
I dug in for a duel
But at the last moment
I buried the brakes
My life split in two directions
Into two separate fates

I got on the last flight
To Amsterdam
But couldn't hit the runway
So we took off again
Aw, there's no need to worry
The captain cut in
The winds are less angry
Over in Berlin

You know it's true
The other shoe
It waits for you
What can you do?
Remember to show gratitude
The darkest night is nothing new
Sonny's got a problem
All the mini-mart clerks know
She knows nothing of Eminem's
Suburban gangster flow
Oh, maybe it's random
How each moment unfolds
It didn't feel like the wrong time or place
Until they cut off her clothes

A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away

I'm on my way home
From my high school
I'm always contemplating
Why the kids are still cruel
Oh, the kids are still cruel

A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
A sonny feeling is taken away
Some of the feeling gets taken awayEmbed
