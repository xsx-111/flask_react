Krisco Kisses Lyrics
Blow me (alongside indistinct chatter)
Blow me! (more indistinct chatter)
Blow me!
Ok, give us a blow!
Hunger! Hunger!
I love that thunder, yeah
Hunger! Hunger!
You feed my hunger, yeah
Hunger! Hunger!
Yeah
Take it to the top my love
Let's take it to the top
With a fist way past the wrist
Take it to the top
You fit me like a glove, my love
You fit me like a glove
Kick right back now, be-bop
Take it to the top my love
Krisco kisses (kisses!)
Never misses (misses!)
Krisco kisses (kisses!)
You can take it take it up, up and up
Hunger! Hunger!
I love that thunder, yeah
Hunger! Hunger!
You feed my hunger, yeah
Hunger! Hunger!
Yeah
Take it to the top my love
Let's take it to the top
With a fist way past the wrist
Take it to the top
You fit me like a glove my love
My little puppet glove
Kick right back now, be-bop
Take it to the top, my love, yeah
Krisco kisses (kisses!)
Never misses (misses!)
Krisco kisses (kisses!)
You can take it, take it up, up and up
Ah... higher, higher
Our love like thunder
You feed my hunger, yeah
Higher... uh! Higher
Our love like thunder
You feed my hunger, yeah
Hunger! Hunger!

Be my glove, my love. Yeah, be my glove!
Be my glove, my love. Yeah, be my glove!
You fit me like a glove, my love

Never misses (misses!)
Krisco kisses (kisses!)
You can take it take it up, up and up
