The Ballad of 32 Lyrics*horns playing 'cavalry charge!' / oncoming car noises*
Oh no, it's the lads!
*car crash noises*
Well... it was the lads
Off the serious stuff, let's get to some heavy hoofin' about, then
*assorted female laughs and moans including 'come on' & 'push'*
(in background) These guys make me sickEmbed
