Born to Run LyricsHA!
In the day we sweat it out
On the streets of a runaway American dream
At night we ride through mansions of glory
In suicide machines
Sprung from cages on Highway 9
Chrome-wheeled, fuel-injected
And steppin' out over the line
Oh, baby this town rips the bones from your back
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap
We gotta get out while we're young
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend
I wanna guard your dreams and visions
Just wrap your legs 'round these velvet hips
And strap your hands 'cross my engines
Together we could break this trap
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back
Oh, will you walk with me out on the wire
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider
But I gotta know how it feels
I wanna know your love is wild
Girl, I wanna know that love is real
Beyond the palace hemi-powered drones
Scream down the boulevard
Girls comb their hair in review mirrors
And the boys try to look so hard
The amusement park rises bold and stark
And kids are huddled on the beach in the mist
I wanna die with you Wendy on the streets tonight
In an everlasting kiss
Uh, uh, uh, UH!
Highway's jammed with broken heroes
On a last-chance power drive
Everybody's out on the road tonight
But there's no place left to hide
Together Wendy we can live with the sadness
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul
Oh, someday girl I don't know when
We're gonna get to that place where really wanna go
And we'll walk in the sun
But till then, baby we were born to run
Baby we were born to run
Tramps like us, baby we were born to run
Whoa, ooh
Born to runEmbed
