Relax Lyrics
Mi-i-ine
Give it to you one time, now
We-ell
Whoa
We-ell, now

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Come on
Ohhh
But shoot it in the right direction
Make makin' it your intention (Ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Live those dreams
Scheme those schemes
Got to hit me (Hit me!)
Hit me (Hit me!)
Hit me with those laser beams
Ow ow ow!
Laser beam me
1, 2

Relax
Don't do it
Relax
When you want to come
Come, uhh! Woo!
Ow ow ow ow ow ow uh!
I'm coming
I'm coming-yeah

Relax, don't do it (Once you're inside of me)
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
When you want to come
Relax, don't do it
When you want to suck it, chew it
Relax, don't do it, no!
When you want to come
When you want to come
When you want to come
Come! Huh! Ow ow ow ow! Woooo! Ow ow ow yeah
The scene of love, feel it

Relax, don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax, don't do it
Ow ow yeah
Relax don't do it
When you want to go to it
Relax don't do it

Now's the time, it's party time (Hey!)
Come!14Embed
