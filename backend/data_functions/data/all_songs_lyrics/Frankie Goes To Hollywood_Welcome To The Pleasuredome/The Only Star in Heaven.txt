The Only Star in Heaven LyricsEnjoy it or get out the game
It’s such a shame to lose again
So use your brain and play it sane
It’s just a game that I love playin'
And when I call you on the phone
Then show me that you’re really home
Let’s share this thing and I will sing
Live life like a diamond ring
I can tell you something
(Shoot shark)
That you ought to know
Building up my feelings
(Shoot shark)
Go to let it show, show, show
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
(Fish)
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
(Shark)
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
(Fish)
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
Shark
Get hot, red hot
Everybody create, create your fate
Everybody create, before it’s too late
Live life like a diamond ring
Live life like a diamond ring
Everybody create, create your fate
Everybody create, before it’s too late
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
(Fish)
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
(Shark)
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
(Fish)
Got to shake your tail to make a wave
Shark
(You’re the only star in heaven)
(You’re the only star that shines)
(You’re the only star in heaven)
(Now that only star is mine)
Flame
On my way to Hollywood
And this is how we get there
And this is how we get there
Love
(Love)
You got to fan the flame
(The flame burns hot)
You got to fan the flame
(The flame burns hot)
You got to fan the flame
Called love
(Love)
Space is the place
Let me out
Space is the place
Let me out
Space is the place called love
(Love)
You’re the only star in heaven
You’re the only star that shines
You’re the only star in heaven
Now I know that star is mine
You’re the only star in heaven
You’re the only star that shines
You’re the only star in heaven
Now I know that star is mine
Flame
(This is how we get there)
On my way to Hollywood
This is how we get there
This is how we get there
Love
Space is the place
Fan the flame
Space is the place
For love
(Love)
You’re the only star in heaven
You’re the only star that shines
Let me out
You’re the only star in heaven
Now I know that star is mine
(You’re the only star in heaven)
(You’re the only star that shines)
(You’re the only star in heaven)
(Now I know that star is mine)
(You’re the only star in heaven)
(You’re the only star that shines)
(You’re the only star in heaven)
(Now I know that star is mine)1Embed
