War Lyrics
Oh no
There's got to be a better way
Say it again
There's got to be a better way
Yeah
What is it good for?
War!

Man has a sense for the discovery of beauty. How rich is the world for one who makes use of this discovery. Beauty must have power over men. (War!) After the end of the war I want to devote myself to my thoughts for five to ten years, and to writing them down

War has caused unrest among the younger generation
Induction then destruction. Who wants to die?

Wars come and go. What remains are only the values of culture.(Yeah...) Then, of course, there is revolutionary love. Love of comrades fighting for the people, and love of people. Not an abstract people, but people one meets and works with. When Che Guevara taught of love being at the center of revolutionary endeavor, he meant both. For people like Che or George Jackson or Malcolm X, love was the prime mover of their struggle and love cost them their lives. Love coupled with a man's pride. Love coupled with a man's pride

(Give it to you one time, now. Now.)
War, I despise 'cos it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers how
When their sons go off to fight and lose their lives, I said
War, huh! Good God y'all
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin'
Say it again
War, huh! Whoa, Lord
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin'
Listen to me
War! It ain't nothing but a heart breaker
War! Friend only to the undertaker
War! War! War! Huh! Yeah. War!
War, huh!
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin'
Say it
War, huh! Good God, now
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothin'
Say it! War!
Oh no
There's got to be a better way
Say it again
There's got to be a better way
Yeah
What is it good for?
War, huh! He-ey!
What is it good for?Embed
