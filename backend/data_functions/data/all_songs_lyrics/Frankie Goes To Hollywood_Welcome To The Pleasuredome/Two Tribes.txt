Two Tribes LyricsYeah..
Ha!
When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score
Score no more! Score no more!
When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score
Working for the black gas
Cowboy No. 1
A born-again poor man's son
Poor man's son
On the air America
I modeled shirts by Van Heusen
Working for the black gas
Yeah..
You know..
When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score
Score no more! Score no more!
When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score
Working for the black gas
Switch off your shield
Switch off and feel
I'm working on loving, yeah. Yow
Giving you back the good times
Ship it out, out!
Working for the black gas
A point is all that you can score
When two tribes go to war
When two tribes go to war
A point is all that you can score
We've got two tribes
We got the bomb! We got the bomb! Yeah! Yeah..
Sock it to me biscuits, now
Are we living in a land where sex and horror are the new Gods?
Yeah
When two tribes go to war (ow! ow! ow!)
A point is all you can score1Embed
