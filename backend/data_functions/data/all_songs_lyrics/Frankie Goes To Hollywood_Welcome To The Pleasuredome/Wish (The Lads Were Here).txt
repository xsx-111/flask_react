Wish (The Lads Were Here) LyricsYou talking to me buddy?
Way-ha way-ha whoa
Now
I’m out on the street
And I dance to the beat of the cheer
I’m on the road and it’s so nice
To meet you, meet you
Wait
Love is on the run
Wish you were here
My love has got a gun
Wish you were here, here
The people I meet they all repeat
Wish you were here
Dance to the beat, move your feet on the street
You were here
Wait
Love is on the run
Wish you were here
My love has got a gun
Wish you were here, here
Wait
Way-ha way-ha whoa
Oh!
Throw it down, the gauntlet of love
Throw it down, heaven’s above
Throw it down, the glove of love
Throw it down, glory of love
Come here while I talk t'you baby
Come here while I drop (drop!)
Come here while I talk t'you baby
Come here while I drop (drop!)
Dance until it’s time to stop
When you fall I’m going to pick you up
Throw it down
The gauntlet of love
Throw it down, heaven’s above
Throw it down, the glove of love
Throw it down, glory of love
Glory of love
Way-ha way-ha whoa
I’m out on the street (street!)
Dance to the beat of the cheers
I’m on the road and it’s so nice, so nice
Nice, yeah
Love is on the run
Wish you were here
My love has got a gun
Wish you were here, hereEmbed
