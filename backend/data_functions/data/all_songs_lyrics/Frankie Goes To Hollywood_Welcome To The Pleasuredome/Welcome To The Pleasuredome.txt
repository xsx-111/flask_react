Welcome To The Pleasuredome LyricsLife goes on day after day after day after day after day after...
Welcome to the pleasure dome
Welcome to the pleasure dome
Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha!
Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha!
Ha!
The animals are winding me up
The jungle call, the jungle call
Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha! Who-ha!
In Xanadu did Kublai Khan a pleasuredome erect
Moving on, keep moving on, yeah
Moving at one million miles an hour
Using my power, I sell it by the hour
I have it so I market it
You really can't afford it, yeah, really can't afford it
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova. What a pushover, yeah
There goes a supernova. What a pushover
We're a long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasuredome
On our way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
Welcome to the Pleasuredome
Moving on, keep moving on
I will give you diamonds by the shower
Love your body even when it's old
Do it just as only I can do it
And never ever doing what I'm told
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova. What a pushover, yeah
There goes a supernova. What a pushover
We're a long way from home
Welcome to the pleasuredome
On our way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
Welcome to the pleasuredome
Keep moving on
Got to reach the top, don't stop
Pay love and life, oh my
Keep moving on, yeah
Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova. What a pushover
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova. What a pushover, yeah
There goes a supernova
Who-ha! Who-ha!
Welcome to the pleasuredome
Who-ha! Who-ha!
Going home where lovers roam
Welcome to the pleasuredome
Erect!
Who-ha! Who-ha!
The war is won
Who-ha! Who-ha!
The war is won
Boy! Boy! Boy!
Keep moving on
Got to reach the top, don't stop
Pay love and life, oh my
Keep moving on, yeah
Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop
Shooting stars never stop. Who-ha! Who-ha!
There goes a supernova. Who-ha! Who-ha!
What a pushover
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
Shooting stars never stop even when they reach the top
There goes a supernova. What a pushover
There goes a supernova. What a pushover, yeah!

We're a long way from home
Welcome to the pleasuredome
On our way home
Going home where lovers roam
Long way from home
