Black Night White Light LyricsWe are the leaders and nothing can beat us
It feels so good, the angels can take you there
You better beware of devil may care
Tell me where you want to go
(We are the leaders)
Heaven's above and Hell's below
(We are the leaders)
Oh sing hallelujah
(Sing hallelujah)
Giving it to you
(We are the leaders)
Black night white light
The other side of midnight
The pleasure seekers are dyin' to meet you
They need young blood, the devil may take you there
You better take care, he's everywhere
Tell me where you want to go
(We are the leaders)
Heaven's above and Hell's below
(We are the leaders)
Oh sing hallelujah
(Sing hallelujah)
Giving it to you
(We are the leaders)
Chasing the dragon
Get off that wagon boy, yeah
Rub your body up
Rope it up
Soak it up
Got to get on up
Throw it up
Show it up
Ye-eah!
Black night white light
The other side of midnight
Black night white light
The other side of midnight
We're on a journey into the light
It feels so good, your mind can take you there
But why does it go your body and soul
Your body and soulEmbed
