Whips And Furs LyricsDance to the music, dance to the music
Dance to the music, dance to the music
'Cos if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and on
He drives a black Cadillac, whips and furs in the back
He drives a black Cadillac, whips and furs in the back
An' if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and on
You can take a chance on love, one more dance on love
You can take a chance on love, one more dance on love
'Cos if you dance to the music
The night will last, the night will last
The night will go on and onEmbed
