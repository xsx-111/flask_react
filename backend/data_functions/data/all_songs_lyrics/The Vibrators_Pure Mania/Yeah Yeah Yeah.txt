Yeah Yeah Yeah Lyrics(Chorus:)
Yeah Yeah Yeah (x4)
Listen honey hear what I say
I give you my love an' then you throw it away
Well -
(Chorus)
Hey baby it's always the same
You kiss my body then you kick in my brain
Well -
(Chorus)
Money honey that hurts
Money honey that hurts
Money honey your causin' me pain
I don't know why you do it but you're doin' it again
Well -
(Hey watch that guitar)
(Chorus)Embed
