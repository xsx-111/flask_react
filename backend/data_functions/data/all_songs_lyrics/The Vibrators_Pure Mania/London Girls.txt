London Girls LyricsCome on honey
I wanna see you tonight
I say no one can be as pretty
Cuz your a better sight
?
With those flexy eyes
I don't need no supermarket
To make me feel alright
London girls are getting me down
Just can't seem to see them run around
Used to be this ? on need
I can't spend my life out on the street
So come on honey
I need a little girl
I think my hands are shaky
And my heads in a whirl
Well i could use a little money
?
Ill give you no funny stories
Id rather wanna see you
London girls are getting me down
Just can't seem to see them run around
Used to be this ? on need
I can't spent my life out on the streets
Yea, sometimes I think that ill love you
And, sometimes I think that ill need you
And, sometimes I don't want you around at all
And, sometimes I just wanna talk with you
And, sometimes I just wanna walk with you
And, sometimes I don't want you to callEmbed
