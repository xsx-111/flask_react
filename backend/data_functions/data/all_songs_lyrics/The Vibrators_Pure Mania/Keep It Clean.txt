Keep It Clean Lyrics1. Cocaine, heroin
I never use speed, I never put the needle in
Bad sex, heavy debts
It's too late to run when they come and snap your legs
Br: Just 'cos they do it in the movies
Doesn't mean to say that it's cool
It's only bits of plastic
Lies projected on the wall
2. Razor blades, guns and chains
You'll never get to heaven if you're gonna play those games
I do believe
If you keep it clean then you got to succeed
Ref: An' if you wanna get on, you gotta keep your business clean. x4
