I Need A Slave Lyrics(Verse 1:)
Well I'm getting hung up
With all this hangin' around
I'm gettin' tied up
When I wanna be tyin' it down
It always goes wrong
Can't seem to get it right
Yeah come on girl
I need a slave tonight
(Chorus:)
I need a slave tonight (x3)
(Verse 2:)
Well I'm gettin' freaked out
With all this hangin' about
I'm lookin' for some action
Can't seem to get no connection
Put some chains on you honey
I'm gonna pull 'em up real tight
Yeah c'mon child
I need a slave tonight
(Chorus:)
I need a slave tonight (x3)
(Mid 8:)
Well all your bondage magazines
They're gettin' me frustrated
Come on girl
I wanna see you naked
(Chorus:) (lines x4)Embed
