No Heart LyricsEven though she's got a heart of stone
But she's a working in this whole goddamn town
She makes me feel like I'm really coming down
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, she ain't got no heart
And no love
Well, hard day out, working at the mill
When I come in I'm feeling pretty ill
"Kiss me, Honey" is what I said
She wanna watch television instead!
You know...
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, she ain't got no heart
And no love
And no heart, or no feelings, or no love
And no heart, or no feelings, or no love
Aww, come on!
Well, sometimes I think that my mind's engulfed
This life's been taken out of a freak show
Never comes eight o'clock, any day 
I'm gonna send her off to heaven with my thirty eight!
I go...
Ooo, ooo, ooo
Ooo, she we ain't got no heart!
And no love
And no heart, or no feelings, or no love
And no heart, or no feelings, or no love
And no heart, or no feelings, or no love
And no heart, or no feelings, or no love
Ain't got no heart 1Embed
