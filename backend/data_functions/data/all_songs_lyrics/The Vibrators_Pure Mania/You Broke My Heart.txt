You Broke My Heart LyricsYou broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Oh yes you did now!
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh yeh-yeh yeh yeh
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh yeh-yeh yeh yeh
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh aaww Yes you did now!
I don't know why it is that you drive me crazy
I don't know why it is you do those things that you do to me!
And
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh yeh-yeh yeh yeh
You broke my heart OH, you broke my heart
Aaww Yes you did now!
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh yeh-yeh yeh yeh
I don't know why it is that you drive me crazy
I don't know why it is you do those things that you do to me!
And
Oh - you are always on my mind
And
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh yeh-yeh yeh yeh (oh yes you did now!) (Repeat several times)
(Fake ending)
You broke my heart into little tiny pieces
Yeh-yeh yeh-yeh yeh yeh (oh yes you did now!) (Repeat 3 times)Embed
