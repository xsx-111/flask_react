Baby Baby Lyrics
Mmm, you're so pretty
Not to talk to you would be a crime
Ah, let me put my arms around you
Just wanna use up a little of your time
And I'm goin'

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you be my girl

Aah, your eyes are so pretty
And the clothes you wear, they're so fine
Ah, won't you come around to my place
Just wanna use up a little of your time
And I'm goin'

Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you be my girl
Ah, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Baby, baby, baby (ah, c'mon)
Won't you be my girl (yeah, c'mon, girl)
Baby, baby, baby (ah, c'mon girl)
Won't you be mine (yeah, c'mon, c'mon)
Baby, baby, baby (yeah, c'mon)
Won't you be my girl (oh, you got me)
Baby, baby, baby
Won't you be my girl (ah, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Baby, baby, baby (ah, c'mon)
Won't you be my girl (ah, c'mon)
Baby, baby, baby (c'mon, c'mon)
Won't you be my
Baby, baby, baby (c'mon, c'mon)
Won't you be my girl (yeah, c'mon)
Baby, baby, baby (ah, c'mon, yeah)
Won't you be my girl (oh)1Embed
