Wrecked On You LyricsWhat you're looking for honey is a bit of stick
You'd better knock it off or you'll get a fat lip
Sure like to give Jesus a try
But always turn into a monster an' make you cry
(I'm gettin')
Wrecked on you, whoo whoo 
Wrecked on you
Well the way you carry on well it just ain't fair
You really freak me out in your black underwear
Don't care honey where you've been
Get may hands on you, do somethin' obscene
(I'm gettin')
Wrecked on you, whoo whoo 
Wrecked on you
Don't do this, don't do that
You got me so messed up I don't know where I'm at
But I'm givin' you some new information
Leavin' you child for another destination
Ain't gonna read no intellectual shit tonight
Gonna get some horror stories, wanna die of fright
Tell you man I'm gonna blow a fuse
I gotta rock 'n' roll lady who's really bad news
(I'm gettin')
Wrecked on you, whoo whoo 
Wrecked on youEmbed
