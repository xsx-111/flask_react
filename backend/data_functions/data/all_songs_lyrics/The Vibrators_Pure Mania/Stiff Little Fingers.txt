Stiff Little Fingers LyricsHangs a naked light over your face shines electric ness upon your bed
If it wasn't for your stiff little fingers nobody would know you were dead
You never really did much living you mainly sat and watched your TV
I think it had you on remote control ticking over nicely
But you screwed up this time now you got to start from the bottom again
It's a serious game when you got to start from the bottom again
I want to be dead the optician said 20 20 but you stumbled round like you were blind
You never saw beyond your own 4 walls it's a shame you never saw the light
But you screwed up this time now you got to start from the bottom again
It's a serious game when you got to start from the bottom again
When you got to start from the bottom again
When you got to start from the bottom again
When you got to start from the bottom again
I'm gonna start nowEmbed
