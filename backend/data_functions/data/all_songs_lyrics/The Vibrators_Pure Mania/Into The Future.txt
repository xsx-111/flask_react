Into The Future LyricsI want a new world, I want it with you
Want your new love, to see me through
So honey don't you stand and stare
I like your clothes and I like your hair
You're pretty messed up for only 23
So honey won't you come along with me
And if you've some time to spare
Take my hand and take me there
And I want it for my baby
I want it for myself
Don't you help me mister
If I can't help myself
Into the future. (SEX KICK)
I want it for my baby (SEX KICK)
I don't wanna be a rich man (SEX KICK)
So dont you be a pain in the ass (SEX KICK)
I never liked your blonde hair anyway
Hang on here comes that feeling again
You're so dumb your mother thinks you're insane
So honey if you've an hour to spare
Honey take my hand and take me there
Into the future (SEX KICK)
I want it for my baby (SEX KICK)
I wanna be a rich man (SEX KICK)
So honey don't be a pain in the ass (SEX KICK)
Gonna be a new world (SEX KICK)
I'm looking for a cheap thrill (SEX KICK)
I'll build a new tomorrow (SEX KICK)
So don't you be a pain in the ass (SEX KICK)
SEX KICK
SEX KICK
SEX KICK
