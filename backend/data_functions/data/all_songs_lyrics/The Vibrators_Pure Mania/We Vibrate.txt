We Vibrate LyricsWell I know a girl yeah she's mighty fine
We go in clubs all the time
An when we're there, we dance the night away
We don't stomp, mash potato or sway
We vibrate
Vibrate together, vibrate
Stamp our shoe leather, vibrate
Tear at the tether
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
We hit the floor, they all stand back
We start to vibrate and the floor starts to crack
Well by the second verse they're all joining in
We don't to the hustle, hully gully or swim
We vibrate
Vibrate together, vibrate
Stamp our shoe leather, vibrate
Tear at the tether
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
Vibrate
Well there's some people tell you what you gotta do do
Release your spine, kick off your shoes
Oh take your muscles into overdrive
But don't you bother
But don't you bother
But don't you bother to bop or jive -
We vibrate
Vibrate together, vibrate
Stamp our shoe leather, vibrate
Tear at the tether
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
C'mon everybody let's vibrate together
