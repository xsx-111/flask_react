Bad Time Lyrics
Well, I've been havin' a bad time
Since I was twenty-two
I never had a chance in life
Used to get trodden on in school
Well, now things are different
Ain't it funny how it can change?
I've been havin' a good time
Since I've become deranged
Gonna give you a

Bad time, honey
Treat you any way I choose
Bad time, honey
To make up for those days at school

Well, I've been havin' a bad time
Since you found out how to be cruel
I never had a chance at all
Since I've been hangin' 'round with you
But now things are different
Ain't it funny how it can change?
I've been havin' a good time
Since I've become deranged
Gonna give you a
Bad time, honey
Treat you any way I choose
Bad time, honey
To make up for those days at school
Ah, c'mon


Bad time, honey
Treat you any way I choose
Bad time, honey
To make up for those days at school
Bad time, honey
Treat you any way I choose
Bad time, honey
To make up for those days at schoolEmbed
