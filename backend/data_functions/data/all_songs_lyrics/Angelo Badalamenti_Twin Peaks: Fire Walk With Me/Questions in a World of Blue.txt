Questions in a World of Blue Lyrics
Why did you go?
Why did you turn away from me?
When all the world seemed to sing
Why, why did you go?
Was it me? Was it you?
Questions in a world of blue

How can a heart
That's filled with love start to cry?
When all the world seemed so right
How, how can love die?
Was it me? Was it you?
Questions in a world of blue

When did the day
With all its light turn into night?
When all the world seemed to sing
Why, why did you go?
Was it me? Was it you?
