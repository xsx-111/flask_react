Golden Hair LyricsLean out your window, golden hair
I heard you singing in the midnight air
My book is closed, I read no more
Watching the fire dance on the floor
I've left my book, I've left my room
For I heard you singing through the gloom
Singing and singing a merry air
Lean out of the window, golden hair1Embed
