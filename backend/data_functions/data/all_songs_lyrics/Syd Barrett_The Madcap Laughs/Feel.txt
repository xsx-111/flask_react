Feel LyricsYou feel me
Away far too empty, oh so alone!
I want to go home
Oh find me inside of a nocturne - the blonde
How I love you to be by my side
They wail...
The crowd on her side
She straggled a bridge by the water...
She misses her crawl
Far ley grew
Heady aside in a dell
Inside an eye be the lonely one, my bride
How I leave on the waddling wheel
They flail...
A gasp shringing
A bad bell's ringing
The angel - the daughter...
You feel me
Away far too empty, oh so alone!
I want to come home
Oh find me inside of a nocturne - the blonde
How I love you to be by my side
They wail...
The crowd on her side
She straggled a bridge by the water...Embed
