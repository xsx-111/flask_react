Here I Go LyricsThis is a story about a girl that I knew
She didn't like my songs and that made me feel blue
She said, "A big band is far better than you"
She don't rock 'n' roll, she don't like it
She don't do the stroll, well she don't do it right
Well everything's wrong and my patience was gone
When I woke one morning and remembered this song
Kinda catchy
I hope that she will talk to me now and even allow me
To hold her hand and forget that old band
I strolled around to her pad
Her light was off and that's bad
Her sister said that my girl was gone
"But come inside boy, and play, play, play me a song"
I said, "Yeah" here I go
She's kinda cute don't you know
That after awhile of seeing her smile
I knew we could make it and make it in style
So now I've got all I need
She and I are in love, we've agreed
She likes this song and my others too
So now you see my world is
'Cause of this tune what a boon this tune
I tell you soon we'll be lying in bed, happily wed
And I won't think of that girl or what she said5Embed
