Judy Lyrics
I never thought dreams could happen
Until one came true for me

Since I met Judy
Since I met Judy
Oh, my life has been one sweet melody
Yeah, yeah

I never thought I could welcome
Two other hearts as I do

Oh, since I met Judy
Since I met Judy
Well, it's been a real hip thing, I'm telling you
Oh, I'm saying that I want Judy

Talking 'bout beauty
She's got it, I know she's got it
And her sweet little ways
Mean so much to me, oh yeah, yeah
I make it my duty to love her, got her, got her, yeah, yeah
I'm gonna keep her right here with me, yeah, yeah
Now I find it hard to believe that I'm happy, yeah
And all my pains and heartaches are long gone, so glad I can tell the world

Since I met Judy
Since I met Judy
Well, my life has been one sweet song
And I won't be worried long, and
If you think I'm gonna leave her, man, you're wrong

It's only Judy, I'm telling you you're wrong
'Cause I love Judy, yeah
I'm crazy 'bout Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy
Judy, oh, what a woman, what a woman3Embed
