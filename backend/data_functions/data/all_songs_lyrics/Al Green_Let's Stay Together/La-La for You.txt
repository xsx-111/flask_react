La-La for You Lyrics
You made me see the good in loving me
Then you turn around and shamed my name
And all I can say is la-la-la
For you, baby (Good for you), listen here
It's for sure that I'm a man
Take the bread out of my hand
Now you wanna know how strong I am, all I can say is
La, la, la, la, for you, baby (Yeah)
What's the use of giving out (Giving out) giving in? (Giving in)
It's just as bad as sin

Ooh, baby, come what may, oh, yeah

It's for sure that I'm a man
Take the bread out of my hand
Now you wanna know (Wanna know) how strong I am, hey
I'm gonna keep on (Keep on) loving you (Loving you)
No matter what my friends say or do (Yeah)
Tryna see, tryna my find my way through, hey, hey
