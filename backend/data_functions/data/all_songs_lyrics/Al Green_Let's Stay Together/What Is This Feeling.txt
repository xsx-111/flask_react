What Is This Feeling Lyrics
What is this feeling I have in my heart for you, my baby?
Oh, baby
It's one of the things that I can't explain to you
And that's how I feel about you (Ooh)
You kiss me a thousand times (Ooh)
Slowly drivin' me out of my mind, uh-huh, baby, yeah

I'm really crazy 'bout the way you can be, my baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me?
Ooh, baby, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
You go out late at night, oh, yes, you do
Knowin' things with you and me ain't right, no, hee-hee-hee

La-la-la-la, la-la-la, baby (Baby)
Somebody need to help me now, yeah
La-la-la-la, la-la-la, baby, yeah, say
I'm yours, I'm yours, baby, yeah
I'm yours, I'm yours to keep, yeah

Crazy 'bout the way you can be (Yes I am)
Hey baby, hey baby, yeah, yeah
Why can't you be that way to satisfy me, baby? Yeah
I'm yours (I'm yours), I'm yours to keep (Yours to keep), baby, yeah
I gotta say
Your love me is something to put me on my feet, baby
I have to— I have to keep on sayin' (Yeah)
La-la-la-la (La-la-la-la), ooh, baby (Baby)
Won't you— hey, hey
Let me come on into your garden of love, baby
Oh-ho, all you got to do
Hold me tender, love me long
Hey, baby, yeah, I wanna know, I've got to know
What is this feeling?
What is this feeling?
Is it real?
Or is it something that I feel?Embed
