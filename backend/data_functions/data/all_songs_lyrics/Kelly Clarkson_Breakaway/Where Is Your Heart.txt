Where Is Your Heart Lyrics
I don't believe
In the smile that you leave me with
When you walk away and say goodbye
Well, I don't expect
The world to move underneath me
But for God's sake, could you try?
I know that you're true to me
You're always there, you say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Oh, where is your heart?

I don't understand
Your love is so cold
It's always me that's reaching out for your hand
And I've always dreamed
That love would be effortless
Like a petal falling to the ground
A dreamer following his dream
Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Oh, where is your heart?

It seems so much is left unsaid (So much is left unsaid)
But you can say anything
Oh, anytime you need
Baby, it's just you and me
Oh, yeah

I know that you're true to me
You're always there
You say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you (To believe you)
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Yeah
Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you (To believe you)
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for (Asking for)
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?
Where is your heart?1Embed
