Gone Lyrics
What you see's not what you get
With you, there's just no measurement
No way to tell what's real from what isn't there
Your eyes, they sparkle
That's all changed into lies that drop like acid rain
You washed away the best of me
You don't care

You know you did it, I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you, coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

Sometimes shattered, never open
Nothing matters when you're broken
That was me whenever I was with you
Always ending (Always ending), always over (Always over)
Back and forth, up and down like a rollercoaster
I am breaking (I am breaking) that habit (That habit) today
You know you did it, I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you, coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone

There is nothing you can say
Sorry doesn't cut it, babe
Take the hit and walk away, 'cause I'm gone
Doesn't matter what you do, it's what you did that's hurting you
All I needed was the truth, now I'm gone
What you see's not what you get
What you see's not what you get

You know you did it, I'm gone
To find someone to live for in this world
(Someone to live for in this world)
There's no light at the end of the tunnel tonight
Just a bridge that I gotta burn
You were wrong
If you think you can walk right through my door
That is just so you, coming back when I've finally moved on
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
Oh, I'm already gone, gone, gone
Already gone
I'm goneEmbed
