Is It Really So Strange? Lyrics
I left the North, I travelled South
I found a tiny house and I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can kick me, and you can punch me
And you can break my face
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you

And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
And you will change your mind

I left the South, I travelled North
I got confused, I killed a horse, I can't help the way I feel
Oh yes, you can punch me and you can butt me
And you can break my spine
But you won't change the way I feel
'Cause I love you

And is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so strange?
Oh, is it really so, really so strange?
I say no, you say yes
But you will change your mind
I left the North again, I travelled South again
And I got confused, I killed a nun, I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I can't help the way I feel
I lost my bag in Newport Pagnell

Why is the last mile the hardest mile?
My throat was dry, with the sun in my eyes
And I realised, I realised, I could never
I could never, never, never go back home again5Embed
