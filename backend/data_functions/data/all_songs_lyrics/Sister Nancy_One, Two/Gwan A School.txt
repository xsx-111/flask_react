Gwan A School Lyrics
Dat me like
Dat me like
Dat me like when you read and write
Dat me like

Dat me like when you read and write

Ay Youthman, ay youthman, ay youthman, beg you gwan a school
'Cause when your mommy daddy send you to school he's gon' gone to de pool
And when your days of school are over
Be no plastic fool
Everybody come a ride upon your back like donkey, horse, or mule
Bagdiddledang

I tell you say, dat
Dat me like
Dat me like
Dat me like when you read and write
Dat me like
Dat me like
Dat me like when you read and write

You get an exercise booklet, pencil, and a twelve-inch rule
You gon' go take your seat on a bench maybe, or chair, or a four-foot stool
Lawd to mi God, Youthman a you fi gwan a school
Hail jah man you fi gwan a school
Turn up me ting ya look we, learn fi read and write
You must can write a love letter tonight
I tell you seh fi learn fi count and spell, hey
Nobody ride upon your back like no Jezebel
Dem bite like a scorpion and dem bad nuh hell
Say, teeth and tongue, said it must haffi tell
A whole heap of people a go end up inna hell
Ay Youthman, ay youthman, ay youthman
Tell me say
Dat me like
Dat me like
Dat me like when you read and write
Dat me like when you read and write
Dat me like when you count and spell

Dem ride upon your back like a Jezebel
Dem bite like a scorpion and dem bad nuh hell
But me have dem inna A and have dem inna B
And all a dem haffi come see me
One, a two, also three
I want every youthman to listen to me
Beg you gwan a school
Hail jah man, I beg you gwan a school
After your mommy and your daddy sent to school he's gon' gone to de pool
After your days of school are over, be no plastic fool
And everybody come and ride upon your back like donkey, horse or mule
