That Was Another Country LyricsRowing out into the air
Taking blankets to the bay
It's the same and he was fine
And, in the first place, was around
That was another country
That was another country
I'm taking these dumb paper lanterns down
Yards, no, miles, they strung along
And me with them
And how was I supposed to know about that?
That was another country
That was another country
Are you all- are you alright?
Are you all- are you alright?
You're my friend
Are you alright?
Rowing into the air
Driving home, home from the bay
And we sang and he was fine
And what is more, he was around
That was another country
That was another country
But are you all- are you alright?
Are you all - are you alright?
You're still my friend
You didn't go out of my life, my lifeEmbed
