Go LyricsGeorgia, it grew in the night when you thought it was tired
And how can it always recover and come
And want to whirl you around with your eyes closed
No matter how you say: I won't go, go, go
Georgia, we follow along, it goes pretty far
You go ahead, I'm going to wait in the car
Instead of run with my feet when they won't go
Okay I will, but I don't know, go and go, go
And you would think now hope would be tired, but it's alright
And you would think now hope would be tired, but it's alright
And you would think tired, ragged, and oil-brown, but it's alright

And I know it seems useless
I know how it always turns out
Georgia, since everything's possible we will still go, go, go
And you would think now hope would be tired, but it's alright
And you would think now hope would be tired, but it's alright
It's alright
It's alright
It's alrightEmbed
