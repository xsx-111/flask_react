Speak Our Minds LyricsI'm leaning down, I'm reaching to the lawn
It is shining, shining with the weather
Recent sorrows have not touched the sky
We walk to Mary's and speak our minds
We're trying not to say it isn't fair
We are crossing over to the tree side
Oh I am not feeling all that tired
We walk to Mary's and speak our minds
I'm losing myself, losing myself, yeah
It's good to get out, be part of
I always say I wish I...
So, so we here are going back on to write something down
And we'll paint something and it will say exactly one thing
This street light says we should go on
Through the tall buildings to the sound
Oh my own true friend, my friend and I
We walk to Mary's and speak our minds
Home, paint the kitchen and speak our minds
I wish I
Could just, could do and I wish I
Could do, could be nowEmbed
