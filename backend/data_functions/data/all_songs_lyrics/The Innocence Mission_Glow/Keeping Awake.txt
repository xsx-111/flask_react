Keeping Awake LyricsHearing your voice in the blue light
Calming people in the house
Traveling upstairs
Good to be there now, right now
Oh, I am near to sleeping, I am keeping awake
Oh, I am near to sleeping, I am keeping awake
Hearing your voice in the house, in the house
Hearing your voice in the house
Under those trees
We will all be sitting
Blankets down
It's tomorrow, yes it is
(yeah-ha, yeah-ha)
Oh, I am near to sleeping, I am keeping awake
Oh, I am near to sleeping, I am keeping awake
Hearing your voice in the house, in the house
Hearing your voice in the house
Oh, I am near to sleeping, I am keeping awake
Oh, I am near to sleeping, I am keeping awake
Lying in this house, in someone's arms
My bed is held in someone's arms
I am, I am held now
In the house
In the heart of paper vines
And Junie runs into her room
Next to mine, dancing
And we are all in for the night
Talking is coming
Is coming up over the stairs
And you're coming over the stairs
The stairsEmbed
