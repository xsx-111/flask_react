There LyricsIt's a long day, a long way into your arms
It is a long, long, get up, get up through a snowy yard
And I think you will see me coming under the sky
And I think you will see me coming, open your arms wide
To be there, be there
To be there
It's a long day, a long way into your arms
A long, long looking forward through a straining eye
And I think you will see me coming under the sky
And I think you will see me coming, open your arms, I try
To be there, be there
To be there
And all the clouds are weary whales swimming by to find you
I'm sorry, sorry how, how slow my steps are, slow as hours
To be there, be there
To be there where you are
To be there where you areEmbed
