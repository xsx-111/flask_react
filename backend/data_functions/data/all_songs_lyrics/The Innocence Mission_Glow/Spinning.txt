Spinning LyricsHarry, another day we will feel better about this
And we'll go through yellow yards to the library lions
Closing our eyes, spinning in autumn
Harry, another day we will feel better about things
And we'll dance through yellow yards like a dress on the line
Closing our eyes, losing this
I know nothing about so many, too many things
I, I see I've come to the wall
Come to the ending of me again
I don't know, I...no
What are you saying? Why don't you just...?
Isn't this, isn't this funny Harry?
I know nothing about so many, too many things
I, I see I've come to the wall
I'm turning around now
I know nothing about so many, too many things
I, I see I've come to the wall
I'm turning around now
I'm spinning around nowEmbed
