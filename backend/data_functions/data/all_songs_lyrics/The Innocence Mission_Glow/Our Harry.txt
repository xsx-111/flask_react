Our Harry LyricsWe will squint into the sun
Waving madly at the camera
Harry standing in the front
And I will be sitting on his shoulders
When our Harry sails in the summer
When our Harry will sail away
Our Harry sails in the summer
Far from me across the sea
He said it is time now he does something
And sent his hope to join the peace corps
I can't think what I'll do when my time comes
I cannot see myself standing alone
But our Harry sails in the summer
Our Harry will sail away
Our Harry sails in the summer
Far from me across the seaEmbed
