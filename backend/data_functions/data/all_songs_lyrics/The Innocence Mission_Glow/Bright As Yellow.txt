Bright As Yellow LyricsAnd you live life
With your arms
Reached out
Eye to eye when speaking
Enter rooms with great joy shouts
Happy to be meeting
And bright
Bright
Bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow
And I do not want to be a rose
I do not wish to be pale pink
But flower scarlet, flower gold
And have no thorns to distance me
But be bright
Bright
Bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow
Even if I'm shining
Even if I'm shining
Here
Inside
Even if I'm shouting
Do you see that I'm
Wanting
That I want to be so so
Bright
Bright
Bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow
Even if I'm shining
Even if I'm shining
Here
Inside
Even if I'm shouting
Do you see that I'm
Wanting
Do you see that I am so so
Bright
Bright
Bright, bright as yellow
Warm as yellow1Embed
