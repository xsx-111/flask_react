I Hear You Say So LyricsI think I hear you saying
In the green June now
Singing in, ringing out
I hear you say so
I walk a pale blue mile to my house
In the evenings and I know
Singing in, ringing out
I hear you say so
Say about iron bridges
They rattle, they rattle, they never give way
And this boy who is leaving his home
Who is reaching out, says
Yes I'm sure about some things
When I will be driving away
I will not be alone there and I know
Singing in, ringing out
I hear you say so
I hear you say so
I hear you say soEmbed
