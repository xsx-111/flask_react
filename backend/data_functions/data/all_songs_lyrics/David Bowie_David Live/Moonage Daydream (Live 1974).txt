Moonage Daydream (Live 1974) Lyrics
I'm an alligator
I'm a mama-papa coming for you
I'm a space invader
I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you
Keep your mouth shut
You're squawking like a pink monkey bird
And I'm busting up my brains for the words

I said keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Don't fake it baby
Lay the real thing on me
The church of man, love
Is such a holy place to be
Don't fake it baby
Make me know you really care
Make me jump into the air
Keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah

Keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
I freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
Keep your 'lectric eye on me baby
(Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Put your ray gun to my head
Press your space face close to mine, love
(Love, love, love, love)
Press your space face close to mine, love
Freak out in a moonage daydream, oh yeah!
