Cracked Actor (Live 1974) Lyrics


I've seen all the rest of my Hollywood Highs
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had
I'm stiff on my legend, the films that I made
Forget that I'm fifty cause you just got paid

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh stay, please stay, please stay

You found yourself a trick down on Sunset and Vine
But since he pinned you baby you're a porcupine
You sold me illusions and a bag full of cheques
You've made a bad connection cause I just want your sex

Crack, baby, crack, show me you're real
Smack, baby, smack, is all that you feel
Suck, baby, suck, give me your head
Before you start professing that you're knocking me dead
Oh yeah
Stay
Stay just for a day
