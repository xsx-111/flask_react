Aladdin Sane (Live 1974) Lyrics
Watching him dash away
Swinging an old bouquet (Dead roses)
Sake and strange divine
Uh-huh-huh-uh-huh-huhh (You'll make it)
Passionate bright young things
Takes him away to war (Don't fake it)
Sadden glissando strings
Uh-huh-huh-uh-huh-huhh (You'll make it)

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Battle cries and champagne
Just in time for sunset
Who will love Aladdin Sane?

Motor sensational
Paris or maybe hell (I'm waiting)
Clutches of sad remains
Waits for Aladdin Sane (You'll make it)

Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane


Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Millions weep a fountain
Just in case of sunrise
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Who will love Aladdin Sane?
Will love Aladdin Sane
Will love Aladdin Sane

They say the lights are oh so bright on Broadway
They say there's always music in the air (Broadway)
On Broadway (Broadway)
On Broadway
