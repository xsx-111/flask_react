Knock On Wood (Live 1974) Lyrics
I don't wanna lose, the good thing, that I've got
If I do, I will surely, I will lose a lot

For your love, is better than any love other I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I'd better knock on wood
Baby

I got superstitious, about you, but I can't take a chance
You got me spinning, baby, spinning in a trance

But your love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, lightning
The way you love me is frightening
You better knock on wood
Yeah!

It's no secret, but that woman fills my lovin' cup
She seems, so ready, that I can't get enough
And her love, is better, than any other love I've known
It's like thunder, it's like lightning
The way you love me is frightening
I better knock on wood
Baby, oh yeah
Better, yes, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Yes, I better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh, knock on wood
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) You know I would, would
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) It's no secret
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) No, oh, better
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Above me
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) I can't leave her
(You'd better knock, knock, knock on wood) Oh no, baby
Knock on wood, woo!Embed
