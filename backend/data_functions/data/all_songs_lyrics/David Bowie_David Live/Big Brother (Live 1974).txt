Big Brother (Live 1974) Lyrics
Don't talk of dust and roses
Or should we powder our noses?
Don’t live for last year's capers
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulsars unreal
We'll build a glass asylum
With just a hint of mayhem
We’ll build a better whirlpool
We'll be living from sin
Then we can really begin

Please saviour, saviour, show us
Hear me, I'm graphically yours

Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother

I know you think you're awful square
But you made everyone and you've been every where
Lord I think you'd overdose if you knew what's going down
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you
Someone to lead us, someone to follow
Someone to fool us, some brave Apollo
Someone to shame us, someone like you

Mother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Mother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
Move it up, move it up
Mother
Hoo, hoo
Shake it up, shake it up
