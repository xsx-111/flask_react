All The Young Dudes (Live 1974) Lyrics
Ooh
Oh
Ooh
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-why-why-why
Now

Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

Lucy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face
A funky little boat race

Oh television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
Oh man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
Now Jimmy's looking sweet though he dresses like a queen
He can kick like a mule
It's a real mean team
We can love
Oh yes, we can love

And my brother's back at home
With his Beatles and his Stones
We never got it off on that revolution stuff
It was such a drag
Too many snags

Well, I drunk a lot of wine
And I'm feeling fine
Gonna race some cat to bed
Is this concrete all around
Or is it in my head?
Oh, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude

All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes
Carry the news1Embed
