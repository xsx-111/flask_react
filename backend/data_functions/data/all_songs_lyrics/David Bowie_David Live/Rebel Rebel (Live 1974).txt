Rebel Rebel (Live 1974) Lyrics
Hot damn!
Lucky he saw
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)

Well, you've got your mother in a whirl
She's not sure if you're a boy or a girl
Well hey baby, your hair's alright
Hey baby, let's go out tonight
You like me, and I like it all
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
We like dancing and we look divine
You love bands when they're playing hard
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
You want more and you want it fast

They put you down, they say I'm wrong
You tacky thing, you put them on

Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
Rebel Rebel, you've torn your dress
Rebel Rebel, your face is a mess
Rebel Rebel, how could they know?
Hot tramp, I love you so!
(Yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay-yay)
Yeah!
You've torn your dress, your face is a mess
You can't get enough, but enough ain't the test
You've got your transmission and your live wire
You got your cue line and a handful of ludes
You wanna be there when they count up the dudes
And I love your dress
And your face is a mess
So how could they know?
I said, how could they know?
It's just a ravenous town
It's just where you wanna go

But you're a rebel rebel
But you're a rebel rebel
