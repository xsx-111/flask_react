Diamond Dogs (Live 1974) Lyrics
As they pulled you out of the oxygen tent
You asked for the latest party
With your silicone hump and your ten inch stump
Dressed like a priest you was
Tod Browning's Freak you was
Crawling down the alley on your hands and knee
I know you're not protected, for it's plain to see
The Diamond Dogs are poachers and they hide behind trees
Hunt you to the ground they will, mannequins with kill appeal

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs

The Halloween Jack is a real cool cat
And he lives on top of Manhattan Chase
The elevator's broke, so he slides down a rope
Onto the street below, oh Tarzan, go man go
Meet his little hussy with his ghost town approach
Her face is sans feature, but she wears a Dali brooch
Sweetly reminiscent, something mother used to bake
Wrecked up and paralysed, Diamond Dogs are stabilised
(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Call them the diamond dogs
Call them the diamond dogs

In the year of the scavenger, the season of the bitch
Sashay on the boardwalk, scurry to the ditch
Just another future song, lonely little kitsch
(There's gonna be sorrow) Try and wake up tomorrow

(Will they come?)
I'll keep a friend serene
(Will they come?)
Oh baby, come on to me
(Will they come?)
Well, she's come, been and gone
Come out of the garden, baby
You'll catch your death in the fog
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
Young girl, they call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
Ooh, yeah baby, call them the diamond
Call them the Diamond
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
Yeah-heh-heh
Call them the Diamond Dogs, call them, they call them
(Oo-oo-ooh) Call them the Diamond Dogs
(Oo-oo-ooh, call them the Diamond Dogs)
Keep cool
Diamond Dogs rule, OK
Hey-hey-hey-hey
Beware of the Diamond Dogs
Beware of the Diamond DogsEmbed
