Sweet Thing (Live 1974) LyricsPart I: Sweet Thing


It's safe in the city to love in a doorway
To strangle some screams from the dawn
And isn't it me, putting pain in a stranger?
Like a portrait in flesh, who trails on a leash
Will you see that I'm scared and I'm lonely?
So I'll break up my room, and yawn and I
Run to the centre of things
Where the knowing one says:

"Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing
Boys, boys, it's a sweet thing, sweet thing
If you want it, boys, get it here then
For hope, boys, is a cheap thing, cheap thing"

I'm glad that you're older than me
Makes me feel important and free
Does that make you smile, isn't that me?
I'm in your way, and I'll steal every moment
If this trade is a curse, then I'll bless you
And turn to the crossroads of Hamburgers, and

Part II: Candidate

I'll make you a deal like any other candidate
We pretend we're walking home for your future's sake
My set is amazing, it even smells like the street
There is a bar at the end where I could meet you and your friend
Someone scrawled on the wall "I smell the blood of les tricoteuses"
Who wrote up scandals in other bars
They're having so much fun with the poisonous people
Spreading rumors and lies and stories they made up
Some make you sing and some make you scream
One makes you wish that you never been seen
But there's a shop on the corner selling papier mache
Making bullet-proof faces Charles Manson, Cassius Clay
If you want it, boys get it here then

So you scream out of line
"Anyone out there? Anytime?
Tres bunch little number whines "Hey girlie, I want you
When it's good it's really good and when it's bad I go to pieces"
If you want it, boys, get it here then
On the street where you live I could not hold up my head
For I put all I have in another bed
On another floor, in the back of a car
In the cellar of a church with the door ajar
Well, I guess we must be looking for a different kind
But we can't stop trying til we break up our minds
'Til the sun drips blood on the seedy young knights
Who press on the ground while shaking in fright
I guess we could cruise down one more time
With you by my side, it should be fine
We'll buy some drugs and watch a band
Then jump into a river holding hands

Part III: Sweet Thing

Is it nice in your snow storm
Freezing your brain?
Do you think that your face looks the same?
Then let it be
It's all I ever wanted
It's a street with a deal
And a taste
It's got claws
It's got me
It's got you
