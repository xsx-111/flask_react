Doing Time LyricsI remember times I had
Some were happy, some were sad
Memories me and my partners in crime
Throwing up a thousand times
I got through it, I feel fine
I went to school and did my time
In a sense I'm out, in a sense I'm free
Today I'm what I wanna be
Fun was cartoons Saturdays
Fun was staying up past eight
Lame was trying to fit in
Lame was the wrong crowd let me it
I got through it, I feel fine
I went to school and did my time
In a sense I'm out, in a sense I'm free
Today I'm what I wanna be
You gotta stick together
With who you are and who you know
You gotta remember
Where you've been and where you wanna go
I never did homework after school
Did all the things I thought were cool
Went out every Friday night
I still do and I'm all rightEmbed
