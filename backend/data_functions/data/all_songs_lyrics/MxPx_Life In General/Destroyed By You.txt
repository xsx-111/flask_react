Destroyed By You LyricsCan someone tell me why I'm feeling this way?
Can someone tell me why this world is so grey?
It's never just black and white
So much went on tonight
Was I wrong or was I right?
You think the whole world revolves around your head
You are ignoring me, you haven't heard a word I've said
Why can't I just pull myself together?
What's done is done, never say never
Can someone tell me why I'm feeling this way?
Can someone tell me why this world is so grey?
It's never just black and white
So much went on tonight
Was I wrong or was I right?
Always look for good in the bad
Learn from the mistakes that I have had
I re and re-learn
To let it go
Talk is easy
But it's so hard to showEmbed
