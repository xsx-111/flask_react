Sometimes You Have To Ask Yourself LyricsNever quite just knew how to get it through
The utilitarian sloganeerian minds
And its time to stand up and redefine the lines
Right now
Compartmentalizing, isn't realizing
Because it's not affecting change in the real world
So get on with your life and get over mine
There's only one world and there's many different tastes
So enjoy, don't employ your state
Common goals, communicate to contemplate
The way things are and why
Don't pawn the status quo problems off on the other guy
Your a celebrity in your own world
Catch phrases only catching cobb webs
Spiritualized capital gain and wealth
Isn't the means to the end, isn't the end itself
Manifest individually
Manifest a sense of reality
Because it's non exclusive
Don't be so elusively blind
Things are never what they seem
You don't know what you'll find
Right now!Embed
