Chick Magnet LyricsWell he's a chick magnet, if ya know what I mean
The way the girlies just go to him
Well ya should've seen
The guy yeah, he's got style and it's plain to see
Smooth shoes and cool tattoos
Hair pomped as tight as can be
He ain't got a girlfriend
No one to sing this song to
He's gotta settle down
If he meets that special girl soon
He knows just what to do
When it comes to the girls
He writes them poetry
And he picks them flowers
He knows just what to say when it come to the ladies
Knows how to make a girl smile
How to drive a girl crazy
He ain't got a girlfriend
No one to sing this song to
He's gotta settle down
If he meets that special girl soon
Chick magnet, chick magnet, chick magnet, chick magnet, chick magnet, chick
Magnet, chick magnet, chick magnet, chick magnet, chick magnet yeah!Embed
