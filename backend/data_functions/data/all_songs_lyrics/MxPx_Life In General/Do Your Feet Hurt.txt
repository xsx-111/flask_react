Do Your Feet Hurt LyricsCan I call you sweetheart or even baby doll?
If I had your number, you'd be getting a phone call
Can I leave you a message on your machine?
Letting you know that you're the bomb
And you blew up on me
Are you anxious to see me
After your next class?
Do you care when I tell you
Step around that broken glass?
Can I see you after you get out of school?
I won't even mind if you treat me cruel
Take a ride on my Vespa, I'll take you home
I'll climb up to your window and read you a poem
I know that you believe in the one true God above
And that's why you're waiting
For your one and only love
Do your feet hurt? Did you fall from heaven?
'Cause you've been running through
My mind all day
My mind don't mind
I don't know what to say or do
I can't eat when I'm with you
Goodnight sweetheart I gotta go
And you won't come to my next show?Embed
