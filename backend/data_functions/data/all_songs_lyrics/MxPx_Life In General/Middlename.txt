Middlename Lyrics
Emotion is my middle name
I lay in bed and listen to the rain
Put happy thoughts in to my head
But I find instead the hurting words you said

Why won't you believe me
When I tell you the things that I see?
I'll still see you tomorrow, at the show

It's been a long winded, long time
I wish I'd never met you
I wish I could forget you
And what you said
You're directing your complaints to me
I should walk away, I could easily
Never hear a word you say

I'm not your robot or your slave
I won't behave, I'm not your toy
Go on, go bury me with self righteousness
I confess, I'm just a boy
Why won't you believe me
When I tell you the things that I see?
I'll still see you tomorrow, at the show

It's been a long winded, long time
I wish I'd never met you
I wish I could forget you
And what you said
You're directing your complaints to me
I should walk away, I could easily
Never hear a word you say

Why won't you believe me
When I tell you the things that I see?
I'll still see you tomorrow, at the showEmbed
