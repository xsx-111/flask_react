Southbound LyricsIt's all the same
Same old town with a different name
That's fine by me
There's only one place that I wanna be
Southbound on I-5
And windows down and music on the stereo
I'm drivin' and I'm dreamin'
There's no place I'd rather go
Staring at white lines on the side of the road
Been on the road awhile
I gotta get back to a place with style
Hang out, havin' fun
I gotta get back to the beach in the sun
Southbound on I-5
Windows down and music on the stereo
I'm drivin' and I'm dreamin'
There's no place I'd rather go
Playing every night with the occasional fightEmbed
