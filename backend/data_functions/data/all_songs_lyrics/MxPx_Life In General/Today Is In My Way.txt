Today Is In My Way LyricsIt breaks my heart it makes me sad
To think of all the times we had
You made me laugh and you make me cry
And all that I can do is sigh, and wonder why
How will I get through tomorrow
If I can't make it through today?
How will I get through tomorrow
When today is in my way?
Today is in my way
What's done is done and in the past
Good things come and go so fast
You looked up at me and said goodbye
All that I could do was sigh and wonder why
How will I get through tomorrow
If I can't make it through today?
How will I get through tomorrow
When today is in my way?
Today is in my way
I deserve all that I get
Serves me right I will admit
And today just won't go away
Today is in my way
Today is in my wayEmbed
