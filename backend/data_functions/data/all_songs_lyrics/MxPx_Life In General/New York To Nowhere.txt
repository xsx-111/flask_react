New York To Nowhere LyricsGoing nowhere fast, watching cars go past
Why won't the snow melt faster?
This trip is a disaster
16 hour drive, just played in some dive
New York to nowhere, we're never gonna get there
A million miles away from everyone I know
Stuck here night and day with 5 more days to go
Going nowhere fast, watching cars go past
Why won't the snow melt faster?
This trip is a disaster
16 hour drive, just played in some dive
New York to nowhere, we're never gonna get there
A million miles away from everyone I know
Stuck here night and day with 5 more days to goEmbed
