Your Problem My Emergency LyricsGet a clue, I'm not here for you
I'm not like you
I'm not gonna do what you say is right
'Cause then I'll end up just like you
I'm gonna rebel, I'm gonna fight
This organized manipulation
Learn to think before you speak
And you just might make a point
I'm just an average guy, is that hard to accept?
I live a normal life I've got no regrets
Don't make me out to be something that I'm not
I never said I was anything, so don't expect me to be
Learn to think before you speak
And you just might make a point
Why is your problem always my emergency?
This is no court of law, you're all speculation
Sex masquerades as rock and roll
And manufactured music to save your soul
So go and do your homework
