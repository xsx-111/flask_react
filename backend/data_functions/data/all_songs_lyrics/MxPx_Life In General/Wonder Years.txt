Wonder Years LyricsI don't understand what's going on in my life these days
Everything upside down turned around
Won't waste my life, no way
And I don't know why
I can't see clearly?
I can't think 'cause it's too early
So many doubts frequent my mind all the time
Our lives in general are one in the same
But there's variations
Our lives in general are one in the same
Difference of opinion
In my younger years, I used to be so free
But I don't know what's happening to me
We all know by now that time's the enemy
It controls us, tells us where to be
Don't know, don't care
If you need me, I'll be right hereEmbed
