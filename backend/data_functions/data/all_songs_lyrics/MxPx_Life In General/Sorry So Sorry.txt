Sorry So Sorry LyricsI should have stayed in bed today
I couldn't think of a positive thing to say
My friends all hate me now
I was selfish and realize now
I gave it a little time
I thought about it a while
Ask to forgive and forget
Crack a joke and a smile
It's hard to say you're sorry
When you know that you were wrong
The weight of hurting words
We often carry on
On
The annoying things I don't mind so much anymore
I've learned to tolerate the annoying four
I won't let the sun go down
When I've made a mistake
I'll make right what I've wronged
And give more than I take
It's hard to say you're sorry
When you know that you were wrong
The weight of hurting words
We often carry on
