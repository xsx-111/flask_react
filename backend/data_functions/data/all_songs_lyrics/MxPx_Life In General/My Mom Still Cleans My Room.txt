My Mom Still Cleans My Room LyricsI'm not always nice, not always mean
My room has never been seen clean
The way I feel is not always how I seem
The thoughts that form inside my brain
Don't always seem to entertain
'Cause when I tell my company
They think there's something wrong with me
You don't know me like you think you do
You don't understand me and it's true
I'm getting older day by day
Ain't got time to get to everything
Hold on tight, enjoy the ride
Life is short, so live it wisely
I'm not always sick, but often tired
Sometimes I'm having fun or wired
I don't have someone to call my own
I'm not full of all the answers
I guess that I'm an o.k. dancer
I just want to be left aloneEmbed
