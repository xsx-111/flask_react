Christalena LyricsChristalena, ya she's so cool
Christalena, she's out of control
Half the time she don't know where she's at
Christalena don't know much about that
But you know, and I know Christalena
But you know, and I know when I've seen her
But you know, and I know Christalena
But you know, and I know when I've seen her
Christalena, she's in her own world
She's always happy as a littly girl
Christalena's nice unless she's annoyed
Christalena happens to like boys - but not me
But you know, and I know Christalena
But you know, and I know when I've seen her
But you know, and I know Christalena
But you know, and I know when I've seen her
Christalena, where'd you go?
Don't even know where you've been
Christalena, won't you stay?
Please don't go away, won't you be my friend?
But you know, and I know Christalena
But you know, and I know when I've seen her
But you know, and I know Christalena
But you know, and I know when I've seen herEmbed
