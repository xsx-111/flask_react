Be Mine! Lyrics
It's a good thing tears never show in the pouring rain
As if a good thing ever could make up for all the pain
There'll be no last chance to promise to never mess it up again
Just a sweet pain of watching your back as you walk
As I'm watching you walk away

And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

It's a cruel thing you'll never know all the ways I tried
It's a hard thing, faking a smile when I feel
Like I'm falling apart inside (When I'm with you)
And now you're gone, there's like an echo in my head
And I remember every word you said

But you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

For the first time, there is no mercy in your eyes
And the cold wind's hitting my face and you're gone
And you're walking away (Away, away, when I'm with you)
And I am helpless sometimes
Wishing's just no good
'Cause you don't see me like I wish you would
'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
There's a moment to seize every-time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine

I saw you at the station (When I'm with you)
You had your arm around what's-her-name
She had on that scarf I gave you (When I'm with you)
And you got down to tie her laces
('Cause you never were, and you never will be mine)
You looked happy and that's great
(No, you never were, and you never will be mine)
I just miss you, that's all

'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine (When I'm with you)
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
Oh, there's a moment to seize every time that we meet (Hey, yeah)
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mine
'Cause you never were, and you never will be mine
(You never were, and you never will) (When I'm with you)
You never were and you never will be mine (When I'm with you)
There's a moment to seize every-time that we meet
But you always keep passing me by
No, you never were, and you never will be mineEmbed
