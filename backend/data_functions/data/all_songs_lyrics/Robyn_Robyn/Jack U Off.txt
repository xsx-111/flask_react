Jack U Off Lyrics
If you're looking for somewhere to go
Thought I'd take you to a movie show
Sittin' in the back and I'll jack you off
I can't give you everything you want
But I can take you to a restaurant
And if you're not hungry, I'll jack you off
If your man ain't no good
Come on over to my neighborhood
We can jump in the sack and I'll jack you off
If you're tired of the masturbator
Little girl, we can go on a date
And if you like, I'll jack you off

I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off

I only do it for a worthy cause
Virginity or menopause
You'll have an instant heart attack if I jack you off
If you really want to be a star
We gotta do it in your momma's car
Naked in a Cadillac, I'll jack you off
And if we can't find no place to go
Girl, I'll take you to a movie show
We can sit in the back and I'll jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off

If you're chicken, baby, come on here
If you're good I'll even let you steer
As a matter of fact, you can jack me off
Yeah, that's right

I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you off
I'll jack you off, jack you offEmbed
