Konichiwa Bitches Lyrics
Uh
Uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

You wanna rumble in my jungle? I'll take you on (Uh-huh)
Stampede your rumpa and send you home
You wanna rumble in space? I'll put my laser on stun
And on the North Pole, I'll ice you, son
You want a thrilla in Manila? You'll be killer bee stung
Wanna taste the vanilla? Better watch your tongue
Cause I'll hammer your toe like a pediatrician ('Trician)
Saw you in half like I'm a magician (Magician)
Tear you down like I'm in demolition
Count you out like a mathematician
I'm so very hot that when I rob your mansion
You ain't call the cops, you call the fire station
'Cause my flavor's so sweet you'll be zoom, zoom, zoom
Don't even get me started on my bada-boom-booms (Ooh)
One left, one right, that's how I organize them
You know I fill my cups, no need to supersize them
Right now you're probably thinking "How she get in them jeans?"
Well, I'm gifted, all natural, and bursting the seams

Uh-huh
Konichiwa, bitches
Uh-huh, uh-huh
Konichiwa, bitches
Don't I look tasty like a french bon-bon?
Even more sweeter than a cherry bomb
Coming with the postman like I'm a mailbomb (Uh-huh)
Cumming in your mouth, make you say "yum, yum!"
Hit the gong-gong, bring the sumos on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
I'ma kick ass all the way to Hong Kong
Make the balls bounce like a game of ping pong
Konichiwa, bitches, from Beijing to Saigon
Got nothing on me, cause you know you's a bum
Dum-didi-dum-didididi-dum-dum
Check the scenario, I'ma bust your ear drum
And leave your heads ringing with the ring-a-ding-dong (Uh)
Busy on the mic since the day I was what? Born
Check out my style, it's the rock of what? Mo'
Shine is on me like a dog on a what? Bone
Fight the power, put myself on the throne
You know when shit is getting heavy like it weighs a ton (Uh-huh)
I will run you down like a marathon (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Tape you up good, put you in the trunk
See you next Tuesday, you is a punkEmbed
