Cobrastyle Lyrics
I press trigga, I don't press people button
Nobody tjaffs come face me with something
Like how I have 22 inna me something (Yeah)
Ten is for you, so who gon' get the next dozen? (Foo)

I press trigga, I don't press people button (Button)
Nobody tjaffs come face me with somethin' (Somethin')
Like how I have 22 inna me something
Ten is for you, so who gon get the next dozen (Foo)
I press trigga, I don't press people button
Nobody tjaffs come face me with somethin' (Somethin')
Like how I have 22 inna me something
Ten is for you so who gon get the next dozen (Foo)
I press trigga, I don't press people button (Button)
Nobody tjaffs come face me with somethin' (Somethin')
Like how I have 22 inna me something (Somethin')
Ten is for you so who gon get the next dozen (Foo)

Anytime they ready punnahussy start war (Start war)
Mess around and see who get it spread on the tar

My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
Punnahussy sit around and watch a girl live (Live)
Watch a girl roll, now you know I roll big (Roll big)
You sit around and plan how to put girl in fridge
Remember when you dig a hole, it's two you gon dig (Foo)

Certain little boys I just stop deal with (Somethin')
Tell you they your friend and then badmouth again

My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi

I press trigga, I don't press people button (Button)
Nobody tjaffs come face me with something (something)
Like how I have 22 inna me something (Yeah)
Ten is for you so who gon get the next dozen (Foo)
I press trigga, I don't press people button (Button)
Nobody tjaffs come face me with somethin' (Somethin')
Like how I have 22 inna me something (Yeah)
Ten is for you so who gon' get the next dozen (Foo)
Anytime they ready punnahussy start war (Start war)
Mess around and see who get it spread on the tar

My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
(Anytime they ready punnahussy start war)
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
(Nobody tjaffs come face me with something)
My style is the bomb didi bom di deng gi deng digi digi
(Mess around and see who get it spread on the tar)
'Cause rudegirl don't play with the bomb di deng gi deng digi digi
(Remember when you dig a hole, it's two you gon dig)

Certain little boys I just stop deal with
Tell you they your friend and then badmouth again (Uh)Embed
