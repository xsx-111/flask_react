Macro Lyrics
Overflowing senses, heightened awareness
I hear my blood flow, I feel its caress
Whispering cosmos, talking right to me
Unlimited, endless, God breathing through me

See the microcosm, in macro vision
Our bodies moving with pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution, one creation

Thundering rhythm, pounding within me
Driving me onwards, forcing me to see
Clear and enlightening, right there before me
Brilliantly shining intricate beauty

See the microcosm, in macro vision
Our bodies moving with pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution, one creation

See the microcosm, in macro vision
Our bodies moving with pure precision
One universal celebration
One evolution, one creation3Embed
