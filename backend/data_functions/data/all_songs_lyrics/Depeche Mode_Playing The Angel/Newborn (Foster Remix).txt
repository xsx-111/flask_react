Newborn (Foster Remix) Lyrics
Newborn for the first time
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
I've opened up my eyes
Now I hear the world talking
Opened up my eyes
Opened up my eyes

Newborn for the first time
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
I've opened up my eyes
Now I hear the world talking
Opened up my eyes
Opened up my eyes (My eyes)

Newborn
Newborn
Newborn
Newborn
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
Newborn
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
Newborn
I'm not born again
I have never lived at all
Newborn
Newborn
