Lilian Lyrics
Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You've stripped my heart, ripped it apart
In the name of fun
Oh, Lillian
I'm a poor man's son
And precious jewels weren't found in schools
Where I came from

Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got

Oh, Lillian
I should have run
I should have known each dress you own
Is a loaded gun

Oh, Lillian


Oh, Lillian
I need protection
I hear your voice and any choice
I had is gone
Oh, Lillian
Once I began
I couldn't stop till every drop
Of blood was sung
Pain and misery always hit the spot
Knowing you can't lose what you haven't got

Oh, Lillian
Look what you've done
You stripped my heart, ripped it apart
In the name of fun

Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian
Oh, Lillian5Embed
