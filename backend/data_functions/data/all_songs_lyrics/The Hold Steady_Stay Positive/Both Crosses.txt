Both Crosses LyricsShe said sometimes she sees these things
Right before they're happening
Hail Mary, full of grace
Some nights she swears she feels her face
She's been with a couple boys who died
And two of them were crucified
And the last one had enlightened eyes
But the first guy, he was Jesus Christ
Hey Judas, I know you've made a grave mistake
Hey Peter, you've been pretty sweet since Easter break
Now she's four A.M. and she's wide awake
She's shiverin' and smilin'
Let's clutch and kiss and sing and shake
Tonight, let's try to levitate
You Catholic girls, you start much too late
Baby, let's transverberate
Baby, let's transverberate
Baby, let's transverberate
But she saw the footage right before it got cut
And she saw the bodies and she saw the blood
She saw the angel put a sword in his side
And baby, that's how we got canonized
She saw him gushing blood right before it got cut
She saw him put a body in a bag in the trunk
She saw the guys coming in from the sides
And baby, that's how we get energized
She said, "You know I'm down to pay for it"
She said, "Just grant me some indulgences
Cause I've been mostly dying
And I've been mostly coughing
And I've been mostly crying
And I've been thinking 'bout both crosses"
She saw the film right before it came out
And at first she thought Judas might go for the mouth
And she saw the nails and she saw the hands
She saw the crown, she heard the band
And the new kid begged him not to do it
And Jesus just said, "Hey, I still love you Judas"
Since you've been up in Massachusetts
I've been dreaming 'bout dos cruces
And I've been thinking 'bout both crosses
And I've been dreaming 'bout dos cruces
Yeah I've been thinking 'about both crossesEmbed
