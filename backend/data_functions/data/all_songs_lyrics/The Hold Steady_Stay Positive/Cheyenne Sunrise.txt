Cheyenne Sunrise LyricsWhen I left I wasn't thinking
That I wasn't coming home
But first Al Green
And then Barry White
Convinced me not to go
And I didn't come home for fighting
I came to bandage up my hand
And if you're gonna talk to me like that
Then I'll just go back out again
Wipe that chip right off your shoulder
We ain't getting any younger
Some things are getting bigger
Some things are falling off
Some things they seem much harder
Some other things stay soft
We're tipping over in the taprooms
We're shooting through the ceiling
We're dying in the bathrooms
And we're living
For that one sweet, fleeting feeling
I know my cough sounds awful
Some nights it hurts a bit to breathe
But I'm glad it's just my body
I do my business on the street
We ain't getting any younger
Tomorrow night we'll be that much older
Some kids are growing awkward
And some kids are going off
We're fingering the punch bowl
We're feeding from the trough
There's nothing quite like a Cheyenne sunrise
To make us has-beens feel too old
Onward Christian soldiers
We're gonna bash right through your borders
I bet your next party gets sketchy
I saw the new kids nodding off
Some things are getting bigger
Some things are falling off
Some things seem much harder
Some other things stay softEmbed
