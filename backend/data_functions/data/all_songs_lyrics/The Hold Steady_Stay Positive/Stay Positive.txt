Stay Positive Lyrics
I got a lot of old friends
That are getting back in touch
And it's a pretty good feeling
Yeah it feels pretty good

I get a lot of double takes
When I'm coming around the corners
And it's mostly pretty nice
Yeah it's mostly pretty alright

Because most kids give me credit
For being down with it
When it was back in the day
Back when things were way different

When the Youth of Today
And the early 7 Seconds
Taught me some of life's most valuable lessons

There's gonna come a time
When the scene will seem less sunny
It will probably get druggy
And the kids will seem too skinny
There's gonna come a time
When she's gonna have to go
With whoever's gonna get her the highest

There's gonna come a time
When the true scene leaders
Will forget where they differ
And get big picture

Because the kids at the shows
They'll have kids of their own
And the sing along songs will be our scriptures

We gotta stay positive
We gotta stay positive
We gotta stay positive
We gotta stay positive

When the chaperone crowned us the king and the queen
I knew that we’d arrived at a Unified Scene
And all those little lambs from my dreams
Well, they were there, too
'Cause it’s one thing to start it with a Positive Jam
And it’s another thing to see on through
And we couldn’t’ve even done this if it wasn’t for you
We gotta stay positive
We gotta stay positive
We gotta stay positive
We gotta stay positive2Embed
