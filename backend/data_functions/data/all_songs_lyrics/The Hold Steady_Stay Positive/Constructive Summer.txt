Constructive Summer Lyrics
Me and my friends are like
The drums on "Lust for Life"
We pound it out on floor toms
Our psalms are sing-along songs
And this whole town is like this
Been that way our whole lives, just
Work at the mill until you die
Work at the mill, and then you die

We’re gonna build something this summer
(We’re gonna build something this summer)
We’ll put it back together
Raise up a giant ladder
With love and trust and friends and hammers
(This summer!)
We’re gonna lean this ladder
Up against the water tower
Climb up to the top and drink and talk
(This summer!)

Me and my friends are like
"Double-whiskey coke, no ice"
We drink along in double-time
Might drink too much, but we feel fine
We’re gonna build something this summer
(Gonna build something this summer)
Summer, grant us all the power
To drink on top of water towers
With love and trust and shows all summer
(Get hammered!)
Let this be my annual reminder
That we can all be something bigger
I went to your schools, I did my detention
But the walls are so gray I couldn’t pay attention
I read your gospel, it moved me to tears
But I couldn’t find the hate, and I couldn’t find the fear
I met your savior, I knelt at his feet
And he took my ten bucks, and he went down the street
I tried to believe all the things that you said
But my friends that aren’t dying are already dead

Raise a toast to St. Joe Strummer
I think he might’ve been our only decent teacher
Getting older makes it harder to remember
We are our only saviors
We’re gonna build something this summer5Embed
