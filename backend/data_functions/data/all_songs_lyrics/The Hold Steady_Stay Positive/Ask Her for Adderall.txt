Ask Her for Adderall LyricsIf she asks, don't tell her that I'm living hand-to-mouth
Don't tell her I've been sleeping on your couch
If she asks just tell her that we opened for the Stones
It's her favorite band except for the Ramones
If she happens to suggest
A love based on trust and respect
Tell her I've been wasted since last week
If she wants to stop on by
Tell her that I almost died
Tell her I ain't seein' people yet
But see if she'll send cigarettes
If she asks don't tell her 'bout the bloodshed in the streets
The less she knows, the less she can repeat
If she happens to bring up
The pin pricks and the throwin' up
Tell her it's just part of growin' up
If she wants to get involved
Tell her to stay in St. Paul
Tell her I'm not up to takin' calls
Ask her for some Adderall
Now Holly won't say hi to me
Cause I'm in love with my anxiety
If she asks just tell her that we're too far gone to deal
She should know exactly how that feels
If she wants a scene report
Don't tell her 'bout the kicked in doors
Tell her we ain't even keeping score no more
If she wants to help the cause
Tell her we need sterile gauze
Tell her she should look through all her medicine
And see if she's got Klonopins
Now Charlemagne don't seem the same
He's skinny, scared, and off his game
He's been hiding from those gentlemen
With the same tattoos as GideonEmbed
