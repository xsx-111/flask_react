Yeah Sapphire LyricsYeah, Sapphire
I'm sick and I'm tired and I'm fried
And you gotta believe me
Yeah, Sapphire
If I cross myself when I come
Would you maybe receive me?
Yeah, Sapphire
You were feisty at first
But I broke you and I showed you the tempo
Sacramento
It swung at us first
But it ended up going down gentle
Sapphire, if Cheyenne's too small
We'll haul it all back to St. Paul
I was just about to call you
When you called
Yeah, Sapphire
I know the last time we touched
I came on a bit rough, please forgive me
Yeah, Sapphire
After you left, it was a big sketchy mess
They almost killed me
Sapphire, if Cheyenne's too small
We'll haul it all back to St. Paul
I was just about to call you
When you called
Sapphire, if St. Paul don't call
We've always got Aberdeen
Cause dreams they seem to cost money
But money costs some dreams
It went just as you predicted
I swear there must be something in your dreams
It all went down exactly like your visions
And I know you said don't call until I'm clean
I'm not drunk, I'm cut
I'm gushing blood
And I need someone to come and pick me up
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles work
I was a skeptic at first, but these miracles workEmbed
