Sequestered in Memphis Lyrics
It started when we were dancing
It got heavy when we got to the bathroom
We didn't go back to her place
We went to some place where she cat-sits

She said: I know I look tired
But everything's fried here in Memphis
Now they wanna know exactly which bathroom
Dude, does it make any difference? It can't be important

Yeah sure, I'll tell my story again
In barlight, she looked alright
In daylight, she looked desperate
That's alright, I was desperate too
I'm getting pretty sick of this interview

Subpoenaed in Texas
Sequestered in Memphis

I think she drove a new Mustang
I guess it might be a rental
I remember she had satellite radio
I guess she seemed a bit nervous
Do you think I'm that stupid?
What the hell, I'll tell the story again
In barlight, she looked alright
In daylight, she looked desperate
That's alright, I was desperate too
I'm getting pretty sick of this interview

Subpoenaed in Texas
Sequestered in Memphis

I went there on 'business'2Embed
