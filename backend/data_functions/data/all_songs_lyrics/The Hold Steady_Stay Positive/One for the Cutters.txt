One for the Cutters LyricsWhen there weren't any parties she'd park by the quarry
Walk into the woods until she came to a clearing
Where townies would gather and drink until blackout
Smoke cigs 'till they're sick, pack bowls and then pass out
Windows wide open to let the hard rock in
Theirs was a rage that didn't need much convincing
The girls gave her glares but the boys were quite pleasant
To be perfectly honest, they didn't seem much different
When there weren't any parties
Sometimes she'd party with townies
Out on the parkways after the parties
It was always arousing when they'd rev up their engines
It's hard to describe so she kept it a secret
The girls that she lived with, they knew nothing about it
The night with the fight and the butterfly knife
Was the first night she spent with that one guy she liked
She gave him a ride to some kid's house in Cleveland
He stayed there for two weeks, the cops finally found him
He didn't seem that different except for that blood on his jacket
He didn't seem that different except for maybe his haircut
He didn't seem much different
They didn't seem that different up until this one little incident
They didn't seem much different
Now the cops want to question everyone present
They parade every townie in town through the station
But no one says nothing and they can't find the weapon
The girl takes the stand and she swears she was with him
Her father's lawyers do most of the talking
She's sick of the questions, sick of the concept
Of justice and fairness, who the hell cares
Who gets caught in the middle?
She smokes and she ponders this riddle
When one townie falls in the forest, can anyone hear it?
When one townie falls
When one townie falls in the forest, does anyone notice?
One drop of blood on immaculate Keds
Mom, do you know where your girl is?
Sophomore accomplice in a turtleneck sweater
Dad, do you know where your kids are?
Sniffing at crystal in cute little cars
Getting nailed against dumpsters behind townie bars
It's a cute little town, boutiques and cafes
Her friends all seemed nice, she was getting good grades
But when she came home for Christmas
She just seemed distant and differentEmbed
