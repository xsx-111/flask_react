You Know What to Do Lyrics
When I see you, I just don't know what to say
I like to be with you every hour of the day

So if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do

I watched you walking by, and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home

And if you want me just like I need you
You know what to do

Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too

Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way

So if you want me just like I want you
You know what to do
Just call on me when you're lonely
I'll keep my love for you only
I'll call on you if I'm lonely too

Understand I'll stay with you every day
Make you love me more in every way

So if you want me just like I want you
You know what to doEmbed
