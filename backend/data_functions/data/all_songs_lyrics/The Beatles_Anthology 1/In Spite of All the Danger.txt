In Spite of All the Danger Lyrics
In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you, anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

In spite of all the heartache that you may cause me
I'll do anything for you, anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

I'll look after you like I've never done before
I'll keep all the others from knocking at your door

In spite of all the danger
In spite of all that may be
I'll do anything for you, anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me

In spite of all the heartache that you may cause me
I'll do anything for you, anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me
I'll do anything for you, anything you want me to
If you'll be true to me1Embed
