Well, the Recording Test...By My Artists (Reading) Lyrics
Well, the recording test came and went
The people that decide about these things at Decca said no
Well you can imagine I was more worried about what I was going to say to the boys having built up their hopes
So I allowed myself a final 24 hours to exhaust the remaining disc companies and I booked into the Green Park Hotel
In the morning I took a cab to the EMI office block in Manchester Square London, to meet the man who would within less than two years produce 16 number one discs by my artistsEmbed
