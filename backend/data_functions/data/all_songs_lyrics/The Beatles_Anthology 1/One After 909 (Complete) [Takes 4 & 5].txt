One After 909 (Complete)  Lyrics
Well, My baby said she's traveling on the one after 909
She said move over honey, I'm traveling on that line
She said move over once, Move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
She said she's traveling on the one after 909

I begged her not to go, and I begged her on my bended knees
She said you're only fooling 'round, only fooling 'round with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909

Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location"
Pick up my bag, run right home
Then I find you've got the number wrong

Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
Well, she said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 9-0
Said she's travelling on the one after 909Embed
