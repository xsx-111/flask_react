One After 909 - Anthology 1 Version / False Starts Lyrics
Said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
Said she's travelling on the one after 909

Pick up my bag, run to the station
Railman said "you've got the wrong location", yeah
Pick up my bag, run right home

John: What are you doing?
Paul: Just... ah, it's murder! I can't do it, can't keep it up, I'm just goin'
George: Use your pleco!
Paul: I haven't got one! "Use the pleco"... I've been tryin' to get them all day
John: Well, your clothes have been brought hours ago...
Paul: I know, but the case was hardly moved
George: I said to you before, Paul, don't forget your case with your clothes in
Paul: I know, but the cases are still up at the door!
George: I said "do you want me to bring your case" in and you just walked away...
Paul: I didn't think, I thought you said I didn't really want
Control Room: Here we go!
Paul: George?

You got the number wrong, yeah
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over, honey, I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on, baby, don't be cold as ice
She said she's travelling on the one after 909
Oh, yeah!


Well, my baby said she's travelling on the one after-

John: Okay
George: I told you!
Paul: 
John: 
Paul: You've come with the wrong  through the solo
George: 
John: What was it? Twelve bar?
Control Room: Yeah, yeah, twelve bar, yeah
Paul: It wasn't
Paul: You three...
Paul: One, two, there, four
Said she's travelling on the one after 909
Oh!Embed
