I Secured Them...A Beatle Drink Even Then (Reading) Lyrics
I secured them an audition at Decca on New Years Day 1962
They came to London and stayed at the Royal Hotel paying 27 shillings a night for bed and breakfast
They were poor and I wasn't rich, but we all celebrated with rum and scotch and coke, which was becoming a Beatle drink even thenEmbed
