Coming of Age Lyrics
Well, I see you standing there like a rabid dog
And you got those crying eyes
Makes me wanna surrender and wrap you in my arms
You know I try to live without regrets
I'm always moving forward and not looking back
But I tend to leave a trail of dead while I'm moving ahead

And so I'm steppin' away
'Cause I got nothin' to say

Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
Feels like, feels like a coming of age

And when my fear pulls me out to sea
And the stars are hidden by my pride and my enemies
I seem to hurt the people that care the most
Just like an animal, I protect my pride
When I'm too bruised to fight
And even when I'm wrong, I tend to think I'm right
Well, I'm bored of the game
And too tired to rage

Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
It feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (And I'm burning the page)

Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
It feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age


It feels like, feels like a coming of age (Yeah, it's like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (Like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age (It's like a coming of age)
Feels like, feels like it's comin'
It feels like, feels like a coming of age48Embed
