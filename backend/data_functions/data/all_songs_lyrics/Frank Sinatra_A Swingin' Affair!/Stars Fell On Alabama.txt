Stars Fell On Alabama LyricsWriter(s): Parish/Perkins
We lived our little drama
We kissed in a field of white
And stars fell on Alabama
Last night
I can't forget the glamour
Your eyes held a tender light
While (And) stars fell on Alabama (fractured 'Bama)
Last night
I never planned in my imagination
A situation - so heavenly
A fairy land where no one else could enter
And in the center - just you and me
My heart beat (just) like a hammer
(My) Arms wound around you tight
And (While) stars fell on Alabama
Last nightEmbed
