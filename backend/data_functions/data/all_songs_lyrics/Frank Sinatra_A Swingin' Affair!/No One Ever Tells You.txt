No One Ever Tells You LyricsNo one ever tells you what's like to love and lose
How it feels to waken and have breakfast with the blues
How to go on living, how to face another day
No one ever tells you the way
No one ever tells you how it feels to walk alone
Listening for those footsteps through the echo of your own
Suddenly it hits you all those dreams not worth a dime
Cause no one ever tells you in time
Long before the icy winds of winter
Autumn tells the swallows, time to fly
Why did she pretend till the bitter end
Till it broke my heart to say goodbye
And no one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before
(instrumental)
No one ever tells you that it's just another fling
No one ever warns you when your heart begins to sing
Someone tells you later all is fair in love and war
But no one ever tells you before
It never comes easy, no one ever tells you beforeEmbed
