The Lonesome Road LyricsLook down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, look up and seek your maker
Before Gabriel blows his horn
Weary totin' such a load
Trudgin' down the lonesome road
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before, before you travel on
True love, true love, what have I done
That you should treat me so?
You caused me to walk and talk
Like I never did before
Weary totin' such a load
Trudgin' down that lonesome road
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look up, look up and seek your maker
Before Mr. Gabriel blows his horn
I'm weary of totin' such a heavy load
Trudgin' down that lonesome road
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before, before you travel on
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel on
Look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you decide to travel on
Look down, look down, look down, look down that lonesome road
Before you travel onEmbed
