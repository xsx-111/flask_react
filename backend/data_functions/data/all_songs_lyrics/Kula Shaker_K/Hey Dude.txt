Hey Dude Lyrics
All I have is all I need enough for love but not for greed yeah
I was younger once this guy came to me told me about all the honey out there
He said:
"Honey gold jewels money women wine cars that shine."
I don't know what he was talking about but I think I had an idea
He said:
"Smell the rose, sweet sweet rose, catch the sun find where it grows
Smell the rose, the sweet sweet rose that grows on castle walls in heaven. In heaven yeah."

Well if it feels like summer you're catching the sun
And I'm catching the moment you fall
When if it tastes like honey don't swallow it all
Don't wait for the moment to come
And catch the sun

Hey dude, don't lean on me man
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man

I was crossing the city one day, everybody was flashing by me Like images of tombstones, images of tombstones
On a Friday night I've seen everybody looking for their little bit of honey
To alleviate the pain, to alleviate the pain
Well if it feels like summer don't burn in the sun
Don't wait for the evening to fall
When if it tastes like honey don't swallow it all
Don't wait for the moment to come
And catch the sun

Hey dude, don't lean on me man
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man

And I can't understand
No, no, n no, n no, n no,n no, n no
I can't understand
I feel like a man, sing it to me honey
Catch the sun

Hey dude, don't lean on me man
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man
Hey dude, No, no, n no
Hey dude,No, no, n no, oooh-oooh-oooh
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a manEmbed
