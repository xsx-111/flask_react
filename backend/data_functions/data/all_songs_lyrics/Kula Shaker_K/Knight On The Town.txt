Knight On The Town LyricsShe had been waiting all week for her knight on the town
He saw a lost soul of heaven that walked on the ground
Well the motor car felt like a carriage
The disco became as a palace and shone like a crown
It shone like a crown
All that we said was forgotten now we don't belong
Games for the lost souls of heaven who walk on the ground
Who walk on the ground
Monday arrived but inside she was feeling so blue
Where was the garden of Eden she thought had come true?
She felt like she should have been praying
Her love was a memory fading, but what can you do
When you're feeling blue...
All that we said was forgotten now we don't belong
Games for the lost souls of heaven of heaven of heaven
Of heaven, yeah!
All that we said was forgotten now we don't belong
Games for the lost souls of heaven of heaven of heaven
Who walk on the ground
Yeah yeah yeah
Who walk on the ground
Yeah yeah yeah
Owww
Owww
Owww
All that we said was forgotten now we don't belongEmbed
