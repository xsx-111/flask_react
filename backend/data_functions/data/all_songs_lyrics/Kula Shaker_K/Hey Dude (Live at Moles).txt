Hey Dude (Live at Moles) LyricsAll I have is all I need enough for love but not for greed, yeah
I was younger once this guy came to me told me about all the honey out there
He said honey gold jewels money women wine cars that shine
I don't know what he was talking about but I think I had an idea
He said smell the rose, the sweet sweet rose
Catch the sun find where it grows
Smell the rose, the sweet rose that grows from castle walls in heaven
In heaven yeah
Well if it feels like summer you're catching the sun
And I'll catch you the moment you fall
Well if it tastes like honey don't swallow it all
Don't wait for the moment to come - and catch the sun
Hey dude, don't lean on me man
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man
I was crossing the city one day
Everybody was flashing by me
Like images of tombstones, images of tombstones
On a Friday night I've seen everybody looking for their little bit of honey
To alleviate the pain, to alleviate the pain
Well if it feels like summer don't burn in the sun
Don't wait for the evening fall
Well if it tastes like honey don't swallow it all
Don't wait for the moment to come - catch the sun
Hey dude, don't lean on me man
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man - and I can't understand
N-no n-no n-no n-no n-no n-no n-no n-no - well I can't understand
When I feel like a man, sing it to me honey!
Ho
Oh yeah
Catch the sun
Hey dude, don't lean on me man
Cause I'm losing my direction and I can't understand, no no
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman when I feel like a man
Hey dude! N-no n-no
Hey dude! N-no n-no
Ooh-ooh yeah
Hey dude, well I do what I can
But you treat me like a woman
When I feel like a man
Oh yeahEmbed
