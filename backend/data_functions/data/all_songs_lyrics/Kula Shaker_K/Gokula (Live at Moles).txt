Gokula (Live at Moles) LyricsIf you won't set me free
I'll have to ride on my own
If you won't let me be
I'll have to find my way home
Bridge
Well the minutes that are getting faster
Push me closer to the edge
Aah....
Aah....
I'm not a photograph
I've got a mind of my own
If you won't set me free
I'll have to find my way home
Aah....
Aah....
Aah....Embed
