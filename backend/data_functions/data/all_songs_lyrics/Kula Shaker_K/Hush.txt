Hush LyricsOne, two, three, hah!
Na na na na na na na na naaa
Na na na na na na na na naaa
Well I got a silly little girl, she's on my mind
Look at her, she looks so fine
She's a best girl that I ever had
Except that she's gonna make me feel so sad
Na na na na na na na na naaa
Na na na na na na na na naaa
Hush, hush...I thought I heard you're calling my name now
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now
Hush, hush...I thought I heard you're calling my name now
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now
Early in the morning, late in the evening
Oh gotta believe me honey, I never was a dreamer
Hush, hush...I thought I heard you're calling my name now
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now
Hush, hush...I thought I heard you're calling my name now
Hush, hush...you broke my heart but that was a dream now
Early in the morning, late in the evening
Ooh yeah!
Na na na na na na na na naaa
Na na na na na na na na naaa
Na na na na na na na na naaa....Embed
