Hollow Man (Live at Moles) LyricsI can only speak the word as quickly as quickly as they come
Looking down upon the bed suspended by a silver thread I'm dreaming
From the feeling I had to be sure
When you know that you've felt this before
It's a long road
Long journey home
Trying to see poetry within the shifting imagery of meaning
Well if you're feeling hollow man just throw the stone to shatter your reflection... with questions
Well if you're trying as hard as you can
To see where you fit in this plan
It's a long road
Long lonely road
It takes time to find the place you love
It takes time to find the place you love
Well if you've got to be sure in that feeling you've got to take time
It takes time to find the place you love
It's a long road
Long journey homeEmbed
