Start All Over LyricsOh my love, I wish that we could start all over
I'm so gone I really want to love again
'Cause I know if it's real, no-one else could understand
Take me back, make me feel, make me real, oh no no
(I'm so gone)
Oh my love, I wish hat we could start all over
I'm so gone, I feel like I'm half way there...
'Cause I know if it's real, no-one else could understand
Take me back, make me feel, make me real, make me real, oh no no
(I'm so gone)
Oh my love, I wish that we could start all over
I'm so gone I really want to love again
I really want to start all over, really want to love again
I really want to start all over, really want to love againEmbed
