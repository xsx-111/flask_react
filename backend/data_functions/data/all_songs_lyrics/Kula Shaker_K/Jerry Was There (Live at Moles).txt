Jerry Was There (Live at Moles) LyricsI'm painting, I paint a picture in your mind
If you're driving roads to suicide, I know you can sympathize
If your lover is a cheatin' and you're blinded by the pain
Your honeymoon in summer is a picnic in the rain
You'll be grateful when you're dead
Yeah you'll be grateful when you're dead
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
I'm shaking, I shake the spear before your eyes
Well if you know your history, you will read between the lines
If you're waiting for a vision, to illuminate your mind
Oh leave this world of misery, oh leave it all behind
You'll be grateful when you're dead
Yeah you'll be grateful when you're dead
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
When you're dead
You'll be grateful when you're dead
Yes you'll be grateful when you're dead
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
Oh yeah
When you're dead
When you're dead
I'm telling you man, Jerry was there
I could feel his presence everywhere
Oh I'm telling you man, Jerry was there
You could feel his presence everywhere
Jerry was there
Jerry was there
Jerry was there
Jerry was there
I seen him man - looked me right in the face!
Yeah!Embed
