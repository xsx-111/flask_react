Into The Deep LyricsInto the deep, the long forgotten sleep
You can feel that your eyes are shut closely now
Where do you know, there's no-one that can know
As you lie you can try to be happy now
Fly brother fly, may you feel the love tonight
Fly brother fly, well I hope you meet your maker
Enter your heart, and never let it part
Yesterday was a lie so be happy now
When all you can feel is what you take as real
Come alive, realise it's a feeling

I know, the time has come to let you go
Time to sleep, to sleepEmbed
