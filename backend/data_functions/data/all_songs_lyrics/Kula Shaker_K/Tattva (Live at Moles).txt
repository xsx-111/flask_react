Tattva (Live at Moles) LyricsTattva, acintya bheda bheda Tattva (4 times)
Like the flower and the scent of summer
Like the sun and the shine
Well the truth may come in strange disguises
Send the message to your mind
Tattva, acintya bheda bheda Tattva (4 times)
At the moment that you wake from sleeping
And you know it's all a dream
Well the truth may come in strange disguises
Never knowing what it means
Tattva, acintya bheda bheda Tattva (4 times)
For you shall be tomorrow
Like you have been today
If this was never ending
What more can you say?Embed
