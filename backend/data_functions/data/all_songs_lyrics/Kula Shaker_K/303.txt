303 LyricsI'm just, I'm just, I'm just a man stuck pushing some wheel
Moving on and down the road to the 303
In the land of summer sun we have just begun
Riding out with my friends in a Mercedes Benz
You can find your way home on the 303
You can let somebody know on the 303
On the 303
Hard times, well all I know is that...
Dark times? Gotta let it go because I got my friends
And I love my friends
Yeah got my friends right to the end
Round the bend, all together now
I've got to, got to get to some place I've not been
Headless guru in the night show me what you mean!
In the land of summer sun we have just begun
Perfect picture card scene, changing all that has been
You can find your way home on the 303
You can let somebody know on the 303
On the 303
Hard times, well all I know is that...
Dark times? Gotta let it go because I got my stash
And I love my hash
Yeah got my stash
Think I'll grow myself a big ol' hairy moustacheEmbed
