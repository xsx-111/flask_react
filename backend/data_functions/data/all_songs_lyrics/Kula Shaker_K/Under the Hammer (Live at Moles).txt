Under the Hammer (Live at Moles) LyricsUnder the hammer, under the hammer again
Under the hammer, under the hammer again
I gotta be strong, gotta be strong yeah
I gotta hold on, hold on to the magical key
Somebody's following me
I've got to know some more than this suffering
There's something more but it's just not happening
I've got to know some more than this hammering
Hammering you
Under the hammer, under the hammer again
Under the hammer, under the hammer again
I've got to be free, heal me mantra
Send me an earthquake, drag the city into the sea
Somebody's following me
I've got some news, everybody's going down
Apocalypse now!Embed
