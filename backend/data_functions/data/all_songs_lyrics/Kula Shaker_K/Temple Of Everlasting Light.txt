Temple Of Everlasting Light LyricsWill I ever see the pleasure that will never end
Hidden in the misty forest that desire sends
Mesmerised like fireflies that are falling through a flame
If I wait I'll be too late to holler out your name
If I wait another day to travel to the east
Time may prey upon me dance upon me with its feet
Hidden in the temple they are building to the sun
Hidden in the forest hidden figure with a gun
I have waited to be here
Now I feel you, I feel you near
Take me homeEmbed
