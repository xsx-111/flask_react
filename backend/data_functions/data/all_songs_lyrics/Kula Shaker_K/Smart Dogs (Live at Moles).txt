Smart Dogs (Live at Moles) LyricsDancing in your shadow
I was riding through a different state of mind
No-one can perceive this state I'm in
It like the living world is blind
It's a feeling like no other
Spending easter with your mother, darling
It's a freaky roller coaster ride
Well if you know the feeling baby
Peel me off the ceiling baby
Did you know the planet earth was blue, turning blue
Don't you try and talk to me
I'm a spaceman sitting in the sky
I'm a sleeping sweetly honey
Let the sleeping pretty smart dogs lie
Let 'em fly
Wait untill tomorrow
See the summer sun upon the ocean sky
Look to the creator, see the masters of magicians fantasise
It's a feeling like no other
Spending easter with your mother darling
It's a freaky roller coaster ride
Well if you know the feeling baby
Peel me up the ceiling baby
Did you know the planet earth was blue, turning blue
Don't you try and talk to me
I'm a spaceman sitting in the sky
I'm a sleeping sweetly honey
Let the sleeping pretty smart dogs lie
Let 'em flyEmbed
