Sweet Home Chicago Lyrics
Oh, baby, don't you want to go
Oh, baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California, to my sweet home Chicago

Oh, baby, don't you want to go
Oh, baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California, to my sweet home Chicago

Now one and one is two, two and two is four
I'm heavy loaded baby, I'm booked, I gotta go
Cryin', baby, honey, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California, to my sweet home Chicago

Now two and two is four, four and two is six
You goin' keep on monkeyin' 'round here friend-boy
You goin' get your business all in a trick
But I'm cryin', baby,  honey, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California, to my sweet home Chicago

Now six and two is eight, eight and two is ten
Friend-boy, she trick you one time she sure gon' do it again
But I'm cryin', hey baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California, to my sweet home Chicago
I'm goin' to California, from there to Des Moines, Iowa
Somebody will tell me that you need my help someday, cryin'
Hey, hey, baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California, to my sweet home ChicagoEmbed
