Phonograph Blues (Take 1) LyricsBeatrice got a phonograph
And it won't say a lonesome word
Beatrice got a phonograph
And it won't say a lonesome word
What evil have I done?
What evil has the poor girl heard?
Beatrice, I love my phonograph
But you broke my windin' chain
Beatrice, I love my phonograph
But you have broke my windin' chain
And you taken my lovin'
And you gave it to your other man
And we played it on the sofa
And we played it side the wall
And we played it on the sofa
And we played it side the wall
But boys, my needles have got rusty
And it will not play at all
Beatrice, I love my phonograph
Mmm, babe, and I'm bound to lose my mind
Beatrice, I love my phonograph
And I'm 'bout to lose my mind
Why don't you bring your clothes back home, baby
And try me one more time
Now my phonograph
Mmm, babe, it won't say a lonesome word
My little phonograph
And it won't say a lonesome word
What evil I have done?
What evil have the poor girl heard?
Now Beatrice
Won't you bring your clothes back home
Now Beatrice
Won't you bring your clothes back home
I wanna wind your little phonograph
Just to hear your little motor moanEmbed
