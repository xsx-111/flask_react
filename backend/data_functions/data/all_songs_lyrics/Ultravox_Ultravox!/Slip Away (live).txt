Slip Away (live) LyricsEnter me gently, I break in the light
Cover my eyes, with the rags of my life
Was I dreaming
Or did you say
The frontiers are falling
It's time to be slipping away
Let's slip away
Let's slip away
All things fall from me, the bonds and the veils
All things blow by me, my sorrows have sails
Was I dreaming
Or did you say
The empires are fading
It's time to be slipping away
Let's slip away
Let's slip away
What am I to do
Don't leave me
What is there to say, I really...
We're just wasting time
Let the night takes its place
Colour my eyes with the dusk of this wonderful day
Let's slip away
Let's slip away
Letters from lovers are lining my grate
Some came too early and some came too late
Were you speaking
Or did I say
The frontiers have fallen
It's time to be slipping away
As you call me
My hands they fall open
My mouth it is frozen
The chrysalis tumbles
I'm falling
Slow motion
