The Wild, the Beautiful and the Damned (live) LyricsCalling cards of madness
Pull the brass men from their knees
To petrify more images
To dangle just outside the reach
Of the stunted and the dreamless ones
Who have nothing left to keep
For frozen dawns or nights
As cold as these have been
Don't ask for explanations
There's nothing left you'd understand
You're one of the wild, the beautiful and the damned
The damned
The wild, the beautiful and the damned
We read the latest venereal journals
Flicked through some catalogues of fear
You tore some more pages from your old lovers' hearts
Then we engineered a wild reunion in a Berlin alleyway
While your New York FÃ¼hrer tore our universe apart
Don't ask for explanations
There's nothing left you'd understand
You're one of the wild, the beautiful and the damned
The damned
The wild, the beautiful and the damned
Break my legs politely
I'll spit my gold teeth out at you
Your sores are almost big enough to step right inside now
I'll send you truckloads of flowers from all the worlds that you stole from me
I'll spin a coin in the madhouse
While I watch you drowning
Don't ask for explanations
There's nothing left you'd understand
You're one of the wild, the beautiful and the damned
The damned
The wild, the beautiful and the damned
The damned
The wild, the beautiful and the damned
The damned
The wild, the beautiful and the damned
The wild, the beautiful and the damnedEmbed
