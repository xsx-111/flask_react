I Want to Be a Machine LyricsI found the bones of all your ghosts
Locked in the wishing well
While birdsong gourmets dragged empty nets
I slumbered in my shell
Im Mitternacht, die Mensch-Maschine
Kissed me on my eyes
I rose and left the fire-ladies
Glowing lonely in the night
With all the pornographers
Burning torches beneath the sea
I want to be a machine
I want to be a machine
I want to be a machine
I stole a cathode face from newscasts
And a crumbling fugue of songs
From the reservoir of video souls
In the lakes beneath my tongue
In flesh of ash and silent movies
I walked that boulevard again
A nebula of unfinished creatures
From the lifetimes of my friends
I howled your innocence has depraved me
I want to be a machine
I want to be a machine
I want to be a machine
Broadcast me, scrambled clean
Or free me from this flesh
Let the armchair cannibals take their fill
In every cell across wilderness
We'll trip such a strangled tango
We'll waltz a wonderland affair
Let's run to meet the tides tomorrow
Leave all emotion dying there
In the star cold
Beyond all of your dreams
I want to be a machine
I want to be a machine
I want to be a machine
Ah!Embed
