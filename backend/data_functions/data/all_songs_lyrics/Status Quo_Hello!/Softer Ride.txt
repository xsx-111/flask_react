Softer Ride LyricsI ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no more
Stay in bed
Til' I'm satisfied
And let my head
Take a softer ride
I ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no more
I ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no more
Find me a schack
Where it's cool inside
Turn my back
On the cold outside
I ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no more
I could go back
To the job I had
But the same old thing
Only drives me mad, so
I ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no more
Never again
Will I have to be..down
I ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no more
Stay in bed
Til' I'm satisfied
And let my head
Take a softer ride
I ain't gonna work
I ain't gonna work no moreEmbed
