Joanne LyricsSitting here, and all alone
Like a cold and broken stone
I'm dreaming of touching you
Silent now, an empty page
Colder than the????age
Above now is where we'll be
Oh Joanne, you're not with me
Through the turning of a wheel
Turning more and more until
You realise it's come too soon
Surely there is still a way
If we believe in yesterday
Oh Joanne, if you would try
Oh Joanne, don't pass me by
Think of all the friends we had
No-one heard when they were sad
To lose us as I lost you
If you ever change your mind
I'll be here, don't look behind
Oh Joanne, I love you still
Oh Joanne, I love you still
Think of all the friends we had
No-one heard when they were sad
To lose us as I lost you
If you ever change your mind
I'll be here, don't look behind
Oh Joanne, I love you still
Oh Joanne, I love you still
Sitting here, and all alone
Like a cold and broken stone
I'm dreaming of touching you
Oh Joanne, I love you stillEmbed
