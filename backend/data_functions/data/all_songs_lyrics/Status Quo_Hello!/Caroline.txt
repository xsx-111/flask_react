Caroline LyricsIf you want to turn me on to
Now anything you really want to
Turn me on to your love
Sweet love
If the night time is the right time
Oh anytime of yours is my time
We can find time for love
Sweet love
Come on sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take ya
I really gotta make ya
Come on sweet Caroline
Take my hand, together we can rock'n'roll
When I'm thinking of you sleeping
I'm at home alone and weeping
Are you keeping your love
Sweet love
Do you still care when I'm not there
Now do you really wish I was there
Can I come there for love
Sweet love
Come on sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take ya
I really gotta make ya
Come on sweet Caroline
Take my hand, together we can rock'n'roll
If you want to turn me on to
Now anything you rally want to
Turn me on to your love
Sweet love
Come on sweet Caroline
You're my sweet Caroline
You know I wanna take ya
I really gotta make ya
Come on sweet Caroline
Take my hand, together we can rock'n'rollEmbed
