Claudie LyricsIt's so long since I sang songs for you
I forget all the words I once knew
I could look back but I can't waste the time
Did it matter they sometimes didn't rhyme?
It's so long since I sang songs for you
It's so long since you smiled just for me
Now your smile's just an old used-to-be
Does it matter that I can't take the time?
Would you rather I write you one more line?
Can my songs once again be for you?
Claudie made a fool out of me
Made me find another place to be
I've been living alone
In a house that wasn't my own
With Claudie is the place I long to be
When I left, did you think of me crying?
Did you care that I felt I was dying?
I pretended that I don't give a damn
All along I've known what I really am
I'm a fool little Claudie just for you
Claudie made a fool out of me
Made me find another place to be
I've been living alone
In a house that wasn't my own
With Claudie is the place I long to beEmbed
