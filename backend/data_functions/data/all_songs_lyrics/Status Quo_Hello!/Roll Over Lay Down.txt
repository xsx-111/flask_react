Roll Over Lay Down LyricsWhen I got home that night early one morning
Seeing the note written in ink pinned to the door
Drinking the drink cold from the fridge on the table
I drank a toast you were the most the night before
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over it's a long way where I've been
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over lay down
When I get home tomorrow night after this morning
Show me the care you showed in the note the night before
Maybe I won't take a drink from the table
Reckon I'll lay me straight down on the floor
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over it's a long way where I've been
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over lay down
When I get home tomorrow night after this morning
Show me the day, show me the note the night before
Maybe I won't take a drink from the table
Reckon I'll lay me straight down on the floor
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over it's a long way where I've been
Roll over lay down and let me in
Roll over lay downEmbed
