Blue Eyed Lady LyricsLittle blue eyed lady, how come you're all alone?
I've been asking, no-one seems to know
To whom do you belong little blue eyed lady?
The band are really moving, everyone is grooving around
Little lady, you're still sitting down
Excuse me if you will, little blue eyed lady
The party's nearly over, your eyes still read the same
Are you looking for one who never came?
Are you a passing cloud or a new found baby?
Little new found baby, how come you're all alone?
I've been asking, no-one seems to know
Are you a passing cloud little blue eyed ladyEmbed
