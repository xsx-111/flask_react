A Reason for Living LyricsI felt in need of some loving so I sat down on a wall
I tried to find a reason for living, but I couldn't find a reason at all
So I owned up to my maker and I started to say a prayer
I waited for an answer but there wasn't anybody there
I thought there should have been someone, but I wasn't quite sure who
It finished me to find there was no-one that I could take my troubles to
So I knelt down by my bedside and I started to say a prayer
It was when I asked for nothing I could feel that there was somebody there
I'm looking still, but it's easy 'cos I know which way to go
It doesn't matter how long it takes me 'cos there's someone there to help me who knows
All the things that I am after, all the loving that I want to share
It's so hard but I don't mind 'cos there really is someone there
I felt in need of some loving so I sat down on a wall
I tried to find a reason for living, but I couldn't find a reason at all
So I owned up to my maker and I started to say a prayer
I waited for an answer but there wasn't anybody thereEmbed
