A Fair Judgement Lyrics

Losing sleep, In too deep
Fading sun, What have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here

Cut the ties, Uncover disguise
Left behind all intertwined
Lost control, Moved out of the role now
Nothing's left here

Leave it be
It was meant to be
Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
A fair judgement is served

Losing sleep, In too deep
Fading sun, What have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here
