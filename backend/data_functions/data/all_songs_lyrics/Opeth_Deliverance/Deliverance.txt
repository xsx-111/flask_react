Deliverance LyricsFloating on mist
Crept up the caverns of my brain
Receiving no warning
From nothing to a life code
Walk with me, you'll never leave
Wait to see your spirit free
Tell me how your heart's in need
As I drown you in the sea
Unwinding snares of distrust
Your wrist in my fast grip
Look me in the eye, I'm clear
This is your time
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
From love to death in a time span of seconds
Oblivious to regret, pushed into belief
In liquid cellophane gasping for air
Mercy in my eyes is the shade of the night
Face down beneath the waterline
Gazing into the deep
The piercing sounds you make
Soaring higher, higher now
And once left in my wake
Your memory is nothing but the scars on me
All over now, forgotten why I needed this
Standing down, disappear into the obscure
Resting days waiting for new disease
Biding time, looked inside insanity
It always burns within
The downward spiral never ends
When driven into sin
Your salvation's found in a sinner's deed
All over now, forgotten why I needed this
Standing down, disappear into the obscure
Resting days waiting for new disease
Biding time, looked inside insanity
The devil guides the way, tells me what to say
Pours himself inside and snuffs the final light
Deliverance
Thrown back at me
Deliverance
Laughing at me
Deliverance
Thrown back at me
Deliverance
Laughing at me
