7th Seal Lyrics
Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll come in
From a sky kingdom
Hear the trumpets
And then
Be advised they'll come
From a pure black whirlwind
Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll come

Running butt-naked hysterical in the flames
Miracles never claim
Captive, devious, dubious, doobies, doomed
Damned in hell
Forever jump back you crack rock heifer
Suffer heavy consequences
In a harsher marsh environment, blend
Your wrinkled up, racked up
Rear end intend's then to bubble
Like plasma, amoeba, placebo, black rain fall
Searing us all as I talk all
Thou not knoweth he had been betrayed
Bushwhacked and rattled in a hurry of scurries
Hurry, don't worry be afraid for your soul
Up, up, and away we go
Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll come in
The wink of an eye then the sun
Will shine no longer for anyone
Be advised they'll come
Some more sure that they'll win
Be advised they'll come
Synchronized with the one

Göbekli Tepe, Alpha Centauri race
The Quasar
Starting age old schemes of global subjugation
Close to grinful? wishing
Warping telekinetic measures of rhythmic unison
And other mindless timeless shine
Beacon brewing commentary streaks
Intuitive to the most minute details of your physiology
And anatomical function
Conjunction, Junction
Your life energy will invigorate and renew
The fragments of stagnant flows
Unvalued attempts to stand juxtapose
A spiritual prose
Inscribe and tryed to try transferring
Blurring, stirring, foes
Up and away in the UFOs
But I'm OK you're OK, I'm OK you're OK
Just remember death is coming
Sooner for some, later for some
Never for the chosen Kingdom Come
Walking red, stalking dread
Seeking no solution, resolution for the head
Turmoil
Bloody was a thought when my buddy had been shot
When he died we all cried some say "Why?"
He's in a better place where I
Settle down, heaven bound, unleavened bread
Woven cobwebs and vision excloak
The entrance when they fled from the living dead
Smoke burning magical sparkling exuberance
Extends from burnt aroma's and those
Expose to doses, psychosis and rose his blades
In such splendor
Immortality vender, immorality
Reality alley oddity, oddity, oddity
Time allocated determined life itself
I stab myself I stem myself
I shuffle and shift-shape wraith
I’m grabbed by elves
Dragging me gagging me
To Middle Earth, visions
Spectral analysis
Brass palaces lustrous halls of untold gold
Come to splash in bold textures
Holy invigorating when caressed to brush my teeth with crest
Smiles pictured
As we inanimate
Heard by relatives animates at these decease, disease
I'll plunge into a plethora of horror's
Kinda anatomical? quick chop, chip, done
Be advised they'll come
Be advised they'll come in
Some will die resurrection
Seven seals of perfection
Be advised they'll come
Untelevised revolution
Be advised they'll come
And you'll account for all you've done

Woe is the foe of the Son of the Father of time
Disturbing the cornerstone of my shrine
Shines like the gem like light of sparkle of jasper and carnelian in emerald rainbow
Thus I come emit the cloud
Hear the sound of trumpets
The war of rushing waters loud
I vowed an allegiance with many scientific minds
Stonehenge consume the tomb, no binge
Revenge, avenge the Mother Earth by the first and second close encounter of the third
I reckon the fourth will beckon humanity
I need no warning1Embed
