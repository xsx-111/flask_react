For No Reason LyricsYes, I'm in the right state of mind
And I did it for a precise reason
Destroying everyone in the immediate area
Just... like... that
A hopeless case...
A hopeless case...
He's mad..
A black cat was in the street
I heard a beat from my black jeep
Alarm went beep
BANG! I laid her in a seat
Walked away singing melodies
I just committed some murders by the trees
Saw some bush-es, so I took a piss
And you don't wanna fuck with this
For no reason...
"destroying everyone in the immediate area
Just... like... that"
(x3)
I'm on the next block, murderin' nonstop
Saw some fools in a flock so I threw a rock
To see if they would move, but they didn't
BANG! good riddance
Walked away singing melodies
I just committed some murders by the trees
Saw some bush-es, so I took a piss
And you don't wanna fuck with this
For no reason...
On Melrose, with no clothes
Pretending to be homeless, but boneless(?)
So ruthless and useless
This took a place which rock groups hang out
BANG! until a fag came out
He put his hand on his crotch
My finger was on the trigger pulling it back another notch
I didn't know if it was a man or woman
BANG!
Bullets were coming for no reason
"destroying everyone in the immediate area
Just... like... that"
(x5)
"...a hopeless case..."
"...running loose on the streets..."
"...he's mad..."
I mean, it was like I didn't mean to kill him
("...a hopeless case...")
I was enraged, I was angry
What they always say, that peace with reality is scary
So remember, you might get caught, for no reason1Embed
