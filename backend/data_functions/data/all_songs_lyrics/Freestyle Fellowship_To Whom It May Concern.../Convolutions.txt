Convolutions Lyrics
Acey chi-chi-chee
A cha-cha-cha, oh!
You got the leather it'll get ya where it gotcha
Who, me-me-me-me?
A ma-ma-ma, wow!
You got the leather it'll get ya where it's caught
Please grab the 40 and pour on a high contour
I endure for more on a shore
In beds for reds and nets and let's get some of this
Synopsis

Next up is a bomb comin' at ya
Composed a complex rhymes
Another batch to start a rhyme
Eclipse straight from black lips
Those who wanna fig get crushed like corn chips

Jazz, bebop and blues
Ask me 'bout the rules and do's and don't snooze
Sit up, red eye bloodshot ?
Extra curricular vernacular particularly
Secular music, music, music...
Know the convolutions of hip hop and jazzEmbed
