We Will Not Tolerate Lyrics
We will not tolerate beating, lynching, burning, raping
Pillaging, drugging, mass-murdering of blacks—we are not your
O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y R-A-P-P-E-R
N-I-G-G-E-R-S—on our chest
Is wickedness, the press is telling us lies
We will not tolerate white men murdering black men, taking 'em home, chopping their bones, and smothering them with plastic
And dipping their heads in acid—wonder if Dahmer dies? Huh!

We will not tolerate!
We will not tolerate!

We will not tolerate Daryl Gates, hates, beats blacks
Creates mistakes, false facts—fuck that, get myyy—
—gat from under my hat, surprise; wait! Don't wait! Anticipate
Fate, liberate state of mind, necessary millimeter nine
We're reaching out so we can feed the blind, here, it's clear

We will not tolerate—fear!

Hoo-hah!
We are not your O-R-D-I-N-A-R-Y
