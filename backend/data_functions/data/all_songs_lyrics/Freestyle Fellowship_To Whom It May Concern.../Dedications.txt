Dedications Lyrics
On behalf of the Freestyle Fellowship
I would like to dedicate this album to all the loved ones who have passed away
Peace and blessings upon the memories of our fallen soldiers
They shall never be forgotten
Under the circumstances, we elect not to read an obituary or signify gang affiliations and what not
But, we deemed it necessary to express our sympathy to their families and friends
We must be strong, we must be strong
And control ourselves
For the killing of each other must stop
Homicide, genocide, suicide
Satan, Allah curse him, is real
In addition, I would like to dedicate this whole Freestyle Fellowship album
To my aunt, Avella Lions?, and my grandfather Henderson
And to a sister that was very close to me, MC Trouble
I would also like to dedicate it to someone close to me
Dana James?
And these rappers, the entire Freestyle Fellowship
Would like to dedicate this LP
To the loss of our only rap station, KDAYEmbed
