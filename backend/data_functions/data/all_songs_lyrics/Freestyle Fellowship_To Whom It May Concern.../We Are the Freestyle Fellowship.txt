We are the Freestyle Fellowship...
Assalamualaikum. Well, here we areâ€”the Freestyle Fellowship. We exist as a shining focal point in a multi-faceted gem of urban contemporary artists. And we ain't got no trials or tribulations endured by those victimized in the Babylonian exploits of tyranny, destruction, and institutionalized enslavement. Freestyle Fellowship becomes the microphone for their cries; reiterating what they hear, describing what they see. Humanitarian in general, we find, within infrastructure of our equalitarian views, a deep-seated affection for our people; a race called "Black." Acknowledging rap as an art form, we break the rules and set new standards in the vocal arena by experimenting in tonal and harmonic inflections and sporadic pitch changes and deliveries. We'll stir your emotion and take rap music to its threshold of enlightenment. And, beyond a shadow of a doubt, my brethren and sisteren; we came here tonight to blow up
Strictly blow upEmbed
