Legal Alien Lyrics(Why are you an alien?)

Because I'm treated like a Klingon
I get stabbed in the back as I'm beat on
By these non-natives, they call me a trespasser
I was first on the planet but now I'm last
On the polls of progress
Check the latest figures
The average Black, nothing but a house nigga
In a permanent underclass - yes the lowest
One paycheck away from being the homeless
Kept like a pet, don't bite that white hand that feeds you
That's exactly what I'm gonna do
Straight going for self like a pitbull
Cause I'm so fed up, my stomach is full of these
Lies, stereotypes keep us weak
We're taught how to look, how to act and even speak
By another man, or should I say a true preacher
The devil in uniform, he's posing as teacher
But let's not talk about him, let's talk about us
Cause they won't change so we just must
Take a look around, we're programmed to keep on failin'
In their eyes, we're the legal aliens

(Once you understand something, usually you must act upon it)
What about the ways we alienate each other?
Using the term but rarely do we act as brothers
'Cause brothers are down for each other through all types of grit
Even 400 years on the wrong continent
Speakin' through a bastard language
I came to express to you my mental anguish
Brothers never actin' in accord with the times
It's not just Black on Black crime
But Black on Black racism, Black on Black on jealousness
A Black on another Black's back so he can benefit
One's in a mansion while his cousin's in the street
We all have rhythm so why are we all offbeat?
Trying to compete to get the light man's affections
He only wants to see us in his correction facilities
And take advantage of our abilities
I'm speaking so the next man can see
How the world turns and why society wants to do us in
'Cause I'm a legal alien


I call us legal cause we're allowed to be here
Just as long as we give these laws of the land programmed
To a slant towards light man, specifically the white man
And everywhere you look the Blacks are labelled as crooks
When we're actually objects that got took
A little fact that's never enough mentioned
Inside any type of school system
But the negative is pumped like a curse
Until the Black situation only gets worse
'Cause being ignorant of self, just leads to failure
There's so many facts they don't tell 'ya
You can't always believe what you read, hear, and see
When its benefit is not for you or me
But for them with the power in the light skin
All in all it's a system of racism
And that's what outsiders don't wanna see
They thinkin' Blacks should shut up and be happy
In a land where opportunities come in mobs
Yet we seem to be locked out of decent jobs
Why? - because of indecent education
False facts will never raise the nubian nation
Until we realize all of these troubles, we're locked in
With title of legal aliens
(Can you feel it?) (X15)
(Can you feel it? Nothin' can save 'ya)1Embed
