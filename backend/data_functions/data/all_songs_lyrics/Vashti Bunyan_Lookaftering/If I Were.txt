If I Were LyricsIf I were to go away
Would you follow me to the ends of the earth
To show me what your love is worth
Or would you go and buy a car
Shrug your shoulders, say, "There you are
She didn't love me anyway
If she had, she would have stayed"
If I were to go away
Would I always look for your beautiful face
In every crowd, every place
Or would I go and buy a hat
Turn my shoulders, say, "That is that
He didn't love me, now it's clear
If he had, he would be here"7Embed
