Lately LyricsNever was much given to prayer
But lately I'm pleading with the air
To keep you safe from harm my dears
The only things that you should keep in rows
Are your perfect teeth - and the rest you know
Its own sweet way will always go
Add your footsteps to the wear
For a tiny dent in every stair
Will let them know that you've been thereEmbed
