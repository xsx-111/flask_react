Here Before Lyrics
Once I had a child
He was wilder than moonlight
He could do it all
Like he'd been here before

Once I had a child
She was smiling like sunshine
She could see it all
Like she'd been here before

Then I had a child
Took his while like northern summer
And he knows it all
Like he's been here before

Once I had a child
He was wilder than moonlight
He could do it all
Like he'd been here before

Once I had a child
She was smiling like sunshine
She could see it all
Like she'd been here before1Embed
