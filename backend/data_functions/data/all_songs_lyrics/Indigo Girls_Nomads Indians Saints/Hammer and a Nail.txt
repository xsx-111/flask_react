Hammer and a Nail Lyrics
Clearing webs from the hovel
A blistered hand on the handle of a shovel
I've been digging too deep
I always do
I see my face on the surface
I look a lot like narcissus
A dark abyss of an emptiness
Standing on the edge of a drowning blue

I look behind my ears for the green
And even my sweat smells clean
Glare off the white hurts my eyes

I gotta get out of bed
Get a hammer and a nail
Learn how to use my hands
Not just my head
I think myself into jail
Now I know a refuge never grows
From a chin in a hand
And a thoughtful pose
Gotta tend the earth
If you want a rose
I had a lot of good intentions
Sit around for fifty years
And then collect a pension
Started seeing the road to hell
And just where it starts
But my life is more than a vision
The sweetest part is acting
After making a decision
Started seeing the whole
As a sum of its parts

And I look behind my ears for the green
And even my sweat smells clean
Glare off the white hurts my eyes

Gotta get out of bed
Get a hammer and a nail
Learn how to use my hands
Not just my head
I think myself into jail
Now I know a refuge never grows
From a chin in a hand
And a thoughtful pose
Gotta tend the earth
If you want a rose
My life is part of the global life
I'd found myself becoming more immobile
When I'd think a little girl in the world
Can't do anything
A distant nation my community
And a street person my responsibility
If I have a care in the world
I have a gift to bring

I look behind my ears for the green
Even my sweat smells clean
Glare off the white hurts my eyes

I gotta get out of bed
Get a hammer and a nail
Learn how to use my hands
Not just my head
I think myself into jail
Now I know a refuge never grows
From a chin in a hand
And a thoughtful pose
Gotta tend the earth
If you want a roseEmbed
