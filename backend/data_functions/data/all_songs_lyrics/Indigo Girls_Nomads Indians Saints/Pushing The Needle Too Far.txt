Pushing The Needle Too Far LyricsWell, I woke up this morning, grey dawn
With a prayer on my breath
See, I lost something precious, and God'll save me
From losing myself
I said 'I think I know what's wrong, I think I know what's wrong'
Now, I met the Queen and I understand why
She closed the door
I'm not making excuses, but you know I've been there a few times
I was knocking on her door
I said 'I think I know what's wrong, I think I know what's wrong'
There's a man, he lived in a house, had a family of five
Well, he blew up the windows and the doors, he just couldn't survive
Well, we've all been removed in one way or another
We don't know our families, we don't need our brothers
Pushing the needle too far
Pushing the needle too far
Well, if you wake up in the morning, grey dawn
With a prayer on your breath
See, maybe you lost something precious, God'll save you
From losing yourself
You'll say, 'I think I know what's wrong, I think I know what's wrong'
It's the queen who closed the door, the family that lies
The people who turn, the cat that has died
A boy that OD's, a girl with a gun
The world on its knees and a band on the run
You help me more by not giving in
I said 'I think I know what's wrong, I think I know what's wrong'
Pushing the needle too farEmbed
