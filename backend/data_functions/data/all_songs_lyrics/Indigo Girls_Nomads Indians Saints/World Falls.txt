World Falls Lyrics
I'm coming home with a stone
Strapped onto my back
I'm coming home with a burning hope
Turning all my blues to black
I'm looking for a sacred hand
To carve into my stone
A ghost of comforts, angel's breath
To keep this life inside my chest

This world falls on me
Hopes of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shaking me

Now I woke up in the middle of a dream
Scared the world was too much for me
Sejarez said, "Don't let go
Just plant the seeds and watch them grow"
I've slept in rainy canyon lands
Cold drenched to my skin
I always wake to find a face
To calm these troubled lands
Ah this world falls on me
With dreams of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shaking me

Now I'm running
To the end of the earth
And I'm swimming
To the edge of the sea
And I'm laughing
I'm under a starry sky
This world was meant for me
Don't bury me
Carry me

I wish I was a nomad
An Indian or a saint
The edge of death would disappear
Leave me nothing left to taint
I wish I was a nomad
An Indian or a saint
Give me walking shoes
Feathered arms
And a key to heaven's gate
Ah this world falls on me
Dreams of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shaking me

I'm running
This world falls on me
To the end of the earth
With hopes of immortality
I'm swimming
Everywhere I turn
To the edge of the sea
The beauty just keeps shaking me
And i'm laughing
This world falls on me
'Cause i'm under a starry sky
Hopes of immortality
This world was meant for me
Everywhere I turn
I've got hopes of immortalityEmbed
