Hand Me Downs LyricsI've taken so many down
I've helped them all to dismount
I've followed so many down
I take their hand me downs
All with hope
All with hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
All with hope
All with hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
To us all
Everything that i believe
Crawls from underneath the streets
Everything i truly love
Comes from somewhere far above
Everything that i believe
Is wrong with you is wrong with me
Everything i truly love
I love in you and i love in me
So give me hope
Give me hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
To us all
You swear you can't swim the river
(i've become the beggar now)
(you've become the saint somehow)
But i saw you running to jump in
(i've become the beggar now)
(you've become the saint somehow)
I swore i'd never be your sinner
(i've become the beggar now)
(you've become the saint somehow)
Til i held your sin
Hand me downs
Now you ask me why i'm here
The same as you
I'm scared - it's fear
I've become the beggar now
And you've become the saint somehow
Twist the words and place the blame
And tell me now aren't we the same
Tripping in our yellow feet
Checking underneath our sheets
For some hope
Give me hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
Give me hope
Give me hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
To us allEmbed
