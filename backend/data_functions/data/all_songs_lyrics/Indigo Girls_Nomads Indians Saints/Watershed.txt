Watershed Lyrics
Thought I knew my mind
Like the back of my hand
The gold and the rainbow
But nothing panned out as I planned
They say only milk and honey's
Gonna make your soul satisfied
Well I better learn how to swim
'Cause the crossing is chilly and wide

Twisted guardrails on the highway
Broken glass on the cement
A ghost of someone's tragedy
How recklessly my time has been spent
They say that it's never too late
But you don't, you don't get any younger
Well I better learn how to starve the emptiness
And feed the hunger

Up on the watershed
Standing at the fork in the road
You can stand there and agonize (Stand there and agonize)
'Til your agony's your heaviest load
You'll never fly as the crow flies
Get used to a country mile
When you're learning to face (Learning to face)
The path at your pace
Every choice is worth your while
And there's always retrospect
(When you're looking back)
To light a clearer path
Every five years or so I look back on my life
And I have a good laugh
You start at the top (Start at the top)
Go full circle round
Catch a breeze
Take a spill
But ending up where I started again
Makes me wanna stand still

Up on the watershed
Standing at the fork in the road
You can stand there and agonize (Stand there and agonize)
'Til your agony's your heaviest load
You'll never fly as the crow flies
Get used to a country mile
When you're learning to face (Learning to face)
The path at your pace
Every choice is worth your while

Stepping on a crack (Stepping on a crack)
Breaking up and looking back
'Til every tree limb overhead just seems to sit and wait
'Til every step you take becomes a twist of fate (Twist of fate)
Up on the watershed
Standing at the fork in the road
You can stand there and agonize
'Til your agony's your heaviest load
You'll never fly as the crow flies
Get used to a country mile
When you're learning to face (Learning to face)
The path at your pace
Every choice is worth your while
Up on the watershed
Standing at the fork in the road
You can stand there and agonize (Stand there and agonize)
'Til your agony's your heaviest load
You'll never fly as the crow flies
Get used to a country mile
When you're learning to face (Learning to face)
The path at your pace
Every choice is worth your while

And when you're learning to face
The path at your pace
Every choice is worth your whileEmbed
