You and Me of the 10,000 Wars Lyrics
You and me of the ten thousand wars
Dividing life into factions of pleasure and chores
A bed to be made and a bed to lie in
A hand in the darker side and our sights set on Zion

The heart of a skeptic and the mind of a child
Put my life in a box and let my imagination run wild
Pour the cement for my feet
The heart and the mind on a parallel course
Never the two shall meet

And oh, the dissatisfied with the satisfied
Everybody loves a melodrama
And the scandal of a lie
Still you held your arms open for the prodigal daughter
I see my eyes in your eyes through my eyes
Still waters

Try making one and one make one
Twist the shapes until everything comes undone
Watch the wizard behind the curtain
The larger than life and the power of seeming certain
The evil ego and the vice of pride
Is there ever anything else
That makes us take our different sides?
I wanted everything to feed me
About as full as I got was of myself
And the upper echalons of mediocrity

And oh, the dissatisfied with the satisfied
Everybody loves a melodrama
And the scandal of a lie
Still you held your arms open for the prodigal daughter
I see my eyes in your eyes through my eyes
Still waters
Still waters

After the battle and we're still around
Everything once up in the air has settled down
Sweep the ashes, let the silence find us
A moment of peace is worth every war behind us

You and me of the ten thousand warsEmbed
