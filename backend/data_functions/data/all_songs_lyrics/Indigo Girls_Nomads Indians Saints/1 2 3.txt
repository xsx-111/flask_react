1 2 3 LyricsFrom the bowery to the brimstone I tried to find your heart
The drugs of initiation, the bottom of a barrel that drops
I understand your causes sympathize with motivation
All the details of this war are just self-infatuation
1 2 3
Nothing's for free
4 5 6
Pick up the sticks
And go home
Your manic blood runs thick my friend are you looking for a clean escape
What's left when the locks have all been broken young children of authority
Tell me how long can you be agile dancing between the alter and the merci seat
Now here's a chance to make a choice are you aware of the fire beneath your feet
1 2 3
Nothing's for free
4 5 6
Pick up the sticks
And go home
You better own up to me
Yeah Yeah
Go home
The basement lies within us
Our fear comes through the door
Now there's nothing left between us
As the fear becomes a roar
Once that wheel is in motion don't lose what you have found
We're talking bout the burning wheel of tongues everything that makes it go round and round
We're all born in the devil's scorn he wants to see you die
I'm asking you, "are you true", and everything they say is a lie is a lie now
1 2 3
Nothing's for free
4 5 6
Pick up the sticks
And go 1 2 3
Nothing's for free
4 5 6
Pick up the sticks
And go 1 2 3 (we're all born)
Nothing's for free (in the devil's scorn)
1 2 3 (we're all born)
Nothing's for free (in the devil's scorn)
And everything they say is a lie it's a lie now
Everything they say is a lie it's a lie
Pick up the sticks (pick up the sticks)
Pick up the sticks (pick up the sticks)
Pick up the sticks (pick up the sticks)
Pick up the sticksEmbed
