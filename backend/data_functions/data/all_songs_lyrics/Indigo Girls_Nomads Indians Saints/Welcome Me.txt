Welcome Me LyricsWelcome me to your city of angels
Devil prophets still hold my hand
I walked your stillborn streets for hours
Ethnic echoes spitting out their trials
They tell me i'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
Welcome me to a haven given
It's well received into my open arms
Oh i ran in my sleep through shaking tremors
I felt the splitting earth echoing in my ears
I feel it i'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
Welcome me to your city of angels
There's a devil monkey laying on our backs
Now tell me where's the heart
Where's the bullet for breaking
Who's gonna give me a weapon
A pacifying weapon
I need it i'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon oh
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I'll be the first to praise the sun
I said i said welcome me
The first to praise the moon oh
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I said welcome meEmbed
