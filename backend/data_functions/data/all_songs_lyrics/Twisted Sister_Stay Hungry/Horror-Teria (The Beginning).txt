Horror-Teria (The Beginning) Lyrics

Oh, it's so nice to see you all inside my dreamy little world
And it's so nice to be with all you lovely little boys and girls
Make yourselves comfortable
My place is so divine
Don't you think I'm wonderful?
Say yes! You're on my time

Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy

Don't try to leave the doors are locked and only I have got the key
Forget the windows they're nailed shut and boarded up
So you can't see
You'll love the light show
Oh, I'm sure you'll think it's swell
When they go off
Your welcome to my living Hell

Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Come here, my sweet
Let me help you with that
There that's better

I'm overjoyed at all the games I'm playing here with you today
But I'm so sad the party's over and we can no longer play
You think you're going home
To your own little bed
But that's impossible
You can't sleep when your dead

Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away
From Captain Howdy
Stay away

It happened
In the broad daylight
So unexpected came the knife
A child's scream
Sliced through the air
But no one came
Or seemed to care
No!
The man's description
Did little good
A local stranger
From the neighborhood
Those little kids
Ooh, he left behind
With their mangled lives
And their tortured minds
Since he didn't seem to care
Then don't you think it's only fair?

Call for street justice!
Let no mercy show!
Call for street justice!
Don't let him go!
The man was caught
And brought before a judge
Who had just returned
From a three drink lunch
His lawyer screamed
"You must set him free!"
And off he went
On a technicality
Since the law don't seem to care
Then don't you think it's only fair?

Call for street justice!
Why should parents cry?
Call for street justice!
How many have to die?

The mob assembled
Smoke filled the air
And marched in anger
To do what's fair
To bring to justice
This soulless thing
And show the others
What Evil brings
Now before you shake your head
Think if it was your child instead

Call for street justice!
Tell me what you'd do
Call for street justice!
Pray this isn't true
Call for street justice!
Why should parents cry?
Call for street justice!
How many have to die?
Call for street justice!
When slime escapes the law
Call for street justice!
We'll even up the score
Call for street justice!
Let no mercy show!
Call for street justice!
Kill him, kill him, get him, kill him, get him!Embed
