Burn in Hell Lyrics
Welcome to the abandoned land
Come on in, child, take my hand
Here there's no work or play
Only one bill to pay
There's just five words to say
As you go down, down, down...

You're gonna burn in Hell!
Oh, burn in Hell!

You can't believe all the things I've done wrong in my life
Without even trying, I've lived on the edge of a knife
Well, I've played with fire, I don't want to get myself burned
To thine own self be true, so I think that it's time for a turn

Before I burn in Hell!
Oh, burn in Hell!

Take one good look in your heart, tell me what do you see?
It's black and it's dark, now is that how you want it to be?
It's up to you, what you do will decide your own fate
Make your choice now, for tomorrow may be far too late
And then you'll burn in Hell! (Hear no Evil, don't you see no Evil)
Oh, burn in Hell! (Don't you lay no Evil, down on me)
You're gonna burn in Hell! (Speak no Evil, don't you think no Evil)
Oh, burn in hell! (Don't you play with Evil, 'cause I'm free)


Hear no Evil, don't you see no Evil, don't you lay no Evil down on me
You're gonna burn in Hell!
Speak no Evil, don't you think no Evil, don't you play with Evil, 'cause I'm free
You're gonna burn in Hell!
Hear no Evil, don't you see no Evil, don't you lay no Evil down on me
You're gonna burn in Hell!
Speak no Evil, don't you think no Evil, don't you play with Evil, 'cause I'm free
You're gonna burn in Hell!

Hear no Evil, don't you see no Evil, don't you lay no Evil down on me
Oh, burn in Hell!
You're gonna burn in Hell!
Speak no Evil, don't you think no Evil, don't you play with Evil, 'cause I'm free
Oh, burn in Hell!
You're gonna burn in Hell!Embed
