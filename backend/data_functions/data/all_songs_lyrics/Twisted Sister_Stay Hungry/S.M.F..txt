S.M.F. Lyrics
Black sheep of the family
Nothing like the rest
Separate from the others
Failing all their tests
Can't they see you're different
So hungry and so lean
You're a walking wonder
You're a metal machine
Look and you'll see
You're a lot like me

You're an S.M.F
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.-M.-F

Caught up in their worries
And tomorrow's dream
Missing all the living
Milk without the cream
They think you're so foolish
Living for today
Caring just what you think
Not what others say
Join with us
Oh, how they'll scream and fuss
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.-M.-F
Alright! Alright!


We're the ones that live it
We're all really free
And if they think that we're sick
Then sick is what we'll be
Scream it loud
Know what you are be proud

You're an S.M.F
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.M.F
You're an S.-M.-FEmbed
