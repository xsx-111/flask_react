Stay Hungry Lyrics
Are you feeling the fire?
Are you ready to explode?
Are your dreams and desires
Riding down an open road?
I'm like a runaway
A heart without a home
Others can laugh and play
I'll fight for every inch I take
I'm desperate to the bone

Stay hungry
Feel the fire
Stay hungry
Don't explode
Stay hungry
With desire
Stay hungry you're alone

Be the hunter and the hunted
Keep your target in your sight
Don't be side tracked or shunted
Let pretenders feel your bite
And if you start to slide
Never show you're weak
Don't feel you've got to hide
Remember what you're fighting for
Remember what you seek
Stay hungry
Feel the fire
Stay hungry
Don't explode
Stay hungry
With desire
Stay hungry you're alone
Alright!

If your fire is faded
And you can't feel it no more
If you're tired and overrated
Let me show you to the door
Expect no sympathy
There's none to be had
Open your eyes and see
There's no room for the wannabees
The has beens or the bad

Stay hungry
Feel the fire
Stay hungry
Don't explode
Stay hungry
With desire
Stay hungry you're alone
Stay hungry
Feel the fire
Stay hungry
Don't explode
Stay hungry
With desire
Stay hungry you're aloneEmbed
