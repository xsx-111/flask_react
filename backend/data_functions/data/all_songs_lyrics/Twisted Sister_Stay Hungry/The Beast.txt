The Beast Lyrics
You can hear the thunder
Long before the storm
But you can't hear the lion when he stalks his prey
He's moving like a shadow
Creeping up on you
And like a siren's call he's gonna have his way
You'd better run, forget your pride
Don't make a stand, just step aside
If you don't have what it takes
Don't try to play you'll lose your stakes
Remember this at least

It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast

You won't hear a footstep
Comin' up on you
Movin' like a snake he's in complete control
This killer knows his business
He is the predator
You are his only target, you're his only goal
What will you say what will you do?
Your wildest nightmare's comin' true
There is nothing you can say
No way to change, he won't delay
This cain will have his feast
It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast


If you play you're bound to lose
Don't roll the dice, don't turn the screws
Just listen to the priest

It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beast
It's the nature of the beastEmbed
