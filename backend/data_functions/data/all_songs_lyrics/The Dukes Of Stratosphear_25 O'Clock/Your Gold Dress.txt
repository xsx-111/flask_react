Your Gold Dress LyricsYou gold dress is whirling around
Like a fan it's lifting you high
High above the ground
Never coming down
You gold dress is burning alight
Deafens me with the sound of the sun
Setting fire to the night
And everything's all right
Vibrations coming my way
When you're floating on by
In your gold dress
Vibrations coming to play
When you're filling the sky
With your gold dress
Your gold dress is shaming the stars
A thousand melting Dali Guitars
Make no sound
And dripping slowly down
Your gold dress is all I can see
Blind my eyes but there it will be
Beacon burning bright
And everything's all right
Your gold dress1Embed
