My Love Explodes LyricsMy love explodes all over the world for you, yeah you
My love explodes in diamonds and pearls for you, just you
When the straight plastic bowler men
Grab your soul and pull you down down down
Call my name on your dream telephone
Catch a saucer and I'll be around
Blow 'em out of town
My love explodes
My love explodes like the stars up in space for you, yeah you
My love explodes with the whole human race for you, just you
When the walls are all closing in
And your paradise goes wrong wrong wrong
Spell my name on your pillow tonight
Catch a rainbow and I'll be along
Singing coloured songs
My love explodes
I've got people billions of people
Waiting here for bliss
All it takes to free these people
Is the power of a kiss, my love explodes
My love explodes all over the world for you, yeah you
My love explodes in diamonds and pearls for you, just you
My love explodes
