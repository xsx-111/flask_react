Daisy Jane Lyrics
Flying me back to Memphis
Gotta find my Daisy Jane
Well the summer's gone
And I hope she's feeling the same
Well I left her just to roam the city
Thinking it would ease the pain
I'm a crazy man
And I'm playing my crazy game, game

Does she really love me? I think she does
Like the stars above me, I know because
When the sky is bright
Everything's alright

Flying me back to Memphis
Honey, keep the oven warm
All the clouds are clearing
And I think we're over the storm
Well I've been picking it up around me
Daisy I think I'm sane
But I'm awful glad
And I guess you're really to blame, blame
Do you really love me? I hope you do
Like the stars above me, how I love you
When it's cold at night
Everything's alright
