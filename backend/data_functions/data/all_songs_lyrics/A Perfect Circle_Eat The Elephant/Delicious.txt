Delicious Lyrics
How inconvenient and unexpected and harrowing for you
As consequences tend to be
For the rest of us
So delicious to witness your dread
Poetic justice consummate

Not unlike you to heedlessly hoist away your smug grenade
Arrogant and insolent
You don't give a damn
Collateral be damned
Not unlike you to hoist away
Hoist away your smug grenade
Choice and bed be made
Good night
Sleep tight

So delicious for the rest of us
To witness your dread
Poetic justice consummate

Not unlike you to heedlessly hoist by your own vain petard
Wrong side of history
You don't give a damn
Collateral be damned
Not unlike you to hoist away
Hoist away your smug grenade
Choice and bed be made
Good night
Sleep tight1Embed
