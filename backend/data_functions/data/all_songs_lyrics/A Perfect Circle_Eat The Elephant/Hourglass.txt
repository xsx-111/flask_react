Hourglass Lyrics
Red flag red, all the sentinels are dead
The Tokyo kitty, swallow, rose, and canary
Tick tick tick, do you recognize the sounds as the grains count down
Trickle down right in front of you?

A little tickle tickle tickle, all your neck hairs prickle
As they barbecue the sentinels and eat them right in front of you
Hourglass smashed, a million little pieces
The count down, carry on, five, four, three, two

Aristocrat breaks down to
Timocrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republocrat breaks down to
Aristocrat breaks down to
Timocrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republocrat breaks down to
No hope left in the hourglass

Red flag red, all the sentinels are damned
The Tokyo kitty, swallow, rose, and canary
Tick tick tick, do you recognize the sounds as the grains count down?
Trickle down right in front of you
Tickle tickle tickle, all your neck hairs prickle
As they barbecue the sentinels then eat them right in front of you
Hourglass smashed, a million little pieces
The count down, carry on, five, four, three, two

Aristocrat breaks down to
Timocrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republocrat breaks down to
Aristocrat breaks down to
Timocrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republocrat breaks down to
Breaks down to
Aristocrat breaks down to
Timocrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republocrat breaks down to
Aristocrat breaks down to
Timocrat breaks down to
Oligarch breaks down to
Republocrat breaks down to
No hope left in the hourglass
A ten, niner, eight!
A ten, niner, eight!
A ten, niner, eight!
Eight, seven, six
Five, four, three, two
A ten, niner, eight!
Eight, seven, six
Five, four, three5Embed
