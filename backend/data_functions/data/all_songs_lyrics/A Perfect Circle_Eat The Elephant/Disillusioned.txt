Disillusioned Lyrics
Dopamine
On dopamine
On dopamine
On dope

We have been overrun by our animal desire
Addicts of the immediate keep us obedient and unaware
Feeding this mutation, this Pavlovian despair

We've become
Disillusioned
So we run
Towards anything glimmering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around
Find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island
Unique
Voice among the many
In this choir
Tuning
Into each other
Lift all higher
Dopamine
On dopamine
On dopamine
On dope

Willingly been re-wired by clever agents within
Looping our reflections, our obsessions draw us in
Fix and fixation, no sentience beyond

We've become
Disillusioned
So we dive like crows
Towards anything glittering

Time to put the silicon obsession down
Take a look around
Find a way in the silence
Lie supine away with your back to the ground
Dis- and re-connect to the resonance now
You were never an island
Unique
Voice among the many
In this choir
Tuning
Into each other
Lift all higher12Embed
