Get the Lead Out LyricsChit-chat, chit-chat
Ain't got time for that
We got places to be
We got mountains to climb
Shape the rainbow with me
Only so much time
Get the lead out
Suck it up, buttercup
(We got places to be)
Get the lead out
We got places to be
Get the lead out
Suck it up, buttercup
Get the lead out
Get the lead out
We got places to be
(We got places to be)
Get the lead out
Get the lead out
Get the lead out
Get the lead out
Get the lead out
Chit-chat, chit-chat
Ain't got time for that
Not one to dawdle, got
No time to coddle you
No time to coddle you
No time
Chit-chat, chit-chat
Ain't got time for that
Not one to dawdle, got
No time to coddle you
No time to coddle you
No time
Chit-chat, chit-chat
Ain't got time for that
Not one to dawdle, got
No time to coddle you
No time to coddle you
No time
Chit-chat, chit-chat
Ain't got time for that
Not one to dawdle, got
No time to coddle you
No time to coddle youEmbed
