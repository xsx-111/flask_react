Eat the Elephant Lyrics
Looming, omnipresent
This task ahead
This task at hand
Ominous and daunting
Crippling undertaking, I'm frozen
Where to begin eludes me
Without you to remind me

Just take the step
Just take the swing
Just take the bite
Just go all in

Where to begin eludes me
Rooting ever deeper
This massive endeavor
Ominous and daunting
Crippling undertaking

Just take the step
Just take the swing
Just take the bite
Just go all in
Take the step
Take the swing
Take the bite
Just take the bite
Take the step
Take the swing
Take the bite
Just go all in

Where to begin eludes me
Without you to remind me
