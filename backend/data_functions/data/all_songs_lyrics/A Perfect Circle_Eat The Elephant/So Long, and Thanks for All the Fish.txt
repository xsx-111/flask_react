So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish LyricsTime is money and money's time
We wasted every second dime
On diets, lawyers, shrinks and apps and flags and plastic surgery
Now Willy Wonka, Major Tom, Ali, and Leia have moved on
Signal the final curtain call in all its atomic pageantry
Bravissimo, hip hip hooray
For this fireworks display
Mind and body blown away
What a radiant crescendo
Ticker tape parade
Our hair and skin like
Marilyn Monroe
In an afterwind
Time is money and money's time
We wasted every second dime
On politicians, fancy water and guns and plastic surgery
Like our Prince and Reenie's mom
All the dolphins have moved on
Signaling the final curtain call in all its atomic pageantry
Bravissimo, hip hip hooray
What a glorious display
Melt our joyous hearts away
Under the mushroom cloud confetti
Hip hip hooray
For this fireworks display
Mind and body blown away
What a radiant crescendo
Hip hip hooray
Hip hip hooray
Ticker tape parade
Our hair and skin like
Marilyn Monroe in an afterwind
Time is money and money's time
We wasted every second dime
On diets, lawyers, shrinks and apps and flags and plastic surgery
Now Willy Wonka, Major Tom, Ali, and Leia have moved on
Signal the final curtain call in all its atomic pageantry10Embed
