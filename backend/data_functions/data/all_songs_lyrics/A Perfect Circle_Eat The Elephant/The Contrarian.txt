The Contrarian Lyrics
Hello, he lied
Like velvet this magician's sleight of tongue and hand
Hello, he lied
Beware, belie his smile
As warm and calculated as heroin
Beware the Contrarian

Within everyone
A scale, a voice
Everyone but him
Core is black as pitch
Soul is out of tune
Advocate of none
Beware, belie his smile
Will cost you everything
Cloak and masquerades
Contempt for everyone
Hello, hello, he lied

Hello, he lied
Like velvet this magician's sleight of tongue and hand
Hello, he lied
Beware, belie his smile
As warm and calculated as heroin
Beware the Contrarian2Embed
