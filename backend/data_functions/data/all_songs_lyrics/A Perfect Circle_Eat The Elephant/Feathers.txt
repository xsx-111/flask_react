Feathers Lyrics
Damages define our border
Wall and manner forged in flame
Knowing little of your wounding
Share our mending all the same

Weight of words and wars we carry
I'm like you, just like you
Eyes of secret, storm, and story
Show and tell, we'll make it through

Sadness, like a pendulum
Pulls us 'round and to and fro
Onus, fate and undue odium
Armor, anchor, lead, and stone

By the telling, will they become?
Will they all be feathers?

Eyes of secret, storm, and story
Show and tell, we'll make it through
Onus, fate and undue odium
Armor, anchor, lead, and stone
By the telling may they become
May they all be feathers3Embed
