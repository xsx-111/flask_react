By and Down the River LyricsMoving in and out of the shadow
It's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you
Showing only bits and pieces
'Till the light betray you and your empty elocution
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace of humility
Searching your eyes for the saint is an act of futility
Searching your eyes for a hint or trace
I've been searching your eyes for humility
Searching your eyes for a hint or a trace
I'm still searching, searching
Showing only bits and pieces
'Till the tide betrays you and your empty elocution
Float the Piper by and down the river
Carcass crippled underneath the pounding waves of adoration
Pied Piper, float on down the river
Bloated carcass crippled 'neath, the weight of adoration
Moving in and out of the shadow
It's no easy mission, holding on to how I picture you4Embed
