See You Next Fall Lyrics
If all is well, I can not tell
Should I clear my throat?
For to lay the hammer down
I'll wait and see in spite of the
Common misconceptions
From all the little clowns
Let's make some moves, I've got the news
It's finally here
After begging like a dog
I'll flee the scene to somewhere clean
Or be left behind
In the world of demigods

Good day
For me at least
I'm not grinding my teeth
I'm not lying awake
There's something warm
No dragons to slay
It's something of charm
To have nothing to say

Just a small fire, dark cape to sire
All the earthly riches
I have tried to grasp in vain
See you next fall, sick of it all
Keep my sole possession
For to shake the ball and chain
Good day
For me at least
I'm not grinding my teeth
I'm not lying awake
There's something warm
No dragons to slay
It's something of charm
To have nothing to say


Good day
For me at least
I'm not grinding my teeth
I'm not lying awake
There's something warm
No dragons to slay
It's something of charm
To have nothing to say2Embed
