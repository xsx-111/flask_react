Rats in Ruin Lyrics
Found all my arrogance
Hung from the barbed wire fence
'Cause you never gave me
A little ground
Found all my belly fire
On the concertina wire
I had to get over it
Or go underground

Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin

I must confess
Happiness
Eats away
At the mind today
Would you journey to view
If all seems well
Is Gutter King out pacing gutter hell?
Is Gutter King out pacing gutter hell?
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruin
Rats in ruinEmbed
