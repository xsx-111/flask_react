Saturnine & Iron Jaw Lyrics
(Nothing x10)

Past my time
On holy days
From my mind
Sight and my taste

Higher force of perception
Nothing, that's the ideal
Gentle hand of confusion
Lead me back to myself

Dead for a crime
Though no one saw
Saturnine, and iron jaw

Higher force of perception
Nothing, that's the ideal
Gentle hand of confusion
Lead me back to myself
