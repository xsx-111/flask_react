The Children of Coyote Woman Lyrics
Romulus and Remus Hill
Lived at the top of Ouachita Bend
Mama died, they laid her down
And quickly took to squabbling
Oh, but this one's mine

If you take that then you'll never be my brother
Oh, if you take mine
If you do that then you'll never be my brother
Again

They get to thumping and the house quaked
They call the lightning down from God's front gate
And all the neighbors had to move along
For fear they'd all get caught up in the wake

Of the Titan Goddess
Her good old boys, and the oubliette of life
Southern county, oh, the titan goddess
Her good old boys, and the oubliette of life
Southern county, oh, the titan goddess
Her good old boys, and the oubliette of life
Southern county again
Romulus and Remus Hill
Fought all the way down the road through town
None could stop their evil brawl
Until they reached the county burial ground
And the lightning spoke

The living god was just a silhouette;
Face upon the mountain, when the thunder roared
St. Michael's sword was just a hurricane being born
In the valley, and the lightning spoke
The living god was just a silhouette
Face upon the mountain, and the thunder roared
St. Michael's sword was just a hurricane being born
In the valley, again

A hurricane being born
In the valley, again
A hurricane being born
In the valley, againEmbed
