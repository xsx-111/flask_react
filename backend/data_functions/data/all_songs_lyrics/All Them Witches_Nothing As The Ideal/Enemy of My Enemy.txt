Enemy of My Enemy Lyrics
Enemy of my enemy
Never been a friend to me
Keep my name from awful truth
Cut my blessings from the void
Silver tapestry of noise
Chase my tail into the noose

Behold my power
Nothing changes nothing
You shake and cower
Nothing changes nothing

Day by day
Accept the choice
Of my own way

Apathy gone as sympathy
Polishing the misery
Stoke the sadness for the young
Jealousy and blatant greed
Water's now the only seed
Keeps the nation being undone
Behold my power
Nothing changes nothing
You shake and cower
Nothing changes nothing

Day by day
Accept the choice
Of my own way

Nothing changes nothing
Nothing changes nothingEmbed
