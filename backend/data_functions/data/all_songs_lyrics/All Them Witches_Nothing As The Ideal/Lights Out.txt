Lights Out Lyrics
(Lights out)
(Lights out)
Ignorance and self-doubt
(Lights out)
(Lights out)
Turn the tables and twist and shout

When you first moved to the city
And everything was crumbling down around you
But you still took time to make yourself feel pretty
Once in a while, once in a while, once in a while

(Lights out)
On bloodbaths
Annihilation
Psychopaths
(Lights out)
On fast cash
Burn the bridges
And sell the ash

When first you moved to the country
You hadn't found that hallowed ground
Made all the plants grow teeth
And poisonous to eat
But you never felt more alive
Confidence is self-defense
Though confidence itself defenselessEmbed
