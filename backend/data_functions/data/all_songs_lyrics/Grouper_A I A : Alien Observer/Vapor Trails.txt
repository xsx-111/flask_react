Vapor Trails LyricsAs I undressed in my apartment, empty-hearted
Did you remember how we made it without a sound?
And with all the vapor that you brought in
And you never even let me hit the ground
You still never make a sound in the air
But you never made a downpour in the sky
And the window clears as my tears pouring down
We could never rain as one on empty houses
It would downpour back to town with deafening sound
It would clean the insides inside-out
You never made a cloud float in the air
But you rise the atoms in the air with your smile
The time you put has made a wound
It's just a wound it leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behind
You'll never know what's happening
It leaves a wound he leaves behindEmbed
