Mary, on the Wall (for Bette Jackson) LyricsMary, on the wall
She looks up
The Mary on the wall
She never understands me
She always brings me down
She's always there to help me
Being across
Yet she still stands watch
As I lay me down
Watching over us
Why won't you help me?
Your eyes to your toes
And you still watch
Where I am, you're watching
Laying your eyes on me
Mary's haunting
Watching over us
Wanting, watching us
She laughs for us
She laughs for usEmbed
