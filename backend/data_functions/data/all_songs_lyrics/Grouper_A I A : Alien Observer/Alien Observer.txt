Alien Observer LyricsLook into the night sky
Looking towards the big lights
Looking out to be free
Suddenly something passes by my window
I feel it﻿ in the darkness
I need to feel it sometimes
Following the street lamps
Warning that we're meant to leave behind
Going to take a spaceship
Fly back to the stars
Alien observer in a world that isn't mine
I feel it﻿ in the darkness
I need to feel it sometimes
Following the street lamps
Warning that we're meant to leave behind
Going to take a spaceship
Fly back to the stars
Alien observer in a world that isn't mine
Going to take a spaceship
Fly back to the stars
Alien observer in a world that isn't mine
Going to take a spaceship
Fly back to the stars
Alien observer in a world that isn't mine3Embed
