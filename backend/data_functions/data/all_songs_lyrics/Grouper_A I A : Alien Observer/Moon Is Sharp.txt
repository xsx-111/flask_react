Moon Is Sharp LyricsThe moon is sharp, I can feel it
The moon glows over water
There is no one in the water after dark
There is no one in the water
I don't see anything else but you in the dark
You're just light upon the dark
I want to hold you in the moon
My arms wrapped around your shoulders
And still I'm wondering about it
You are close around me, hang around
There is nothing like that power
And I wonder about this, I remember
Feeling content past the water
I went to sleep, ascending higher
And I'd never flown this high
And your body lay next to me
And we touched
And we took flight1Embed
