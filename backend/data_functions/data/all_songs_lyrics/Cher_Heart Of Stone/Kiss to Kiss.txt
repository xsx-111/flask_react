Kiss to Kiss LyricsDo nothing till you hear from me
Leave a number where you're gonna be
These times are dangerous for you and me
Would I get a message through?
She'll be watching every move you make
She'll be waiting for that one mistake
Somebody's heart is gonna have to break
Before we are through
Because we can't live
From kiss to kiss
Making up for all we've missed
Hiding in the daylight shadows
Until it's time to say goodbye
Wishing it would be all right
Living with a loneliness
From kiss to kiss
Don't ask me now what is right or wrong
'Cos I've been wondering since you came along
We were weak and love was strong
Now there's nothing we can do
So I'll meet you at the same ole place
I know it's worth it when I see your face
Someday we'll just disappear without a trace
Baby, that's the truth
I keep hoping we'll find a way
(Kiss to kiss)
I keep wondering who's gonna pay
(Kiss to kiss)
I keep waiting for Judgement Day
Some people's lives
Just get in the way
And that's the truth
Because we can't live
From kiss to kiss
Making up for all we've missed
Hiding in the daylight shadows
Until it's time to say goodbye
Wishing it would be all right
Living with a loneliness
From kiss to kissEmbed
