All Because of You Lyrics
Sometimes a heart has a mind of its own
Sometimes I can tell myself
That I'm better off being alone, sometimes
But this time I can't hide from the thought of it
It's around every corner I turn
Right there in lights
In black and white, staring at me

It's all because of you that I feel this way
All because of you that my heart wants to break
If every other love can be forgotten
It's all because, all because of you

Tonight I can't feel any magic inside, tonight
'Cause I can't reach out for the stars
Looking up at the moon on my own, no signs of life
No, nothing's right since you've been gone

It's all because of you that I feel this way
All because of you that my heart wants to break
If every other love can be forgotten
It's all because, all because of you
All because of you I can't sleep at night
Oh, no, I can't sleep at night, and there ain't no rest
Living second best without your love
You don't know what it's like to feel this way

All because of you that my heart wants to break
If every other love can be forgotten, it's all because of youEmbed
