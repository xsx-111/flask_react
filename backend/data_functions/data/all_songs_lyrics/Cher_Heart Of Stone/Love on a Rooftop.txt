Love on a Rooftop Lyrics
We use to talk delivered on a dime
Now we live together, never find the time
We use to walk as lovers on the sand
Now we're working full time on our lifetime plan
We never stop to see the moon at night
We're just too busy leading complicated lives

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn't make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa

Look at us now, all grown up
We got it all together, got it all sown up
But is this all it was leading to?
Do we just run out of dreams
When all our dreams come true?
Whatever happened to those endless nights
When we were happy
Living young and foolish lives
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn't make love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa

We never stop to see the moon at night
We're just too busy leading complicated lives

Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn't make our love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember holding you so tight
Ooh, when kissing lasted all night
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Love on a rooftop
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I remember love on a rooftop
We couldn't make love stop
We were giving all that we got
Whoa, whoa, whoaEmbed
