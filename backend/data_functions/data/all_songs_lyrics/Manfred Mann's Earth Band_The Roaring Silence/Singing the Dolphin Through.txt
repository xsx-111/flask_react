Singing the Dolphin Through LyricsFarewell Plymouth, your morning cold and grey
Is painting shadows on my thoughts
And we're bound for nowhere
Singing the dolphin through
Singing the dolphin through
Singing the dolphin through still waters
Joseph, I know you're trusting me to see you right
And I know you can't stand the fighting
Yes I know you can't stand the fighting
For one more, one more night
Joseph, the mud gives way to coral somewhere
And the hours of light they last and last
We'll see no hostile flag there from craft unknown
We will have grown free from sighing
Singing the dolphin through
Singing the dolphin through
Singing the dolphin through still watersEmbed
