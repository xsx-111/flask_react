Starbird LyricsStarbird let your cry lead us all through the night
Rising from the ashes, your light'll show us the way
Starbird you can fly me take me everywhere you go
Roaring with the windsong, burning in your fiery glow
Screaming through the darkness
Roaring with the windsong
Starbird keep your light shining for all to see
Starbird let your cry lead us all through the night
Rising from the ashes, your light'll show us the wayEmbed
