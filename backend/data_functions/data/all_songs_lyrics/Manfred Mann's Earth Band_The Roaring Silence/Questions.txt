Questions LyricsIn a dream it would seem
I went to those who close the open door
And turning the key
I sat and spoke to those inside of me
They answered my questions with questions
And they pointed me into the night
Where the moon was a star-painted dancer
And the world was just a spectrum of light
They reached to my center of reason
And pulled on the touchstone that's there
The shock of that light had me reeling
And I fell into the depths of despair
Turning the key
I sat and spoke to those inside of me
They answered my questions with questions
And they set me to stand on the brink
Where the sun and the moon were as brothers
And all that was left was to think
They answered my questions with questions
And they pointed me into the night
And the power that bore me had left me alone
To figure out which way was right1Embed
