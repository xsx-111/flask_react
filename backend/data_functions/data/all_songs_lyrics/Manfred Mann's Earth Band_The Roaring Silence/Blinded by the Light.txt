Blinded by the Light Lyrics
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Madman drummers bummers
Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps
His way into his hat
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older
I tripped the merry-go-round
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin'
The calliope crashed to the ground
The calliope crashed to the ground!

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Some silicone sister with a manager mister
Told me I got what it takes
She said "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong
Play the song with the funky break"
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart
To see if it was safe outside
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly
And asked me if I needed a ride
Asked me if I needed a ride!

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light

She got down but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night
She's gonna make it through the night


But mama, that's where the fun is
But mama, that's where the fun is
Mama always told me not to look into the eyes of the sun
But mama, that's where the fun is
Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone
Preacher from the east
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone
That's where they expect it least"
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner
Watching the young girls dance
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone
Reminding him of romance
The calliope crashed to the ground

But she was blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
Blinded by the light
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night

Blinded by the light
(Madman drummers bummers, Indians in the summer)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(With a teenage diplomat)
Blinded by the light
(In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(His way into his hat)
Blinded by the light
(With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(I tripped the merry-go-round)
Blinded by the light
(With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(The calliope crashed to the ground)
Blinded by the light
(Now Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(And throws his lover in the sand)
Blinded by the light
(And some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Save the buckshot, turn up the band)
Blinded by the light
(Some silicone sister with a manager mister)
Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night
(Told me I got what it takes)
Blinded by the light
(She said, "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong")
She got down, but she never got tired
She's gonna make it through the night24Embed
