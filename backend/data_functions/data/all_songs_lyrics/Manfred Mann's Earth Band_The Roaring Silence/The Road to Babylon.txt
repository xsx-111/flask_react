The Road to Babylon LyricsBy the waters of Babylon
We lay down and wept and wept for these I am
We remember, we remember, we remember these I am
A golden helmet blinded minds
Among ten thousand swords along the road to Babylon
A golden thunder silenced songs
Among ten thousand voices on the road to Babylon
Well, well, well
Beware that golden helmet
Well, well, well
There's no easy way to go
Well, well, well
No easy road to follow
Well, well, well
A golden ocean turned to fire
And burned ten thousand ships along the road to Babylon
A golden dreamer touched the sky
Alone in empty silence on the road to Babylon
Well, well, well
Beware that golden thunder
Well, well, well
That dreamed and sang the song
Well, well, well
The empty sound of sorrow
Well, well, well
A golden helmet blinded minds
Among ten thousand swords along the road to Babylon
A golden thunder silenced songs
Among ten thousand voices on the road to Babylon
Well, well, well
Beware that golden helmet
Well, well, well
There's no easy way to go
Well, well, well
No easy road to follow
Well, well, wellEmbed
