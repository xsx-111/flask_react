This Side of Paradise LyricsLife passes slowly just this side of paradise
Eyes watching skies with salt water rain
There you stay watching day follow day
Living lonely and only just this side of paradise
Oh it's easy to see when the moon passes by
And a cloud dies in a clear black sky
Living lonely and only just this side of paradise
Oh, it's easy to see when the moon passes by
Like a leaf spin slow slow
Maybe that's where the sun and the rain live together
Maybe it's time to get up and move out forever
Life passes slowly just this side of paradise
Eyes watching skies with salt water rain
There you stay watching day follow dayEmbed
