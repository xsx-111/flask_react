Hotel Lyrics
In the hotel
I can’t remember how the past felt
I rent a blank room
To stop living in my past self

Fuck now
I’m outta here tomorrow
Fuck now
I’m outta here tomorrow
And when I check out
It won’t matter how my name’s spelled
‘Cause when you pass through
You only keep what you can’t sell

In the hotel
I can’t remember how the past felt
But in a strange bed
I keep sleeping with my past self

Fuck now
I’m outta here tomorrow
Fuck now
I’m outta here tomorrow
And when I check out
It won’t matter how my name’s spelled
‘Cause when you pass through
You only keep what you can’t sell1Embed
