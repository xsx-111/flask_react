Parade Lyrics
Right when the blizzard ends, they throw a fucking huge parade
A great excuse for celebration of the mess they've made
But then when the streets get flooded, we know what proximity’s worth
‘Cause we're already here in the same place when our phones don't work

So then we lie down in our field and just do nothing at all
And I’m getting ready for when everything is wonderful
For just a couple pairs of broken bones with broken feathers in blood
In a meadow, uncut and understood

We can be an island apart from a ceaseless war on our heart
Harbored in a fortress insurmountable
Taller than affliction, safe wherever we are
Erasing horror and disgust
Rewinding the sorrow and the rust
Before our suffering’s suffering, hadn’t we suffered enough?

On the morning that we're both 19 and newly on our own
And all we know is “each other” and invisible homes
We find two empty seats in the back of a car in an empty parking lot
Where all our bridges are abandoned and the cops have forgot
And I can feel the difference when the day begins
Like all I know is, "This year will be the year we win."
We smoke the paper from the banner from our past parades
And start again, before the memory of the mess we've made4Embed
