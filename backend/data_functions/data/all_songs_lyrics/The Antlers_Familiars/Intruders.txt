Intruders Lyrics
Maybe when I’m older
I’ll be clearer, more attuned and understanding
Well, I’m ready
I wrote a list of my demands and then I burned an older version

So to start with
I’ll start over, I’ll cut my hair and cut the power
So who am I?
Without weapons, without defense to arm my guards against intruders?

Well, this is my house
So fuck your doubts and your cute battalion ‘cause I’m steady
And when my double scales the wall
I’ll know exactly where he’s landing and I’ll surprise him

Then when he’s captured
With his hands bound I beg for answers to all my questions, like
“What happened?
Why’d you let me let you in when I was younger? And why’d I need to?”2Embed
