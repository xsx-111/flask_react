Surrender LyricsWell I hope that you can't hear what I am thinking
You know I can’t always talk but I’m always listening
In an absence where you hate to feel uncared for
Pretending there's nothing that you're not prepared for
Who are you lapping when you’re running from surrender?
If life is a fatal race for all contenders
To find the peace within the combat where we’re standing
We have to make our history less commanding
Well, our mercy is a boundary we’ll surrender
When love is a safer place we both remember
Like an old estate that stands in no location
At the edge of an age of endless renovation
And while all that noise competes for our attention
We’ll meet on a quiet field in our own dimension
We'll step inside a world far less demanding
When we allow for something less commanding1Embed
