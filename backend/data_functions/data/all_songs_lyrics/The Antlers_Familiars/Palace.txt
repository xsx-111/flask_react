Palace LyricsYou were simpler
You were lighter when we thought like little kids
Like a weightless, hate-less animal
Beautifully oblivious before you were hid
Inside a stranger you grew into
As you learned to disconnect
Now he hangs your mirrors separately
So one can’t show you what the other reflects
When he heard I was on his tail, he emptied your account
And hid a part of you that’s so invaluable
The part of you unsellable at any amount
He left the tallest peak of your paradise
Buried in the bottom of a canyon in hell
But I swear I’ll find your light in the middle
Where there’s so little late at night, down in the pit of the well
Then when heaven has a line around the corner
We shouldn’t have to wait around and hope to get in
If we can carpenter a home in our heart right now
And carve a palace from within

We won’t need to take a ton of pictures
It won’t be easy to believe
The day we wake inside a secret place that everyone can see
We won’t need to take a ton of pictures
It won’t be easy to believe
The day we wake inside a secret place that everyone can see
The day we wake inside a secret place that everyone can see7Embed
