Refuge LyricsWhen you lift me out of me…
When you lift me out of me, will I know when I’ve changed?
And when you bring me back to me, will you bring me back to me, un-estranged?
Man, you're already home and you don't even know it
You have a room you can return to, and you'll never outgrow it
See, you're already home when you don't know where to find it
It's not our house that we remember
It’s a feeling outside it when everyone's gone but we leave all the lights on anywayEmbed
