Director Lyrics
From a stage in your heart
I can tell that you're far from yourself
When you barter your lust for your health
And when you claim it's all a play
And you just don't care
I only stare
I’m a director watching you rehearse

You say "lend me your eyes to evolve
From that actor I fight in the dark
Where I'm two twins I can't tell apart!”
But you remember which is which
When the wrong man wins
You will hate who you are
’Til you overthrow who you've been

How’d you expect your soul
To send a whole patrol
If you were too far gone
For me to know where to find you?
I’ve wandered out alone
Into your cold unknown
To try to bring you home
So you forgot your way?
Well I’m trying to remind you3Embed
