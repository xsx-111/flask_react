Danger Zone Lyrics
When you feel that your heart is strong
And made up in your mind you can't go wrong
You better watch out
Oh, you knew you had it child
For the danger zone

You can take a little walk down in the park
Steal a little kiss, baby
While in the dark, but listen
Don't let your hair get wet
With the midnight dew, now
In the danger zone
Oh yeah

It's alright to have a love you can feel all the time
But don't let your feelings upset your mind, no no
You better watch out, yeah
You're in the danger zone
Nothin' but danger

Danger
Lord have mercyEmbed
