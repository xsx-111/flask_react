634-5789 Lyrics
If you need a little lovin'
Call on me, alright
And if you want a little huggin'
Call on me baby, mm hmm
Oh I'll be right here at home
All you got to do is pick up your telephone
And dial now

6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (What's my number!)
6-3-4-5-7-8-9

And if you need a little huggin'
Call on me, that's all you gotta do now
And if you want some kissin'
Call on me baby, all right
No more lonely nights, when you'll be alone
All you got to do is pick up your telephone
And dial now

6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (That's my number!)
6-3-4-5-7-8-9
Oh, I'll be right there
Just as soon as I can, oh
And if I'll be a little bit late now
I hope that you'll understand
Whoa yeah, alright

And if you need a little lovin'
Call on me, Lord have mercy
And if you want some kissin'
Call on me baby, that's all you got to do now
No more lonely nights, when you'll be alone
All you got to do is pick up your telephone
And dial now

6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (That's my number!)
6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (Oh yeah)

6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (Call me on the telephone)
6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (No more will you be alone)
6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (What's my number)
6-3-4-5-7-8-9 (That's my number, children)
