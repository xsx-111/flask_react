Something You Got Lyrics
Something you got
Makes me work all day
Something you got
Makes me bring home and pray
Something you got, oh
You ought to know
Well I say my my, oh whoa
I love you so

Something you got
Keeps me home every night
Something you got
Makes everything alright
Something you got
Honey you ought to know
I say my my, oh whoa
I love you so

Something you got
Honey you ought to know
I say my my, oh whoa
I love you so
Something you got
Keeps my home every night
Something you got
Makes everything alright
Something you got
Honey you ought to know, alright now
I say my my, oh
My my, oh
My my, oh
I love you so

My my, whoa oh
Mama, oh oh
