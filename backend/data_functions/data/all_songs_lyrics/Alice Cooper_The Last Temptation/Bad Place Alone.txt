Bad Place Alone LyricsI'm a creature of the street
And I rip off all the money
I was kicked in the teeth
Shoved face first through a window
I got a gangland name
And a teardrop tattooed eye
They call me Little Caesar in the brotherhood of crime
I know
About the pain
Dyin' in an alley with an air-conditioned brain
I know
It's for real
Flatlined in an ambulance without a pulse to feel
Hey blood brother, you're one of our own
You're as sharp as a razor and as hard as a stone
Hey blood brother, you're bad to the bone
You're a natural killer in a
Bad place alone
They call me Smoky Joe
And I'm as thin as a coroner's needle
I got a pocket full of rocks, man
I shake like a cold chihuahua
I got a runny nose
And a road map on my arm
I blew
My gig
Pokin' 'round the gallery with someone else's rig
I know
I understand
I watch my body hauled off by the local garbage man
Hey blood brother, you're one of our own
You're as sharp as a razor and as hard as a stone
Hey blood brother, you're bad to the bone
You're a natural killer in a
Bad place alone
We're cool, we're cold
We're stiff, we're tagged
We're slabbed, we're croaked
We're whacked, we're cracked
We're smoked and cured and
Slammed and slurred and
Sliced and diced and put on ice
Cooked and stewed and badly brewed
And splattered once or twice
Hey blood brother
Hey blood brother
Hey blood brother
Hey, hey, hey
Hey blood brother
Hey blood brother
Hey blood brother
Hey, hey, hey
Look at us
Nice and thin
Not a lot of fat on us
But not a lot of skin
We're alone
So are you
And maybe I'm the man
That's gonna close your baby blues
You're just a shadow of yourself
Bag of bones
Nobody there
To answer the phone
You're alone, bro!
You're all aloneEmbed
