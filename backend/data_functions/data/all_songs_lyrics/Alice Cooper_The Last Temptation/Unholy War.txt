Unholy War LyricsFrom the start of life
To my dying day
In the dark of night
And the burning light of day
It's a bloody fight
But I can't walk away
I'm prime for the front line
Unholy war, unholy war
I'll try, I'll fight until I die
Unholy war, unholy war
I see, I know, you'll always be
Unholy
You see my burning fuse
From a mile away
I took your cruel abuse
Lord took away my shame
I learned to bite the hand
That used to pull my chain
We'll fight, cause we ain't on the same side
We're in an unholy war, unholy war
I'll try, yeah I'll fight until I die
Unholy
When I'm all alone - Unholy
With your thoughts of pain - Unholy
I can break on through - Unholy
With just an ounce of faith - Unholy
You're shaking in your boots
Because it's Judgement Day
I'll get my just rewards
And you'll have your hell to pay
There's no time to throw out the lifeline
Unholy war, unholy war
I'll try, I'll fight until I die
Unholy war, unholy war
I see, I know, you'll always be
UnholyEmbed
