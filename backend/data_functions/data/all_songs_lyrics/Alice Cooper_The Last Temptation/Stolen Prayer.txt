Stolen Prayer Lyrics(dark voice)
Child voice
(multiple voices)
I walk the streets alone
On feeble bones I ride
My sins are etched in stone
I got no place to hide
Well, I was unshakable
In what I did believe
I feel so breakable
But have I been deceived
You showed me your paradise
And your carnival of souls
But my heart keeps telling me
That ain't the place to go
Well, I'm not invincible
So I want you to leave
Well, I'm so convincible
But have I been deceived
I take your words and try them on
(Yeah, it's a perfect fit, boy)
You tell me one size fits us all
(Yeah, like an old straightjacket)
Well, tell me why I'm so afraid
All my words are spoken
All my words are spoken
All my words are spoken
In a stolen prayer
I remember yesterday
When things were black and white
Never thought I'd get confused
On what was wrong and right
Well, I'm not unbreakable
With armor on my skin
Well, it's not unthinkable
I could be fooled again
I take your words and try them on
(Yeah, it's a perfect fit, boy)
You tell me one size fits us all
(Yeah, like an old straightjacket)
Well, tell me why I'm so afraid
All my words are spoken
All my words are spoken
All my words are spoken
In a stolen prayer
You steal another minute from my life
You cut a little deeper with your knife
You steal a little breath from my air
And you don't care
And even though I'm chokin'
All my words are spoken
I take your words and try them on
(Yeah, it's a perfect fit, boy)
You tell me one size fits us all
(Yeah, like an old straightjacket)
Take this world and try it on
(Man, you're lookin' good boy)
Stick your neck out on the block
(So you won't miss nothing)
Stretch your finger, grab your hair
(Don't you feel like screaming)
Feel the blood rush from your veins
(Now you're a perfect zombie)
Now I'm down on my knees
All my words are spoken
All my words are spoken
(All my words are spoken)
(All my words are spoken)
All my words are spoken
In a stolen prayerEmbed
