Rats LyricsI was lost, just wandering 'round downtown
Many people were pushing me around
Hate spreads just like infection
Those rats jumping on and off my back
Fat black rats holding me down
I see rats in every direction
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet
Inconsiderate in their heat

Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right
For people like you and me
Walk over all the people you can't see
If they die there's more bread for me
Like snakes crawling through the grass
No time to catch your breath
Crazy people lost their heads
Masses trampling on my feet
Inconsiderate in their heat
Those rats breeding angriness and spite
Never have done anything right
For people like you and me
See that face man look at me
Oh, he's too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now all he's got is a pinstripe mind
See that face man look at me
Oh, he's much too selfish to see
Once he was warm and was kind
Now he's got is a pinstripe mindEmbed
