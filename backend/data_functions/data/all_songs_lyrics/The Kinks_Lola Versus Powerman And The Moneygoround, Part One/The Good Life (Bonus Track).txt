The Good Life (Bonus Track) LyricsWell I failed my education
And I failed at my first job
Well I failed so bad that I nearly broke down
But then the good, good life came and turned my head around
Then a fat man walked up to me
Smokin' a Havana cigar
And said, "boy you gotta learn to put your body around
You'll have a big Rolls-Royce and make one or ten million pounds
It's gonna be the good life
Good life
I'll give you wine, women, music if you sign on the dotted line"
Good good food
Good good wine
Well it's a good, good life and I love it
Better off than being a tramp
I write so many cheques that my fingers get cramp
I've got so many women that I wish that I wasn't a man
It's gonna be the good life
Good life
But I'm so browned off that it's given me a permanent tan
Too much food
Too much wine
Well it's a good, good life and I love it
That was a good, good life and I loved it
Cheat me all the time
Well they spent all their money, now they're gonna spend mine
I got so many problems that it's keeping me awake at night
And if this is civilization, I'd rather be uncivilized
And if this is the good, good life, I'd rather be back in the mineEmbed
