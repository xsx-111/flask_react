Top of the Pops Lyrics(Drum roll)
"Yes, it's number one - it's Top of the Pops!"
I've just come in at Number 25
I'm oh so happy, so glad to be alive
And everybody says it's going to get to the top
Life is so easy when your record's hot
Go tell my mamma and my sister too
To press my trousers and polish my shoes
I might even end up a rock-and-roll god
It might turn into a steady job
My agent said to me: "Son, I always told you so"
Now my record's number 11 on the BBC
And number seven on the N.M.E
Now the Melody Maker want to interview me
And ask about my politics and theories of religion
(Simulated interview session)
"I'd like to ask you a little bit about your influences in your career so far..."
"...ok man, now stand over there, I wanna nice shot of you all, alright...alright, Shot of a lifetime..."
Now my record's up to number 3
And a woman recognized me and started to scream
This all seems like a crazy dream
I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen
And now I've got friends that I thought I never had before
It's strange how people want you when your record's high
'Cos when it drops down they just pass you by
Now my agent just called me on the telephone and said:
"Son your record's just got to Number One
And do you know what this means?
This means you can earn some real money"1Embed
