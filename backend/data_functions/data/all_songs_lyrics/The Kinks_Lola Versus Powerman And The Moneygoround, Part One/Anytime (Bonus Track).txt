Anytime (Bonus Track) LyricsYou can walk outside
On a crowded street
People pass you by
And no one stops to speak
And when you haven't got a friend
And the world's falling down around you
And you need someone to care
Anytime you're down
Anytime you're sad
I'll be there to see you through
Anytime you're down
And you're all alone
Come on by and be my friend
Anytime you're down
Anytime you're sad
I'll be there to make you glad
But we are very small
And need someone to talk to
And we need someone to care
Anytime you're down
Anytime you're sad
I'll be there to see you through
Anytime you're down
And you're all alone
Come on by and be my friend
Anytime you're down
Anytime you're sad
I'll be there to see you throughEmbed
