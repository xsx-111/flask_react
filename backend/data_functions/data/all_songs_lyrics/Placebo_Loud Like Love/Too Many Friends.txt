Too Many Friends Lyrics
My computer thinks I'm gay
I threw that piece of junk away
On the Champs-Élysées
As I was walking home
This is my last communiqué
Down the superhighway
All that I have left to say in a single tome

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

If I could give it all away
Will it come back to me someday?
Like a needle in the hay or an expensive stone
But I got a reason to declaim
The applications are to blame
For all my sorrow and my pain
A feeling so alone

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there
I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

My computer thinks I'm gay
What's the difference anyway
When all the people do all day
Is stare into a phone

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there

I got too many friends
Too many people that I'll never meet
And I'll never be there for
I'll never be there for
Cause I'll never be there
I'll never be there
I'll never be there
I'll never be there
I'll never be there5Embed
