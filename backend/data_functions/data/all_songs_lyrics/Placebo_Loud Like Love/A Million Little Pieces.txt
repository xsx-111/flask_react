A Million Little Pieces LyricsThere wasn't much I used to need
A smile would blow a summer breeze through
My heart
Now my mistakes are haunting me
Like winter came and put a freeze on
My heart
I've lost the power to understand
What it takes to be a man with
My heart
I saw you wanted this to end
You tried your best to be a friend to
My heart
But I'm leaving this worry town
Please, no grieving
My love, understand
Whenever I was feeling wrong
I used to go and write a song from
My heart
But now I fear I've lost my spark
No more glowing in the dark for
My heart
So I'm leaving this worry town
Please, no grieving
My love, understand
Understand
Understand
Understand
Understand
Understand
(Can't you see I'm sick of fighting?)
Understand
(Can't you tell I've lost my way?)
Understand
(Look at me there's no denying.)
Understand
(I won't last another day!)
So I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving
My love, understand
That I'm leaving this worry town
Please no grieving
My love, understand
All my dreaming torn in kisses
All my dreaming torn in pieces
All my dreaming torn in pieces
All my dreaming torn in kisses
