Loud Like Love LyricsLove on an atom
Love on a cloud
To see the birth of all that isn’t now
Can you imagine a love that is so proud
It never has to question why or how?
Total abandon, the love in my dreams
When I wake up I’m soaking in my sheets
Breathe
Breathe
Believe
Believe
Believe
Believe
For all of our youth
We have craved them
Their beauty and their truth
Breathe

Believe
That we are LOUD LIKE
Love on an atom
Love on a cloud
To see the birth of all that isn’t now
Can you imagine a love that is so proud
It never has to question why or how?
For all of our youth
We have craved them
Their beauty and their truth
So we name them
And somehow they pull us through
We have craved them
For all of our youth
Breathe
