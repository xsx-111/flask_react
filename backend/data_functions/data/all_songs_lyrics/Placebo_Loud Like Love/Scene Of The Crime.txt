Scene Of The Crime Lyrics
Send me a sign, let me know
Give me a time, a place I should go
Reach inside, watch me grow
See me rise
Scene of the crime, the star of the show
If you were mine, then we would know
The peace of mind and seeds that we sow
Are intertwined

We almost made it
But making it was overrated

Scene of the crime, a friend or a foe
I got a body to hide, I got a body on show
And with our bodies entwined
We will know paradise
Scene of the crime, go with the flow
Take it fast, take it slow
Stay blind so I don't know
What's right

Our breath that berates before our rise
The ground beneath that shakes under our weight
We almost made it
Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
Making it is overrated
