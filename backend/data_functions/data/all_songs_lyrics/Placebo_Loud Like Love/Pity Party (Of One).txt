Pity Party (Of One) Lyrics
Here's to all the hearts we've broken
And the ones that we've made come alive
All the dreams and desires left unspoken
And the places we put them to hide

I'm glad I'm not invited
To your pity party
Yes, in fact, I'm delighted
'Cause it's a heavy scene

Here's to every lost soul who's anointed
In the name of a god who's not there
And every child who is left disappointed
By a parents who just couldn't care

I'm glad I'm not invited
To your pity party
Yes, in fact, I'm delighted
I don't want you to pity me

Can't you see there's a world out there?
Don't be scared
Can't you see there's a world out there?
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Can't you see there's a world out there?
Don't be scared
Can't you see there's a world out there?
Don't be scared, don't be scared
I'm glad I'm not invited
To your pity party
Yes, in fact, I'm delighted
'Cause I am pity-freeEmbed
