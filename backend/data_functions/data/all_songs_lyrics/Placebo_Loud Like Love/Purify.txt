Purify Lyrics
Special awareness, so much confusion
And it's so difficult to harness
But then I look at you, nimble and righteous
And then I look at the floor: we made a fine mess

My kiss, can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs?
And on the nape of your neck?

Are you a temple? Are you a temptress?
There's too much choice, the possibilities are endless
So wash away my sins, give me catharsis!
Re-magnetize my moral compass

My kiss, can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs?
And on the nape of your neck?
Your touch, I cannot regret!
I love the shape of your mouth
And the back of your head

You're so my kind
Erotic and divine
I gotta testify to how you purify
To me you're more than a human
You're more complex
You're like a fallen angel
Who use its god as a hex!

My kiss, can you feel it yet?
In the back of your legs?
And on the nape of your neck?
Your touch, well I cannot regret
I love the shape of your mouth
And the back of your head

You're so my kind
Erotic and divine
I gotta testify to how you purifyEmbed
