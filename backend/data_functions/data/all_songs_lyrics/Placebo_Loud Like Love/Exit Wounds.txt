Exit Wounds LyricsIn the arms of another who doesn't mean anything to you
There's nothing much to discover
Does he shake, Does he shiver as he sidles up to you
Like I did in my time?
As you wake does he smother you in kisses long and true?
Does he even think to bother?
And at night under covers as he's sliding into you
Does it set your sweat on fire?
Want you so bad I can taste it
But you're nowhere to be found
I'll take a drug to replace it
Or put me in the ground
In the arms of another who doesn't mean anything to you
Do you lose yourself in wonder?
If I could, I would hover while he's making love to you
Make it rain as I cry...
Want you so bad I can taste it
But you're nowhere to be found
I'll take a drug to replace it
Or put me in the ground
Want you so bad I can taste it
But you're nowhere to be found
I'll take a drug to replace it
Or put me in the ground
Put me in the ground 4Embed
