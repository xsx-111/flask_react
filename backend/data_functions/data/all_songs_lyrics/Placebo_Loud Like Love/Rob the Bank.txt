Rob the Bank Lyrics
Rob the bank
Of England and America
Rob the bank
Of the entire euro zone
Rob the bank
Of Mexico and Canada
Rob the bank
Then take me home
But take me home

Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love

Rob the bank
Make a joke out of dyslexia
Rob the bank
Then pick your nose
Rob the bank
Paint a picture of a swastika
Rob the bank
Then take me home
But take me home
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love

And if ever I suspect
That in your head you're somewhere else or you are faking
Or maybe you don't think of me at all
And if ever you conspire to woo another
I will not be forsaken
Beware the very how and all it's fury
If I am scorned
Scorned

Rob the bank
Of Luxembourg and Monaco
Rob the bank
Of Liechtenstein and Rome
Rob the bank
Hit the biggest vault in Moscow
Rob the bank
Then take me home
But take me home

Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make love
Make loveEmbed
