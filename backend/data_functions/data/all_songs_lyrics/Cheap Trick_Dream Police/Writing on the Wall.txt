Writing on the Wall LyricsAll right, I saw the writing on the wall
All night, I saw the writing on the wall
I saw the writing on the wall
Lo and behold, heard it on the radio
It was a long time comin', but it sounds so sweet, Come on, man, get off my back
All right, I saw the writing on the wall
All night, I saw the writing on the wall
I saw the writing on the wall
In the Midwest and in the East
Canada, Southwest, around the world
L.A., Tokyo, sounds so sweet
Come on honey, get on your feet
All right, I saw the writing on the wall
All night, I saw the writing on the wall
I saw the writing on the wall
The words were oh, so...
The words were oh, so clear
All right, I saw the writing on the wall
All night, I saw the writing on the wall
I saw the writing on the wall
Lo and behold, heard it on the radio
It was a long time comin', but it sounds so sweet, Come on, man, get off my back
Saw it at the airport, it was on T.V
Read it in a magazine, runnin' down the street
Makes no sense, but I hope it's gonna last
The next big thing, I really gotta laugh
Worked and slaved and played like hell
Everybody's goin' crazy, you're the last to know
Can't explain it, still a joke to me
Maybe I'm naive, 'cause it's so plain to see
It's right in front of your face, man
It's right in front of your face, man
Played like hell, whoa!
Played like hell, whoa!Embed
