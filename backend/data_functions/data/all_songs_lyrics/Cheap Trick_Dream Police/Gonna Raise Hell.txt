Gonna Raise Hell LyricsGonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Ambition? Ha!
If all I've heard is true
There's nothin' much I can do
To change the world, it's irreversible
But in what it lacks
It's got a taste that smacks of somethin' irresistable
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Submission? Yes!
Now I won't name names, and a secret's a secret
But a hint's a hint or a clue
You really wanna know, you really wanna go
There's only two things you got to do
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Mother, mother
Mother, mother
Mother, mother
My mission? Ah, yes!
Everybody hear? Everybody here
It's a fate I all agree
Sometimes you win, I never lose
To me it's no mystery
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell
Gonna raise hell, gonna raise hell, gonna raise hellEmbed
