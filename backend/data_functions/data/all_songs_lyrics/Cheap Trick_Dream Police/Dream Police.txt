Dream Police Lyrics
The dream police
They live inside in my head
The dream police
They come to me in my bed
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me
Oh no

You know that talk is cheap
And those rumors ain't nice
And when I fall asleep
I don't think I'll survive
The night
The night

Cause they're waiting for me
They're looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain

The dream police
They live inside in my head
(live inside in my head)
The dream police
They come to me in my bed
(come to me in my bed)
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me
Oh no
Well I can't tell lies
Cause they're listening to me
And when I fall asleep
Bet they're spying on me
Tonight
Tonight

Cause they're waiting for me
They're looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain

I try to sleep, they're wide awake
They won't let me alone
They don't get paid to take vacations
Or let me alone
They spy on me, I try to hide
They won't let me alone
They persecute me
They're the judge and jury all in one

Cause they're waiting for me
They're looking for me
Every single night
They're driving me insane
Those men inside my brain
The dream police
They live inside in my head
(live inside of my head)
The dream police they come
To me in my bed
(come to me in my bed)
The dream police
They're coming to arrest me

The dream police (police, police)
The dream police (police, police)3Embed
