Feathers and Down Lyrics
So you're trying to do what they did
Your friends that turn to liquid
And got lost in the sea
Now you're drowning me
With your talk of four-leaf clovers
You turn to rocks and omen
To beat the ambient harm
That is bruising your karma

Oh I wish my arms were wider
I wish that I could hide you
So you can rest and repair

Without the blanket of sorrow
The thick and the grey
Your blanket of woe
Is so heavy and stained
And it only weighs you down

So you thought that getting sober
Would mean your life was over
I don't think it's that bad
I don't think it's that sad
Just you sleep a little, baby
Leave the world alone and later
If you wake up alive
That old blanket of sorrow
Could be feathers and down
Your blanket of woe
Would leave you alone
And I can love you 'til you drown

Come to me let's drown
Come baby let's drown
In feathers and down1Embed
