And Then You Kissed Me Lyrics
Man, I've had a few
But they wouldn't quite blow me like you
You gave me your name and signed
With a halo around my eye

And it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Love, you're news to me
You're a little bit more than I thought you'd be
A mole in my well-fed lawn
You're a nightmare beating the dawn

And it hit me like never before
That love is a powerful force
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood's a power fuel
Sweet love, tasty blood
My heart over floods
Oh you hit me
Yeah, you hit me really hard
Man, you hit me
Yeah you hit me right in the heart

Lord, I've had my deal
But I never quite knew how it feels
When love makes you wake up sore
With fists that are ready for more

And it hit me that love is a game
Like in war no one can be blamed
Yes, it struck me that love is a sport
So I pushed you a little bit more

Blue, blue, black and blue
Red blood sticks like glue
True love is cruel love
Red blood's a power fuel
Sweet love, tasty blood
My heart over floods
Man, you hit me
Yeah you hit me really hard
Baby, you hit me
Yeah you punched me right in the heart
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
And then you kissed me
And then you hit me
Oh, you haunt me with your violent heartbeat at night
Oh, you strike me with your silence baby, tonight
Why you haunt me with your violence baby, come hit me
You haunt me with your violent heartbeatEmbed
