Live and Learn Lyrics
I came home in the morning and everything was gone
Oh, what have I done?
I dropped dead in the hallway
Cursing the dawn
Oh come on, sun, why must I burn?
I'm just trying to learn

I stared into the light to kill some of my pain
It was all in vain, 'cause no senses remained
But an ache in my body
And regret on my mind
But I'll be fine

'Cause I live and I learn
Yes, I live and I learn
If you live, you will learn
And I live and I learn

Got kicked in the head
So I started a fight
'Cause I knew I was right
But I learned I was wrong
I remember a slaughter
I remember I fought for the money I'd brought
I got blistered and burned
And lost what I'd earned
But I lived and I learned
Yes, I lived and I learned

I got, I got it now
I got, I got it now
(She’s got, she’s got it now)
I got, I got it now
(She’s got it now)
I got, I got it now
(She’s got, she’s got it now)

I came to on a corner
With some help from a man
And goddamn, I don’t seem to have learned
That a lady in need is guilty indeed
So I paid and got laid in return
And I don't know what I've learned

Well, you get what you give
And hell yes, I lived
But if you live as you learn
I don't think I can learn
Oh, with the sun in my eyes
Surprise, I'm living a life
But I don’t seem to learn
No, I don't think I can learn2Embed
