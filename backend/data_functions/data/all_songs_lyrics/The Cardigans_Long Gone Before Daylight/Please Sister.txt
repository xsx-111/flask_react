Please Sister Lyrics
With a sampled heartbeat and a stolen soul
I sold my songs to have my fortune told
And it said: "you should know that love will never die
But see how it kills you in the blink of an eye"

I know of love as a hot white light
That knocks you down and then leaves you dry
Oh, how can it be, sweet mama tell me why
Why all love's disciples have to wither and die?

Please sister, help me, come on, do what you should
Please give me something, I'm not doing so good
I'm gone, done wrong, is there nothing you can say?
Please sister, help me, I'm not feeling okay

Give me belief that my time will come
And a toll-free helpline if I find someone
But she said: "you gave away what you never really had
And now your purse is empty, I can see why you're sad"

Oh, please sister, help me, come on, do what you should
Please give me something, I'm not doing so good
I'm gone, done wrong, is there nothing you can say?
Please sister, help me, can you make me feel okay?
So if it's true that love will never die
Then why do the lovers work so hard to stay alive?
Please
Please sister, help me
Please give me something

Oh please sister, you know I do what I can
Oh sweet mama, please just send me a man
'Cause I'm gone, gone, is there nothing you can give?
Please sister, help me, I just need some love to live

Just a little love to live
And a little love to singEmbed
