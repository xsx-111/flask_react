03.45: No Sleep Lyrics
It's way too late to think of
Someone I would call now
The neon signs got tired
Red eye flights help the stars out
I'm safe in a corner
Just hours before me

I'm waking with the roaches
The world has surrendered
I'm dating ancient ghosts
The ones I made friends with
The comfort of fireflies
Long gone before daylight

And if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God lent his voice to me to speak
I'd say "go to bed, world"

I've always been too lame
To see what's before me
And I know nothing sweeter than
Champagne from last new year's
Sweet music in my ears
And a night full of no fear
But if I had one wish fulfilled tonight
I'd ask for the sun to never rise
If God passed the mike to me to speak
I'd say "stay in bed, world
Sleep in peace"Embed
