A Good Horse Lyrics
It takes no match to give me a spark
Now I'm trying out another heart
I've been whinin' bout a fresh start
I found myself a good horse

I spurred it over quicksand
And I rode it through a hollow land
I fed it with a shaky hand
I found myself a strong horse

These are the promises I can keep
These are the promises I can keep
To live like I must
And ride with the dust in my face
In grace

I found myself a good horse
Yes, I found myself a strong horse
But things remained no different than before

These are the promises I can keep
Yes, these are the promises I can keep
To live like I must
And ride with the dust in my face
(These are the promises that I will keep)
These are the promises I can keep
These are the promises I can keep
To live like I must
And ride with the dust in my face
In grace
In grace
In graceEmbed
