La Parade LyricsAnother day to live
Another way to go
Nobody's in this room
Nobody's here for now
Wake up early
I know it's too late
Too late for the parade
Look at my feet
Moving slowly
I'm afraid it's over
Naked
A bit sleepy
In
My single room
I
Open the door
N' call up
Call up the lift
I wish
I was
In the
Parade
Sometimes I feel my skin
Sometimes I hear a voice
"Please try to be friendly"
But I'm too old inside
I'm so jealous
But proud to be
An ordinary girl
I'd like to talk
But you know I hate
All ordinary words
Naked
A bit sleepy
In
My single room
I open the door
N' call up
Call up the lift
I wish
I was
In the
ParadeEmbed
