Tapioca Tundra Lyrics
One, two, three, four, five
Four, three, two, one, zero
Ah-ah

Reasoned verse, some prose or rhyme
Loses themselves in other times
And waiting hopes cast silent spells
That speak in clouded clues
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you

Careful plays on fields
That seem to vanish
When they're in between
And softly as I walk away
In freshly tattered shoes
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you
Na-na-na

Sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease
Silhouettes and figures stay
Close to what he had to say
And one more time, the faded dream
Is saddened by the news
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you

Well, sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

Sunshine, ragtime
Blowing in the breeze
Midnight looks right
Standing more at ease

Silhouettes and figures stay
Close to what he had to say
And one more time the faded dream
Is saddened by the news
It cannot be a part of me
For now it's part of you1Embed
