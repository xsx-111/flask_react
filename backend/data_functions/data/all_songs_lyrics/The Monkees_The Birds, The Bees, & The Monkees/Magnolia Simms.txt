Magnolia Simms Lyrics
One, two, three
*Clears throat*
Ha-ha-ha
Ah, it's one of those days

Love to me is blue-eyed and blonde
Oh, that's sweet Magnolia
Apple pie on the window still warm
That's my sweet Magnolia

Walking under a sky that's so blue
After rain has fallen
When she's walking so close by my side
My troubles seem to just run and hide

La-dee, da-dum
La-da-da-da-dee, la-da-da-dum
Ba-ba-voom, na-da-doo
Dee-da-doo
Da-dee da-dum
La-da-da-dee, dee-dee-bum
Ba-ba-bee-boo-bee
Bee-bum-ba-hum
Well, walking under a sky that's so blue
After rain has fallen
When she's walking so close by my side
My troubles seem to just run and hide

Magnolia Simms is my little doll
I can't live without her
For if she'd go, my world will just fall
Stay with me, Magnolia
Ooh-hoo
*record skipping*

Stay with me, Magnolia
Ooh-hoo, hoo-hoo
Loo-dee-di-di-doo
La-da, da-di-di-di-do
Da-hum
Da-da-hum
Loo-dee, uh-huh-huh-hum
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Uh-huh, huh-huh
Uh-huh-huhEmbed
