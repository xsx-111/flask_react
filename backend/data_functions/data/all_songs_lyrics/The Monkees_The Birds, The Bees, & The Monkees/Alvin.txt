Alvin LyricsDid you ever step in a water pipe, pipe?
Fall to the bottom of the water system?
And there, did you meet a little alligator
Who answered to the name of Alvin?
If you did, he's mine
I lost him
I threw my Alvin down the water pipe, pipe
Down to the bottom of the water system
Because he was getting too big for his britches
But now I'm getting lonely since he's gone
I miss himEmbed
