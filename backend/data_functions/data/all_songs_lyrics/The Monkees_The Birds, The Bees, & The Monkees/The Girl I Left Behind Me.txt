The Girl I Left Behind Me LyricsIts old enough to try and tie you down
So, I just couldn't wait and hang around
You always said must be free
But you couldn't see you were loosing me
And messing up the one good thing we had
And now I'm going out the way that I came in
The game is over now, I couldn't win
My heart is all I have to pack
And this time girl I won't be back
And years from now I'll turn around and see
The girl I left behind me
I told myself that things would be ok
You would come around to my way any day
As time went on you just stayed the same
No, you couldn't chang or be rearranged
I'm picking up the pieces of my life
And now I'm going out the way that I came in
The game is over now, I couldn't win
My heart is all I have to pack
And this time girl I won't be back
And years from now I'll turn around and see
The girl I left behind me
As time went on you just stayed the same
No, you couldn't chang or be rearranged
I'm picking up the pieces of my life
And now I'm going out the way that I came in
The game is over now, I couldn't win
My heart is all I have to pack
And this time girl I won't be back
And years from now I'll turn around and see
The girl I left behind me
Behind me...Embed
