Savages Lyrics
Murder lives forever and so does war
It's survival of the fittest, rich against the poor
At the end of the day, it's a human trait
Hidden deep down inside of our DNA

One man can build a bomb; another, run a race
To save somebody's life and have it blow up in his face
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of God, I am afraid of man

Is it running in our blood, is it running in our veins?
Is it running in our genes, is it in our DNA?
Humans aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
How can we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl

We live, we die, we steal, we kill, we lie
Just like animals, but with far less grace
We laugh, we cry, like babies in the night
Forever running wild in the human race
Another day, another tale of rape
Another ticking bomb to bury deep and detonate
I'm not the only one who finds it hard to understand
I'm not afraid of God, I am afraid of man

You can see it on the news
You can watch it on TV
You can read it on your phone
You can say it's troubling
Humans aren't gonna behave as we think we always should
Yeah, we can be bad as we can be good

Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
How can we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to behave

All the hate coming out from a generation
Who got everything and nothing, guided by temptation
Were we born to abuse, shoot a gun and run
Or has something deep inside of us come undone?
Is it a human trait or is it learned behaviour?
Are you killing for yourself or killing for your saviour?
Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
How can we expect anything at all?
We're just animals still learning how to crawl
Underneath it all, we're just savages
Hidden behind shirts, ties, and marriages
Truth is in us all, cradle to the grave
We're just animals still learning to behave
