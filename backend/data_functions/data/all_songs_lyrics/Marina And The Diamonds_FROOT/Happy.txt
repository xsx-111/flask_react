Happy Lyrics
Couldn't relax
Couldn't sit back
And let the sunlight
In my lap
I sang a hymn
To bring me peace
And then it came
A melody

It felt so sweet
It felt so strong
It made me feel like
I belonged
And all the sadness
Inside me
Melted away
Like I was free

I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy
Don't go out
Much at all
I've never been
The type to call
I realise
To be happy
Maybe I need
A little company

So now you know
You know it all
That I've been
Des-desperately alone
I haven't found
The one for me
But I believe
In divinity

I found what I'd been looking for in myself
Found a life worth living for someone else
Never thought that I could be, I could be
Happy, happy
I believe in possibility
I believe someoneâ€™s watching over me
And finally, I have found a way to be
Happy, happy

From the concrete to the coast
I was looking for a holy ghost
Like the land joining the sea
Happiness it followed me

I believe in possibility
I believe someone's watching over me
And finally, I have found a way to be
Happy, happy, happy81Embed
