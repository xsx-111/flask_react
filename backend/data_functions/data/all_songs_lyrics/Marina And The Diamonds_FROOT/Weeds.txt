Weeds Lyrics
Could have filled a garden
With all the flowers that you gave me
But none of them were ours
You know the problem with history
It keeps coming back like weed
And when nothing feels enough
At least you taught me how to love, how to love, love
But he keeps growing back

Like weeds
Baby, just open your eyes to see
He’s growing from inside me
And I just don’t know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds, like weeds
Like weeds, yeah, yeah

I miss all of my exes
They’re the only ones that know me
And God knows that sex is
A way to feel a bit, a little bit less lonely
Yeah, I tried to keep it covered up
Yeah, I thought I cut him at the root
But now I think my time is up
Cause he keeps growing back
Like weeds
Baby, just open your eyes to see
He’s growing from inside me
And I just don’t know what I can do
I thought I cut him at the root
Like weeds, like weeds
Like weeds, yeah, yeah
Like weeds, like weeds
Like weeds, yeah, yeah, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby


Like weeds, like weeds
Like weeds, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh
Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah, eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh
Eh-eh-eh

Baby, baby, baby, baby17Embed
