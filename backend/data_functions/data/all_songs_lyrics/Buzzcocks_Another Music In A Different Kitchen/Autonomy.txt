Autonomy Lyrics
It's a thing that's worth having, yes I would
Buys you your life, sir, if it could

I, I want you, autonomy

It leaves us all wondering, and it should
He's up to something for the good

I, I want you, autonomy
I, I want you, autonomy

It leaves us all wondering, and it should
He's up to something for the good

I, I want you, autonomy
Yes, I, I want you, autonomyEmbed
