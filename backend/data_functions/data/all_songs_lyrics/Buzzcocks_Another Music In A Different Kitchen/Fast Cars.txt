Fast Cars Lyrics
They're nice and precise, each one begins and ends
They may win you admirers, but they'll never earn you friends

Fast cars, fast cars, fast cars
I hate fast cars

They're so depressing, going 'round and 'round
Ooh, they make me dizzy, oh, fast cars, they run me down

Fast cars, fast cars, fast cars
I hate fast cars


Sooner or later, you're gonna listen to Ralph Nader
I don't wanna cause a fuss, a-but fast cars are so dangerous

Fast cars, fast cars, fast cars
I hate fast cars
Fast cars, fast cars, fast cars
I hate fast carsEmbed
