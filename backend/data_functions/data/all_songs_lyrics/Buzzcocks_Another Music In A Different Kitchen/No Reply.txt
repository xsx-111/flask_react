No Reply Lyrics
When I phone you, night and day
I get no reply (Reply), no reply (Reply)
I keep writing those letters, and send them away
To get no reply (Reply), no reply (Reply)

No reply, oh, can't you see?
No reply, it's ruining me
Even if I ask the reason why, I get no reply (Reply)
No reply (Reply), no reply (Reply), no reply

Oh no, n-no, no, no, no reply, no reply
Oh no, n-no, no, no, no reply, no reply

I'm bruising my knuckles, knocking at your door
But I get no reply (Reply), no reply (Reply)
I've stood it for so long, I can't stand it no more
To get no reply (Reply), no reply

No reply, oh, can't you see?
No reply, it's ruining me
Even if I ask the reason why, I get no reply (Reply)
No reply (Reply), no reply (Reply), no reply
Oh no, no, no, no, no reply, no reply
Oh no, n-no, no, no, no reply, no reply


I'm bruising my knuckles, knocking at your door
But I get no reply (Reply), no reply (Reply)
I've stood it for so long, I can't stand it no more
To get no reply (Reply), no reply

No reply, oh, can't you see?
No reply, it's ruining me
Even if I ask the reason why, I get no reply (Reply)
No reply (Reply), no reply

Oh no, no, no, no, no, n-no, no, no, no reply, no reply
Oh no, n-no, no, no, no reply, reply, reply, replyEmbed
