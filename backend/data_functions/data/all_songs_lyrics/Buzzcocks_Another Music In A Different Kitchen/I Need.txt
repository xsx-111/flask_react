I Need Lyrics
I need, I need
I need
I need

I used to only want, but now I need
To get by with what I got, but now I need
I need
I used to only want, but now I need

I need sex, I need love
I need drink, I need drugs
I need food, I need cash
I need you to love me back

I need, I need
I need
I need

I just can't do without, 'cause now I need
The things I care about, 'cause now I need
I need
I used to only want, but now I need
I need sex, I need love
I need drink, I need drugs
I need food, I need cash
I need you to love me back

I need, I need
I need
I need

And now I have to dream because I need
Of a necessary scheme to get me what I need
I need
I used to only want, but now I need

I need, I need
I need
I need

The things I used to crave for, now I need
Have made me just a slave for what I need
I need
Yes, I am just a slave for what I need
I need sex, I need love
I need drink, I need drugs
I need food, I need cash
I need you to love me back

You to love me back
You to love me backEmbed
