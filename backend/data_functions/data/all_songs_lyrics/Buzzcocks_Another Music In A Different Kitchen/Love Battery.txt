Love Battery Lyrics
My mad love battery wants to charge you
My mad love battery could, uh, maybe enlarge you
My mad love battery, fizzing at the terminals
My mad love battery is one hell of a pack of animals
My mad love battery has to have us both
My mad love battery don't allow for sleep or sloth
My mad love battery never minces words
Don't discharge flattery, so don't listen to what you've heard
Ya know? Ya know?

I got sick electricity on the boil for you
I got this searing love, that burns without cue, without cue
Without cue, without cue, without cue, without cue

My mad love battery, going out of control
My mad love battery wants to swallow you whole
My mad love battery never minces words
Don't discharge flattery, so don't listen to what you've heard
Ya know? Ya know?

I got this crazy current that slips through my underwear
And when it really connects, I come and go everywhere
Everywhere, I come and go, come and go
Come and go everywhere
My mad love battery wants to charge you
My mad love battery could, uh, maybe enlarge you
My mad love battery, fizzing at the terminals
My mad love battery is one hell of a pack of animalsEmbed
