Get on Our Own Lyrics
Honey, I saw you yesterday on my way home
Baby, I craved for you today, so I decided to phone
So why don't we get together soon, and get on our own?

Just think of what me and you could do, if we get on our own?
If we could get on our own? If we could get on our own?

Honey, I saw you again today, and I, uh, liked what I saw
So why don't we meet tonight, then I could, uh, see a bit more?
So how's about we get together soon? Well, why be alone?

Just think of what me and you could do, if we get on our own?
If we could get on our own? If we could get on our own?


Just think of it, me and you, us together, yes, just we two
Think of all the things that me and you could do
If we get on our own? If we could get on our own?
If we could get on our own? Just me and you, ahEmbed
