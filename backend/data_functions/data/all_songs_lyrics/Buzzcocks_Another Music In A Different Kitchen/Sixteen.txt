Sixteen Lyrics
You know, I don't like dancin'
And I don't like to bop
Too much movement's exertion
Makes me wish I could drop
Dr-drop, dr-drop, dr-drop, drop

And I don't like French kissin'
'cause you swallow my tongue
And you think that you're oh-so-very old
You only want me 'cause you think I'm so young
Yo-young, yo-young, yo-young, young

Alright, okay, no way

And I wish I was 16 again
Then things would be such fun
All the things I'd do would be the same
But they're much more fun than when you're 21
1, 1, 1, 1

Alright, okay, no way
And I hate modern music
Disco, boogie, pop
They go on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on
How I wish they would stopEmbed
