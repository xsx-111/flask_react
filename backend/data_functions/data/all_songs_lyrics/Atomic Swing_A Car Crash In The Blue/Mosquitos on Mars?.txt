Mosquitos on Mars? LyricsI've walked for a thousand miles today
And my bones are aching hard
I can deal with aching legs and bones
'cause my heart is aching worse
Well I may find it's good when it's
Over and gone
And I may enjoy you're here
When you're gone out of my room
I can't seize luck in present time
In the way it is on TV
And I can't write you a regret song
In the way it's meant to be
But I may find it's good when it's
Over and gone
And I may enjoy your love
When you're gone
Out of my life!
How far can I go
On a domestic flight?
How close can I get
With four more sentenses to write?
If I'm loosing this fear
I'll win another threat
Are there mosquitos on Mars?
And is this planet flat?Embed
