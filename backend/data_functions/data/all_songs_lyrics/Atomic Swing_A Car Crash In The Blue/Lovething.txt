Lovething LyricsUnder the trees we'll be safe from mosquitos tonight
And if we don't breathe we can leave this frenzied city in lights
So take me, take me, take me out of these fields
To sail away, away upon the seventh of seas
'cause I gotta leave
For a lovething chasing my soul
A little light lovething freezes me so cold
And traces around the world
With nothing to eat we have travelled for seven long days
With no chance to sleep I cover up my blank rewarded face
So if someone knows the clue please break up the curse
For I believe that nothing has ever been worse
So make a rehearsal
It's a lovething that's chasing my soul
A little light lovething freezes me so cold
And traces me around the world
So take me, take me, take me out of these fields
To sail away, away, upon the seventh of seas
' cause I gotta leave
For a lovething chasing my soul
A little lovething freezes me so cold
And traces me around the worldEmbed
