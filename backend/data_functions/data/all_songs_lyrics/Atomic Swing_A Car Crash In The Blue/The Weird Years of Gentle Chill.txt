The Weird Years of Gentle Chill LyricsBeautiful mama, I think we're closing to the end
Beautiful mama, I hope you wanna reach the end
Of a thousand breaks and thrills
Bounded thoughts and wills
So just close your eyes, bare your dreams
Tell of the wishes that you have been hiding
Through the years
Through the weird years of gentle chill
Whatever I wanted, I had to learn how to pretend
And whatever I needed you never became any friend
But in this hour lame and chill
Confess my guilt I will
'cause I sold my soul, I walked upon water
I've put shame on your innocent daughter
On through the years
Through the weird years of gentle chill
In this hour lame and chill
I fear you have the skill
But it was not for me
It was not for you
To harm no other of my innocent brothers
On through the years
On through the weird years of gentle chill
'cause you're alone in a big crowd
You are smooth, slick and proud
You are cruel mama, a curse from above
A soft gangster, a trickster of love
You've been a smooth murderer with a view to a thrill
On through the weird years of gentle chillEmbed
