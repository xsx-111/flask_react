Carnival Stall LyricsAin't you gonna cry no more
Ain't you gonna fight no more
In the summer
In your carnival stall
Ain't you gonna feel no more
That you never had a chance to love
And be loved
In the summer
In your carnival stall
'cause they break your heart so damned easy
And you haven't got the guts to resist
But you've come all this way
You'll make it some day
For sure, you will do
If the colour of your mind is blue
Baby I don't know what to do
In the summer
In your carnival stall
The only thing that I know
You cannot build your dreams upon love
In the summer
In your carnival stall
Despite your tryin' to smile with your lips
Your shining eyes have become eclipsed
But you've come allt his way
You'll make it someday
For sure, you will do
It was so long since my baby was seen
I'm afraid I'm about to know what it means
So if you got a place for two
I think I'd rather go with youEmbed
