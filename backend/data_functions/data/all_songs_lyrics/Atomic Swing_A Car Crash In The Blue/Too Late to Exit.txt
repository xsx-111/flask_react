Too Late to Exit LyricsWhen the clock beats two and night kisses the morning
A dizzy farewell song keeps clawing my ears
The sense of my head obeys and goes alarming
But the pipers within my chest keep blowing their horns
So if you're in doubt
I'm not desperate by the hour
You know I've tried
To break this dead end of ours
And pass like a dove
But it's too late to exit from love
It's too late to pass through I really should
Well, I'm captured by a cliché
But I can't find no door
I always waited politely to sometimes get chosen
And I've blamed my sweet little mum "I ain't no fortunate son"
For so long I've chewed these words with no chance to use 'em
For so long I've really thought I was the only one
So if I'm not
Let us share all these drunken hours
And let us fly
From the roof of this tower
To higher above
For it's too late to exit from love
It's too late to pass through I really should
Well, I'm captured by a cliché
But I can't find no door
I'ts too late little babyEmbed
