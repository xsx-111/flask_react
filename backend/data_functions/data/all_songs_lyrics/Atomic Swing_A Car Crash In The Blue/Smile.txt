Smile LyricsI wonder baby, wonder baby
How far can I go for no more
And if you maybe, if you maybe
Would come back as you always did before
The ugly houses in the backstreets
Where you lived and you worked in a store
Just fill my head up with some past dreams
And a kiss undercover of the wall
And I said "baby someday luck comes in your arms"
'cause you got just what people call "good luck charm"
But all you have to do now is
Smile if there's anything you want
Please tell me how it feels to live in a million dreams
Smile if there's anything you want
Whenever you come around you're surely the only one
You got the best trade in a fast plane
I'm so glad that you made it so well
While I'm a bad case on the last train
And no one asked how I felt But now you're the best girl of the best girls
So step in the halo of drums
And if you please send me a reason
I'll be here whenever you come
And I said "baby someday luck comes in your arms"
'cause you got just what people call "good luck charm"
But all you have to do now is
Smile if there's anything you want
Please tell me how it feels to live in a million dreams
Smile if there's anything you want
Whenever you come around you're surely the only one
But if you come on now and step into the groove
I won't be no sentimental fool
Even if all you have to do now is
Smile if there's anything you want
Please tell me how it feels to live in a million dreams
Smile if there's anything you want
Whenever you come around you're surely the only oneEmbed
