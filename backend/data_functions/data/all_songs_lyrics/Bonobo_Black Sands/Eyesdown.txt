Eyesdown LyricsHands up
I've got my eyes facing down
I shout it when my tears come down
Slow now
Hands up
I've got my eyes facing down
I shout it when my tears come down
So slow now
So slow now
I shout it when my tears come down
Slow now
Hands up
I've got my eyes facing down
I shout it when my tears come down
Slow now
So slow now
Hands up
I've got my eyes facing down
I shout it when my tears come down
Slow now
Hands up
I've got my eyes facing down
I shout it when my tears come down
Slow now
So slow now
I feel it
So slow now
Hello, I'm near it
I feel it
So slow now
