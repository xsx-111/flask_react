All In Forms LyricsWhat's wrong with me?
You, you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
What's wrong with me?
You, you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
What's wrong with me?
You, you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
What's wrong with me?
You, you came
Just put on my best
I just want to know
Just a square
Just put on my best
So am me
Why can't I say?
Just want to know
Didn't you say?
Pair of shoes
Just put on my bestEmbed
