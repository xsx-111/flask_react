Stay the Same Lyrics
A night train, midnight, bags gathered 'round my feet
Possessions, some lessened to carry with me
Heavy and soothing, like a gentle symphony
I rest my head right back upon my seat
It's hard and cold, though the best thing for me
This train is moving, but my heart is stationary

Seasons change, surely it won't be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games

I left it with you: a note that was discreet
I made sure I put it upon the cellar door
It's hanging, hoping, will you read it while I weep?
Last time, the last time it flickers through me
So vivid, it rushes from my head down to my feet
We're laughing, joking, through a dance to my defeat

Seasons change, it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games
Seasons change, it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games

Seasons change, it'll never be the same
I'm hoping I won't stay the same
Reasons strange, why we all must play these games
Stays the same, stay the same12Embed
