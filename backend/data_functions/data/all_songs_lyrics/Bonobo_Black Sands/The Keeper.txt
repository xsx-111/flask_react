The Keeper Lyrics
I know she said that I don't need her
'Cause every time I call, she's sitting sweeter
Oh, and I know she said to get near her
But I'm feeling cold and I must leave her

Sat down here with my head hung down and I just seem to find
A bit of peace, a bit of love, a bit of something left behind
Sat down here, best intentions, nothing said, nothing lied
A bit of peace, a bit of love, a bit of something left inside

And my heart's content, I say that to please her
Happiness is on her face, it's not mine that greets her
Only my disgrace to admit I need her
But we all fall from grace, dust me down and keep her

Sat down here with my head hung down and I just seem to find
A bit of peace, abit of love, a bit of something left behind
Sat down here, best intentions, and nothing said, nothing lied
A bit of peace, a bit of love, a bit of something left inside

We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't go
We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't
We can't, we can't
Can't go on, no, no
We can't, we can't
Can't go on, no, no
Can't go
We shall go on in this embrace
We can't go on, we can't go on
'Cause we can't go on living this way
We can't go on, we can't go on
We'll be like one, no need for names
We can't go on, we can't go on
'Cause we can't go on living this way
We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't go on
We can't go on, we can't go on
Can't go, can't go, can't go, can't go4Embed
