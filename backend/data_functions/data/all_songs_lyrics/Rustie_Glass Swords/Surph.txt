Surph LyricsRide it out, oh yeah
Ride it out
Baby, ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
On floor, move your booty
Baby come do your duty
I can see it in her eyes she's a superfreak
From my head to her thigh she's so supersweet
Want some more?
Don't get it twisted
Got the taste?
So addictive
There's no surprise how she handles it
Oh back that booty up and you I wanna
Ride it out
Baby, let me ride it out
Oh, we can ride it out
You know I wanna ride it out
Ride it out
Baby, let me ride it out
Oh, we can ride it out
Ride it out baby
Call me up, bring it over
Smoke enough, turn the lights down low
Bring your body close to mine for the ecstasy
I got them other senses for alchemy
Eyes all hazy, woke you up
Taking over, know what's up
No surprise how she handles it
Back that booty up and you know I wanna
Ride it out
Baby, let me ride it out
Oh, we can ride it out
You know I wanna ride it out
Baby, let me ride it out
Oh, we can ride it out
Ride it out
Baby, let me ride it out
Ride it out baby
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out baby baby
Baby, let me ride it out
Baby baby let me ride it out
Ride it out
Ride it out
Baby, let me ride it out
Baby babyEmbed
