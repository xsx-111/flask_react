Song Within a Song Lyrics

The Sun has left the sky
Now you can close your eyes
Leave all the world behind until tomorrow

The dream is like a song
It leads you on and on
The piper plays his tune, so you must follow


So far beyond the sky
Not knowing how or why
You realize the feeling is forever

And though another day
May steal your dreams away
You and the song will always stay together
