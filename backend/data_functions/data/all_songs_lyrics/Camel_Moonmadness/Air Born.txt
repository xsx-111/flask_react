Air Born Lyrics
High-flying glider, spread your wings; flying high on a cloud
Borne on the air, spiral around
So busy making circles, you never touch the ground
You see the sea, feel the sky
Don't know where you go when you die
Don't know the answers to what's in my mind
Riding on the wind, turning with the tide

Light takes you up; it brings you down
Changes the pain that remains
Keep moving fast, through the wind and the rain
And if the world keeps spinning round, you'll be back again..3Embed
