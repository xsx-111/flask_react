Another Night Lyrics
Dark clouds before my eyes
Can't face the morning skies
Day comes a day too soon
I'm waiting for that silver moon

Maybe I'm wrong
But I'm feeling like another night
Would make it alright

Twilight is fading through
Seems like I'm fading too
How can I believe it's real
When nothing starts to stop this wheel?

Maybe I'm wrong
But I'm feeling like another night
Would make it alright

Dark clouds before my eyes
Can't face the morning skies
Day comes a day too soon
I'm waiting for that silver moon
