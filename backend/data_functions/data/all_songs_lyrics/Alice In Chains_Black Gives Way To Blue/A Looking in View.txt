A Looking in View Lyrics
Hear footsteps creak the floor
The shadows give away
Someone outside the door
Won't let 'em in
Life damaged gears to grind
A run down broke machine
That steals your peace of mind
Before you know it's gone
Lay down
Wait

Silence burning, hold your tongue
Keep us separate, sullen, dumb
Hiding in the darkness under
Boiling to the surface
Stumble, fall
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie

These things I hate in you
Also reflect it seems
Distortion laced with spite
Takes you out of me
Lay down
Lay awake
Hiding in the darkness under
Boiling to the surface, somethin'
Crawling on your skin, discomfort
Makes you break and run
Stumble, fall
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie

It's why you never tell me heaven's on your mind
It's why you never tell me heaven's on your mind
It's why you never tell me heaven's on your mind
That's why you never tell me
Heaven's on your

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie
A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life
Lie
It's why you never tell me
Heavens on your mind
A vengeful mind
Oh god, ooh
Selfish plans, a vengeful mind
It's all gone
Ooh
Except for the cross
A vengeful mind just reached inside1Embed
