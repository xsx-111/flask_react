When the Sun Rose Again Lyrics
Run, run 'til you drop
Hide, everyone knows
We all trade in "never-befores"
Selling out for the score
Pray, squeal when you're caught
Cry, it's not my fault
Time to trade in "never-befores"
Selling out for the score

Seems you prophesized
All of this would end
Were you burned away
When the sun rose again?

Hate, long wearing thin
Negative, all you've been
Time to trade in "never-befores"
Selling out for the score

Seems you prophesized
All of this would end
Were you burned away
When the sun rose again?
Seems you prophesized
All of this would end
Were you burned away
When the sun rose again?

Seems you prophesized
All of this would end
Were you burned away
When the sun rose again?2Embed
