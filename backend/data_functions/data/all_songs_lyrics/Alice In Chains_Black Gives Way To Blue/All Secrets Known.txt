All Secrets Known Lyrics
Hope, a new beginning
Time, time to start living
Like just before we died

There's no going back to the place we started from

Hurt, falling through fingers
Trust, trust in the feeling
There's something left inside

There's no going back to the place we started from
All secrets known

Calm, old wounds are healing
Strong, truth is worth saving
I want to feel alive

There's no going back to the place we started from
