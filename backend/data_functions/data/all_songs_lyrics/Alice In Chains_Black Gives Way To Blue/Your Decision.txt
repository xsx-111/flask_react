Your Decision Lyrics
Time to change has come and gone
Watched your fears become your god
It's your decision
It's your decision
Overwhelmed, you chose to run
Apathetic to the stunned
It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say "It's over, It's over"

It might seem an afterthought
Yes, it hurts to know you're bought
It's your decision
It's your decision

You feed the fire that burned us all
When you lie
To feel the pain that spurs you on
Black inside
It's your decision
It's your decision
No one plans to take the path that brings you lower
And here you stand before us all and say "It's over, it's over"
"It's over"3Embed
