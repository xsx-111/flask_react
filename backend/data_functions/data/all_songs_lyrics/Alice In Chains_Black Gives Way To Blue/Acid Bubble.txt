Acid Bubble Lyrics
You tried to kill me off
Surprised, I remain
A scale tips, impossible
Afraid of my own name

And I always paid attention
To all the lines you crossed
Forgive this imperfection
It shows and all

I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner
Unloved inside your mind

Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system

I tried to shake it off
You can't remove the stain
A scale breaks impossible
Afraid, we are the same
And you never paid attention
To all the lines I crossed
Forgive this imperfection
It shows and all

I am the child that lives and cries in a corner
Dies in a corner
Unloved inside your mind
Cries in a corner
Dies in a corner
Unloved inside your mind

Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system
Intent obsolescence built into the system

Built into the system
Built into the systemEmbed
