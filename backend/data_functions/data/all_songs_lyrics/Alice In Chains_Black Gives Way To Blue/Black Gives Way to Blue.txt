Black Gives Way to Blue Lyrics
I don't wanna feel no more
It's easier to keep fallin'
Imitations are pale
Emptiness all tomorrows, haunted by your ghost

Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you

Fading out by design
Consciously avoiding changes
Curtain's drawn, now it's done
Silencing all tomorrows, forcing a goodbye

Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you3Embed
