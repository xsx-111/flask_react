Private Hell Lyrics
Give away a love and then remove another too
Painted words adorn the walls, echoing untrue
I feel cold, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Promises abound, you rarely find it to begin
Maybe I'm afraid to let you all the way in
I guess so, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I excuse myself, I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself in my very own private hell
I excuse myself, I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself in my very own private hell

Lately I'm beside myself, pretending unconcerned
Standing at a corner where I threw you on a turn
I'll move on, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh
Flowers on a cross remain, marking an ending scene
Damn it all if blood you spill, turn the grass more green
Life is short, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh

I excuse myself, I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself in my very own private hell
I excuse myself, I'm used to my little cell
I amuse myself in my very own private hell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell3Embed
