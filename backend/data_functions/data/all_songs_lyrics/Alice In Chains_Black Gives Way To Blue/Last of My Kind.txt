Last of My Kind Lyrics
So young, so brazen, so unholy
I come to you in painted skies
Your broken saint, your ancient story
The living challenge to their lies

Trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
And they wanna force my hand
Until I take what I wanted
And break all the lies
And defeat the fucking liars
Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law

A wolf alone upon the hillside
I live on what they throw away
I go to sleep behind the eight ball
I live to fight for one more day
I'm trapped in the cold outside
There ain't no shelter
And they wanna force my hand
Until I take what I wanted
And break all the lies
And defeat the fucking liars
Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen
Take what I wanted
And break all the lies
And defeat the fucking liars
Smash all the temples
And crawl through the rubble
And cry to the fallen

I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law

I'm the last of my kind still standing
I'm the last of my kind still standing down the law

The last of my kind still standing
The last of my kind still standing3Embed
