Billion Dollar Babies Lyrics
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little lady, slicker than a weasel
Grimy as an alley, loves me like no other lover
Billion dollar baby
Rubber little monster, baby I adore ya
Man or woman living
Couldnâ€™t love you like me baby

We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Aww!
Yeah, billion dollar baby
I got you in a dimestore
No other little girl could ever
Hold you any tighter
Any tighter than me maybe
Billion dollar baby
Reckless like a gambler, million dollar maybe
Fighting like a dog
That's been infected by the rabies
We go dancing nightly in the attic
While the moon is rising in the sky
If I'm too rough tell me
I'm so scared your little head
Will come off in my hands
Million dollar baby
Yeah, billion dollar baby
Trillion dollar baby
Zillion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby
Billion dollar baby, babyEmbed
