Mess Around Lyrics
Ah, you can talk about the pit barbecue
The band was jumping, the people too
Ah, mess around

They doing the mess around
They doing the mess around
Everybody doing the mess around

Ah, everybody was juiced, you can bet your soul
They did the boogie-woogie with a sturdy roll
They mess around

They doing the mess around
They doing the mess around
Everybody doing the mess around

Now ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg
When I say go, just ah, shake your leg
And do the mess around

I declare, do the mess around
Yeah do the mess around
Everybody's doing the mess around
Now let me have it there boy
Now you got it boy
(Yeah, ah, mess around, go on mess around)
(Mess around, boy)

Now this band's going to play from, 9 to 1
Everybody here's gonna have some fun
Doing the mess around

They doing the mess around
They doing the mess around
Everybody doing the mess around

Now you see that girl with that diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
Mess around

I declare she can mess around
Ah, mess around
Everybody do the mess around3Embed
