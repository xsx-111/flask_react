Stillness Is the Move LyricsWhen the child was just a child
It did not know what it was
Like a child it had no habits
No opinions about anything
Maybe I will get a job
Get a job as a waitress
Maybe waiting tables in a diner
In some remote city down the highway

After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
The stillness is the move
On top of every mountain
There was a great longing
For another even higher mountain
In each city longing for a bigger city

After all that we’ve been through
I know that I will always love you
From now until forever baby
I can’t imagine anything better
After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
Isn’t life under the sun just a crazy dream
Isn’t life just some mirage of the world before the world
Before the world
Why am I here and not over there
Where did time begin
Where does space end
Where do you and I
Where do you and I begin
After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
The stillness is the move
After all that we’ve been through
I know we’ll make it, I know the way
The question is it true
There is nothing we can’t do
I see you along the way baby
The stillness is the move6Embed
