Two Doves LyricsGeranium kisser
Skin like silk and face like glass
Don't confront me with my failures
Kiss me with your mouth open
For your love, better than wine
For your cologne is sweetly fragrant
Call on me, call on me, call on me
Your hair is like an eagle
Your two eyes are like two doves
But our bed is like a failure
All day up in the valley
At the waning of the light
To the chamber that conceived me
Call on me, call on me, call on me
Geranium killer
Throat of soil of and mind like stone
Please don't defend a silver lining
Around the halo of what is already shining
When all the planets are aligning
For an afternoon that's never ending
Call on me, call on me, call on me2Embed
