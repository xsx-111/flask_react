No Intention LyricsThe renegade feeling satisfied
You blinked and closed your eyes
You like the feeling of Saturday
You love the danger in the night
The restless corpse is collapsing wind
The breath is daffodil
What won't be coming is lapsing
Into the universal fill
Or maybe just no intention
Or maybe just no intention
When I am full with endeavor
Nothing can stop gestalt
The freshness of my reality
Makes me feel tingly and hot
When you wake up shouting "Idea!"
Is that a punishment?
You represent saying "I'm real!"
But is that what you meant?
Maybe you meant no intention
Maybe you meant no intention
No intention
No intentionEmbed
