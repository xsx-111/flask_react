Remade Horizon LyricsIn the backyard
In the living room
Residential neighborhood
I've come for you
In the margins
Of the freeway
I have sat alone and wondered
Where are you?
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
In the medicine
In the weddings
Like the cormorant in evening
I see her silhouette
In the market
In the parking lot
In the uniform
You're nowhere now
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon
Tossed aside the mirrored life
Echo it out, echo it out
Yeah I want to remake the horizon
Remake the horizon1Embed
