Useful Chamber Lyrics
She is an emerald
In a shining, shining winter
Rosette in a snow globe
Ride it up, clean and gold
I spread love

She is anticipating on it
Magic and old invention
Leanin' out the window
Callin' out to all who know
She sees what no one sees

Far away, with you
While every need, and water blue
We'll sail away, on this boat
Till suddenly it's new

Who made loss or whatever alone?
I know I cannot wait that long
I don't know what I should be lookin' at
But I will look wherever I'm told
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte

I'm caught up in a storm
That I don't need no shelter from
All I want and all I need
Right here with me
You're right here with me

Call to me, soft and sweet
Cool the fire that burns in me
Catch me when I lose control
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
I'm caught up in a storm

Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitte
Bitte orca, orca bitteEmbed
