Cannibal Resource Lyrics
Look around at everyone
Everyone looks alive and waiting
The wind is up, the stars are out
The sun is calm, the light is fading
But we are

Still counting on cannibal resource
OK, open your eyes
I think you're more than a terrified witness
Behind the arbitrary line

Can it ask a question?
Can it sing a melody?
Can it be interpreted?
But is it more than what the eye can see?
Maybe not

Still counting on cannibal resource
OK, open your eyes
I think you're more than a terrified witness
Behind the arbitrary line
I'm cryin'
I'm cryin'

Still counting on cannibal resource
OK, open your eyes
I think you're more than a terrified witness
Behind the arbitrary line
The arbitrary line
The arbitrary line
The arbitrary lineEmbed
