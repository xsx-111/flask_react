Pop Song For Us Rejects Lyrics
Addiction's held you back
But you don't care
Cause you're on a high again
And it's not fair
Consuming alcohol
While I gotta drive
Take a hit from the drugs you stole
And try to survive

Since your life was over
You haven't yet been sober
You have held me back so long
Everything you do is wrong

Now I gotta dump you
Continue my life too
I tried to help you
Don't care what you do

You're state of mind's improved
But we're still apart
I visited you'd moved
Don't know where to start
Your life's an open cold sore
Got to get out the cream
Now I'm thinking positive
But I know it's a dream
Since your life was over
You haven't yet been sober
You have held me back so long
Everything you do is wrong

Now I gotta dump you
Continue my life too
I tried to help you
Don't care what you do

You died yesterday
You died yesterday
You died yesterday
You died yesterdayEmbed
