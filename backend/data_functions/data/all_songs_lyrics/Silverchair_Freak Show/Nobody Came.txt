Nobody Came Lyrics
Laying lost and wounded
Just myself to blame
Have no life and
Being hand-fed pain

Head's a crying wasteland
Filled with shame
Cried for help before and
Nobody came


His father beats him
No hesitation
His face left dripping
In humiliation

His head's a crying wasteland
Filled with shame
Cried for help before and
Nobody came
As he lies wounded
His father turns to clay
A frozen statue
Can't walk away

His head's a crying wasteland
Filled with shame
Cried for help before and
Nobody came

To see what I can lose again
For being the victim

Ohh, ohh, ohh
