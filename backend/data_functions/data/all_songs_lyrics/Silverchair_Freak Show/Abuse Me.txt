Abuse Me Lyrics
Need to ask a question
Calling out my name
Nothing seems to bother
Wish I had a clue

C'mon abuse me more I like it

Well I don't think you like me
Well I hate you as well
No one seems to like you
Wish I couldn't tell

C'mon abuse me more I like it
C'mon keep talking 'cause it's true
C'mon abuse me more I like it
C'mon keep talking 'cause it's true

Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard, overboard
C'mon abuse me more I like it
C'mon keep talking 'cause it's true

Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard
Throw the sailors overboard, overboardEmbed
