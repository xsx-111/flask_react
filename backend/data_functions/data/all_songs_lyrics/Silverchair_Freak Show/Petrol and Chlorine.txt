Petrol and Chlorine Lyrics
Sinking through dark black holes
It's never gonna end
Open gash in my ribcage
It's never gonna mend

Take another picture off the wall
Sinking deeper every time I fall

Each day ends quicker
And my mind gets slower too
As my life just fades away
I wouldn't have a clue

Take another drawer out from the shelf
I'm too weak to do it by myself

Though you had the world at your feet
You could see it I was blind
Had the perfect job called life
You didn't like it you resigned

Brain's a square of grass
Growing on petrol and chlorine
On petrol and chlorine

You could see it I was blind
Had the perfect job called life
You didn't like it you resigned

Hmmm, hmmm
On petrol and chlorine
You know just what I mean
On petrol and chlorine
You know just what I meanEmbed
