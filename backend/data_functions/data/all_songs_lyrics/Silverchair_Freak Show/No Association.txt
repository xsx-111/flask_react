No Association Lyrics
You've never wanted to know me before
Little or no association
Leave me alone, I want to live
Stop sucking the blood right out of me (me, me)


Couldn't care less if I died right now
Who am I?
I don't know, you tell me
You seem to know everything else


Need a pathway, need a guide
Contemplating suicide
Wish I could be like you
You say you care, but do you? (Do you?, do you?)


What a fool
I can't move
What a fool
I can't move (move, move)
