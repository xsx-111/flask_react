Roses Lyrics
Drained as drained can be
Life is gone from me
Drained if drained is free
If only I could breathe

Smelling dead roses
Smelling dead roses

Take your mind with you
There's no room for two
I can't handle both
Handle both of you

Smelling dead roses
Smelling dead roses

But I won't fall down
No I won't fall down
But I won't fall down
Cause I won't fall down
Smelling dead roses
Smelling dead roses

But I won't fall down
No I won't fall down
But I won't fall down
Cause I won't fall downEmbed
