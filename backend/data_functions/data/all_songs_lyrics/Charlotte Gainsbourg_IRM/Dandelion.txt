Dandelion LyricsRed River, keep on rolling down
It's been a long time since I let my hair hang down
I'll take my time before I go under the ground
Oh dandelion, tell me what you're thinking now
Shape I'm in, I better get back home soon
I got one eye on the road and one eye on the big black moon
Dandelion, won't you tell me what to do
Ironsides rusting in the railroad rain
Now I found out what the Captain of the Morning was saying
Dandelion, better hope your mother's praying
Dumb luck is the only luck I ever knew
I'd make a wish but I don't think it'd ever come true
Dandelion, I guess I'll leave it up to you
Belle Starr, she doesn't have any shoes
She walks crooked and paints her eyelids blue
Dandelion, I wanna go there tooEmbed
