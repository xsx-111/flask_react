In The End LyricsHelp me to see
What it's all coming to
Crumbs on the table
And mud on these shoes
Treading so long
I can't see where we've been
Tracks on the trail
And nails digging in
Who's to say it's all for the best in the end
Some hands will rob you
And some hands will beg
Some say they'll stay
Til the last dying day
But if actions can't speak
And words cannot do
What ten thousand armies
Can't even fight through
Who's to say it's all for the best in the end
Who's to say it's all for the best in the end1Embed
