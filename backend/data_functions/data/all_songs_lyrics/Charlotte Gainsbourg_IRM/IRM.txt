IRM LyricsTake a picture, what's inside?
Ghost image in my mind
Neural pattern like a spider
Capillary to the center
Hold still and press the button
Looking through a glass onion
Following the x-ray eye
From the cortex to medulla
Analyze EKG
Can you see a memory?
Register all my fear
On a flowchart disappear
Leave my head demagnetized
Tell me where the trauma lies
In the scan of pathogen
Or the shadow of my sinEmbed
