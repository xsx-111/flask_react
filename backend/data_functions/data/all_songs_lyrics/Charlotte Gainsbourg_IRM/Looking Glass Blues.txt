Looking Glass Blues LyricsThink I'd like to climb down in a hole
Down in the bottom of the world below
Twist myself back out of sight
Looking glass says have a look inside
Drink a little bottle and I disappear
Smaller I grow, smaller all my fears
I can fit inside the heard of anywhere
Looking glass blues and I don't care
Time ticks backwards and the day is null
Borrowing dreams from a buying ground
Stranded on a chest board, I can't move
And I don't even want to sing these backwards blues
Backwards blues
Backwards blues
What can you see through a looking glass
The opposite of everything that you can't have
You can't have
Good or bad
I see what exists outside myself
The absence of something that I know to well
Now the fear is reaching like a hand in a glove
The ugliest thing inside a heard you can think of
I walk through a key big as the sun
Past all meanings and the things we've done
Counterfeit soul with an infant brain
Cause that's how we gonna get along todayEmbed
