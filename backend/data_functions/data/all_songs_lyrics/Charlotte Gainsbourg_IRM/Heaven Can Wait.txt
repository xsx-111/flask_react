Heaven Can Wait LyricsShe's sliding, she's sliding
Down to the dregs of the world
She's fighting, she's fighting
The urge to make sand out of pearls
Heaven can wait
And hell's too far to go
Somewhere between
What you need and what you know
And they're trying to drive that escalator into the ground
She's hiding, she's hiding
On a battleship of baggage and bones
There's thunder, there's lightning
And an avalanche of faces you know
Heaven can wait
And hell's too far to go
Somewhere between
What you need and what you know
And they're trying to drive that escalator into the ground
You left your credentials in a greyhound station
With a first aid kit and a flashlight
Going to a desert unknown
Heaven can wait
And hell's too far to go
Somewhere between
What you need and what you know
And they're trying to drive that escalator into the ground1Embed
