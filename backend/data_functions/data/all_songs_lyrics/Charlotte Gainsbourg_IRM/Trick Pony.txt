Trick Pony LyricsTrain, train
Come and gone
My rum coco
My cold empty
Shake, shake
Sugary
Shoo, shoo fly
Don't come back again
X X the eyes
C. C. Rider riding
On the morning tide
To the fall horizon
Sic, sic the wolves
And hope it don't get ugly
A trick pony
He don't know me
He don't know me at all
Knock, knock
Go away
Pull the trigger
And see your shadow laughing
Transatlantic
There's no one there
It's no cold comfort
With your conscience calling
X X the eyes
C. C. Rider riding
On the morning tide
To the fall horizon
Sic, sic the wolves
And hope it don't get ugly
A trick pony
He don't know me
He don't know me at all1Embed
