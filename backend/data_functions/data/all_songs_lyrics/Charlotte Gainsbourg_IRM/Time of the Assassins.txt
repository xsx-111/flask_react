Time of the Assassins LyricsI walk in a line
I see where I'm going
I turn inside out
The days that I've known
I face to myself
And give up the ghost
I turn in my mind
What time already knows
In the time of the assassins
They say hallelujah
It doesn't take a miracle
To raise a heart from the dead
I sift through the ash
I look for a sign
I open the wound
That keeps me in line
The shoulder that turns
The flame that goes out
The chapter I close
There's no point to it now
In the time of the assassins
They say hallelujah
It doesn't take a miracle
To raise a heart from the dead
And can something change
But still feel the same
The beginning's the end
I start all over again
In the time of the assassins
They say hallelujah
It doesn't take a miracle
To raise a heart from the deadEmbed
