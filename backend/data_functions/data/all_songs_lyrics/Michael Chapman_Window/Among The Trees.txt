Among The Trees LyricsAmong the trees I have lain and passed my golden days
Among the trees I have spent all my summers in a haze
Of lazy afternoons, watching all the rain
As it patterns the verandah, then disappears again
Come the sun...
How I wish I could return to those summers once again
How I wish I could just sit in the presence of a friend
Making music or just listening to the birds so far from sight
Watching as the dark shades of evening turn to night
Gone the sun...
Among the trees I have lain and passed my golden days
Among the trees I have spent all my summers in a haze
Of lazy afternoons, watching all the rain
As it patterns the verandah, then disappears again
Gone the sun...Embed
