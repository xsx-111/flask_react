Southside Of Heaven LyricsWhen I die, Lord, won't you put my soul up on a train
Won't you send it southbound
Give it a cool blues-man name?
I've been lost on them back roads
So many times, I've gone blind
Losing faith in my family
Had driven me out of my damn mind
But on the south side of heaven
Won't you take me home?
Cause I've been broke down for so long
And Lord, it's getting cold
I've been a desperado in West Texas
For so long Lord, I need a change
For ten long years this old place ain't seen a drop of rain
And that wind blows everyday Lord, all like a desert snow
Like a lost bound train running on cocaine and outta control
But on the south side of heaven won't you take me home?
Cause I've been broke down for so long A
Nd Lord, it's getting cold
Long down the Louisiana byways
Lonesome highways roll on
Won't you take me where the poor man lives
Its where I call my home
And can't you see that a breeze, nothin' but a change in pace
Money can't buy my soul, cause it comes from a hard earned place
But on the south side of heaven won't you take me home
Cause I've been broke down for so long and Lord, it's getting cold1Embed
