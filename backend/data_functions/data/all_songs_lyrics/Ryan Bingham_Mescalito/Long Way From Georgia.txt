Long Way From Georgia LyricsOh sittin' in a truck stop
With my Cowboy Boots and my Guitar
I've been livin' on a tip box
It was meant for cigars
Long Way From Georgia
Long Way From Georgia
Oh I'm out on the highway Yeah Yeah
I have no regrets
'Cause I'm livin' my way
Long coffee and cigarettes
Long Way From Georgia
Long Way From Georgia
Oh wind this highway is my poem
Oh through the night I ride on
I just keep on rollin' on
'Cause I'm a long way from home
Long Way From Georgia
Long Way From Georgia
Oh sittin' in a truck stop
And a waitress tells me
Ah boy you got a good smile
Might take you a long way
Say boy you better make it count
'Cause you're a long way from GeorgiaEmbed
