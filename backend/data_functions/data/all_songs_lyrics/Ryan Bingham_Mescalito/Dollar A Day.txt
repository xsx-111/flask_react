Dollar A Day LyricsWell I've been workin in the goddamn sun
With just for a dollar a day
Been workin for a dollar a day
I've been workin for a dollar a day
Man I never understand why all my money
Goes down to man at the bank
And all he does is sit and think
About the money that I'm gonna make
And all of my brothers well their jumpin on planes
And they going off fighting in wars
They are lowered on a desert shore
Fighting for my freedom and a little bit of oh
Man it sure does cost well a whole lot of money
Well to live in the land of the free
Well I think I'll go and plant me a seed
Grow a marijuana money tree
Well then I'm gonna head down to south louisiana
With a guitar on my back
Corn bread and a gunny sack
Maybe uncle sam'll cut me some slack
I've been digging in the rock since five o'clock
And my calluses is cut to the bone
Well the soles in my shoes is worn
Cuz I've been diggin in the rocks since dawn
Well I've been workin in the goddamn sun
With just for a dollar a day
I've been workin for a dollar a dayEmbed
