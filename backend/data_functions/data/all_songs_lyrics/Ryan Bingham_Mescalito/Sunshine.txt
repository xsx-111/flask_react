Sunshine LyricsWell sunshine
Fall on me
Won't you tell me
When the hour is late
Tell them old crows
Want to fly away
Tell the darkness
That you ain't no slave
Well sunshine
Won't you follow me
Through the night
Won't you guide me
When we go by
Says trouble
Along the road ahead
Some lawmen
Really want me dead
Well sunshine
Ain't done nothing
Is what I told that man
Said I ain't done nothing
With these two hands
See there ain't no blood
Ain't no blood on my hands
Stains to come
Made the government mad
Well sunshine
Well sunshine
Follow me
Won't you guide me
Till I can see
Tell them old crows
Want to fly away
Tell the darknessEmbed
