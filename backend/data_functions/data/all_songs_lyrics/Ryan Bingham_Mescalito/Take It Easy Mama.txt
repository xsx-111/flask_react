Take It Easy Mama LyricsTake it easy mama
Lay your head down
Hold on to my lovin
We're both gonna need it now
Take it easy mama
Lay your head down
Rest your head on my shoulder
It's a long way into town
It's hard
When you're alone
It's hard
When everybodys free
Take it easy mama
Lay your head down
Hold on to my lovin
We're both gonna need it now
Take it easy mama
Lend me your smile
Let your falling head come down
Ground me with your smile
It's hard
When you're alone
It's hard
When everybodys free
It's hard
When you're alone
It's hard
When everybodys stoned
Take it easy mama
Lay your head down
Let your falling head come down
Ground me with your smile
Take it easy mama
Lay your head down
Hold on to my lovin
We're both gonna need it nowEmbed
