The Other Side LyricsEvery time I turn around
A man tries to get me down
I just can't see your face
I'm blinded by the sun
Living on the run
And I can't remember this place
Take me to the other side
Let me go when I'm high
Take me to the other side, pretty mama
And on the wind won't you let me ride
I better slow down before I wreck
Driving on the river's edge
My momma says, "Come back home."
But I can't keep em running fast
Burning up the year's grass
Another sands dirt road
Won't you take me to the other side
Let me go when I'm high
Won't you take me to the other side, pretty mama
And on the wind won't you let me ride
Cowboy's your given name
Nothing ever stays the same
'Cept the rain falling down
You can't keep from goin'
No the wind is always damn cold
It's time to put the hammer down
Won't you take me to the other side
Let me go when I'm high
Won't you take me to the other side, pretty mama
And on the wind won't you let me ride
Won't you take me to the other side
On the wind won't you let me ride
Won't you take me to the other side, pretty mama
And on the wind won't you let me rideEmbed
