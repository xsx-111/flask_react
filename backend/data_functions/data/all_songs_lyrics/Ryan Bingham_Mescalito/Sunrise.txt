Sunrise LyricsHere I go again
Straight up out the motel
Hock my guitar out of a pawn shop jail
If I quit, I'm just rolling the dice
Couldn't pass up the red beans and rice
Singing
Oh, my my
See them girls shake their ass
Underneath the sunrise
Oh, my my
Taste the sugar on their lips
Underneath that moonlight
Well I've never met the devil with a one-eyed dog
You can lead a blind man out of Vietnam
Everybody's beggin, everybody wants a chance
Stuck in a storm, we'll do a rain dance
Oh, my my
See them girls shake their ass
Underneath the sunrise
Oh, my my
Taste the sugar on their lips
Underneath that moonlight
I'm taking my chances
I'm taking my sins
Throwin' 'em down the hill and i'll watch 'em come around again
Watched 'em fall, watched 'em rise up to the sky
A hundred miles an hour across the river to the other side
Oh, my my
See them girls shake their ass
Underneath the sunrise
Oh, my my
Taste the sugar on their lips
Underneath that moonlight
Well I've never met the devil with a one-eyed dog
You can lead a blind man out of Vietnam
Everybody's beggin, everybody wants a chance
Stuck in a storm, we'll do a rain danceEmbed
