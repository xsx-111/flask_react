G-Song Lyrics
As I walk into the night
I don't feel that my feet have touched the ground
And I want to carry on
But I can't see anyone who'd take the time

There may be troubles, in your mind
Maybe tomorrow, could be fine

I feel like going home
But I don't know if I'm up or coming down
And I feel there's something wrong
But I know it's just the time it takes to climb

There may be troubles in your mind
Maybe tomorrow, you could be fine
There may be troubles in your mind
Maybe tomorrow, you could be fineEmbed
