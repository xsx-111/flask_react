Sex! LyricsSex
Is a very funny thing
Sometimes it's good
Sometimes it's bad
You can't get it all the same
First time
It can be very hard
But, you know, you gotta try it again
Yeah, just try it again
Now sex
Is a curious thing
Sometimes it burns
Sometimes it stings
Sometimes it leaves a stain
One day, you just had enough
Next day, you gotta do it again
And again and again
In one
Shepherds pie
In two
Shepherds pie
In three
Shepherds pie
And bully's special prize
A years supply of shepherds pie (oh, cheers)
Now sex
Is a very funny thing
Sometimes it s/e
Sometimes it s/e
And sometime s/e
The first time can be very hard
But, you know, you gotta try it again
Yeah, you just try it again
And again
And that's sexEmbed
