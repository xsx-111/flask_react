You Can See Me Lyrics
If you like me, you can buy me, and take me home
When you see me, on your TV, I'm alone
You can call me, tell your story, on the phone
You can hear me, over blue seas, I'm alone

You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me
You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me

When you need me, come and see me, and take me out
In the evening, when we're sleepy, lay me down
All the crazies, try to space me, and I don't know
I'm not easy, don't try to please me, xenophobe

You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me
You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me

If you like me, you can buy me, and take me home
When you see me, on your TV, I'm alone
You can call me, tell your story, on the phone
You can hear me, over blue seas, I'm alone
You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me
You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me
You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see me
You can't see me, I'm not really there
You can't see meEmbed
