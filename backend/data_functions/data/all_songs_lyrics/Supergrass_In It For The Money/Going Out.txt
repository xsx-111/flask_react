Going Out Lyrics
If you want to go out
If you want to go out
Read it in the papers, tell me what is all about, yeah

If you want to stay home
If you want to stay home
Freedom of the papers, all you ever need to know, yeah
Freedom of the papers, all you got to do, oh no (No)
Oh, no

If you want to play home
If you want to play home
Freedom from the papers, all you have to do is call
Freedom from the papers, all you have to do, oh no (No)
Oh,no

If you want to go out
If you want to go out
Read it in the papers, tell me what it's all about, yeah
Read it in the papers, all you have to do, oh no
Not me
If you want to go out
If you want to go out
If you want to go out
If you want to go outEmbed
