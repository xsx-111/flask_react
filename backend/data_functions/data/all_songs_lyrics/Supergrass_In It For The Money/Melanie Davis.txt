Melanie Davis LyricsMelanie Davis stands all alone in her room
Feeling unsteady 'cos when you're alone, you're alone
Do you need someone, I need anyone
Do you need someone, I need everyone
Light up a fire, trying to come in from the cold
When you're retired, needing a home from a home
When you need someone, not just anyone
Do you need someone, I need everyone, yeah everyone
Do you need someone, I need anyone
Do you need someone, I need everyoneEmbed
