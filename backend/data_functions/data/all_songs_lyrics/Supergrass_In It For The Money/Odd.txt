Odd LyricsI Drift out to sea
Moving slowly away
Alone on the breeze
Put my sorrow to sleep
But I know, yes I know, how to live
A true love for me, is all that I need
It's something I've always done wrong
To sleep but not dream
Is the way that I feel
There's no-one for me
On the bed of the sea
But I know, yes I know, how to live
A true love for me, is all that I need
It's something I've always done wrong
Oh but I know, yes I know, how to live
A true love for me, is all that I need
It's something I've always done wrongEmbed
