Wait for the Sun LyricsWhite budding sun
It's gonna come again
Wait for the one
She's bringing you her love
But I may not know everyone
Along the way
And I may not see everyone
Along the way
Head for the hills
They're never far away
Look for the one
She's coming for your love
But I may not know everyone
Along the way
And I may not see everyone
Along the way
La la la la....
(Take it away, wolfman!)
But I may not know everyone
Along the way
And I may not see everyone
Along the way
And I may not know everyone
Along the way
And I may not see everyone
Along the wayEmbed
