Late in the Day Lyrics
It's late in the day
I'm thinking of you
The things that you say
So long
So long for me

Its late in the day
I'm talking to you
Hear what I say
So long
So long for me

All the time I thought of you
In an ordinary way
You slip back down the heart away
All I really have to say
Is people pass along the way
These thoughts of you and me again

I lay on my bed
Searching my mind
Writing my love
So long
So long for me
I sleep on the road
Dream of a sound
Coming my way
So long
So long for me

All the time I thought of you
In an ordinary way
Check back down the heart away
All I really have to say
Is people pass along the way
Had thoughts of you and me again
All the time I thought of you
In an ordinary way
Check back down the heart away
And all I really have to say
Is people pass along the way
I close my eyes and turn away
And all the time I've been with you
In an ordinary way
Check back down the heart away
And all I really have to say
Is people pass along the way
And thoughts of you and me againEmbed
