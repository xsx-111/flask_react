Sitting Up Straight Lyrics
Sitting up straight on the back of a bus
Mimiking time as evening turns to dusk
Oh, look at the boy with his face on the floor
So I have a little smoke to pass the time of day
Oh yeah, oh yeah

He's like me, he would do anything to get away
I know, can you believe it everyday
I know I can't believe in you
It means everything and every pound of me

Sitting up straight on the back of a bus
Mimiking time as evening turns to dusk
Well, look at the boy with his face on the floor
So I have a little smoke to pass the time of day
Hey hey, hey hey

He's like me, he would do anything to get away
I know, can you believe it everyday
I know I can't believe in you
It means everything and every pound of me, yeah let's go
Stand up straight
Stand up straight
Stand up straight
Stand up straight
Stand up straight
On the back of a bus
On the back of a bus
On the back of a bus
On the back of a bus
On the back of a busEmbed
