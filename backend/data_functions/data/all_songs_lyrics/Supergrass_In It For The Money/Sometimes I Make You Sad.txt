Sometimes I Make You Sad LyricsShut out the world, you can do it
Then let me climb inside
There's only one way you can do it
Just let your mind unwind
So to the world I say "Hello!"
But the people don't care
There's nothing out there
Once there was a boy
Spent days all alone
In a rowing boat
Living in Rome
Set sail for the sea
Get back on this song
Get back on
Young love we'll have to through it
Sometimes I make you sad
Stamp out the beat so you can do it
It's like the world we share
And when the curtain falls on you
The people don't care
'Cos nothing out there
La, la la la la la-------
And not a word I've said is true
But the people don't care
'Cos there's nothing out there
Don't you know!Embed
