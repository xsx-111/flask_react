Tonight LyricsGoing to a party and you'll never want to leave it tonight
You'll wanna see the band playing bish bash bosh tonight
Yeah, I know its just a feeling but I know I'm going to see her tonight
Yeah, and everybody knows they're never gonna get a sleep in tonight
And she said "When?"
I said "Why, yeah, tonight"
Whoo hoo, whoo hoo, whoo hoo
Going to a party and you'll never want to leave it tonight
You'll wanna see the band playing bish bash bosh tonight
Yeah, I know its just a feeling that I know I'm going to see her tonight
Yeah, and everybody knows you're gonna follow me around tonight
And she said "When?"
I said "Why, tonight" I went dry
And a gun in his hand
And he's looking at mine
And he's two foot two
And its clear you don't know where I am, when you see what I've been through
And he's phoning his cab
When he's seemingly fine
And he's seen me too
It's clear he don't know what you are, when you see what I've been through
She said "When?"
I said "Why, yeah, tonight"
Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!
Yeah Whoo hoo!
Tonight
Yeah, she said "When?"
I said "Why, tonight" I went dry
Yeah, tonightEmbed
