In It for the Money Lyrics
Here I see a time, to go and leave it all behind
And you know it's wrong to fall

We're in it for the money
We're in it for the money
We're in it for the money
We're in it for the money
We're in it for the money
We're in it for the money
We're in it for the money

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home

But all I can see is our love and all I can hear is her
But all I can see is our love and all I can hear is her

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home

Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way home
Got my mind made up I got my finger on the button going way home
Got the sun turned down got a feeling in my pocket going way homeEmbed
