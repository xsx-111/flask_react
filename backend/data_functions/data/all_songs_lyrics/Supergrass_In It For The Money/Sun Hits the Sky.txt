Sun Hits the Sky Lyrics
I know a place where the sun hits the sky
Everything changes and blows out the night
Everyone knows why my tongue can't be tied
Cause I want to live where the sun meets the sky

I am a doctor, I'll be your doctor
I'm on my way, you won't come down today
Live for the right things, be with the right ones
Or they'll hold you down, they'll turn your world around

Well, I just don't know why the sun hits the sky
Everyone changed as they turned out the light
Living is easy with time on my side
Cause I want to live where the sun meets the sky

I am a doctor, I'll be your doctor
I'm on my way, and you won't come down today
Live for the right things, be with the right ones
Or they'll hold you down, they'll turn your world around
I am a doctor, I'll be your doctor
I'm on my way, and you won't come down today
Live for the right things, be with the right ones
Or they'll hold you down, they'll turn your world aroundEmbed
