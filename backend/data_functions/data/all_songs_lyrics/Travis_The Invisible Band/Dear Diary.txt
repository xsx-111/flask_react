Dear Diary Lyrics
Dear diary
What is wrong with me
'Cause I'm fine between the lines
Be not afraid
Help is on its way
A sentence suspended in air
Way over there

Dear diary
What else could it be
As nightshade descends like a veil
Under the sail of my heart
Be still, don't stop until the end

Dear diary
What is wrong with me
'Cause I'm fine between the linesEmbed
