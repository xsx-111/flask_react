Ring Out the Bell LyricsI'm so lonely God won't know me
I can hardly get up
I sold my halo back in April
Now I can't hold my head up
So ring out the bell
I'll fly where there's someone to tell
My shoulders are colder since I fell
Someone see me feel me breathing
Someone get me home soon
If I see sunrise and screw up my eyes
I don't feel so lonesome
So ring out the bell
I'll fly where there's someone to tell
My shoulders are colder since I fell
I'm doing fine, I'm getting by
Tell me what I should do
God knows why I'm watching the sky
Getting so blue
One fine morning without warning
I'll go through the blue sky
Until I do I'll wait for you
So I can get this right
So ring out the bell
I'll fly where there's someone to tell
My shoulders are colder since I fell
So ring out the bell
I'll fly where there's someone to tell
My shoulders are colder since I fellEmbed
