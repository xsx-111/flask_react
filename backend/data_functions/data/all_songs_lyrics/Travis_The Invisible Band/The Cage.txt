The Cage LyricsYou broke the bread
We drank the wine
Your lip was bleedin' but it was fine
Come on inside babe
Across the line
I love you more than I
But then this bird just flew away
She was never meant to stay
Oh to keep her caged
Would just delay the spring
You broke your word
Now that's a lie
We had a deal that you would try
Come on inside girl
I think it's time
High time we drew the line
But then this bird just flew away
While I looked the other way
Oh to keep her caged
Would just delay the spring
You broke my soul dear
You stole the plot
You left an empty shot
There's nothing left here
'Cause you took the lot
An empty cage is all I've got
'Cause when your bird has flown away
She was never meant to stay
Oh to keep her caged
Would just delay the spring
To keep her caged
Would just delay... the springEmbed
