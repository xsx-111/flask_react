The Humpty Dumpty Love Song Lyrics
All of the king's horses
And all of the kings men
Couldn't put my heart back together again
All of the physicians and mathematicians too
Failed to stop my heart from breaking in two

'cause all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah, you got the glue
So I'm going to give my heart to you

I had a premonition
A movie in my mind
Confirming my suspicions about what I would fine
You followed me to L.A., down to Mexico
Came in through the back door
At the start of the show

'cause all I need is you
I just need you
Yeah, you got the glue
So I'm going to give my heart to you
Oh was a perfect day
Oh in a perfect way
You know, something had to go
You left me high, you left me low
Now as I lie in pieces, await for your return
The sun upon my forehead
It burns, baby, burns, baby, burns
An eye on all my horses
You slept with all my men
I'm never going to get it together againEmbed
