Indefinitely LyricsEveryday in every way I'm falling
Everything that everyone says turns me on
Shine a light on me
So that everyone can see
That I wanna stay here indefinitely
Time exists but just on your wrists, so don't panic
Moments last and lifetimes are lost in a day
So wind your watches down, please
'Cause there is no time to lose
And I'm gonna stay here, indefinitely
And I wanna stay here, so just let me be
Now I can see the light circle around your reflection
And I'm gonna stay here indefinitely
And I'm gonna stay here so just let me be
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
Indefinitely
