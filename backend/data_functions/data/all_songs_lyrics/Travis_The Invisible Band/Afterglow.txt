Afterglow LyricsFeeling myself all of the time
All of the time feeling alright
Taking a while raising a smile
Raising a smile makes it all worthwhile
But if you wanted to find peace of mind
You could find it any time you liked
You are the afterglow
Feeling my way all of the time
All of the time doing just fine
Taking a page out of my life
Out of my life wouldn't it be nice
If you wanted to find peace of mind
Then you couldn't find it any time you liked
You are the afterglow
You are the midnight show
The only one I know
You come and then you go
And when you finally leave
You leave nothing for me
Ohh...Embed
