Flowers in the Window Lyrics
When I first held you I was cold
A melting snowman I was told
But there was no one there to hold
Before I swore that I would be alone for ever more

Wow, look at you now, flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so
Let's watch the flowers grow

There is no reason to feel bad
But there are many seasons to feel bad, sad, mad
It's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold
But I am here to help you with the load

Wow, look at you now, flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so let's watch the flowers grow
So now we're here and now is fine
So far away from there and there is time, time, time
To plant new seeds and watch them grow
So there'll be flowers in the window when we go

Wow, look at us now, flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so, let's watch the flowers grow
Oh, wow, look at you now, flowers in the window
It's such a lovely day
And I'm glad you feel the same
'Cause to stand up out in the crowd
You are one in a million
And I love you so, let's watch the flowers grow, grow

Let's watch the flowers grow1Embed
