All I Want to Be (Is by Your Side) (Live) LyricsDo what you do
Don't bring me down
I went to the doctor
He's just another clown
Don't stand alone
You might turn to stone
I wish there was a pill for that
You're on your own
Can't you see what it's doing to me
All I want to be is by your side
I don't care if they cut my hair
All I want to be is by your side
All I want to be is by your side
By your side
Shake me down
You want to put me on the ground
There's money in my pocket
I won't make a sound
Well you could run me over
Or pick a four-leaf clover
Now they cut the lights down
This record's going slower
Can't you see what it's doing to me
All I want to be is by your side
I don't care if thеy cut my hair
All I want to be is by your side, yeah
All I want to bе is (by your side)
All I want to be is by your side
All I want to be is by your side
Thank youEmbed
