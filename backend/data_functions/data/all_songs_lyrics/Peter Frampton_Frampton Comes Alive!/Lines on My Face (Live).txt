Lines on My Face (Live) LyricsLines on my head from that one thing she said
She spoke of strangers that don't sleep two a bed
Kept on trying, buying time, not waiting on fate
I somehow got the feeling that I opened my eyes too late
I saw where you came from
Called out your name, but there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
Made you my wife, I don't need that
Lines on my face while I laugh, lest I cry
Speed city, dirt and gritty, waving me goodbye
Now there's so many people, my family of friends
Trying so hard to makе me smile till this heartachе mends
I saw where you came from
I called out your name, but there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
I made you my wife, but I don't need that
Ice in her eyes, frozen tears could never be a surprise
You can't erase a dream, you can only wake me up
My mind is turning slower, never to accept defeat
It don't matter it dont matter, still got a house I gotta heat
I saw where you came from
I called out your name, but there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
I made you my wife, I don't need that
I saw where you came from
I called out your name, but there's no answer
We lived on your doorstep
I made you my wife, I don't need that1Embed
