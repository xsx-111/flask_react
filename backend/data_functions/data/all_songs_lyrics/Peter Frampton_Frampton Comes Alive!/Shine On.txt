Shine On Lyrics
Find it hard to see you in the dark
I looked around you were beside me
Don't you realize
It's hard to dream
Without your helping hand to guide me
This could be the one, girl
If you will be my sun

Shine on
Me, shine on me
Let it shine on
Shine on
All I have to do is let it shine on

Please look about and tell me what you see
All noise and dirt and plastic people
Love is clean
And ours has been a bluer shade of jade
Than black or white is
Take me on a ride, girl
Right there by my side, oh
