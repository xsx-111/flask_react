Do You Feel Like We Do (Live) Lyrics
Well, woke up this morning with a wine glass in my hand
Whose wine? What wine?
Where the hell did I dine?
Must have been a dream
I don't believe where I've been
Come on, let's do it again

Do you...you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you...you, feel like I do?

My friend got busted
Just the other day
They said, "Don't walk, don't walk, don't walk away."
Drove into a taxi
Bent the boot, hit the back
Had to play some music, otherwise he'd crack

Do you...you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you...you, feel like I...

Do you...you, feel like I do?
Yes, ya do
Do you...you, feel like I do?

Champagne for breakfast and a Sherman in my hand
Peach top, Peach tails, never fails
Must have been a dream. I don't believe where I've been
Come on, let's do it again

Do you...you, feel like I do?
How'd ya feel?
Do you...you, feel like I...

Do you feel like we do?
Do you feel like we do?
Oh, that's true
Do you feel like we do?
Get back
Do you feel...do you feel like we do?

Do you feel...do you feel...like we do?
I wanna thank you
Do you feel like we do?
That's alright, that's alright in here tonight
Here tonight, good time
We're gonna have a good time
Good time, good time, good time, good time, good time2Embed
