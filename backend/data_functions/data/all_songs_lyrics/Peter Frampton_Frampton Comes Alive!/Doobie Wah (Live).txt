Doobie Wah (Live) LyricsWe'd like to get a bit funky now
This one's called 'Doobie Wah'
Do what everybody says is wrong
I don't believe nobody, takes too long
Changing your mind, well now, let me up
I don't believe that kind drink my cup
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Take away what you can make today
Look, turn around
Put your hand in the lottery
What you found?
Take the place, you got another taste
Let me through
Carry on, won't do you no wrong
Something new
Icicles of blue serene
Inside my eyеs
I came in the same way too
Yеah
Head in the sky
Let me breathe
Don't want to make you cry
Gotta leave
Take all you can
Don't let it show
Walk away, you gotta pay
For all you know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hang on to me
If you really want to be free
You don't really need to be
Anything you don't want to be
Setting suns and thinking aloud
I'm speaking of you
I came in the same way too
Head in the sky
Let me breathe
Don't want to make you cry
Gotta leave
Take all you can
Don't let it show
Walk away but you gotta pay
For all you know
Yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah!
Do what everybody says is wrong
I don't believe nobody, takes too long
Changing your mind, well now, let me up
I can't believe that kind drink my cupEmbed
