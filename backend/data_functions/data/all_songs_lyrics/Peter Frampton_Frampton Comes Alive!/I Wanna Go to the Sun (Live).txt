I Wanna Go to the Sun (Live) LyricsWell, like I said before
Pay up your money and you ask for more
But there's no reason
Yeah, no reason
(Yeah, Yeah)
I can't say goodbye
Tried all too hard and it made you cry
Cus', I've been cheating
Yeah, I've been cheating (Yeah)
Like before she kicked me out the door
And I couldn't see behind me
Like before when I asked for more
I couldn't be myself
And I'm still singin' this song
Baby won't you do me wrong
Music is my food and life
Don't take it away
I want thе world to see
I'm about
I don't care when it will be
Thеre's no doubt
I wanna go to the sun, everyone
I don't know what I can do
Sand and sea, will do it endlessly
I could never, turn it away
Salty air, seagulls everywhere
I wanna live there one day
But I'm still singin' this song
Baby won't you do me wrong
Music is my food and life
Don't take it away
I want the world to see
I'm about
I don't care when it will be
There's no doubt
I wanna go to the sun, everyone
I don't know what I can do
(...)

I want the world to see
I'm about
I don't care when it will be
There's no doubt
I wanna go to the sun, everyone
I don't know what I can do
I wanna go to the sun, everyone
I don't care when it will be
There's no doubt
I wanna go to the sun, everyone
(...) (Yeah)
I wanna go to the sun
I don't care when it will be
I wanna go to the sun
I don't care when it will be
Thank youEmbed
