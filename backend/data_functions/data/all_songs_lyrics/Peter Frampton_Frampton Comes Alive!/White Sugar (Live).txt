White Sugar (Live) LyricsI'm riding on a see-saw
No easy by way
Mustn't let the day go
Wasting on the highway of life, all my life
I'm feeling unclean, my stomach is shot
Preservatives hide out in all that we got
Don't ask again because I don't know myself
Tinned spam and meatloaf do me right in
White sugar
Evil as the day you were born
White sugar
Daylight murder that I mourn
I'm feeling like a jigsaw
There's one piece missing
You call it frustration, baby
Won the pools, couldn't get it in, couldn't get it in
Manhattan pattern up on the wall
Lives on vitamins, I can hear you call
Big dapple apple, I'm back in your grasp
Nothing left for me to do just have to fast, hеy hey
White sugar
Evil as the day you wеre born
White sugar
Daylight murder that I mourn
White sugar
Evil as the day you were born
White sugar
Daylight murder that I mourn
Hey, Manhattan pattern up on the wall
Lives on vitamins, I can hear you call
Big dapple apple, I'm back in your grasp
There's nothing left for me to do just have to fast, hey hey
White sugar
Evil as the day you were born
White sugar
Daylight murder that I mourn
White sugar
Evil as the day you were born, evil as the day
White sugar
Daylight murder that I mourn, that I mourn
White sugar
Evil as the day you were born, evil as the day
White sugar
Daylight murder that I mourn, that I mournEmbed
