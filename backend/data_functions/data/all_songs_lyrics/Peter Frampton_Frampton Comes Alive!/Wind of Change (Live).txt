Wind of Change (Live) Lyrics
The sweetest fragrance It brings a wind of change
I feel it now or die
I have itchy fingers and butterflies are strange
You know that I live a lie

Take me away, take me away
Faking my way through
Take me away, take me away
Faking my way through

Sapphires aren’t enough to buy me happiness
Diamonds don’t demand me, they’re just for looking
Love comes close to wrecking all you have to give
God knows, There’s so much to give Yeah Yeah

Take me away, take me away
Faking my way through
Take me away, take me away
Faking my way through

La da da da like I do
Da da da da, 'cause all I do is for you
All I do is for you and you and you and you
Da da da da da
Thank youEmbed
