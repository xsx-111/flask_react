Everything Went Numb Lyrics
And the story goes like this:
Everything went numb for the money and the guns
And every time he'd think it out: "there's nothing to worry about
Get in the van, don't deviate from the plan
If everything goes smooth then you'll walk away a rich man"
So it begins, everybody walks in
Could this be the way or the day that the underdog wins?
I think not, and I bet on the feds because the black hat men never win in the end, so....

Ski mask (check)
Sawn-off (check)
Guilty conscience, fear of death (check, check, check)
Everything went numb when he stumbled upon what he thought
Was going to be another means to the end
Silence
Sirens
It all went down like his nightmare the night before
I don't want to hear
I don't want to be near
I do what I got to do just to keep my nose clean

The story doesn't end here
Don't fear for our hero ain't near the end, my friend
Let's take it back to how it all began: with a proposition
And proposition starts with a capital P
"or at least for me" is what he said to himself
But himself ain't a lot when he's got nothing left
Of what was once a man, loved and loving
He took that trip that turns something to nothing
Right and wrong
There's not a lot a difference when you're singing that poor man's song
And that song, it goes just a little like this:
Na na na, na na na...
Ski mask (check)
Sawn-off (check)
Guilty conscience, fear of death (check, check, check)
Everything went numb when he stumbled upon what he thought
Was going to be another means to the end
Silence
Sirens
It all went down like his nightmare the night before
I don't want to hear
I don't want to be near
I do what I got to do just to keep my nose clean3Embed
