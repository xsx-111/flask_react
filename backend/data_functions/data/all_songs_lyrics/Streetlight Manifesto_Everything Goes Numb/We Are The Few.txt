We Are The Few Lyrics
Dear Mr. Gepetto: I hope this finds you well
I wrote you this letter
Because we miss you here in hell
Well now, I know it's hard when you don't know what to think
And every single smile is a foil, and you're waking up
You might try, but you won't get by until you're crucified
For all the things you try to do
Well I don't care if you sink or swim
And I don't care how you hold it in
As long as you don't bother me
With all the things I don't bother you with
9 times out of 10 you might be right
But what about that time you know you're wrong?
You sing that same song
And everybody smiles but they'll never get along

I'm trying, and I'm trying, and I'm trying
And I'm trying to let go;
But everybody's going down tonight

We are the few that won't say nothing right
We are the footsteps fading into the night
Nobody cares, and nobody stares with such conviction and I say:
I never wanted this, no one ever wanted this
But they gave it to you so you might as well be proud of it
And I don't know where we went wrong
All I know now is, I got to do something right
So come clean
No one should have have to live with the things you've seen
But you're living anyway
Well, I stop the car and put her in park
And I step outside- god, I hate this part
When I see what I saw, what I thought was a life
That was more than a chore, I'm just doing what I need to get by
I don't care if you leave or stay
But you might as well split
Because it's not the same as it was
When we said our last goodbye
And if you want the truth: I was hoping one of us would-
Pass away, because it'd be much easier then
We would all get together and think about when
We were young, we were dumb, we were numb but in love
And I'm done so I'm sending out this letter today

I'm trying, and I'm trying, and I'm trying
And I'm trying to let go;
But everybody's going down tonight

We are the few that won't say nothing right
We are the footsteps fading into the night
Nobody cares, and nobody stares with such conviction and I say:
I never wanted this, no one ever wanted this
But they gave it to you so you might as well be proud of it
And I don't know where we went wrong
All I know now is I got to do something right
This has been the best night of my life
This has been the best night of my life
I could have lost my life
And I would have lost my mind
But now I'm fine, and I find
That this has been the best night of my life
This has been the best night of my life
(I still can't believe they had the heart to apologize)
This has been the best night of my life
(I still can't believe they had the heart to apologize)
I could have lost my life
And I would have lost my mind
But now I'm fine, and I find
That this has been the best night of my life
And as the day fades
No one investigates
Nobody answers when she calls his name
Another victim, somewhere in a shallow grave
I want to hold her and tell her
"It's not your fault"
Na na na...
It's not your fault
Na na na...
And as the day fades
No one investigates
Nobody answers as she calls his name
Another victim, somewhere in a shallow grave
I want to hold her and tell her
"It's not your fault"
Na na na...
It's not your fault

We are the few that won't say nothing right
We are the footsteps fading into the night
Nobody cares, and nobody stares with such conviction and I say:
I never wanted this, no one ever wanted this
But they gave it to you so you might as well be proud of it
And I don't know where we went wrong
All I know now, is I got to do something right
We are the few that won't say nothing right
We are the footsteps fading into the night
Nobody cares, and nobody stares with such conviction and I say:
I never wanted this, no one ever wanted this
But they gave it to me so I might as well be proud of it
And I know I've done something wrong
All I know now, is I got to do something rightEmbed
