A Moment Of Violence LyricsI never did lose a battle
But I'm feeling further from the end of war
Deplored, ignored and rarely ever self assured
Why does it seem like the ones who have everything have nothing inside? Nothing inside?
I don't sleep anymore, I gave it up
'cause what we do is not enough
And now they're calling out our bluffs
Have you done a single thing for someone else
Or do you take, take, take until your belly is stuffed?
How long do you think you can go before you lose it all?
Before they call your bluff and watch you fall?
I don't know but I'd like to think I had control
At some point but I let it go and lost my soul
Sit tight but the revolution's years away
I'm losing faith and I'm running low on things to say
So I guess I have no choice but to regurgitate
The tired anthem of a loser and a hypocrite
Oh! To have died that night, I realized it wouldn't last!
Our days were numbered and the reaper tipped the hourglass
The final mayday of our sinking ship had come at last
Oh! To the west, you don't know what it is you're running from
And everybody's laughing loud
Your last chance to make your mother and your father proudEmbed
