Failing, Flailing LyricsYou say you've got the cure
But I don't have a disease
And you say you've got the answers
But I've made no inquiries
And you're failing, bailing
Good God, motherfucker, now I hear you're flailing
I see you flailing
That's right, I think I do
I see you flailing away, away
I know it's hard but so are you
And so am I and we'll pull through together, together
And I said that it's been years but still I fear
That someone dear will leave me here forever, forever
And I said: "Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!)
"Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!)
Hey, you've got to keep trying
You've got to keep holding onto what you've got
Because what you've got it sure ain't a lot
And hey!
Everyone's falling down
Everyone's holding out for what you've got
But what you've got, it sure ain't a lot
And you act like it is but you know that it's not
And even if it was, would you ever give it up?
If I told you what you had was really nothing?
Nothing? Nothing!
Yes, it's nothing, nothing at all
Well, you say your life's a bore
And I can't quite disagree
If you judge your life by the pieces of shit that inhabit your TV
Because they stand so proud, and they talk so loud
And every other word is a lie
I've found that everyone who is anyone is a waste of time
A waste of time
I know it's hard but so are you
And so am I and we'll pull through together, together
And I said that it's been years but still I fear
That someone dear will leave me here forever, forever
And I said: "Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!)
"Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!), "Hey!" (Hey!)
Hey, you've got to keep trying
You've got to keep holding onto what you've got
Because what you've got it sure ain't a lot
And hey!
Everyone's falling down
Everyone's holding out for what you've got
But what you've got, it sure ain't a lot
And you act like it is but you know that it's not
And even if it was, would you ever give it up?
If I told you what you had was really nothing?
Nothing? Nothing!
Yes, it's nothing, nothing at all
Nothing
You won't say nothing
You won't say nothing
And that's just fine
Nothing, (Take me back to that, day when I was like)
You won't say nothing, (I would like to see, your face one last time)
You won't say nothing, (Take me back to that, day when I was like)
And that's just fine. (I would like to see, your face one last time)
Nothing
(Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names will never hurt me) ((Take me back to that, day when I was like))
You won't say nothing
(And it's been years but still I fear that someday they'll desert me) ((I would like to see, your face one last time))
You won't say nothing
(Oh, it's hard, I know, when it's time to stand alone) ((Take me back to that, day when I was like))
And that's just fine
(And no one understands you) ((I would like to see, your face one last time))
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names will never hurt me
Oh, it's been years but still I fear that someday they'll desert me
Oh, it's hard, yes I know
When it's time to stand alone
And no one understands you
Sticks and stones may break my bones (Nothing)
But names will never hurt me
And it's been years but still I fear that someday they'll desert me. (You won't say nothing)
Oh, it's hard, I know, (You won't say nothing)
When it's time to stand alone
And no one understands you. (And that's just fine)Embed
