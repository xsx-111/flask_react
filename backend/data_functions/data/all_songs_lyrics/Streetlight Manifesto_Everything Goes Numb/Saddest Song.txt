Saddest Song LyricsIt doesn't really matter if you lead or follow
Everybody's laughing like there's no tomorrow and even if there was
Would you still go following your friends?
I don't know where we went wrong, we're still singing those same sad songs
"It's my life, not your life, I'll end it when I want"
And now I'm off to save the world once again
But I don't know how I'll pull it off this time
I think I'm going to drown
Now he's off to save the world once again
But he don't know how he'll pull it off this time
I just know I'm going to drown
And it's the saddest song you'll ever hear
The most pain you will ever feel
But you grit your teeth because it don't get better than this (know this)
And you'll try to explain as the blood leaves all your veins
And you can't think of anything that you would change
Stop!
"Look and you will see" is what I think she said to me
I'm not too sure because it could have easily been a million things
But I don't know what she said
I still don't know what she said
It's been years since I've seen her face, 14 years were just erased
If my life was your life, would you ever take it back?
And now I'm off to save the world once again
But I don't know how I'll pull it off this time
I think I'm going to drown
Now he's off to save the world once again
But he don't know how he'll pull it off this time
I just know I'm going to drown
Yeah you will try to explain as the blood leaves all your veins
And you can't think of anything that you would change
And it's the saddest song you'll ever hear
The most pain you will ever feel
But you grit your teeth because it don't get better than this (know this)
And you'll try to explain as the blood leaves all your veins
And you can't think of anything that you would change2Embed
