A Moment of Silence LyricsA moment of silence, please, for those who never get the chance
They show up to the party but they're never asked to dance
The losers, the liars, the bastards, the thieves
The cynicists, the pessimists and those that don't believe in nothing
I never met a loser that I didn't see eye to eye with, I declare
I stare into your eyes but you look right past me into the air
What's it like to stand in your shoes?
To have never felt the belt of somebody's abuse?
I take the bottle and I tip it to all my heroes that have passed
Alas, you have left us but your stories they will last
Uninspired by the recruiting call
Independent we stand, independent we fall
So tell me: how long do you think you can go before you lose it all?
Before they call your bluff and watch you fall?
I don't know but I'd like to think I had control
At some point but I let it go and lost my soul
Sit tight but the revolution's years away
I'm losing faith and I'm running low on things to say
So I guess I have no choice but to regurgitate
The tired anthem of a loser and a hypocrite
Oh! To have died that night, I realized it wouldn't last!
Our days were numbered and the reaper tipped the hourglass
The final mayday of our sinking ship had come and passed
Oh! To the west, you don't know what it is you're running from
And everybody's laughing loud
Your last chance to make your mother and your father proud
A moment of silence, please, for those who never get the chance
They show up to the party but they're never asked to dance
The losers, the liars, the bastards, the thieves
The cynicists, the pessimists and those that don't believe in nothing
They said: "A pox upon your house, upon your family
And everyone you ever knew and everyone you'll ever meet."
I bet they think we wish we joined when we could
But we do what we want, we don't do what we should
Now everybody's laughing because they're thinking they're in on something I don't get
Don't forget, I connect and I heard every word you said
Like a child who believes he was wronged
If you hate me so much then stop singing my songs
So tell me: how long do you think you can go before you lose it all?
Before they call your bluff and watch you fall?
I don't know but I'd like to think I had control
At some point but I let it go and lost my soul
Sit tight but the revolution's years away
I'm losing faith and I'm running low on things to say
So I guess I have no choice but to regurgitate
The tired anthem of a loser and a hypocrite
Oh! To have died that night, I realized it wouldn't last!
Our days were numbered and the reaper tipped the hourglass
The final mayday of our sinking ship had come and passed
Oh! To the west, you don't know what it is you're running from
And everybody's laughing loud
Your last chance to make your mother and your father proud2Embed
