A Better Place, A Better Time Lyrics
And so she wakes up
In time to break down
She left a note up on the dresser and she's right on time
You don't know anything right or wrong
I said I know
And she said so
I wanna panic but I've had it so I go
You don't owe anything to anyone
But don't take your life
Because it's all that you've got
You'd be better off just up and leaving
If you don't think they will stop

And when you wake up
Everything is gonna be fine
Guarantee that you wake in a better place, in a better time
So you're tired of living
Feel like you might give in
Well don't
It's not your time

Looking through the paper today
Looking for a specific page
Don't wanna find her full name followed by dates
Because when I left her alone she made a sound, like a moan
"You're known by everyone for everything you've done"
Fuck buying flowers for graves
I'd rather buy you a one way non-stop
To anywhere, find anyone, do anything
Forget and start again, love
She said she won't go (and that's that)
It hurts too much to stand by
You've got to stop and draw a line
Everyone here has to choose a side tonight
The moment of truth is haunting you
Don't forget your family regardless what you choose to do
You can't decide and they're all screaming "why won't you?"
I'll start the engine but I can't take this ride for you
I'll draw your bath and I'll load your gun
But I hope so bad that you'll bathe and hunt
Annie's tired of forgetting about today
And always planning for tomorrow (tomorrow) tomorrow
Annie says, "The saddest day I came across was
When I learned that life goes on without me" (without me) without me
Annie said, "If everyone has someone else
Well I ain't got nobody's love to save me" (to save me) to save me
Annie said, "I think I'll pass away tonight
Because it seems I'll never get it right
It's just me" (just me) just me Annie said

And when you wake up
Everything is gonna be fine
Guarantee that you wake in a better place, in a better time
So you're tired of living feel like you might give in
Well don't
It's not your time

Annie said she wouldn't mind
If they never find a cure to all her problems (her problems) problems
And she said, as long as she has someone near to make it clear
She doesn't need to solve them (solve them) solve them
Annie said, "Oh, this loneliness is killing me
It's filling me with anger and resentment (resentment) resentment
And she said, "I'm turning into someone that I never thought I'd have to be again"
And when you wake up
Everything is gonna be fine
Guarantee that you wake in a better place, in a better time
So you're tired of living
Feel like you might give in
Well don't
It's not your time

Well Annie's tired of forgetting about today
And always planning for tomorrow tomorrow
And she said, "The saddest day I came across was
When I learned that life goes on without me" without me
Annie said, "If everyone has someone else
Well I ain't got nobody's love to save me" save me
And she said, "I think I'll pass away tonight
Because it seems I'll never get it right, it's just me"
It's just me Annie said

And when you wake up
Everything is gonna be fine
I guarantee that you wake in a better place, and in a better time
So you're tired of living
And you feel like you might give in
Well don't
It's not your time
And even if it was so
Oh I wouldn't let you go
You could run run run run but I will follow close
Someday you'll say "that's it, that's all"
But I'll be waiting there with open arms to break your fall
I know that you think that you're on your own
But just know that I'm here and I'll lead you home
If you let me
She said "forget me"
But I can't5Embed
