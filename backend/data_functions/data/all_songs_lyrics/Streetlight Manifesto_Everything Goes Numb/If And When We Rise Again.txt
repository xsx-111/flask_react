If And When We Rise Again LyricsDon't you come to me with all your color-coded quotes
Everybody's laughing but they never ever get my jokes
Fool, you're a tool, a sheep
And it's obvious to everyone but company you keep
And don't you squint at me because your childhood was the pits
Every single one of us have trodden through our shit
Oh, and I know you're shrewd
Because I smell it in your clothes
It's in everything you do
Falling, fallen, we all fall down
It only really matters how we stand our ground
And if and when we rise to our feet again
We'll be on our own
Everything we built (It's gone)
And every one around (Is stunned)
We just sit here staring blankly
And everything goes numb
Lord, if I felt a thing
I could wrap my mind around this
And prevent us getting singed
And please excuse my enemies
I think they do not know
I will gladly self destruct if they leave me alone
Friend, that's the end of us
Because you're way behind in empathy and overdue on trust
Calmly, calmly and patiently
We've seen all the evidence
But still cannot believe
And if and when we rise to our feet again
We'll be on our own
Somehow, someway, we persevere
The questions on our lips fall on deafened ears
And if and when we rise to our feet again
We'll be on our ownEmbed
