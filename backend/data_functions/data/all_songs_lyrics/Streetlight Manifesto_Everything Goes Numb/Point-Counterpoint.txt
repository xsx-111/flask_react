Point/Counterpoint Lyrics
I've got a gun in my hand, but the gun won't cock
My finger's on the trigger but that trigger seems locked
And I can't stop staring at the tick tock clock
And even if I could I would never give up
With a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung
I can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung
And if and when I die won't you bury me alone
Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song

If there was something wrong would you be oh so strong
Would you do what it takes to move this hollow life along
I'd like to think I would, you know I'd like to think I would
But I can guarantee that what you see is not reality
And every time she makes a point, I make a counterpoint
She said it's easy but in the end you'll have no choice
And you know that's only just the way that it goes
You said it right man, that is just the way that it goes

And the days, and the days they seem like forever
And the days, and the days they seem like forever
But forever isn't ever enough
I'd like to sing a song
Promise you won't be long
I'll try not to be long but I don't want to get this story wrong
There was a kid who never cared about the little things
Don't even bother because I'm tired and I'm sick of it
And every time she makes a point, I'll make a counterpoint
She said it's easy but in the end you'll have no choice
And you know that's only just the way that it goes
You said it right man, that is just the way that it goes
I've got a gun in my hand but the gun won't cock
And my finger's on the trigger but that trigger seems locked
And I can't stop staring at the tick tock clock
And even if I could I would never give up
With a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung
I can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung
And if and when I die won't you bury me alone
Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song
Oh, you don't know where I've been
Oh, you don't know what I've seen

If I did something right
Would you give up this fight
Would you say you were wrong and maybe someone else was kind of right
I'd like to think you would
You know I'd like to think you would
But I can't guarantee that what you get is an apology
Jump back to the day we met
I never thought that it would end this way
If ever I let you down I want to ask of you
To take it down a notch and we can talk it on through

And the days, and the days they seem like forever
And the days, and the days they seem like forever
But forever isn't ever enough
I'd like to sing a song
Promise you won't be long
I'll try not to be long but I don't want to get this story wrong
There was a chick who never cared about the little things
Don't bother cause I still don't give a shit
And every time she makes a point, I'll make a counterpoint
She said it's easy but in the end you'll have no choice
And you know that's only just the way that it goes
You said it right man, that is just the way that it goes
I've got a gun in my hand but the gun won't cock
And my finger's on the trigger but that trigger seems locked
And I can't stop staring at the tick tock clock
And even if I could I would never give up
With a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung
I can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung
And if and when I die won't you bury me alone
Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song
Oh, you don't know where I've been
Oh, you don't know what I've seen

So tell me friend, how's it going to end
When the shit goes down and there's no one left around to get your back
You'll crack
You'll smile and agree with everything they say
They'll try to tell you that it's all okay
But it's not and you're shot and you're bleeding pretty bad
And you can't stop thinking about the things you never had
Like a wife and a kid and the things you never did
You're running around
You're living a life that's empty in the end, my friend
Oh, you'll take back all you've said
Oh, when the regrets fill your head
Trust me I've been there before
I would not wish it upon my greatest enemy
What irony
Once friends, but I find
You'll have to learn this lesson on your own

So I waited by the phone but that phone never rang
And I sang so loud so I wouldn't hear the bang
When the bang never came and I never got the call
Fuck it! Thank you! I love you all
Some are going to say that we're doomed to repeat
All our past mistakes
Great
But that's not me
And even if it was I would always disagree
Because in the end I always get the better of me

I've got a gun in my hand but the gun won't cock
And my finger's on the trigger but that trigger seems locked
And I can't stop staring at the tick tock clock
And even if I could I would never give up
With a vest on my chest, a bullet in my lung
I can't believe I'm dying with my song unsung
And if and when I die won't you bury me alone
Cause I'll never get to heaven if I'm singing this song
Oh, I'll take you where I've been
Oh, I'll show you what I've seen3Embed
