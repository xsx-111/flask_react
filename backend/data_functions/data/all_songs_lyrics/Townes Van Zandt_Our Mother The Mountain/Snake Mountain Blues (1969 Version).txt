Snake Mountain Blues (1969 Version) Lyrics
Mr. Ten Dollar Man, let me tell where you're bound
Drink your green liquor, Lord, you'll roll to the ground
But you come around here with your money in your hand
Taste of my woman, well you'll die where you stand

Well Snake Mountain blues, they got me down low
I could die in the morning, but no one would know
Well my woman come round, my body she'd find
Go down to Dundee, have her a time

Snake Mountain's gonna crumble, Lord, and fall from the sky
'Fore that woman of mine stops tellin' her lies
Well if I'd die Lord she'd weep, she'd weep and she'd mourn
Soon as I was buried, forget I'd been born

Love a black-skinned woman, she won't do you no wrong
Slow to start moanin', she don't moan for long
Ah a yellow-headed woman brings nothin' but pain
Takes all you give her, well she leaves only shame

Ah my daddy, Lord, he rides on a long holy train
First winds of winter, I'll see him again
And it's farewell to this yellow-headed misery I've known
Snake Mountain's callin', callin' me home
Well the Snake Mountain blues got me down low
I could die in the mornin', ain't no one would know
My woman come around, my body she'd find
Go down to Dundee, have her a timeEmbed
