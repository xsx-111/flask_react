My Proud Mountains Lyrics
My home is Colorado with her proud mountains tall
Where the rivers like gypsies down her black canyons fall
Well I'm a long, long way from Denver with a long way to go
So lend an ear to my singing 'cause I'll be back no more

Well, I left as a young man not full seventeen
With nothin' for company, but the wind and a dream
'Bout all the fast ladies and livin' I'd find
When I left my proud mountains and rivers behind

So I rolled and I rambled like a leaf in the wind
Well, I found my fast ladies and some hard-livin' men
Well, I sometimes went hungry with my pockets all bare
Lord, I sometimes had good luck with money to spare

Well, I made me some friends, Lord, that I won't soon forget
Well, some are down under and some are rambling yet
But as for me, well, I'm headed for home
Back to high Colorado never more for to roam

So friends, when my time comes, as surely it will
You just carry my body out to some lonesome hill
And lay me down easy where the cool rivers run
With only my mountains 'tween me and the sun
Yeah my home is ColoradoEmbed
