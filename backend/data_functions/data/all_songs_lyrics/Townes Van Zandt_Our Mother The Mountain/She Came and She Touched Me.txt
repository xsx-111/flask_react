She Came and She Touched Me Lyrics
She came and she touched me with hands made of heaven
Reflections sent spinnin' through a face laced in mist
Now I stand where she left me buried deep 'neath her shadow
And the mirror pleads sadly, has it all come to this?
And I wonder will she call my name?

Where the wind careens madly through wide windows paneless
Fragrances mingle in a room full of shade
The peons pick partners and waltz across the ceilings
But the violins whisper that I've been betrayed
Tryin' not to look ashamed

Well the drunkards drink deeply from cups full of nothingness
Ghost lovers laugh at the games that they play
While the moments do somersaults into eternity
Cling to their coattails and beg them to stay
Saying I got nothing to hide

Well, illusions projected on walls made of tiffany
Mad minuets to a sad satin song
Harlequin mandolins harmonize helplessly
Hoping that endlessly won't last for long
Praying that their God ain't dying
Then I turn and I see her in a dress made of moonlight
Teardrops like diamonds run slow down her face
And her arms, they surround me like chains made of velvet
And the demons fall faithfully into their place
And the river runs with jewels

Now the morning lies open, the night went quite quickly
Memory harmlessly fractures and fades
All the poets do push-ups on carpets of rubber foam
Loudly they laugh at some joke that's been made
And the wise men speak like fools1Embed
