Like a Summer Thursday Lyrics
Her face was crystal, fair, and fine
And her breath was morning and her lips were wine
And her eyes were laughter and her touch divine
And her face was crystal and she was mine

If only she could feel my pain
But feelin' is a burden she can't sustain
So like a summer Thursday, I cry for rain
To come and turn the ground to green again

If only she could hear my songs
About the empty difference 'tween rights and wrongs
Then I know that I could stand alone
As well as they now that she's gone

Her face was crystal, fair, and fine
And her breath was morning and her lips were wine
And her eyes were laughter and her touch divine
And her face was crystal and she was mineEmbed
