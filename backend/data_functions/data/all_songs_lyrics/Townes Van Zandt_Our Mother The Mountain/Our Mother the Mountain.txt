Our Mother the Mountain Lyrics
My lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon is dancin' purple all through her black hair
And her ladies-in-waiting, she'll stand 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fair
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

She tells me she comes from my mother the mountain
And her skin fits her tightly and her lips do not lie
She silently slips from her throat a medallion
Slowly she twirls it in front of my eyes
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

I watch her, I love her, and I long for to touch her
The satin she's wearin' is shimmering blue
And outside my window, her ladies are sleeping
My dogs are gone hunting, their howling is through
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

So I reach for her hand and her eyes turn to poison
And her hair turns to splinters and her flesh turns to brine
She leaps across the room, she stands in the window
Screams that my first-born will surely be blind
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh
And she throws herself out to the black of the nightfall
She's parted her lips, but she makes not a sound
I fly down the stairway and I run to the garden
No trace of my true love is there to be found
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

So walk these hills lightly and watch who you're lovin'
By mother the mountain, I swear that it's true
And love not a woman with hair black as midnight
And her dress made of satin all shimmering blue
Sing a-to Lorelei-oh

Ah my lover comes to me with a rose on her bosom
The moon's dancing purple all through her black hair
And her ladies-in-waiting, she'll stand 'neath my window
And the sun will rise soon on the false and the fairEmbed
