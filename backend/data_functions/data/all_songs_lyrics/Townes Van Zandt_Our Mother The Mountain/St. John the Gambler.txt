St. John the Gambler Lyrics
When she had twenty years when she turned to her mother
Saying, "Mother, I know that you'll grieve
But I've given my soul to St. John the gambler
Tomorrow comes time to leave
For the hills cannot hold back my sorrow forever
And dead men lie deep round the door
Of the only salvation that's mine for the asking
So mother, think on me no more"

And winter held high around the mountains breast
And the cold of a thousand snows
Lay heaped upon the forest lea
But she dressed in calico
For a gambler likes his women fancy
Fancy she would be
And the fire of her longing would keep 'way the cold
And her dress was a sight to see

But the road was long beneath her feet
She followed her frozen breath
In search of a certain St. John the gambler
Stumbling to her death
She heard his laughter right down from the mountains
And danced with her motherâ€™s tears
To a funeral drone a calico
'Neath a cross of twenty years
To a funeral drone a calico
'Neath a cross of twenty years1Embed
