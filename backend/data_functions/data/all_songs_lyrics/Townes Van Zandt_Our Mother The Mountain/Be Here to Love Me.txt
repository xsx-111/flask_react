Be Here to Love Me Lyrics
Your eyes seek conclusion in all this confusion of mine
Though you and I both know it's only the warm glow of wine
That's got you to feeling this way
But I don't care, I want you to stay
And hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today

The children are dancin', the gamblers are chancin' their all
The window's accusing the door of abusing the wall
But who cares what the night watchmen say?
The stage has been set for the play
So just hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today

The moon's come and gone, but a few stars hang on to the sky
Well, the wind's runnin' free, though it ain't up to me to ask why
But the poets are demanding their pay
And they've left me with nothin' to say
Except hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me today
Just hold me and tell me you'll be here to love me todayEmbed
