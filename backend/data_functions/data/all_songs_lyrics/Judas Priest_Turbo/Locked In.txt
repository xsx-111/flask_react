Locked In Lyrics
I can't stand the way you move it
You drive me crazy with that walk
You get me so excited, I tremble and I shake
When you make the moves you make

You've got the key, the key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours forevermore

You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love

I can't take it when you touch me
Feels so good I could explode
You've got me in a frenzy, I tremble and I quake
When you shake the things you shake

You've got the key, the key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours forevermore
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love


You've got the key, the key to my heart
Go ahead and use it
Drag me in, slam the door
Then I'll be yours forevermore

You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in
Locked inside your love

You've got me locked in, baby
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, locked in, baby
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, locked in
Locked inside your love
You've got me locked in, locked in
Locked inside your love...2Embed
