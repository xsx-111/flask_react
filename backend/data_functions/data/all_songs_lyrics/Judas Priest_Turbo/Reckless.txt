Reckless Lyrics
No one can stop me now
I'm like a human dynamo
Live wired and charging out with power
This time I won't hold back
I'm raring to get up and go
Fueled up and growing by the hour

Look out
I'm blasting through the lines, alive and kicking
Watch out
I'm young and lethal
I'm going from here until eternity

I'm feeling reckless
Way out of hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Coming at gale force ten

Around me I feel the shock waves
Building from the energy
A force field no one can break through
Solid as rock no wonder
I am indestructible
First placed in everything I do
Look out
I'm blasting through the lines, alive and kicking
Watch out
I'm young and lethal
I'm going from here until eternity

I'm feeling reckless
Way out of hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Coming at gale force ten

Radioactive, I'm shooting through the atmosphere
Taking off, I'm heading like a rocket through the stratosphere

Look out
I'm blasting through the lines, alive and kicking
Watch out
I'm young and lethal
I'm going from here until eternity

Coming at gale force
Coming at gale force ten
I'm feeling reckless
Way out of hand, a real survivor
Reckless
Coming at gale force
Coming at gale force tenEmbed
