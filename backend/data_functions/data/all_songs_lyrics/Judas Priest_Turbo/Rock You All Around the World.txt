Rock You All Around the World Lyrics
In the cities of the world
You know every boy and girl
Goes crazy to the beat of rock and roll
And as the volume is soaring
All the crowd is roaring
Let it roll
Well, we don't care in the least
Because our metal is a feast
But there's always someone trying to put it down
So we crank the music louder
And our voices turn to power
With a wall of sound we'll blow them all away

Rock you all around the world
We're going to rock
We're going to roll
We're going to shake you down
We're going to lose control
 
No one can hold us down
Just look around and see
This generation's getting up and breaking free
Rock you all around the world
Rock you all around the world
We're going to rock
We're going to rock you
Rock you all around the world

Rock you all around the world
We're going to rock
We're going to rock you
Rock you all around the world
We're going to rock rock rock you
Rock you all around the World
We're going to rock
We're going to rock you
Rock you all around the world
We're going to rock rock rock you
Rock you all around the world
We're going to rock
We're going to rock you
Rock you all around the worldEmbed
