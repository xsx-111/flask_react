Hot for Love Lyrics
Twenty-four hours of the day
You're on my trail
And I can't get away
I can't shake you off
You're a wolf on the prowl
You got my scent
And I can hear you howl

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide this hurt inside

Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love

When the sun goes down
I can feel your heat
Until the sun comes up
When you've got me worn deadbeat
I said I'm all burned out
I'm a physical wreck
But there you go again with your
Hot breath on my neck
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide this hurt inside

Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love


Nowhere to run (Hot for love)
Nowhere to run (Hot for love)
Nowhere to run to (Hot love)
Nowhere to run (Hot love)

Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide this hurt inside
Hot for love
So hot for love
Oh baby, hot for love
Yes, you're hot for love
Hot for love
Hot for love
You're really hot for love
Hot for love...Embed
