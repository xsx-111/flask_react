Wild Nights, Hot & Crazy Days Lyrics
I'm going to break-out
I'm going to drive my car
I'm going to get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm going to overload

Can you feel the beat?
Everybody's rocking in the summer heat
As the sun goes down
Well deep down inside
You feel your temperature rise

For those wild nights
Hot and crazy days
Wild nights
Hot and crazy days

I'm feeling good tonight
I'm going to cruise around
Making every head turn
Wind up the radio
I'm in the mood for some loving
Because the night time's coming


Come on
Getting hot tonight
Come on
That's right
Come on
There's no end in sight
Come on
Alright

I'm going to break-out
I'm going to drive my car
I'm going to get up and go
I want some action
I've been working so hard
I'm going to overload


 
Wild nights
Hot and crazy daysEmbed
