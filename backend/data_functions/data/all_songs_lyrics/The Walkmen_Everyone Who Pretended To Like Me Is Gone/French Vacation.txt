French Vacation LyricsI've left my friend
Of drinking in on time
But he never showed up
But he speaks French, he's fine
And I'm
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
I should have known
I should have known
Hey, I'm glad you've finally caught up
Just to get a lounge
Been drank on my own
Hey, where'd you go?
Hey, where'd you go?
I remember when all our plans were to meet at home
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?Embed
