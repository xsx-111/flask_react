Roll Down the Line LyricsWhat I need boils
What I need binds
And strangles with regret
But still comes so easily
Where'd you go?
Tonight I woke
To find you gone
The question and
An answer that sounded off
The glance goes abject enough
When she was young
She asked me if
I knew her well
I thought I did
I know better know
What I need boils
What I need binds
And strangles with regret
But still comes so easily
The question and
An answer that sounds
The glance goes abject, cut off
An answer, cut offEmbed
