It Should Take a While LyricsFound out
Not just now, no
I just know it's not
Your good time
I'm wrong
Even now, I'm wrong
Even now
Even now
I don't care that much right now
I'm a mess, I can't get out
That's the last thing
I, I can see for the worst anyway
This could be time for us
This could be time for us
It's been fun, let's leave it at that
Goodnight, sure it's been a long time
Let's not push our luck this time
Let's not push our luck this time
Goodnight, sure it's been a long time
That'll be enough for tonight
Let's not push our luck this time
I wasted hours, I'll forgive
The hard luck, I'll accept it
I hope you won't think of it
I hope you won't think of itEmbed
