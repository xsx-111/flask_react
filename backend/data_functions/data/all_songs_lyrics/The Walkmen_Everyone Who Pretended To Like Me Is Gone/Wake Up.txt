Wake Up LyricsOut of station through my radio
Nothing's on
It's like a joke that's told without its final line
Where's it going?
Where had it belonged?
I know
I'm trying
I'm trying to wake up
Wake up
And I tell by you way too far
Looking back I had a casing
Sentimental suns and shade
Would they ever spin around?
Foward
They're trying
They're trying
And so they do
In the call of a new world
As I climb to the next floor
Haven't we met before
Under brighter skies above
Above
Anyway, its fine
We're walking through wind
Unfamiliar scenes, we're choking on it
And we're shaking hands with someone we dont know now
Wake up
