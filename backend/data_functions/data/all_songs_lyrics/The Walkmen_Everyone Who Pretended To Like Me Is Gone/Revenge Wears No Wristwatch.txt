Revenge Wears No Wristwatch LyricsAnger, anger
Treats me hard
I tell her I say
I've heard it all before
I've had it up to here
Such a mess, I am
You say somethings wrong
This kind of lifestyle doesn't work
I'm trying something else
For a change, for a change
Thats okay, okay, okay
I've heard it all before
I've had it up to here
Such a shame, such a shame, such a shame1Embed
