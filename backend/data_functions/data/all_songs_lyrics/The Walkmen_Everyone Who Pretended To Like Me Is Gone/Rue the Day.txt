Rue the Day LyricsI know you won't be thinking of me now, it's been years
But I hope you change your mind when we were introduced
We both laughed 'cause we've been friends since long ago
And then today, but I never thought of you a single day
But yesterday I remembered driving with no headlights
We would tiptoe out in the evening
Never done such things before
But I have never frowned once
Thinking of you since
I'd be lying if I said your name never came up
As I'd be thinking of just how I'd like to cash my days in now
And all I ever do is think of yesterday
Man, it's hard to stand up straight all of the time
We'd tiptoe down
To my basement
Never done such things before
I'd drive you home for goodness sake
I could barely stand up straight
Oh there's a memory calling
Calling way too loud and way too strong
Twisting all the bad things into good
I'm a lucky guy now
But I'll never know until it's gone
Yeah, I'll never know it till its goneEmbed
