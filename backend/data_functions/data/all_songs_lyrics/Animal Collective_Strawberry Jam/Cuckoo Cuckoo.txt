Cuckoo Cuckoo LyricsHow I lost my boy
How I lost my boy
How I lost my boy
How I lost my boy

The king in I died
He kept floating past my eyes
And singing his songs
Life was good, now death's all wrong
Cause you can't feel a thing
No heart flutters in late spring
You just drift and pray
For sun-kissed golden days

And I can't hold what's in my hand
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
And little kids sliding down the steel park slide
Little kids can't play with things that died
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
And two to three minutes don't seem so long
And where's my mom, I want to hold her tight
She's so far away from crowded nights
I'm going cuckoo cuckoo
We're all going cuckoo cuckoo
He said please stay
You can see me, don't go away
I can't see the landscape
Please describe its amaranthine haze
It's odd where I am
They're people, you're not like them
They just look away
For rain-quenched golden days

And my tears quench five feet of lawn
And I can scream, but cannot yawn
And people gonna come and people gonna cry
He just woke and dreamt and ate and died
Don't try and erase what you have done
Put your fingers in a mouth and kiss it if it wants
And where's my friend, I want to hold him tight
He's so far away from mountain lights
I'm going cuckoo cuckoo
We're all going cuckoo cuckoo

And I can't hold what's in my hand
Don't do any good to say this isn't what I planned
And little kids sliding down the steel park slide
Little kids can't play with things that died
Sometimes all I want is one favorite song
And two to three minutes don't seem so long
And where's my mom, I want to hold her tight
She's so far away from crowded nights
I'm going cuckoo cuckoo
We're all going cuckoo cuckoo2Embed
