Chores LyricsIf I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have 'til I am dead
If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have 'til I am dead
Now I've got these chores
And I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done
Now I've got these chores
And I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done
If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have 'til I am dead
If I say too bad
I'll take a lesson in my head
I've got to have 'til I am dead
Now I've got these chores
And I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done
Now I've got these chores
And I'm never going to hurt no one
And when at last
My work is done
I only want the time
To do one thing that I like
I want to get so stoned
And take a walk out in the light drizzle
At the end of the day
When there's no one watching, when there's no one watching
When there's no one watching, when there's no one watching
At the end of the day...
When there's no one watching...
When there's no one watching...
When there's no one watching...
When there's no one watching...
It's not going to happenEmbed
