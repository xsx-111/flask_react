#1 LyricsNoah: Mine, I want
I caught you when your line got disconnected trouble
Respect the hive, it seems like days since you ejected
Your mom and I will help you dance through your bad weather
Young love is fine, just please respect the candles as they line (as they line)
Now Son!
Noah: I won't waste time, I won't waste mine
I know there will be times, you wonder why it can't stay simple
Your mom and I
To pet your head and dress your lettuce
Don't work all night and split your hair and sleep on numbers
Young love is bright
Just please respect the candles in a line (as they line)
Now Son!4Embed
