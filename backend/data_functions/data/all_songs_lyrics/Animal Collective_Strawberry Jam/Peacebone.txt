Peacebone Lyrics

Bonefish

A Peacebone got found in the dinosaur wing
Well I've been jumpin all over, but my views were slowly shrinking
I was a jugular vein in a juggler’s girl
I was supposedly leaking the most interesting colors

While half of my fingers are dipped in the sand
You progress in letters but you're used to cooking broccoli
The other side of takeout is mildew on rice

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the "old times"
Then we did believe in magic and we did die
It's not my words that you should follow, it's your insides
You're just an inside, adjust your insides, you're just an inside

I bet the monster was happy when we made him a maze
'Cause he don’t understand intentions and he just looks at your face
I bet the bubbles exploded to tickle the bath
And all the birds are very curious, all the fish were at the surface
With half of me waiting for myself to get calm
I'm like a pelican at red tide
I'm a corpse, I'm not a fisherman and
A blow out does not mean I will have a good night

And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the "old times"
Then we did believe in magic and we did die
It's not my words that you should follow, it's your insides
You're just an inside. Adjust your insides. You're just an inside

Well I start in a hose and I'll end in a yard
When I feel like I’m stealing I can't keep myself from hearing God
Only the taste of your cooking can make me bow on the ground
It was the clouds that carved the mountains
It was the mountains that made the kids scream

Oh well she bore all her parts but
She never was found
You think I'll carve a path through New York
And be an artist, but are you anything
Then you find out that you can’t ask a baby to cry
And an obsession with the past is like a dead fly
And just a few things are related to the "old times"
When we did believe in magic and we did die
It's not my words that you should follow, it's your inside
Adjust your insides. You're just an inside

Inside, inside, inside...
Peacebone, peacebone, peacebone...
