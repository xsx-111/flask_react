Fireworks Lyrics
Now it's day I've been trying
To get that taste off my tongue
I was dreaming of just you
Now our cereal, it is warm
Attractive day in the rubble
Of the night from before
Now I can't walk in a vacuum
I feel ugly, I feel my pores
It's the trees of this day
That I do battle with for the light
Then I start to feel tragic
People greet me I'm polite:

What's the day? What's you doing?
How's your mood? How's that song?
Man, it passes right by me
It's behind me, now it's gone
And I can't lift you up, my mind is tired
It's family beaches I desire
A sacred night, we'll watch the fireworks
The frightened babies poo
They've got two...Flashing eyes and they're colored why
They make me feel
That I'm only all I see sometimes
I've been eating with a good friend
Who said ‘A genie made me out of the earth's skin'
In spite of her she's my birth kin
She's spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people out lurking
In dominions of a hot Turk dish
If elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
I've been eating with a good friend
Who said ‘A genie made me out of the earth's skin'
In spite of her she's my birth kin
She's spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people out lurking
In dominions of a hot Turk dish
If elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
I've been eating with a good friend
Who said ‘A genie made me out of the earth's skin'
In spite of her she's my birth kin
She's spits me out in her surly blood rivers
All the people out lurking
In dominions of a hot Turk dish
If elephants are reaching for our purses
Then meet me after the world with the shivers
What's the day? What's you doing?
How's your food? How's that song?
Man, it passes right by me
It's behind me, now its gone
And I can't lift you up 'cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
Sacred nights where we watch the fireworks
They frighten the babies and you know
They've got two!
Flashing eyes and their colored why
They make me feel
That I'm only all I see sometimes
And I can't lift you up, cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
Sacred nights where we watch the fireworks
They frighten the babies and you know
They've got two!
Flashing eyes and if they're color blind
They make me feel
That you're only what I see sometimes
And I can't lift you up, cause my mind is tired
It's family beaches that I desire
Sacred nights where we watch the fireworks
They frighten the babies and you know
They've got two!
Flashing eyes and if they're color blind
They make me feel
That I'm only all I see sometimes20Embed
