Derek LyricsWe had a white and blackish sheltie had a name when we first got him
Shoulda taken better care of him but he had it okay
I'm sorry when I get unruly when you carry on so much I get a little tired
I hope you get over your teething it's not easy when you feel sick
He had a sprightly walk you'd like him when he'd keep up along your side
Wrap your peckers is what he told us
Me and Mike looked at each other
Like whoa what was that then
Derek never woke up at night
And in the morning he's ready to go
And he never had a voice like you
To scream with when he wanted something
I should have been so much more willing
To help out with all the things
That a dog like you needed
What do you
See when you
See inside of me
You can count when you count, count on me
What do you see when you see inside of me4Embed
