Time LyricsTime here, all but means nothing
Just shadows that move 'cross the wall
They keep me company, but they don't ask of me
They don't say nothing at all
And I need just a little more silence
And I need just a little more time
But you send your thieves to me
Silently stalking me
Dragging me into your war
Would you give me no choice in this?
I know you can't resist
Trying to re-open a sore
Leave me be, I don't want to argue
I'd just get confused and I'd come all undone
And if I agree, well, it's just to appease you
Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for
You see love, a tight thorny thread
That you spin in a circle of gold
You have me to hold me
A token for all to see
Captured to be yours alone
And I need just a little more silence
And I just need a little more time
The courage to pull away
There will be hell to pay
Deeper you cut to the bone
Leave me be, I don't want to argue
I'd just get confused and I'd come all undone
And if I agree, well, it's just to appease you
'Cause I don't remember what we're fighting for
Time here, all but means nothing
Just shadows that move 'cross the wall
They keep me company
But they don't ask of me
They don't say nothing at all
So leave me be, I don't want to argue
I'd just get confused and I'd come all undone
And if I agree, well, it's just to appease you
Cause I don't remember what we're fighting forEmbed
