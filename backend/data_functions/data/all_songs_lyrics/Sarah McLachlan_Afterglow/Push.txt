Push LyricsEvery time I look at you
The world just melts away
All my troubles, all my fears
Dissolve in your affection
You see me at my weakest
But you take me as I am
When I fall you offer me a softer place to land
You stay the course, you hold the line
You keep it all together
You're the one true thing I know I can believe in
You're all the things that I desire
You save me, complete me
You're the one true thing I know I can believe
I get mad so easy
But you give me room to breathe
No matter what I say, you'll do
Because you're too good to fight about it
Even when I have to push
Just to see how far you'll go
You won't stoop down to battle but
You never turn to go
You stay the course, you hold the line
You keep it all together
You're the one true thing I know I can believe in
You're all the things that I desire
You save me, complete me
You're the one true thing I know I can believe
Love is just the antidote
Nothing else can cure me
There are times I can't decide
When I can't tell up from down
You make me feel less crazy
Otherwise I'd drown
But you pick me up and brush me off
You tell me I'm okay
Sometimes that's just what we need
To get us through the day
You stay the course, you hold the line
You keep it all together
You're the one true thing I know I can believe in
You're all the things that I desire
You save me, complete me
You're the one true thing I know I can believe
You stay the course, you hold the line
You keep it all together
You're the one true thing I know I can believeEmbed
