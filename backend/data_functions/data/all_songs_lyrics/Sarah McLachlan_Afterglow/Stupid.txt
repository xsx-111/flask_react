Stupid LyricsNight, lift up the shades
Let in the brilliant light of morning
But steady me now
For I am weak and starving for mercy
Sleep has left me alone
To carry the weight of unraveling where we went wrong
It's all I can do to hang on
To keep me from falling into old familiar shoes
How stupid could I be
A simpleton can see
That you're no good for me
But you're the only one I see
Love has made me a fool
It set me on fire and watched as I floundered
Unable to speak
Except to cry out and wait for your answer
But you come around in your time
Speaking of fabulous places, create an oasis
Dries up as soon as you're gone
You leave me here burning in this desert without you
How stupid could I be
A simpleton can see
That you're no good for me
But you're the only one I see
Everything changes
Everything falls apart
Can't stand to feel myself losing control
But deep in my senses I know
How stupid could I be
A simpleton can see
That you're no good for me
But you're the only one I see
How stupid could I be
A simpleton can see
That you're no good for me
But you're the only one I seeEmbed
