Drifting Lyrics
You've been gone so long
That all that you know has been shuffled aside
As you bask in the glow
Of the beautiful strangers that whisper your name
Do they fill up the emptiness?

Larger than life is your fiction
In a universe made up of one

You have been drifting for so long
I know you don't want to come down
Somewhere below you there's people who love you
And they're ready for you to come home
Please come home

Walk in a room and the world stops to stare
Mesmerized all who are caught in the glare
Of the spotlight that follows wherever you go
Does it light up the emptiness?

Larger than life is your fiction
In a universe made up of one
You have been drifting for so long
I know you don't want to come down
Somewhere below you there's people who love you
And they're ready for you to come home
Please come homeEmbed
