Train Wreck LyricsWould your love in all its finery
Tear at the darkness all around me
Until I can breathe again
Until I believe again
'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen
Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks
A wildfire born of frustration
Born of the one love that gets me so high
I've no fear at all
Would your eyes like midnight fireflies
Light up the trenches where my heart lies
Until I can see again
To find my way back again
'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen
Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks
A wildfire born of frustration
Born of the one love that gets me so high
I've no fear at all
To fall so deep into you
Lose myself completely
In your sweet embrace
All my pain's erased
From your mouth it's all that I wish
The mercy of your lips just one kiss
Until I can breathe again
Until I can sing again
'Cause I'm a train wreck waiting to happen
Waiting for someone to come pick me up off the tracks
A wildfire born of frustration
Born of the one love that gets me so high
I've no fear at all
To fall so deep into you
Lose myself completely
In your sweet embrace
All my pain's erasedEmbed
