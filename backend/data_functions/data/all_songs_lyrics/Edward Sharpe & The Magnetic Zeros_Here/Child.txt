Child LyricsThe voices in my head are shadows, shadows
She comes to me to tell me what they're after
Says, "It ain't the end boy but you best be careful, careful"
Might catch your tail end in a circle, circle
The ocean, how she moves in ripples, ripples
In flashing lights I swear she was an old film
Then the color bleeds and she becomes an angel, angel
Calls out to me like a siren to a scoundrel
I say, "Come on, child"
And I say, "Come on, child"
The blanket where she hides by virgin lights
Look to the sea where the cotton hits the turnpike
Staring her needs but I don't have the words right, words right now
If it were up to me might make her turn right, turn right
Lost another one but she still smiles, smiles
Black loving eyes and a stare that sees for miles
Says she wants to, oh wants to stay a child, child now
And wonders why we ever ever have to die
And I say, "Come on, child"
And I say, "Come on, child"
Just a touch I'm gonna carry, carry
Another time where our palms shared the same lines
The accent of a kiss whispers we're married, married now
It's either love or just the sun in my eyes
And I say, "Come on child"
And I say, "Come on child"
And I say, "Come on child"
Love, love, love, love, loveEmbed
