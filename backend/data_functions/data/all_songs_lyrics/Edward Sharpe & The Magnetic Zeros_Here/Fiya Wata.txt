Fiya Wata LyricsI'm sending you all of my love
You with a heart to feel it (feel it)
You in the light and dark
With the eyes to see it
Love
Go ahead
Love stand beside us!
Love is within each heart to guide us
And I thank the sun for shining that light
And lettin' love blaze like
Fire!
Water!
We're all still learning
The river forgives
All tides are turning
(You know) some say the river won't flow
They say it's gonna stay run dry
(You know) well, once more the river will flow
For every time it was dry
We'll all be sharing a river of love
And letting love blaze like fire
River, river, river
Love like a river
The river it flows
However dark or long the night is
My love
The sun
Is your reflection
It's true
We're one
We're all each other
Lay down your arms
Lay down your gun
Open your arms
Free your heart
And know one day I'll see you all
Farther down this river
To a place we've never, ever known (no)
Tonight out son will finally know the sound of love delivered
To its hidin' place beneath the winter snow
And I thank the sun for shining that lightEmbed
