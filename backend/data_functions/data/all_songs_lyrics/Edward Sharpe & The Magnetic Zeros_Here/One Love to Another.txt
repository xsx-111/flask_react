One Love to Another Lyrics
One love, one love
One love to another
One love to another
One love to discover
He'll come for he's helpful
She loves getting sunshine
She paid me in ?
Everything is alright
She said

One love, one love
One love in the heart
One love for another
One love to discover
It's a hard time a hard time
Dissolution
It's a hard time a hard time
Revolution
It's a hard time a hard time
Like a ?
It's a hard time a hard time
?

La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la
It's a good time a good time
Dissolution
It's a good time a good time
Revolution
It's a good time a good time
Like a ?
It's a good time a good time
?
One love, one love
One love to another
One love, one love
One love to discover
?
Oh, one love
