Mayla LyricsMayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, hold on
Try to see it through
My future to the new horizon
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Hold on, we'll try
Our hands are bleeding through
We're building us a new horizon
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, we'll try
Our hands are bleeding through
Our guess is stuck with you and falling
And all I have to do to arise
Is look into your eyes
Mayla, long time
Mayla, sunshine
Mayla, hold on
Try to see it through
Our future to the new horizon
Mayla, Mayla, Mayla, Mayla
Mayla, Mayla, Mayla, Mayla
Mayla, Mayla, Mayla, MaylaEmbed
