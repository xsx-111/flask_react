All Wash Out LyricsHere come chilly preacher
Stumblin' 'gainst the wind
Singing, love, love is something to believe in
A prayer and the sea and twenty tons of me
Crying love, love is something to believe in
To my child of wonder rambling
On my crooked fingers pointing blame
Let it all wash out in the rain
Let's let it all wash out in the rain
Beyond the drunken focus of my aim
I'm the hero twistin' in the flame
Let's let it all wash out in the rain
Let it all wash out in the rain
One more for forgiveness
Twistin' in the cold
Singing love, love is something I believe in
Too much my defenses are danglin' from the chain
Oh, but free, free is something to believe in
To my God I want my gypsy train
To my child a howlin' tambourine
Let it all wash out in the rain
Let it all wash out in the rain
Yes let it all wash out in the rain
Let it all wash out in the rain
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm1Embed
