Burger Queen LyricsSlightly bemused by his lack of direction
Hey you, hey you
Came to this world by caesarean section
Hey you, hey you
Chooses his clothes to match his pallid complexion
Hey you, hey you
Now it takes him all day just to get an erection
Hey you
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Goes out to cruise and to meet his connection
Hey you, hey you
He never scores he just gets an infection
Hey you, hey you
Dreams of a place with a better selection
Hey you, hey you
Still it takes him all day just to get an erection
Hey you
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem
Makes no sense at all
Things aren't what they seem
Luxemburger queen
He's a burger queen
Slightly bemused by the total rejection
Hey you, hey you
Came to this world by caesarean section
Hey you, hey you
Dreams of a place with a better selection
Hey you, hey you
Dreams of a face that is pure perfection
Hey you
Things aren't what they seem
Luxemburger queen
Luxemburger queen
Luxemburger queen
He's a burger queen1Embed
