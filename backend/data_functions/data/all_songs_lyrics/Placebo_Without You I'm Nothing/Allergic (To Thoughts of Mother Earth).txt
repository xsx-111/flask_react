Allergic (To Thoughts of Mother Earth) LyricsAny means in your horizon, Heaven in a tourniquet
The after life to keep your eyes on bitter pill you take today
With expert levitation forward, polished to the nth degree
It takes it's smile from every children, you take the beatin'
Any means in your horizon, every mink walks two by two
We gamble to be born again, you know I never wanted to
Expert levitation forward, polished to the nth degree
Takes it's smile from every children, you take the beatin'
The light divinin', the light definin'
The light divinin', the light dividin'
Don't let me down, let me, let me down, don't let me
Don't let me down, let me, let me down, let me
Don't let me down, let me, let me down, don't let me
Don't let me down, let me, let me down, let me
The light divinin', the light definin'
The light divinin', the light dividin'2Embed
