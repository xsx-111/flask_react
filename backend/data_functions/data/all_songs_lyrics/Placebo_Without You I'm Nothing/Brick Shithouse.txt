Brick Shithouse Lyrics
Meet the brick shithouse
This is the brick shithouse
This is the brick shithouse
This is the brick shithouse
This is the brick shithouse
This is the brick shithouse
This is the brick shithouse
Meet the brick shithouse
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?

Lay him down, lie on
Lay him down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching
Meet the brick shithouse
Kiss the brick shithouse
Meet the brick shithouse
Kiss
Lay him down, lie on
Lay him, down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
When you cum you never make a single sound
I'll be watching, when he's around
When he's around, when he's around
He's around
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?

Lay him down, lie on
Lay him down
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
Now your lover went and put me in the ground
I'll be watching, when he's around
When you cum you never make a single sound
I'll be watching, when he's around
When he's around, when he's around
He's around
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?
Don't you wish you'd never met her?2Embed
