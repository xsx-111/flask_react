Ask For Answers LyricsTime to pass you to the test
Hanging on my lover's breath
Always coming second best
Pictures of my lover's chest

Get through this night
There are no second chances
This time I might
To ask the sea for answers
Always falling to the floor
Softer than it was before
Dog boy, media whore
It's who the hell you take me for
Give up this fight
There are no second chances
This time I might
To ask the sea for answers
These bonds are shackle free
Wrapped in lust and lunacy
Tiny touch of jealousy
These bonds are shackle free
Get through this night
There are no second chances
This time I might
To ask the sea for answers
These bonds are shackle free
These bonds are shackle free
These bonds are shackle free
These bonds are shackle free

Get through this night
There are no second chances
This time I might
To ask the sea for answers2Embed
