Scared of Girls LyricsAn introverted kind of soul
The earth did open, swallow whole
Careenin', careenin'
Careenin', careenin'
Her next of kin who lived in sin
Was asking God to let her in
Careenin', careenin'
Careenin', careenin'

I'm a man, a liar, guaranteed in your bed
I gotta place it on the rack, got a place inside it
Got a place inside it, got a place inside it
An extroverted kinda girl
Did tour the world with MC5
Careenin', careenin'
Careenin', careenin'
Her younger sister, had a blister
Where I kissed her on her thigh
Careenin', careenin'
Careenin', careenin'
