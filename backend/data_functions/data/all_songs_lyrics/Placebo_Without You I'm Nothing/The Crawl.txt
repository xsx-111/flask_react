The Crawl Lyrics
It takes the pain away
But could not make you stay
It's way too broke to fix
No glue, no bag of tricks

Lay me down, the lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl

Your smile would make me sneeze
When we were Siamese
Amazing grace in here
I'd pay to have you near

Lay me down, the lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl

Don't go and lose your face
At some stranger's place
And don't forget to breathe
And pay before you leave
Lay me down, the lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl
Lay me down, the lie will unfurl
Lay me down to crawl4Embed
