Radio Sucks (Interlude) Lyrics
Hey, It's the bald man here and
I'm here to tell you why the
New Limp Bizkit album is so important
That's because CD's like this one spare you
From all the Chart-topping, Teeny-Boppin'
Disposable happy horse shit that
Brings up the bile from the back of my neck
I have no time or tolerance for all the shitty wack acts like that
I wouldn't piss on their CD's to put out a fire
And I'm Tired of all the lame-ass, tame-ass
Pre-fabricated, sorry excuses for singers and musicians
Who don't even write their own songs
What the world needs now is a musical revolutiuon
We need some rock, we need something that has balls
We need something with substance, depth, something with soul some edge, some passion, some power
Shit, if it's gonna be mellow, fuck, man
It better have something, it better mean something!
I'm telling you, if you gotta hit 'em with something hard
You gotta stick 'me with something limp, Like Limp Bizkit
I'm so fucking tired with this shit
I'm hearing on the radio, radio sucks!
The same fuckin songs over, and over again!
All the weak ones, all that disposable crap
That isn't gonna matter in 3 months, it's just shit, It's crap, Fred
Fred I'm telling you there's nothing, but shit goin' on
And we need some new music
W-Wha-What about Limp Bizkit?
Limp Bizkit is fuckin cool, you guys are cool
The new record's great, but fuck all that other shit!
I'm so sick of all that weak shit that's takin up space on the charts. Fuck that shit, Fred, I'm Outta' here!
Fuck, dude, Fuckin' Pinfield is pissed
Oh, man I gotta go find that bald bastard
Hey, Matt! Matt!Embed
