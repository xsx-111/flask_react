Trust? Lyrics
Backstabbers
Two-faced
Low lifes
It's time to step up to the plate
A one, two
A one, two
A one, two
What the fuck you gonna do?

You know I see right through you (Through you!)
You act like you don't know me (Know me!)
You lie, you cheat, you steal, you lose
Wouldn't wanna be in your shoes (So buckle up!)
Always looking over your shoulder (Shoulder)
For the ones you stick (Stick), you sick little prick (Prick)
It looks like your time's running out (Ooh!)
Creeping up your back (back), so what you all about?

I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!

You're the kind of guy with two faces (Faces!)
Just another life that's wasted (Wasted!)
Here's a little fact, you do me like that (That!)
End up in the back of my trunk in a sack
You'd better keep your hands off (What?)
What's mine or anybody else's (Else's!)
When you're selfish, your wealth is
All you crave (Crave!) from the cradle to the grave
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!

I got a little bitty question
Just what the fuck are you thinking?
You think you're all that and then some?
Well you're not, I think you're dum-diddy-dumb

I take it back (Back), those thoughts are kinda wack (Wack)
Don't really need that kind of karma on the track (Track)
Maybe Freddy Krueger will step into your dream and
Burn you like a demon and leave your ass screaming
To be exact ('xact), I wanted to react (Act)
Mission of attack ('tack), your head was getting cracked (Cracked)
But you're a human being that's lucky to be breathing
And that's that, that's that

I don't trust nobody (Nobody)
And nobody trust me
Never gonna trust anybody (Never gonna trust anybody)
And that's the way it's gonna be (Gonna be)
I don't trust nobody (Nobody)
'Cause nobody trust me (Trust me)
Never gonna trust anybody (Never gonna trust anybody)
And that's the way it's gonna be!
I don't trust nobody
'Cause nobody trust me!
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way it's gonna be!
I don't trust nobody
'Cause nobody trust me!
Never gonna trust anybody
And that's the way it's gonna be!
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!
I'm too fucking good and fucking proud
I'm gonna show you how bad it hurts to be a clown!1Embed
