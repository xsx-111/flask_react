Re-Arranged Lyrics
Just think about it
Just think about it

Lately, I've been skeptical, silent when I would use to speak
Distant from all around me who witness me fail and become weak
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged

It seems that you're not satisfied, there's too much on your mind
So you leave, and I can't believe all the bullshit that I find
Life is overwhelming, heavy is the head that wears the crown
I'd love to be the one to, disappoint you when I don't fall down

But you don't understand when I'm attempting to explain
Because you know it all and I guess things will never change
But you might need my hand when falling in your hole
Your disposition, I'll remember when I'm letting go
Of you and me, we're through and rearranged
You and me, we're through and rearranged
You're no good for me
Thank God it's over
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying
And you make believe
That life is so long until you're dying
You make believe
That nothing is wrong until you're crying, crying on me
You make believe
That life is so long until you're dying, dying, dying on me!
You think that everybody's the same
I don't think that anybody's like you
(You ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
You think that everybody's the same (Thank God it’s over, and I won’t be the same)
(You ruin everything and you kept fucking with me)
I don't think that anybody's like you (Thank God it’s over, and I won’t be the same)

Just think about it
You'll get it
