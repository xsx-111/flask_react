A Lesson Learned Lyrics
This pain in my stomach won't go away
I assume, this is punishment from all mistakes I've made
In a world where my actions speak louder than words
In a world where my actions speak louder than words

I know more people than ever before
One lesson I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now than I've ever been

'Cause this pain in my stomach won't go away
I assume this is punishment for all mistakes I've made
In a world where my actions speak louder than words
In a world where my actions speak louder than words

I know more people than ever before
One lesson I've learned from it all
Fortune and fame are disguised as your friend
'Cause I'm lonelier now than I've ever beenEmbed
