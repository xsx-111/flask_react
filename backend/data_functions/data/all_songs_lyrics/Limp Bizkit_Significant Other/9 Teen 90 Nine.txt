9 Teen 90 Nine Lyrics
Bring it on!

Fame, you're claiming is the top of the world
This stage I'm claiming is the top of the world
Love I'm feeling when you people connect
And if you're out in the crowd you're getting more than respect
And if you're wondering I got plenty of flows
I'm making plenty of friends and many are foes
But as the audience grows, security knows
Stopping me now is kinda serious

No use in dreading what they call Armageddon
I think we made it through the slump
But who really cares where we're heading?
'Cause now you mutherfuckers got a reason to jump!

So lets make something out of it this way we can all relate
Worldwide, we collide, this is how we communicate
So let's make something out of it, whoever thought we would see the day?
I can't believe we did it so let's drift away

Hate, a feeling I don't really get
And hate can get you in some serious shit
Time is something that may change me
But I can't change time, so fuck it!
I've been stumbling through these thoughts
And about the fact that I could be delirious
But as the audience grows, security knows
Stopping me now is kinda serious
No use in dreading what they call Armageddon
I think we made it through the slump
But who really cares where we're heading?
'Cause now you motherfuckers got a reason to jump!

So lets make something out of it this way we can all relate
Worldwide, we collide, this is how we communicate
So let's make something out of it, whoever thought we would see the day?
I can't believe we did it so let's drift away

We see good things change and good things go away
We see good things waste and we taste, the pain
What we need is a place to escape from today, right!
What we need is a place to escape from today, right!
Yeah!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!

You wanna be down with the G shock
Fuck the glam rock, assed out like Ken Shamrock
MC's detest me wanna chest to chest me
But I ain't all about that
You gotta be down with the G shock
Fuck the glam rock, assed out like Ken Shamrock
MC's detest me wanna chest to chest me
But you don't want none of that!
Yeah!
Where we at?
Where we at?
Where we at?
Where we at?
Where we at?
Where we at?
Where we at?
Where we at?
Don't stop!
It's 9 teen 90 nine!
Don't stop!
It's 9 teen 90 nine baby!1Embed
