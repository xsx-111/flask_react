The Mind of Les Lyrics
Hit me, Fire cracker
So there you go
Fifteen of your hard earned dollars
Right out the window
Most expensive piece of plastic
I've ever come across
Fifteen dollars, fifteen dollars
On a shoddy piece of plastic
There is it Limp Bizkit in all it's glory
Fred Durst, the man, the myth
The compulsive masturbator
You love him, you hate him
You love to hate him, Hello
Once when I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
My poppy gave my nose a tweak
And told me I was bad
Then I learned a brilliant word
Saved my aching nose
The biggest word you've ever heard
And this is how it goes
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though he sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Ah, those were the days
I don't know, you got any more of that
So what did you think
You were getting a Celine Dion record
No, no, no young bucky
You laughed, you cried
You just kissed your
Fifteen bucks goodbye
Limp Bizkit, I don't think so
Fred Durst, I don't know
But what the hell, I got paid
Goodbye nowEmbed
