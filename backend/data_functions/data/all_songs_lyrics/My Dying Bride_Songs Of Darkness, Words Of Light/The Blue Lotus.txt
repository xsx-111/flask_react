The Blue Lotus LyricsUnder the darkened, ancient oak
Gentle in the night's breeze
I stop and stare, rest a while
With hands upon my knees
Through jaded leaves, bush and scrub
I spy my journey's end
Black it looms, silent gloom
The castle called Avend
On I trot, past forest eyes
Past horrors of the night
Through the dark, I see a sign
A gentle glowing light
Upon reaching the castle I ascend the ivy
Towards the window
My heart pounds, my breath is rushed
As I fight both brick and branch
The ledge is mine and over I sweep
Silent like the snow
Quiet, I slip across the polished floor
Tonight, I will dine with chance
(The Blue Lotus, a legend, I thought a myth
Old poems and stories gone)
A beauty of unimaginable lust
Both men's hearts, and Gods, were won
Skin like milk, an angel's face
They say her smile could kill
Her hair the blackest of all black
Stories I thought though, still
So there she lay sleeping upon the bed
(Half covered by fantastic silks)
Her breast I see, moves with her dreams
A sight I will always recall
A single candle that shows the way
(Through forest, river and hills
Glows upon that lovely skin
Shadows dancing around the walls)
Closer I creep, toward my prize
The Blue Lotus lies before me
Her lips are full, red as blood
Moist as they invite me
Stoop I did to kiss those lips
In that glowing room
When suddenly, she did awake
Her eyes filled with doom
From silks, her hands were round my neck
Escape there was no hope
A flash of teeth is all I saw
And gone was my throat
Her blood lust deep, she swallowed me
Red was all I saw
She drank her fill and watched me fall
Gently to the floor
A league away my death is found
By locals who tend this land
Who lay me down in shallow earth
A single lotus placed in my handEmbed
