A Doomed Lover LyricsYour unbreathing, unbreathing sleep
Our dreamless bed
Is mine to keep
In my eyes and frozen arms
Nothing lives 'cept my harm
Now you're worn, worn with years
Years and sorrows
Like saints with arrows
Once again, I see a man
I watch him die with a humble sigh
Calm this tide, tide of sorrow
He leads me away and I follow
Sighs and then slumbers
Wakes and sighs again
Opens up the eyes
Sees the ghost again
Our dying love, it prays in vain to live
And pleads for help, I simply cannot give
"My devoted love takes tiny backward
Steps away
Loneliness aplenty spread before me
My devoted love takes tiny backward
Steps away
Loneliness aplenty spread before me"Embed
