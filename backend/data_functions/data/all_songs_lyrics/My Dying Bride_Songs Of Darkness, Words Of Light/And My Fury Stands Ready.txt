And My Fury Stands Ready LyricsCome from where you hide
(So I may) unchain my tempest
None will stop my tide
(And you will) tremble at my unrest
Find you I will
(And take you) up into your Heaven
Commeth soon the kill
(I have taken) kings and feeble men
"And my fury stands ready
I bring all your plans to nought
My bleak heart beats steady
'Tis you whom I have sought
Feasting myself sick
On your pathetic sins
Wound for me to lick
The work of slaughter begins"
In my face (in my face) see your killer
You can wish me away
In your face (in your face) I still see her
No more shall you betray
In her face (in her face) saw her killer
Thou shalt not pray
Come from where you hide
(So I may) unchain my tempest
None will stop my tide
(And you will) tremble at my unrestEmbed
