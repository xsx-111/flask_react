Catherine Blake LyricsSo vile men's torment was truly a pleasure
A plan that would change mankind forevermore
Catherine Blake slept fitfully in the
Summer night, in the heat
She murmured gently and moved smoothly
This way and that, oh, the beauty
Her luscious eyes, delicate fingers
Clawed at her sodden bed
Catherine smiled, took a fabulous breath
Of summer air and tasted death
Die Erorians' visit had been successful rewarding
With night of female screams of whimpers
Lustful dreams
Night followed rampant night of
Delicate soft gasps
The ultimate attack on Heaven and it's glories
Seduce them as they slept, oblivious to
Their midnight tryst
The seed of doom was planted
Phantom raped in their dreams
The sad ones take their own lives
Slay their men night after night
Catherine Blake dreamt of a horror
Of passion too and of terror
Over her silent breast, shadows swept
Shades caressed
Motherhood was destroyed by the seed
And laid to waste
A great rift was born
Men and the world were torn
The daggers went in deep, vile and sickening
Women swept away all infancy from their wombs
"And still the Lord God remained silent
No utterance, no movement, no tears"
The earth became red
The cutting machines of man
Disgust and hatred for the lives of woman
The butchery, the savagery, did spill unto themselves
"A chorus of agony from Heaven and Rain poured in a colossus of angels tears"
The creature of all sins
The lord of the bleakest abode
Did wonder at the silence
What did the Almighty know?
All Hell did fill with the screaming souls of dead men
"The mighty army of God did stand and wait
Hoping our lord would unleash them all"
The great fiery pit, hordes ripped apart
Chaos ensued, screaming from the dark
Observing his darkened child, in the miserable
Corners of earth
The great heart of God will heal up the earth
"The Lord watched as his beloved slipped silently back into the darkness below"Embed
