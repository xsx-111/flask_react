The Scarlet Garden LyricsI know no shame
The empire of my desire
Gathers you into my fire
I'll hope you fall, hope you call
My filthy name, it makes you crawl
On you knees, with all your pleas
Lay down there, look up at me
Look at me
Are you alive my dear, and breathing?
Are you diseased my dear, and bleeding?
I'll lift you high my dear
I'll have you dreaming
'Tis time to say farewell, to your pleading
Poor devil as thou art, a ruin at my feet
Go drop your little life, and welcome up my sleep
So briefly at my side, so simple in defeat
No more lies utter from you
From mine eyes I must take you
No longer wise. Nothing is new
Tears for my trembling faith
You shall not die unsung
Goodbye my dear, you wicked thing
I have no tears, beautiful thing
No silver pail to catch them in
So ends this tale you did not winEmbed
