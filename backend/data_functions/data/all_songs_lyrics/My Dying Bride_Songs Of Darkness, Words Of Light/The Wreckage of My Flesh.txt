The Wreckage of My Flesh LyricsLoathsome I've become
A creature so undone
Wretched and broken
I cannot find my faith
Any God will do
Nothing said is new
Nothing said is true
Fly away my hope
The embrace, embrace of shade holds me dear
Eats me away
Loose the dogs of disgrace upon me
I have no faith
Raise the poor outcast I have
I have become, I am undone
Calm is the air. Still is the sea
The valley of death keeps calling me
Rest my eyes from the world
This dying place, it's so absurd
Oh, Christ above, whom I love
Lost to me. My snow white dove
Make this day like the night
Songs of darkness and words of light
Pulling down, down my heart
I won't forget my lovers heart
With utter loathing and scorn
I was somehow born
Strewn in black decay
None shall I obey
The wreckage of my flesh
The nakedness of my deathEmbed
