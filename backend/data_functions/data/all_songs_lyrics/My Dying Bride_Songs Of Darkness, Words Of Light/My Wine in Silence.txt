My Wine in Silence LyricsWhere are you now, my love?
My sweet one
Where have you gone, oh my love?
I'm so alone
I only think of you
And it drives me down
I only dream of you
Come here my lover
I'll keep you
I will change you
Come here my slave
You will live forever
Screaming
Crying
My lover
With you
I'm done
At last
I'll come to you, take my hand
Hold me again, please take my hand
Who are you?
What were you?
My beauty
I can't tell
How I feel
How I felt
You have paid
For your un-kindness
With you
I'm done
At last
Please hold me now, my love
Where are you now, oh my sweet love?Embed
