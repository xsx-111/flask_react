Warned You Lyrics
He looked to me, it's no surprise
And I
Well, I
I could die

But I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you

And if I ever look surprised
Well, I
I'm not trying
To lie

But I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you
I warned you, I warned you8Embed
