Time To Try Again Lyrics
Time to try again
At home I need to find my pills
Something they forgot to teach was
How to relax when things look steep

But you and I've been told
That now we're getting older
To use some sense and not our luck
Oh I never had enough
So why try again?

Can't seem to find the time
To straighten out and make something mine
It's all good to wish you well but
What's the point no kiss and tell
But it's over

Since we've been told
That now we're getting older
To use our sense and not our luck
Oh you know I never had enough
So why try again?2Embed
