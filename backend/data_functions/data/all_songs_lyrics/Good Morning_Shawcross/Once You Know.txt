Once You Know Lyrics
Once you know what I got to say
That'll explain why
And how I feel at the end of the day
It's to do with you
And I
And I
And I
And I

Is that a question on your mind
Or did I read you wrong
I don't know what you feel inside
Sometimes I've tried
But it's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone
It's gone

You need a lover more than you let on
Don't need me as your friend
I'm thinking that I'm just in love
What's the difference in
The end
The end
The end
The end
The end
The end
The end
The end?2Embed
