Wednesday Lyrics
Oh, my darling I can't ignore
One little thing
It hurts me to adore
Each time I look
I seem to find
What's good in love
Is not that good at all
Oh no
Oh no

It's hard to make plans
Caught up again
Oh no
It takes so long but it's not for me
Surely you'll see

So please relax and take my hand
I'll come with you
To see your rocking band
Stop up the street or I'll guess far
Take one for me, and all the rest is lost
Oh no
Oh no
It's hard to make plans
Caught up again
Oh no
It takes so long but it's not for me
Surely you'll see1Embed
