Myopic Void Lyrics
I no longer, saw color
Only gray, only gray
I no longer, saw color
Only gray, only gray
I no longer, saw color
Only gray, only gray
I no longer, saw color
Only gray, only gray
I no longer, saw color
Only gray, only gray
I no longer, saw color
Only gray, only gray

Dancing madly backwards
Dancing on a sea of air
Dancing madly backwards
Dancing on a sea of air
Dancing madly backwards
Dancing on a sea of air
Dancing madly backwards
Dancing on a sea of airEmbed
