As the Moon Speaks (Return) Lyrics
As the moon speaks to the waves of the sea
An open ocean relic of the times that used to be
Many years have passed since your vision came to me
And I think of you only as the moon speaks to the sea

Memories have only open space to give
And as I think to the past there's nothing left to see
So future man, open your arms to me
Let me hear the wisdom as the moon speaks to the sea
Yeah!

I can't feel nothing
I can't feel nothing
I can't feel nothing
I can't feel nothingEmbed
