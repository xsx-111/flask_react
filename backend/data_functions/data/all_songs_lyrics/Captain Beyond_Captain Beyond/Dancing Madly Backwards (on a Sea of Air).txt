Dancing Madly Backwards (on a Sea of Air) Lyrics
Dancing madly backwards
Dancing on a sea
Erasing all my memories
Of blackness in my dreams
Tip toe, tip toe quickly
Forget about your cares
And remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air
Just remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air

Wishing all your wishes
Landing on a star
Knowing you are planted here
Knowing that's so far
Dance, dance faster
Madly dance away
But remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air
Just remember underneath you
Is just a sea of air

Well, it's alright now, looked it face to face
Don't complain, if it seems too late
No no no no no
Ah, 'cause I'm not sitting on the golden gate
Love and a-peace and a-war and hate
No no no no no
Well I'm not gonna sit around and wait
All I'm a-doing is losing my faith
No no no no
But we're all on stage and that's for sure
Searching is endless when there ain't no cureEmbed
