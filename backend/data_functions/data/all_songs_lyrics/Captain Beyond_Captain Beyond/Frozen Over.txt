Frozen Over Lyrics
Mama don't mind what you say
All about a thousand days of yesterday
Mama don't mind what you do
She's gonna love, she's gonna love, she gonna love you
Mama don't mind what you say
All about a thousand days of yesterday

Delays, it's late
I just can't wait to see your face again, I know
Delays, it's late
I just can't wait to see your face again moving faster
Delays, it's late
Open the gate, the man that's leading up to my door, I said
Delays, it's late
I just can't wait to see your face again frozen over

Delays, it's late
Can't you see the past is catching up to you
Delays, it's late
Please don't wait, you can't conceive a thing that you do
Delays, it's late
Can't you see that death is moving up more and more
Delays, it's late
I just can't wait to see your face again frozen over
Ah, your face is frozen over
It's not the one I knew, no, no

Honey, your face is a-frozen
Frozen as could be
Baby, your face is like a block of ice
Cold as the deep dark seaEmbed
