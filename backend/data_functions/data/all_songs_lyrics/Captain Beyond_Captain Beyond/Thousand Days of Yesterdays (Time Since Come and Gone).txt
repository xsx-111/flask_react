Thousand Days of Yesterdays (Time Since Come and Gone) Lyrics
A thousand days of yesterdays
Time since come and gone
A thousand days of yesterdays
Are all goodbye, so long
Tomorrow comes like wind blown clouds
Animals lose the racing grounds
Space has just been lost and found, yeah

I said soon
Gonna wake, no sleepy eyes
And soon, sun will light the tired sky
Today is just as soon again
Reflections see myself out there
Where's the start and where's the end? Yeah

Days gone by never to return
Days gone by never to return
Days gone by never to return
Days gone by never to return
Days gone by never to return
Days gone by never to return

A thousand days of yesterdays
Time since come and gone
A thousand days of yesterdays
Are all goodbye, so long
Today is just as soon again
Reflections see myself out there
Where's the start and where's the end?Embed
