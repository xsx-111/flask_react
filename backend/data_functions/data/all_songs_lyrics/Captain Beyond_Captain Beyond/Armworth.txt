Armworth Lyrics
What was my arm worth when they took it away?
In the spirited rush that set up Armistice Day
Where did they put it, Bella, where and which way?
Did it stop the mad charge that the enemy made?
Or is it with my brother, is it with my brother
In a mean, endless grave?
Tell me, where?
Tell me, where will I go to find it?

What has my arm gained in the balance of things?
Are there still birds a-flying in a brushing of wings?
Or do they still see the skies, still see the skies as a terrible thing?
And spoiling all their singing, babe, and a-smashing up their wings?
Wish I could go with them, Brother, but of all things
It's only a stub of the original thing
And it was there when I signed up and I saluted my king!
Where? Tell me
Where do I go to find it?Embed
