Mesmerization Eclipse LyricsPart 1
See the bright ship in the harbor, hey
Making iridescent waves
Need to try a little harder
On the voyage to better days
Sun and moon in the valley at the same time
Bringing out the golden braid
Guess we're gonna reach the peak in no time
Optic nerve just rot away
Mesmerization eclipse in the movement, hey

Desperation is setting in, baby
Erratic movement to and fro
Need your love to make it right, baby
'Cause I have no place to go
Sun and moon in the valley at the same time
Hey, baby you know it's true
Guess we're gonna reach the peak in no time, yeah
Optic nerve just can't be fooled

All of a sudden babe I blew my time
Things got lost
Oh so lost
Trying to hide in time

Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby
Mesmerization baby

Ooh your God
Pulled you in like the ancient siren
Within the desert lies the deal
Hear the visitation sermon
Never quite deserve the deal
It's a mesmerization eclipse
It's a mesmerization eclipse
It's a mesmerization eclipseEmbed
