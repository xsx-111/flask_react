Raging River of Fear Lyrics
There's a strange feeling coming down
Swooping deep inside us
Turbulent smoke signals
Silent sound around us
Pushing forth, and pulling back
Twisting far and near
In every cold reality
Flows a raging river of fear
I've been captured by the river of fear, listen

Where it comes from and why it's here
Is a mystery to us all
A black night cocktail storms the land
Rush to meet the dawn
 the things that be
Sounds ring out of the clear
I won't drown as she pulls you in
The raging river of fear
I've been captured by the river of fear
Ooh ooh river of fear

The raging river of fear my friend
Is running through us all
The minds just like a battlefield
Memories full of thought
Raging river of fear
Questions to us all
Feel it, can't you feel it
Feel it, can't you feel it
Feel it, can't you feel it
Feel it, can't you feel it
Feel it, can't you feel it
Feel it, can't you feel it

The raging river of fear my friend
Is running through us all
The mind's just like a battlefield
Memories full of thought
Raging river of fear
Questions to us allEmbed
