As the Moon Speaks (to the Waves of the Sea) LyricsListen
Jump on a moonbeam and ride
Ride it, glide it, all the way
As the moon speaks to the waves of the sea
And of an ocean relic of the times that used to be
Many years have past since your vision came to me
And I think of you only as the moon speaks to the sea
Astral lady, girl I love you
Gonna dance, you make it sound
Seal keeps altars high above all
That is out of life, yeahEmbed
