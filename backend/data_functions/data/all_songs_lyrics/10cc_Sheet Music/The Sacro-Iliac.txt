The Sacro-Iliac Lyrics
Here's a new dance that you all can do
Baby, baby, what's he gonna do?
Sit back and relax 'cos it's good for you
Baby, baby, what's he gonna do?
What's he gonna say?
He's takin' my breath away

Well if you're tired of doing the Boogaloo
And you're afraid of doing the Swim
'Cos you think you will drown
In the noise of the record
And the klutz on the floor
He ain't there anymore
'Cos all you wanna do
Is be alone at the bar
All you wanna do is be alone at the bar

You wanna drown in your cocktail
You wanna leave with the laundry

If your mind is trippin'
But your disc is slippin'
Here's what you gotta do -
Nothing
In any tempo and any rhythm
C'mon Mac do the sacro-iliac
C'mon back do the sacro-iliac
I said c'mon back do the sacro-iliac
Well it's easy
Here's the new dance that you 'll wanna do
So easy
Don't want to annoy ya with my paranoia

Now I'm doing the dance that is good for me
Baby, baby, what's it gonna be?
I ain't no Astaire, but I've a right to be
Baby, baby, when's he gonna learn?
Where's he gonna stay?
He's taken my breath away

Well I'm bored with the beat of the Shing-a-ling
And the Lindy is leaving me cold
'Cos I've never been freaky or funky or laid back
And the lush on the floor
Isn't me anymore
And I never ever wanna be alone
At the bar
I never ever wanna be alone at the bar

So C'mon Mac do the sacro-iliac
C'mon back do the sacro-iliac
Won't you c'mon back do the sacro-iliac
C'mon back do the sacro-iliac
Won't you come on back do the sacro-iliacEmbed
