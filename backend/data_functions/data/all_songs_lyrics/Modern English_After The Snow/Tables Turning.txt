Tables Turning LyricsThe bells are tolling for me and my love
Screened horizon's fading, but fading from my trust
All the walls are falling 'round my ears
I can see the writing's on those walls
Can't you tell me what to do?
I always place my trust in you
Reaching out for what is mine
Pulling down the invisible blind
Empty beds for an empty mind
Something difficult to describe
Content but not quite safe
I turned and watched you fade away
Can't you tell me what to do?
I always place my trust in you
Reaching out for what is mine
Pulling down the invisible blind
Can't you tell me what to do?
I'll always place my trust in you
It's the blind leading the blind
How can we be so kind?
Help yourself to another bite
Everything will be alright
The table's turning 'round to you
Lay it well before the silver cracks in two
Can't you tell me what to do?
(The bells are tolling) For me and my love
Can't you tell me what to do?
(Horizon's fading) For me and my love
Can't you tell me what to do?
(The walls are falling) For me and my love
Can't you tell me what to do?
(The tables turning) For me and my love
Can't you tell me what to do?Embed
