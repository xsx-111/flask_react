Face of Wood LyricsDreaming in a chair, contemplating
Of times gone by, exhilarating, entertaining
Reaching out with tenderness
Scenes of laughter framed in reminiscence
Catch a smile for stormy days and sad occasions
Moving targets and camera shy
The room is dark and shadowed
Time keeps ticking by
Silence and solitude
No one left to cry
No one left to cry
Standing in front a mirror
I draw and pinch my skin
Tired eyes portray reality
A face of lines looks out in the world
I am oak
I am oak
I am oak
I am oakEmbed
