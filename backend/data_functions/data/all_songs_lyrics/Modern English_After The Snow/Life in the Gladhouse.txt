Life in the Gladhouse LyricsLife in the gladhouse is never dull
Humdrum days still flying out the window
It's wild with overgrown people
Broken engagements and twisted faith
Growing up and then just growing older
Oh me, oh my
An Easter parade for the innocence
A fugitive smile makes a break for the wire
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
My shadow gives me distance
And props me up against the wall
My shadow gives me distance
And sometimes he's not there at all
So let's all dance in time
This song is called necessity
Let's all dance in time
Let's all dance, let's all dance, that's all
Oh me, oh my
Clowns for the public
Pre-sing their sales
A private affair
Oh me, oh my
Oh me, oh my
So let's all dance in time
So let's all dance in time
(Life in the gladhouse is never dull)
So let's all dance in time
(Life in the gladhouse is never dull)
So let's all dance in time
(Life in the gladhouse is never dull)
So let's all dance in time
(Life in the gladhouse is never dull)Embed
