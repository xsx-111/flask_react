After the Snow LyricsThe rhythm of the rain gives an off beat on the window pane
Like an angel crying from the sky
I can see its beauty after the snow
I can see its beauty after the snow
The temperature's dropping rapidly
Normal service will shortly be resumed
I can see its beauty after the snow
I can see its beauty
After the snow (Has gone away)
After the snow
I stood and watched the dark sky rise
With glaring sunlight in my eyes
I thought of home and times gone by
And laughed aloud at the crimson sky
After the snow
After the snow
After the snow
After the snow
After the snow, there's something more
After the snow, there's something more
After the snow, there's something more
After the snow, there's something more
After the snow
After the snow
The rhythm of the rain gives an offbeat on the window pane
Like an angel crying from the sky
I can see its beauty after the snow
I can see its beautyEmbed
