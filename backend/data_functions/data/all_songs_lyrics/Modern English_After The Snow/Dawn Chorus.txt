Dawn Chorus LyricsWhen summer returns to its warm green fields
The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
The swallow swooping, migrating home
The dawning days morning with a sigh
Opening windows with a wounding cry
The rainbow's lost its dreams of gold
And everything slows
When summer returns to its warm green fields
The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
The swallow swooping, migrating home
And everything slows
The closing vacuum draws you in
Strange visions, balloons on white stallions
A wall of sound with flutes and strings
Rising on a wave of voices
Surrounded by your humble faith
Morning's there to wake us
In time, rain and sky
The world is breathing, living, but turning in its rage
When summer returns to its warm green fields
Everything slows
The sun fading, pastel in the breeze
Everything slows
The swallow swooping, migrating home
Everything slows
The swallow swooping, migrating homeEmbed
