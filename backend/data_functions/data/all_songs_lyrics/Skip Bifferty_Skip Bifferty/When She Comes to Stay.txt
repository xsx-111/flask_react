When She Comes to Stay Lyrics
If I want to be you, free, easy and myself
Found out what to see, found my mind and it is real
Then I start to think of what to do today
Find to change, so I go around to say
When she comes to stay, tries to change my way

So I tried to be clear, open so you see
That I found the day when I asked her if I may
Keep her in my life and I can do her
Do what is right, sleep a day and live by night
Ooh, when she comes to stay, tries to change my way
