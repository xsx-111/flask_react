Money Man Lyrics
Hey Mr. Money Man, please help me know your plan
I want to know
Keeping my money there, so I can look and stare
Don't let me go

Hey Mr. Money Man
Send me some money can you?
Mr. Money Man 
Spending money is a drag, when you are looking on my shoulder
Waving notes and keeping checks on me
Leave it all to me 

Sending your auditor  looking for (Looking for me)
Where has your money gone, what did you spent it on?


Saving money is the thing, invest it
I would rather spend it having good times, all the drinks I need
Save it all you see, give it all to meEmbed
