Everything About You LyricsThe sound of your Christian name
I love it, I hear that name
And other words aside from you
The sound of your Christian name
I love it, I never can
Hear that name and not think of you
I love the sound of your voice
I love the way that you smile
When I'm not with you
I can't wait to see you
You have this nature that is
Wonderful like a kiss
I truly do love everything about you
Sometimes you say
Something so common place
Everyday
And to me it sounds magical
I love the sound of your voice
I love the way that you smile
When I'm not with you
I can't wait to see you
You have this nature that is
Wonderful like a kiss
I truly do love everything about you
I love the sound of your voice
I love the way that you smile
When I'm not with you
I can't wait to see you
You have this nature that is
Wonderful like a kiss
I truly do love everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about you
Everything about youEmbed
