Sensitive LyricsWe all need to feel safe
Then that's taken away
Sometimes I want to return
Return to before
The trouble began
That time of no fear
By showing you I'm
Sensitive
You do risk
Being crucified
Crucified by
Those you are unlike
My feelings are hurt so easily
That is the price that I
I pay
The price that I do pay
To appreciate
The beauty they're killing
The beauty they're busy killing
If the sun going down
Can make me cry
Why should I
Why should I
Why should I not
Like the way I am?
My feelings are hurt so easily
That is the price that I
I pay
The price that I do pay
To appreciate
The beauty they're killing
The beauty they're busy killing
Killing
Killing
