When Morning Comes To Town LyricsWhen morning comes to town
I'll be moving on
When evening comes back 'round
I'll be somewhere alone
Somewhere far away
What about you?
All things have to end
They have to and they do
And they do
We started to believe
To one another we belong
We know that isn't so
You're not mine but I'm not yours
I never wanted this
For us to carry on
Knowing that it leaves
And knowing what we want
What we want
This way it is the way no rain (?)
I'm happy to go out like this
If happy is the word
I'll think of you always
For you know it as well as I
To follow you I would have
Died, I would still die
Would still die
When morning comes to town
Something once precious (?)
And for all of time
Because of how we feel
????????????
Us afraid to be alone
Not saying anything
Knowing something's wrong
Something's wrong
This way it is the way no rain (?)
I'm happy to go out like this
If happy is the wordEmbed
