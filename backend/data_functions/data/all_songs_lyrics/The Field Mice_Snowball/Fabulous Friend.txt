Fabulous Friend LyricsThat hard, cruel hostile town is no place you'd want to fail
If somewhere you were to fail
Success at any cost
If fade the same and fall
If fade the same and fall
When even there I did not think of
Someone I should have thought of
She was my fabulous friend
I could but be impressed
I could but be impressed
I wish I'd been hers too
What good does wishing do?
What good does wishing do?
I was born afraid, I miss her to this day
For me and only me
My concern it was for me
My concern it was for me
How am I to accept
I could show such thoughtlessness
I could show such thoughtlessness
I can't stop thinking of the person i did not think of
I'm not brave, I'm not special
I'm not any of those things
I'm not any of those things
This guilt that I do feel
I deserve to always feel
Fully deserve to never not feelEmbed
