I Can See Myself Alone Forever LyricsNow and then it occurs to me
I am still on my own
Now and then it to me
I am still on my own
I become afraid that I could die
Having only been alone
I become afraid that I could die
Having only been alone
I start to think that I know
This is why I always fear
I still haven't found someone
Someone to love
Now and then it occurs to me
I am still on my own
I start to think that I know
This is why I always fear
I still haven't found someone
Someone to love
It makes me sad
For I know like anyone with love to give
I know I could care for someone
Like anyone with love to give
Love to give
Love to give
I start to think that I know
This is why I always fear
I still haven't found someone
Someone to loveEmbed
