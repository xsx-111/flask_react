This Love Is Not Wrong Lyrics
Why is it they cannot see any love this precious?
It really does anger me, that they disapprove of this love

This love is as good as any other
As good as any other
This love is not wrong
Not wrong
Not wrong

Why is it that they knock something so special?
If only they could see when you touch me I tingle

This love is as good as any other
As good as any other
This love is not wrong
Not wrong
Not wrong

Why am I letting them get to me?
Those who don't understand that only good things can
Come from what we feel for one another
At the moment, at this point in time
Why is it that this love we have upsets them?
Why is it that they find this love upsetting?

"This love is as good as any other"
Says one woman to another
This love is not wrong
Not wrong
Not wrongEmbed
