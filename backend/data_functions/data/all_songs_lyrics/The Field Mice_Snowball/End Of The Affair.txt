End Of The Affair LyricsThis is it, isn't it?
This is the end
For you and I
For you and I
The end of the affair
We no longer care
For each other
Once I needed you so
Once I needed you so
Now I can't stand being in the same room as you
I can't even stand the sight of you
This is it, isn't it?
This is it, isn't it?
This is it, isn't it?
This is it, isn't it?
This is it, isn't it?
This is it, this is the end
For you and I
This is it, isn't it?
(I don't love you)
This is it, isn't it?
(anymore, and you)
This is it, isn't it?
(don't love me)
This is it, isn't it?
(anymore now)
This is it, isn't it?
(do you?)
This is it, this is the end
For you and IEmbed
