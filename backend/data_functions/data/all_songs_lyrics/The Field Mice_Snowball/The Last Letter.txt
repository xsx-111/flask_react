The Last Letter LyricsHere is the letter
The last letter
The last ever
I am so sorry
You're the last one
I'd ever want to hurt
But my life was always
Heading for this
It has to be this way
I have no choice
Thank you for being so good
For seeing to me
If it hadn't been for you
This could have taken place
Sooner
You deserve better
Than this here last letter
I never was one
To try
I never was any good
Was I?
Here is the letter
The last letter
The last everEmbed
