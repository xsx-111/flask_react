When You Sleep LyricsWhen you sleep
I listen to you breathing
When you sleep
I listen as the air
Leaves you
I can't help feeling
It cannot last
I can't help feeling
You will break my heart
Break my heart
Where is that
Chaos that usually
Flows from me
Is usually
Part of me
Part of me
I can't help feeling
It cannot last
I can't help feeling
You will break my heart
Break my heart
I could listen to you
Breathing too deep
Forever
Forever
On account of you
I am able to
Forget how
Painful
I felt
With you
I can't help feeling
It cannot last
I can't help feeling
You will break my heartEmbed
