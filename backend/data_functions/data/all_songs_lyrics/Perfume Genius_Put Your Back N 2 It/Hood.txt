Hood Lyrics
You would never call me baby
If you knew me truly
Oh, but I waited so long for your love
I am scared, baby, that I can't keep it up for long

Boy, I wish I grew up the second
I first held you in my arms
Underneath this hood you kiss
I tick like a bomb

You would never call me baby
If you knew me truly
Oh, but I waited so long for your love
I will fight, baby, not to do you wrong2Embed
