Take Me Home Lyrics
Take me home, tend to me
Baby lay me down easy
For I have grown weary on my own

All alone
I wither and I bruise
I run my mouth like a fool

I'll be so quiet for you
Look like a child for you
Be like a shadow of a shadow
Of a shadow for you

Take me home, tend to me
Baby lay me down easy
For I have grown weary on my own

All alone
I wonder aimless
I work the corner of an endless grid
I'll be so still for you
Like a dead dog
Lay there till my eyes pop
All for you4Embed
