17 Lyrics
Take everything away
This gnarled, weird face
This ripe swollen shape
I want blank, I want frozen lake
I want deep space

Tuck the whole thing
In the body of a violin
String it up on a fence
Cover it with semen
I am done, I am done with it

Don't sing me that song
It will only prolong it3Embed
