Dark Parts Lyrics
The hands of God were bigger than grandpa's eyes
But still he broke the elastic on your waist

But he'll never break you, baby
But he'll never break you, baby

The hands of God were bigger than grandpa's eyes
But he's long gone

The love you feel is strong
The love you feel is stronger

I will take the dark part
Of your heart into my heart
I will take the dark part
Of your heart into my heart1Embed
