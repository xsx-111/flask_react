Sister Song LyricsDrive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone
Your sister and me have a set of keys
Don't you worry your head 'bout a thing
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're gone
Your sister and me will keep your place clean
So it shines when you finally come home
Drive on, drive on
My special one
Don't you stop 'til you know you're goneEmbed
