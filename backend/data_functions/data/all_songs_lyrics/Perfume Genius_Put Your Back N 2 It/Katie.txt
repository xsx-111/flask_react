Katie LyricsKatie I don't believe you and that's the bottom line
How could this have gone on before my very eyes?
Well if you're trying to make me cry
Well I'm crying
But what you tell me, oh, that's gotta be a lie
All I ever wanted for you kid was a life unlike mine
No knock on the door and no drag to floor every night
I can't have it be true for you too
I can't believe you
It would cut me to the bone
To know that I let that man into our home
Not baby, no Katie, not youEmbed
