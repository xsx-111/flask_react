Floating Spit Lyrics
Peel off the color
Of the night
A second skin
A floating spit is hovering
The other side is opening now
I don't think that I can hold it
The other side is opening now
I don't think that I can hold it

Tear off the color
Of the night
A second skin
A floating spit is hovering
The other side is opening now
I don't think that I can hold it
The other side is opening now
I don't think that I can hold it3Embed
