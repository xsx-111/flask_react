No Tear Lyrics
Roof comes down
And you leave me with nothing
I will shed no tear

Earth gives way
You leave me hanging
I will shed no tear

Baby the centre will bloom
With or without you
And the core, it will turn
With or without you

And I will carry on
I will carry on with grace
Zero tears on my face1Embed
