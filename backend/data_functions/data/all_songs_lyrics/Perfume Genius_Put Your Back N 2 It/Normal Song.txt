Normal Song Lyrics
Hold my hand, I am afraid
Please pray for me when I am away
Comfort the girl
Help her understand
That no memory, no matter how sad
And no violence, no matter how bad
Can darken the heart
Or tear it apart

Take my hand when you are scared
And I will pray if you go back out there
Comfort the man
Help him understand
That no floating sheet, no matter how haunting
And no secret, no matter how nasty
Can poison your voice
Or keep you from joy6Embed
