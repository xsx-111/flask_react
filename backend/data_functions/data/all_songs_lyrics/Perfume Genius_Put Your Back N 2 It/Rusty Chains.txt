Rusty Chains LyricsAll my dreams
I've seen them leave with my old love
No longer near me
Now I am made of rusty chains rattling
Oh let them
Let them break
Whoever does undo these knots
Oh let me claw my way to the front
And be with him
Like that summer
The one we spent before
He was taken from me
So safe
That feeling that is so endless
Oh let me rest
In his arms again
So safe was that feeling
And so endlessEmbed
