Web Weaver LyricsLarynx cries no longer heard
A chord was struck that chilled the nerve
It froze the time that we all lived
The roles reversed to downward spin
Is life finished or hung within?
The voices pleading went unheard
And shattered membranes of our lives
Hung suspended from the hives
Where is harmony? The sad voice wanedEmbed
