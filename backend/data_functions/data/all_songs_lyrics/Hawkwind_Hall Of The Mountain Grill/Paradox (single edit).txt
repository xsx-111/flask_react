Paradox (single edit) LyricsThe story that I'm telling you
Something that you can do
Ask yourself and try to find the answer
See the signs, they're always there
But you know you never care
You're always looking for another reason
Try to reach it's not too far
See it as you really are
Ask yourself to try and find the answer
Always, always it's the same thing
Try it, try it, you just can't win
Circles, circles spinning round
People, people always bring you down and down
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round you go
Down and down, down and down
Down and down, down and down
Down and down, down and down you go
Down and down, down and down
Down and down, down and down
Down and down, down and down you go
Down and down, down and down
Down and down, down and down
Down and down, down and down you go
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round
Round and round, round and round you goEmbed
