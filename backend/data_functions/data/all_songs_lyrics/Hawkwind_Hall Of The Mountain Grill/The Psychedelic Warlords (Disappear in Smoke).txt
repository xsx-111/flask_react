The Psychedelic Warlords (Disappear in Smoke) LyricsSick of politicians, harassment and laws
All we do is get screwed up by other people's flaws
World turned upside down now, nothing else to do
Live in concrete jungles that blocks up the view
And that ain't no joke
You can disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke
You can disappear in smoke
And I'm telling you that it ain't no lie
Think you know the answers, we don't tell no lies
We can take you any way, seven different highs
World turned upside down now, there's nothing else to do
Live in concrete jungles that blocks up the view
And that ain't no joke
You can disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke
You can disappear in smoke
And I'm telling you that it ain't no lie
Sick of politicians, harassment and laws
All we do is get screwed up by other people's flaws
World turned upside down now, nothing else to do
Live in concrete jungles that blocks up the view
And that ain't no joke
You can disappear in smoke
And that ain't no joke
You can disappear in smoke
And I'm telling you that it ain't no lie
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no joke
That ain't no jokeEmbed
