Magical Colors LyricsCome on
Come on baby
I got to get it
Oh up in your room
Magical colors
I won't be that way
Come on baby
I know I can't understand it
I just gotta get some of that thing
Oh, I gotta get into your business
I gotta get it
I gotta, gotta keep on pushing
Magical colors
I talk about me and you
Oh come on baby
The way you shake that thing
Shing a-ling a-ling
I know I wasted all of my time
I know I just can't make it alone
I gotta get into your business
Come on baby
Please
Don't treat your daddy this way
It seems like this whole crazy world wanna keep two people like us apart
And I can’t stand it
D'you know it make me wanna cry
D'you know it make me wanna cry
D'you know it make me wanna cry
D'you know it make me wanna...cry


Yeah, I feel so good
I don't care who knows it
That’s right
Come on baby
Let me into your business
I gotta, gotta get it
I gotta, gotta keep on tryin'
Magical colors
Talk about me and you
Yeah
I got to keep on pushing baby
Keep on trying baby
'Cos I love you
Ohhhhh! YeahEmbed
