Blue Green Olga LyricsShe is blue green
She is blue
She is blue green
She is blue
And I love her, yes I do
She is flying like a bird
Floating through the waves, absurd
And I love her, so I do
Blue green Olga by my side
Take a chance and be my bride
Blue green Olga by my side
I said I love her, so I do
Well, you got me going up town
You know I'm feeling good
Said that you were sixteen
And mother understood
I got to love you, Olga
You got to help me please
She is blue green
She is blue
She is blue green
She is blue
I love her, so I do
She is mine and she is wise
She is more than candy eyes
And I love her, yes I do
Blue green Olga by my side
Take a chance and be my bride
Blue green Olga by my side
I said I got to love you, Olga
Damn
Give it up
Come on, Olga
Give it up, yeah
Give it up
Blue green baby
I said you're monkey
And you're mutt
Blue green baby
Oh true blue, true blue
Oh shit
True blue, true blue
True blue, true blue
Blue green baby
Blue green baby
