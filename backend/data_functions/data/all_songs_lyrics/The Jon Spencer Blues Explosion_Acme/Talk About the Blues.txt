Talk About the Blues Lyrics
Woooooooooooooooo

That’s right
I’m talking about the blues
I said I feel so good baby
Oohh
I’m talking about the blues
Rolling Stone magazine
On the telephone baby
Talk about the blues
Right now, oohh
Look out, yeah, ha ha ha
That’s right ladies and gentlemen, thank you for letting me into your home
I’m gonna do it right now
I’m gonna talk about the blues
Ughh
Rolling Stone magazine
Coming on the phone baby
Talk about that
Fashion, haa!
Ughh
(I use that microphone like a plumber use a tool)

Hey
Spin Magazine
Wanna tell you where you at
But I ain’t getting with that
Or MTV
Make up your own mind ladies and gentlemen
(That’s bullshit man, you know what I’m talking about)
Do your own thing
Yeah, ‘cause that’s a rock 'n' roll blues we did
Rock ‘n’ roll, yeah
Rock ‘n’ roll, get real, c’mon
Right now ladies and gentlemen, right now, right now
We’re gonna bring it on down, everybody
Do it!

Stay with me baby
Because I got something I want everybody to hear right now
Ladies and gentlemen
I don’t play no blues
I play rock 'n' roll
That’s right
The blues is number one
The blues is number one ladies and gentlemen but there’s something I gotta tell you right now
I do not play no blues
I do not play no blues
I play rock 'n' roll
Get it!

I play rock 'n' roll
Yeah, that’s right baby, come on momma
Do it baby (rock 'n' roll)
I said I feel so good
I said I feel so good (rock 'n' roll)
I said I feel so good baby
I said I feel so motherfucking good (rock 'n' roll)
Oh
That’s right
Whoo, oh behalf of myself, Mr. Judah Bauer, Russell Simins and everybody at Rolling Stone magazine I’d like to say
Rock ‘n’ roll
(I know you had something to do with what happened to my brother)Embed
