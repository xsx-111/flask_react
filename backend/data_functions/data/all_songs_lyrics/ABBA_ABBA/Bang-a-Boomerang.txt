Bang-a-Boomerang Lyrics
Making somebody happy is a question of give and take
You can learn how to show it so come on, give yourself a break
Every smile and every little touch
Don't you know that they mean so much?
Sweet, sweet kisses so tender
Always will return to sender

Like a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is love

Love is always around and you can look for it anywhere
When you feel that you've found it my advice is to take good care
Never use it as a selfish tool
Never ever be such a fool
Every feeling you're showing
Is a boomerang you're throwing
Yes a bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang
Love is a tune you hum-de-hum-hum
By giving away, I think you'll learn
You'll get love in return
So bang, a boome-boomerang is love

And if you're warm and tender
I'll kiss you, return to sender, please surrender

Bang, a boome-boomerang
Dum-de-dum-dum de-dum-de-dum-dum
Oh bang, a boome-boomerang is love
A boome-boomerang is loveEmbed
