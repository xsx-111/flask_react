Hey, Hey Helen Lyrics
So at last, you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today

Is it worth the pain to see the children cry?
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy?

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone? (Yes, you can)

So you're free at last (I am a woman)
And beginning to forget the past (Like a woman)
Does it make you sad (Do you know me?)
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had?

But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom
Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
What's the matter with you?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do? (Yes, you do)

Aha, yes you do, yes you do
Aha, yes you do, yes you do

Hey, hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen
Can you make it alone?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
What's the matter with you?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do?
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Now you live on your own
Hey, hey Helen (Hey, hey Helen)
Can you make it alone?1Embed
