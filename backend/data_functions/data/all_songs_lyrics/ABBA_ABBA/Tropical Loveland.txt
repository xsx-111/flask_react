Tropical Loveland Lyrics
Come to my loveland, wander along
Beautiful gardens full of flowers and songs
Come to the sunshine, beaches and sand
Listen to bluebirds, won't you come to my land?

The grass is mellow and the sky is blue
My paradise is waiting here for you

Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny, happy and sunny
Ooh, in my tropical loveland

Come to my loveland, wander with me
(To my loveland, to my loveland)
Lie with me darling in the shade of a tree
Over the rainbow, under the moon
(To my loveland, to my loveland)
That's where my land is, won't you come to me soon?

Just take my hand, I'll show you everything
The secrets that my paradise can bring
Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you
Life can be funny, happy and sunny
Ooh, in my tropical loveland

Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you (Ooh, I wanna share it with you)
Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you (Ooh, I wanna share it with you)
Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you
Ooh, it's a tropical loveland
Ooh, I wanna share it with you (Share it with you...)Embed
