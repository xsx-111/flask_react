Margaritas at the Mall Lyrics
Drawn up all my findings
And I warn you they are candid
My every day begins
With reminders I've been stranded on this
Planet where I've landed
Beneath this gray as granite sky
A place I wake up blushing like I'm ashamed to be alive

How long can a world go on under such a subtle god?
How long can a world go on with no new word from God?
See the plod of the flawed individual looking for a nod from God
Trodding the sod of the visible with no new word from God

We're just drinking margaritas at the mall
That's what this stuff adds up to after all
Magenta, orange, acid green
Peacock blue and burgundy
Drinking margaritas at the mall

Standing in the shadows of the signpost on the road
50 gates of understanding, 49 are closed
Yes, I guess this time I really hit that number on the nose
What I'd give for an hour with the power on the throne
How long can a world go on under such a subtle god?
How long can a world go on with no new word from God?
See the plod of the flawed individual looking for a nod from God
Trodding the sod of the visible with no new word from God

We're just drinking margaritas at the mall
This happy hour's got us by the balls
Magenta, orange, acid green
Peacock blue and burgundy
Drinking margaritas at the mall
We're drinking margaritas at the mall
Drinking margaritas at the mall2Embed
