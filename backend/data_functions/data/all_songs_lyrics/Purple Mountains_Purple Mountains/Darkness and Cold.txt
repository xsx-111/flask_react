Darkness and Cold Lyrics
The light of my life is going out tonight
As the sun sinks in the west
The light of my life is going out tonight
With someone she just met
She kept it burning longer than I had right to expect
The light of my life is going out tonight
Without a flicker of regret

Darkness and cold, darkness and cold
(Darkness and cold, darkness and cold)
Rolled in through the holes in the stories I told
Conditions I'm wishing weren't taking control
Darkness and cold, darkness and cold

The light of my life is going out tonight
And she don't look too depressed
The light of my life is going out tonight
In a pink champagne Corvette
I sleep three feet above the street
In a Band-Aid pink Chevette
The light of my life is going out tonight
Without a flicker of regret
Darkness and cold, darkness and cold
(Darkness and cold, darkness and cold)
Rolled in through the holes in the stories I told
Conditions I'm wishing weren't taking control
Darkness and cold, darkness and cold

Darkness and cold, darkness and cold
(Darkness and cold, darkness and cold)
Patiently encroaching on the animal
The weather of forever retaking control
Darkness and cold, darkness and cold

Darkness and cold, darkness and cold
(Darkness and cold, darkness and cold)
Rolled in through the holes in the stories I told
Conditions I'm wishing werenâ€™t taking control
Darkness and cold, darkness and cold

Darkness and cold, darkness and cold2Embed
