The Returns Lyrics
After all
There are such things
And these are the things
Who'll turn your memories back into dreams again
Oh, it's all flying and waving
For you to keep trying
You're so close
You're so close
And all the returns
One of these days
One of these days
One of these days
One of these daysEmbed
