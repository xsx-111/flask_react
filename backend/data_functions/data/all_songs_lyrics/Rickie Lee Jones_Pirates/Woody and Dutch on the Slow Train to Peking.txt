Woody and Dutch on the Slow Train to Peking Lyrics
Hey, hey hey Junior!
Man, who does that look like walkin' down the street?
Hey, hey 
Hey, hey hey Bones!  Ey, what're you doin' back in town, man?
Man, I didn't even know what city I was in!
*Laughter*
Crazy that guy!
"I didn't even know what city I was in," heh!

Dutch took 'em on the slow train to Peking
On La Brea Avenue
To find the Stax and Sun
That they was reachin' to get to
They were a-rappin the fat scat
Diamond dialectos of points and taps
Between the chicken in the back
And they drew themselves a bebop midnight map
They said "Do you got a map to the next joint?"
"Do you got a map to the next joint?"

Pick it up on the night train
Down on the corner of rhythm and blues
Where I have met all o' my boys since back in '52
Bringing 'em Stax and Sun
'Cause I think that Cleveland forgot
And Memphis forgot
Where they were comin' from
Do ya like it, do ya like it like that?
Do you like rappin' the fat scat?

I was walkin' down the street in my '57 Lincoln, white and brown, shakin' that thing the way I do, and policeman said, "Girl you can't walk like that," and my boyfriend said...
I got the boogie, woogie, in my socks!
(Where else?)
Ah, please don't make the little girl stop!
(Heh heh heh heh)


Woody and Dutch dance the cell of fourteen
Like a pill, they do it all night
The spectators, whitewalls, fins and greased back
Every Saturday night
Leanin' the scenery, pickin' up the kids
At the next door neighbours', and I know what you did, yeah
Well I got a room you can prob'ly stay in
If you promise you won't make too much noise...
Ah well, no I won't!
Ah, lemme see you promise that, baby
No I don't!
Hah, aw, no problem!
