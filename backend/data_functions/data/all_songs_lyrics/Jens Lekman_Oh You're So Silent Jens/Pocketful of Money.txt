Pocketful of Money LyricsI got my pockets full of money
I'm gonna spend it all tonight
I got my pockets full of money
I'm gonna spend it all tonight
A whole month's salary
Gonna set it to flames
On some girl I just met recently
I barely know her name
Cha cha, cha cha, cha cha
Cha cha, cha cha
Well, take me someplace decent
Where we meet up with your friends
Where the people are pleasant
Where the music never ends
Where the music never ends
Cha cha, cha cha, cha cha
Cha cha, cha cha, cha cha
I can say that you are pretty
That would make me a liar
But you turn my legs to spaghetti
And set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire (Ooh)
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
You set my heart on fire (Ooh)
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
You set my heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come, I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire
I'll come runnin' with a heart on fire1Embed
