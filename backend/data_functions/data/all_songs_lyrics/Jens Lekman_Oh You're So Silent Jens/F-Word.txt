F-Word LyricsWould you stand up for this kind of beauty?
Cause this kind of beauty won't stand up for you
It won't lift a finger
For some lazy dreamer
Here it comes the average dirty word
Pardon my French
But I'm sitting on an park bench
Watching yearning cats
Milk-fed little brats
And they say:
Love won't pick
The slanted or the slick
Or the lovesick
And I'm lovesick
So I say
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Can't you feel the stench?
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Summer evening
Cats are screaming
For love
Is summer evening
The cats screaming
For love
So I say
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Can't you feel the stench?
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Can't you feel the stench?
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Can't you feel the stench?
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Can't you feel the stench?
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bs
Can't you feel the stench?
F-word, f-word
Pardon my French
But it's bs, bsEmbed
