I Saw Her in the Anti-War Demonstration LyricsYou're looking for me in the demonstration
Well I have already lost patience
You might find me sitting by
On the pavement
Maybe not, cause I have shrunk
I fell in love with a punk
And she took my breath
Now there's nothing left
But love enough to feed a family
I just want to feed Emily
With lukewarm English beer and vegan pancakes
I saw her in the anti-war demonstration
Was a sweet sensation of love
When I was sixteen
I hung out with the kids who lacked it
And the punks who were born in leather jackets
The kind of punks that place themselves in brackets
She was one of them back then
She was somebody's girlfriend
And I was no one
I had nothing
And the skies were clear blue skies
And her eyes were clear blue eyes
And her thighs were about the same size as mine
And we were walking
In the anti-war demonstration
Was a sweet sensation of love
Of love
It was a sweet sensation of loveEmbed
