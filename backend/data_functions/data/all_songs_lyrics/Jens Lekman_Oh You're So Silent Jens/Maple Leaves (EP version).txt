Maple Leaves (EP version) LyricsIt's autumn in Gothenburg
I'm walking home to my suburb
Rain falls hard on the city
On every homeless kitty
Oh, please God bring relief
Even if it's only brief
The girl she says that we were just make-believe
But I thought she said maple leaves
Do it for speed--go!
Ooh
So we talked for hours
And you cried into my sheets
And you said you hated your body
That it was just a piece of meat, I disagree
I think you're beautiful
But it's impossible
To make you understand
That if you don't take my hand
I'll lose my mind completely
Madness will finally defeat me
She said it was all make-believe
But I thought you said maple leaves
And when she talked about a fall
I thought she talked about a season
I never understood at all
I thought she said maple leaves
And when she talked about the fall
I thought she talked about Mark E. Smith
I never understood at all
I never understood at all
I never understood at allEmbed
