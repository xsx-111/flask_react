A Man Walks into a Bar LyricsA man walks into a bar
Orders a beer and a bowl of peanuts
But the bar turns into a spaceship
And the bartender gives him a hair cut
I can't remember the end of that joke
You once told it to me when we smoked
On your father's expensive cigars
All I remember is the part of a man walking into a bar
How many lovers does it take
To put a light bulb into a socket?
And why did Mona Lisa smile?
I have the answer written down in my pocket
I just remember I laughed 'till I cried
Because you told it with your funny voice
Your southern dialect makes me rejoice
Those special times we had
When love was just a silly gag
I know why Mona Lisa smile
Da Vinci must have been a really funny guy
And laughter is the only way into my heart
I know why Mona Lisa smile
Da Vinci must have been a really funny guy
And laughter is the only way into my heart
Summer night on a gravel road
You told me about your childhood friend Veronica
Who was claimed to have swallowed a toad
And I picked up my harmonica
I know why Mona Lisa smile
Da Vinci must have been a really funny guy
And laughter is the only way into my heart
I know why Mona Lisa smile
Da Vinci must have been a really funny guy
And laughter is the only way into my heart
A man walks into a bar
Orders a scotch and a bottle of coke
But the laughter is gone in his heart
You never told me the end of the jokeEmbed
