The Wrong Hands LyricsI still wear these worn out jeans
I have to wear long-johns undeneath
Down by the harbour there's a cool cool breeze
Have you ever wondered if oceans can freeze
Strings on my fathers old guitar
The position of the northern star
The clock-like beat of the budgies heart
Tick-tick-tick now they know where you are
I try the light therapy from the Xerox-machine
The gentle beat of a tambourine
And it's not like I can't stand
To see you with another man
I just don't wanna see good love
Fall into the wrong hands
Behind the craze there's a pretty sunset
Water shines like tiny bells
I feel the warmth in the cigarette
But everything else
And it's not like I can't stand
To see you with another man
I just don't wanna see good love
Fall into the wrong hands
I try the light therapy from the Xerox-machine
The gentle beat of a tambourine
And it's not like I can't stand
To see you ruin our plans
I just don't wanna see good love
Fall into the wrong hands
Fall into the wrong handsEmbed
