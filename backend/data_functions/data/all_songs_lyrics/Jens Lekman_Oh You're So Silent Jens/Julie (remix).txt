Julie (remix) LyricsOh Julie, meet me by the vending machine
Oh Julie, I'm gonna buy you a wedding ring
Eating french fries by the dock of the bay
Lots of ketchup and mayonnaise
You said this town's too big for our hearts
You can't tell where it ends or starts
Oh Julie, put on your jacket tonight
Oh Julie, the ticket inspector's out of sight
What will you do when you graduate
If you stay here you'll suffocate
And all your friends are moving to London
While the cherry trees are still in blossom
Oh Julie
Oh, hold me, hold me through the sweet hereafter
Being with you can be very fatal
Somehow we forget to pray for the angels
Then the angels make sure that our hearts are devoured
Make us jump from the Eiffel Tower
Oh Julie, you know that I ain't for hire
But you can have me, you can trade me for your cigarette lighter
Take a step from the humdrum
Step out of the museum
They said we'd hit the bottom
But the cherry trees are still in blossom
Julie, you know that I ain't for hire
But you can have me, I will invite you back to the invention of fire
Oh JulieEmbed
