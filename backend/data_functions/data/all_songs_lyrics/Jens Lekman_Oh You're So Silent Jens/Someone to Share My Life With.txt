Someone to Share My Life With LyricsI don't want a girl
Who hangs on every word I say
Who shows me off to her parents
Over roast beef on Sunday
I don't want a girl
Who thinks she has to fake
I don't want a girl
Who laughs at every little joke I make
I just want someone
To share my life with
I just want someone
To share my life with
I don't want a girl
Who thinks there's only me to please
I don't want a girl
Who thinks it's fun to tease
I don't want a girl
Who thinks she has to cater for my every needs
I don't want a girl
To go down on her knees
I just want someone
To share my life with
I just want someone
To share my life with
And that someone could be you
That someone could be you
You could be that someone
You could be that someone
You could be that someone
You could be that someone
You could be that someone
You could be that someoneEmbed
