Black Cab Lyrics
Oh no, God damn
I missed the last tram
I killed the party again
God damn, God damn
I want to sleep in my bed
I want to clean up my head
Don't want to look this dead
Don't want to feel this dread
I killed the party again
I ruined it for my friends
"Well, you're so silent, Jens"
Well, maybe I am, maybe I am
Now at the central station
No time for being patient
I feel like going home
But at the same time, I don't

Black Cab

And I've heard all those stories
About the black cabs and the way they drive
That if you take a ride with them
You might not come back alive
They might be psycho killers
But tonight I really don't care
So I say turn up the music
Take me home or take me anywhere

You don't know anything
So don't ask me questions
You don't know anything
So don't ask me any questions
You don't know anything
So don't ask me questions
Just turn the music up
And keep your mouth shut
