Cry Of The Werewolf Lyrics
To what you got, hold on baby
Hold on; to what you got, hold on, ye-yeah
Never-


For, two woman don’t supposed to fight over one man
All they got to do, let they love grow strong


Uh, yeah
Hold on tight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Hold on tight
Never you love an' cut across, girl
For, the man who you love, you’re gonna lost
