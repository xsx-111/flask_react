Your Teeth in My Neck Lyrics
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh yeah

Some will take money and make big enemy
While I man take love and make good friend
Some are sticking pocket, the other are flicking ratchet
But I man is here to teach you what's right from wrong
Say you know now (Hoi-oi-oi)


Hoi-oi-oi
Hoi-oi-oi (Lord, oh, yeah)

Some are sticking pocket, the other are flicking ratchet
But I man is here to teach you what's right from wrong
Listen me carefully, let's live in love an' I-nity
For, anything you do, Jah a see we
A one love family (Hoi-oi-oi; hoi-oi-oi)
For I and I wanted to be free
Let's live in love an' one harmony (Say you know now)Embed
