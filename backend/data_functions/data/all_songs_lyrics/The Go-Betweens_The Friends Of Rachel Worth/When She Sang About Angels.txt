When She Sang About Angels LyricsWhen she sang about angels
She looked at the sky
Anybody else, anybody else, but I let it go by
When she sang about the fields
She raised up her arm
As if she was pushing back the cotton on some Midwestern farm
When she sang about a boy
Kurt Cobain
I thought what a shame it wasn't about
Tom Verlaine
When she sang about angels
She looked at the sky
Anybody else, anybody else, but I let it go by
Then she threw some names
Like she always did
She threw some names, she dropped some names
Like she used to when I was a kid
When she sang about angels
She looked at the sky
Anybody else, anybody else, but I let it go by
I let it go by
I let it go byEmbed
