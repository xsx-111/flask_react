Heart And Home LyricsHow can I help you focus
When all you do is choke us?
Try looking for me and wishing for me
And kiss me softer than the rest
How can I help you dream
When all you do is scream?
If I'm not allowed to be above the crowd
I don't wanna be your guest
A one in a million smile
A silent number that I can't dial
But eyes so blue it's like falling through
An evening in the west
What can I do to sway you?
Drop to my knees and pray you
Stop breathing the fumes of those other grooms
Then we really will be blessed
Ba, ba, ba there's ice around your heart
My homeEmbed
