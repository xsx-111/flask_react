German Farmhouse LyricsI lived in seclusion for a couple of years
In a german farmhouse just drinking beer
And every morning I'd wake up with a smile from ear to ear
I had one contact to the outside world
A phone in London and a seasick girl
I knew what was happening but only in my part of the world
I knew what was happening
I knew that this was my world
I knew what was happening in my part of the world
There was an abandoned castle with empty chairs
There was a rumour Pavarotti would sing there
To raise funds for a music school but then the
Whole thing vanished into thin air
It was a crazy idea
And it vanished into the air
It was a falling down castle with falling down stairs
I could walk the streets unrecognized
Nobody stopped me I was never surprised
By anybody's actions or by an ex-lover's eyes
And this felt good
And this felt so right
To be unloaded as I walked through the night
This felt good
This felt so right
To be unloaded as I walked through the night, this felt rightEmbed
