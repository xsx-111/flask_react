The Clock Lyrics
Candles and tambourines shine in the dusk
Monkees and Spoonful float through the musk
Why when you come here
Does the rainbow turn black?
Spitting and burning, the vision attacks

But then the clock turns and it's now
And it's you
But then the clock turns and it's now
And it's you

Ghosts from the river beg to get in
Staining my windows with pictures of sin
Sometimes the night time steals all your light
Then in the morning the birds lift and fly

But then the clock turns and it's now
And it's you
But then the clock turns and it's now
And it's youEmbed
