Magic In Here LyricsDiamonds on the water at five o'clock
Lovers lie around in tangled knots
Pulling your picture from a cardboard box
Forget you not, forget me not
I don't want to change a thing when there's magic
I don't want to change a thing when there's magic
In here, now the coast is clear
I got no time for fear
Time knocks you down like a rolling ball
In memory hall
Love leaves you clean like a waterfall
Then you hit a wall, hit a wall
I don't want to change a thing when there's magic
I don't want to change a thing when there's magic
In here, now the coast is clear
I got no time for fearEmbed
