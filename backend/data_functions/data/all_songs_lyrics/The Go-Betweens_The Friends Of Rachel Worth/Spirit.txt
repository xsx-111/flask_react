Spirit Lyrics
I've got tickets
To the best show in town
If you want to come on down and listen
I'm ready
And I might come along
With something that you've been missing

I've got no money
I've got nothing at all
But I'll keep you guessing
And I'm bound
To hit the wall
And I'll be running
I'm no trouble
I'm nothing like the trouble
That I used to be when I was somebody's double
Do you have any whisky?
I don't like to drink
But I like to know that's it's along there with me

There's nothing I've seen
That's ever really
Flattened me
And there's something
In the corner of your eye
That gets me
Yes there's something
But I know
You'll keep me guessing

So what do you say
Tell me what you're thinking of
Tell me what you're thinking of this minute
You're a spirit
You're one thing greater
Than all the things that you are together
You're one thing greater
Than all the things
You are togetherEmbed
