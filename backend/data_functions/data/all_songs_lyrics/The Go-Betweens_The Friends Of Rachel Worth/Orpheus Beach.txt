Orpheus Beach LyricsI hear you skating on the ice
And wonder why you left me twice
The eerie sound of blade on lake
Cracks my skin and I fill with ache
But I don't want this heart
I don't need this blood
I see you running through the grass
A doctors daughter, a sky of glass
My swollen eye at sunday school
No saviour here under God's bright rule
But I don't want this heart
I don't need this blood
Time to be leaving, run from your reach
Gonna go dreaming on Orpheus Beach
I feel you breathing in my head
But better there if not in bed
I wash your perfume from my clothes
I don't believe that affection goes
But I don't want this heart
I don't need this blood
Time to be leaving, run from your reach
Gonna go dreaming on Orpheus BeachEmbed
