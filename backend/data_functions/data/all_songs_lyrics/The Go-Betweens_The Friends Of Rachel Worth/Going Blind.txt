Going Blind LyricsYou sure gotta funny way
Of hanging on to the babylon
Of the always gone and getting it wrong
Because it makes no difference to anyone
That you had your fun in the burning sun
When you thought you'd won
And i like your weird way of drifting low
In the underflow, try letting go
And then you'll know
'cause sometimes change is a dirty word
When you're in the herd, yeah that's what i heard
Did your kitten purr?
You sure gotta funny way of hanging on
'cause i'm going blind
You sure got a funny way of hanging on
'cause i'm going blind
Midnight and hauntings and nights on the fly
Moonlight on moorings with you on my mind
If you go a little crazy when the light is black
Get on a different track, find out what you lack
And you'll make it back
And it sure seems strange here in hollywood
But i'm looking good, i'll put on my hood
And dream of birnam wood
You sure gotta funny way of hanging on
'cause i'm going blind
You sure got a funny way of hanging on
'cause i'm going blindEmbed
