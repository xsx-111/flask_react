He Lives My Life LyricsHe's got a four wheel drive that he takes to Double Island Point
He's got a relationship with a woman that he met in an Irish joint
I know the land
And the coloured sand
Everything's fresh at the source in this land
Everything's fresh at the source in this land
And I wish him luck
I hope he get's it right
As he lives my live
He's got a house all to himself that overlooks a park
He's got a piano all to himself that he plays after dark
I know the sound
As the sun goes down
Everything's fresh at the source as the sun goes down
Everything's fresh at the source as the sun goes down
And I wish him luck
I hope he get's it right
As he lives my life
And if you see him
Tell him I'll be him
As I live his lifeEmbed
