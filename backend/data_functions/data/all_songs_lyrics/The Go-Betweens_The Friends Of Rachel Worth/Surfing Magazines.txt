Surfing Magazines LyricsWe used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines
Some good looking people wearing
Lee Cooper jeans
They're breaking on the headland, they're breaking on the shore
And when you're living in Hawaii they're breaking at your door
We used to wet our fingers on surfing magazines
Going to throw school and follow those scenes
Going to get a Kombi and go from beach to beach
Be the kind of people the Authorities can't reach
We used to get our kicks reading surfing magazines
Wake up in the morning and the waves are clean
Standing on the headland taking in the scene
Just like they do it ... in surfing magazinesEmbed
