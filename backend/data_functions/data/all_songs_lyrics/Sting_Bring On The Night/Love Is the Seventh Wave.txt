Love Is the Seventh Wave Lyrics
In the empire of the senses
You're the queen of all you survey
All the cities, all the nations
Everything that falls your way, I say

There is a deeper world than this
That you don't understand
There is a deeper world than this
Tugging at your hand

Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see

There is a deeper wave than this
Smiling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me, girl

Feel it rising in the cities
Feel it sweeping over land
Over borders, over frontiers
Nothing will its power withstand, I say
There is no deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is no deeper wave than this
Listen to me, girl

All the bloodshed, all the anger
All the weapons, all the greed
All the armies, all the missiles
All the symbols of our fear

There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me, girl

At the still point of destruction
At the center of the fury
All the angels, all the devils
All around us, can't you see?

There is a deeper wave than this
Rising in the land
There is a deeper wave than this
Nothing will withstand
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave
I said, love is the seventh wave

Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every power we never see

There is a deeper wave than this
Smiling in the world
There is a deeper wave than this
Listen to me, girl

Every ripple on the ocean
Every leaf on every tree
Every sand dune in the desert
Every breath you take with me
Every breath you take, every move you make
Every cake you bake, every leg you breakEmbed
