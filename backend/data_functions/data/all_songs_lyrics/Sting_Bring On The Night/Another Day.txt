Another Day Lyrics
Every day that goes by
A new hungry baby starts to cry
Born astride a painful grave
Drowned in hunger's tidal wave
Pick a child that you can save
It'd be the only one
If africa escapes starvation
Not only food but education
The desert grows with every minute
Trapping everybody in it
All the children look the same
They wonder why they came

But it's hard to tell the poison from the cure
It's harder still to know the reason why, why, why
The only thing i really know for sure
Is that another day, another day's gone by

Every day that goes by
A brand new missile points towards the sky
We're survivors of a game of chance
Beneath an arms race avalanche
If you survive this winter's cold
You'd be the only one
If we escape annihilation
Not only hope but education
The world is ruled by bellophiles
Adding to their weapon piles
Imagine what your taxes buy
We hardly ever try

That this too solid flesh
Would melt and resolve into a dew
Suffocating lassitude
Drowning in my platitude
Trapped by insecurities
I'm not the only one
If i survive this dislocation
Have to use my education

Chief of inactivity
Wasted creativity
Distances our revolution
Silence is consent
