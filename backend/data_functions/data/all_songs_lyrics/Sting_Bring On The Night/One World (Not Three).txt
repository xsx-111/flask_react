One World (Not Three) Lyrics
One world is enough, for all of us 

It's a subject we rarely mention
But when we do we have this little invention
By pretending they're a different world from me
I show my responsibility


The third world breathes our air tomorrow
We live on the time we borrow
In our world there's no time for sorrow
In their world there is no tomorrow


Lines are drawn upon the world
Before we get our flags unfurled
Whichever one we pick
It's just a self deluding trick

One world is enough, for all of us
I don't want to bring a sour note
Remember this before you vote
We can all sink or we all float
Because we're all in the same big boat


It may seem a million miles away
But it gets a little closer everydayEmbed
