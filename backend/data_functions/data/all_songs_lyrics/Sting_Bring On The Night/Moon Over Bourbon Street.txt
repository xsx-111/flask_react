Moon Over Bourbon Street Lyrics
There's a moon over Bourbon Street tonight
I see faces as they pass
Beneath the pale lamplight
I've no choice but to follow that call
The bright lights, the people
And the moon and all
I pray everyday to be strong
For I know what I do must be wrong

Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon
Over Bourbon Street

It was many years ago
That I became what I am
I was trapped in this life
Like an innocent lamb
Now I can never show my face at noon
And you'll only see me walking
By the light of the moon
The brim of my hat
Hides the eye of a beast
I've the face of a sinner
But the hands of a priest
Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon
Over Bourbon Street

She walks everyday through
The streets of New Orleans
She's innocent and young
From a family of means
I have stood many times
Outside her window at night
To struggle with my instinct
In the pale moon light
How could I be this way
When I pray to god above
I must love what I destroy
And destroy the thing I love

Oh you'll never see my shade
Or hear the sound of my feet
While there's a moon
Over Bourbon Street2Embed
