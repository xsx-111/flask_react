I Burn for You Lyrics
Now that i have found you
In the coolth of your evening smile
The shade of your parasol
And your love flows through me
Though i drink at your pool
I burn for you, i burn for
You and i are lovers
When night time folds around our bed
In peace we sleep entwined
And your love flows through me
Though an ocean soothes my head
I burn for you, i burn for
Stars will fall from dark skies
As ancient rocks are turning
Quiet fills the room
And your love flows through me
Though i lie here so still
I burn for you, i burn for you
I burn1Embed
