Cigarettes, Wedding Bands Lyrics
The working man's day, we just piss it away
We sit out in the weather
Familiar he said, time soon breeds contempt
Wash your hands of it forever

Violence it ripped through the old dogwood fence
See the whole scene unravel
The drunk brother said he could reason with them

While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied

The picture was left on the front porch
The back said "I love you, don't you ever think of me?"
If my body goes then to hell with my soul
We don't even know the difference

The dead folks in the clouds, for crying out loud
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied

And why did we live so long?
Long, long

The house is not the same since we left it that day
Old friends seem to wander

Our parents' hands, cigarettes, wedding bands

While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied

And why did we live so long?
Long, long
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied
While they lied at night, they lied at night
While they lied
