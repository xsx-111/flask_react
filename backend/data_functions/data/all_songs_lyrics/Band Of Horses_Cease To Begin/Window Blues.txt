Window Blues Lyrics
Erase the facts
The shit was flying out of the window I painted blue
I paint the whole room
When it's time to get in trouble, we know just what to do

The screen door swayin'
Now baby, give me somethin' to live for, I've been a fool
I've been a fool
No revelations in the water, no tears into the booze

Pace the floor
The worried people shaking the whole house, I, I take it back
I take it all back
The regret that's got us sayin' the hound's upon the tracks

And always in time
I'm never lookin' over my shoulder, I sing to you
I sing it to you
Keepin' heads above the water and feet into the shoesEmbed
