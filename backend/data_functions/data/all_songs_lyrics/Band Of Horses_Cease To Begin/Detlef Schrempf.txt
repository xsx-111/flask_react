Detlef Schrempf Lyrics
And take a little walk when the worst is to come
When I saw you lookin' like I never thought
And say you're at a loss, or forgot
That words can do more than harm
Oh, oh, oh, oh

The town is gonna talk, but these people do not
See things through to the very minimal
But what's it gonna cost to be gone?
If we see you like I hoped we never would
Oh, oh, oh, oh

When eyes can't look at you any other way
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way
Any other way, any other way


So take it as a song or a lesson to learn
And sometime soon be better than you were
If you say you're gonna go, then be careful
And watch how you treat every living soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh

My eyes can't look at you any other way
Any other way, any other way
When eyes can't look at you any other way
Any other way, any other way5Embed
