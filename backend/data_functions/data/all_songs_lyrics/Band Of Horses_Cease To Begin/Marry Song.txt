Marry Song Lyrics
I'll marry my lover in a place to admire, I don't
Have to even ask her, I can look in her eyes and thank God
That I am forgiven, or thank all of my friends
To say I've been true, or they've forgotten

And weary my mind is to say the least, it's been
Awful hard to just stand on my feet, I think
I'll slow down if I am able, I won't drown
In the ocean or starve in my place at the table

Lucky ones are we all 'til it is over
Everyone near and far
When you smile, the sun, it peeks through the clouds
Never die, for always be around and around and around

And how is your sister and what of your brother?
Extend hellos to your father and mother
What in the world would cause you any sorrow?
Lighten your load and see how I keeled the wheelbarrow I borrowed

Lucky ones are we all 'til it is over
Everyone near and far
When you smile the sun, it peeks through the clouds
Never die, for always be around and around and around1Embed
