Alien LyricsOne, two, three, four
I ain't no father and I ain't no son
I ain't no relative of anyone
There's no connection between you and me
And my disguise is all you'll ever see
I'm an alien, baby, I'm an outsider, yeah
I'm an alien, baby, I'm an outsider, yeah
Yeah you eat your chickens screaming in the night
Your daughter comes in in a pale moonlight
She sees the feathers scattered on the ground
He's been and gone and never made a sound
He's an alien, baby, he's an outsider, yeah
I'm an alien, baby, I'm an outsider, yeah
Right!
And if I see you snoopin' round my farm
I'll give you a mug of cocoa then I'll break your arm
And if I tortured you upon a rack
You wouldn't say half what you'd say
Behind my back
I'm an alien, baby, I'm an outsider, yeah
I'm an alien, baby, I'm an outsider, yeahEmbed
