Kingdom of Love LyricsIn the spiritual kingdom of love
You're the one that I'm thinkin' of
Yeah, in the spiritual kingdom of love

You've been layin' eggs under my skin
Now they're hatching out under my chin
Now there's tiny insects showin' through
And all them tiny insects look like you
In the primitive jungle of love
It's funny what you're capable of
Yeah, in the primitive jungle of love

The way you look and all the things you said
If looks could kill then, baby, I'd be dead
Either someone's cloned you and you aren't
Or you grow out of me just like a plant
Ain't no way I'm gonna be
Anything I oughta be
All I want to do is be your creature
Ain't no way I'm gonna be
Anything I wanna be
All I want to do is be your teacher
In the physical kingdom of time
I guess that your dish is full of slime
Well, in the physical kingdom of time

You know I would ramble all through time and space
Just to have a butcher's at your face
You're the one I love or so it seems
Because you've confiscated all my dreamsEmbed
