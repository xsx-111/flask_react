Song No. 4 LyricsWe arrive and go
Neither fast or too slow
We are watching all the papers
But I wish to God that they'd say
What they're doing
When it comes here
Mmm, the girls are so smooth
And you, your youth
All your visions have collapsed
You expect it back, in fact
But please don't do it again, oh
Why don't you ever come and talk to me?
I'll concentrate hard on whatever you say
Here comes the musket
With all its brace
I know that it can take all it wishes when it's here

So you go and you're gone
Only us lingers on
There is no acceptance like the past
And I always see from my point of view
You just never listen and talk to me
Even if I smell, you wouldn't say
You just stand and listen and talk to me
You don't even concentrate on what you say
No, you and your fingers always sit there and fiddle with me
You never speak about what you'd smell if you could hear me
Drain
(Yeah
Click over
Click over, that's it then
Right
That's it then, yeah
Do you wanna play it?)Embed
