Old Pervert LyricsI'm an old pervert and I hang around under the bridge
I'm an old pervert and I hang around under the bridge
I won't do you no harm I just wanna show what's in my fridge
So come on little girl, is your name Hester or maybe it's Midge
Well, they say that I'm weird and disenfectant is the only thing I drink
They say that I'm weird and disenfectant is the only thing I drink
Ah, but cleanliness of the soul is more important, don't you think?
And I could show you one or two things right there in my sink
So come on baby
I'm an old pervert and I just don't get around much anymore
I'm an old pervert and I don't get around much anymore
Sometimes I feel it evaporating through the door
But come on pretty baby and I show you how I let you score
Ha ha ha ha
Yeah, babyEmbed
