Vegetable Man LyricsIn yellow shoes
I get the blues
So I walk the street
In plastic feet
In my blue velvet trousers
Make me feel pink
There's a kind of stink
About blue velvet trousers
In my paisley shirt
I look a jerk
And my turqoise waistcoat
Is quite out of sight
But oh woe, my haircut looks so bad
Vegetable man, where are you?
So I change my gear
And I buy my jeans
Then I cover them up
With the latest cut
My  socks with water and epoxy
It don't take long to buy nylon socks
I watch my watch with a plain face and the date
In a whole hole
It's what I wear, it's what you see
It must be me
It's what I am
Vegetable man
Ah ha ha ha ha ha hha
Ah ha ha ha ha ha hha
Oh, I've been looking all over the place
For a place for me
But it ain't anywhere
It just ain't anywhere
He's the kind of fella
You just got to see if you can
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
Vegetable man
He's the kind of fella
You just got to see if you can
