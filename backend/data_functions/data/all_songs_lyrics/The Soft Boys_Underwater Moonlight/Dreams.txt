Dreams LyricsDreams are my everything
I'm not here
Dreams are my everything
I don't care
I hear green symphonies in the silence
I hear black melodies in the violence
I can't concentrate on a world I hate
I'm in love with you
What else should I do?
Dreams are my everything
And I mean it
I don't need anything
I can dream it
I can't concentrate on a world I hate
I'm in love with you
What else should I do?Embed
