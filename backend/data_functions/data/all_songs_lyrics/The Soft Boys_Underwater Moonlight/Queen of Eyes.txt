Queen of Eyes LyricsBlinking on and off, it's the Queen of Eyes
With a carapace shell and her black lace thighs
I don't know why she never gets anywhere with you
Lucky the Pig is out on a limb
He's looking for someone to investigate him
I don't know why he never gets anywhere with you
Here I am again, it's no surprise
Locked in orbit round the Queen of Eyes
All I ever got from her was lies
In this horrible age of abuse and decay
It's good to know that somebody is looking okay
I don't know why she never gets anywhere with you
Blinking on and off, it's the Queen of Eyes
With a carapace shell and her black lace thighs
I don't know why she never gets anywhere
I don't know why she never gets anywhere
I don't know why she never gets anywhere with youEmbed
