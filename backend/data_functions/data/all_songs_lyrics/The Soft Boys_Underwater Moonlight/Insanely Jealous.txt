Insanely Jealous LyricsShe's walking down the street
Me - I'm just invisible
And who or where she walks with makes no difference to me
The people that she meets
She turns them into sideshows
They're just here for their amusement
That's not what I want to be
But I'm insanely jealous of you
Yeah, I'm insanely jealous of you
The night is black and thick
I wander past your window
And I catch a cigarette thrown from a jewel-encrusted hand
It comes on pretty quick
Exactly like a crocodille
In search of a mirage across the undulating sand
But I'm insanely jealous of you
Yeah, I'm insanely jealous of you
I don't know why the people want to meet
When all they know is that they'll breed like rabbits in the end
Cause ordinary people on the street
They never know, but if they can't be rabbits they'll be friends
And I'm insanely jealous of the people that you see
And I'm insanely jealous of the people that aren't me
And I'm insanely jealous of you
Yeah, I'm insanely jealous of you
I just can't let it out
This feeling of insanity
Is thicker than a barge upon a shattered heap of coal
I know what it's about
Like crying from a nightmare
And the one who lies beside you cannot hear to save a soul
But I'm insanely jealous of the people that you know
And I'm insanely jealous of the places that you go
And I'm insanely jealous of you
Yeah, I'm insanely jealous of you
The damage that we do is just so powerfully strong
They call it love
And the damage that we do, it just goes on and on and on
Not long enough
Paint is cracked and dry
The name is now illegible
And everything is lost upon the cracked and misted hull
Beneath a yellow sky
The lovers trip beside a ship
But all I hear when they embrace is just the kiss of skulls
And I'm insanely jealous of the people that you see
And I'm insanely jealous of the people that aren't me
And I'm insanely jealous of the places that you go
And I'm insanely jealous of the people that you know
And I'm insanely jealous of the hairs upon your back
And I'm insanely jealous of the spiders in your path
And I'm insanely jealous of the stains upon your sheet
And I'm insanely jealous of the stuff inside your feet
And I'm insanely jealous of the things upon your bed
And I'm insanely jealous of the jerk that's in your head
And I'm insanely jealous of the people that you love
And I'm insanely jealous of the fingers in your glove
And I'm insanely jealous of you
Insanely jealous of you
Insanely jealous of you
Insanely jealous of youEmbed
