Strange LyricsAnd when I go downstairs the candle throws a shadow over me
And when I get downstairs I pass the place she always used to be
And it's strange... (strange)
How no one else can see
Strange... (strange)
No one else but me
And when I kiss her mouth I raise the lid and lower it again
And when I kiss her mouth I never cry, I'm just like other men
But it's strange ... (strange)
How no one else can see
Strange... (strange)
No one else but me
And so she lies there in the freezer looking elegant and tall
Oh, she could lie there for a century and never change at all
And it's strange... (strange)
How no one else can see
Strange... (strange)
No one else but me
No one else but meEmbed
