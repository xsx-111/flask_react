Tonight LyricsI am here and everywhere tonight
I am here and everywhere tonight
I am here and everywhere tonight
Tonight
In the trails made by giant ships
In the sway of a teddy girl's hips
In the curl of a teddy boy's lips, tonight
In the trails the aeroplanes make
In an old age pensioner's cake
I'm not here for just anyone's sake, tonight
Tonight
In the places nobody goes
I'll be there with a very long nose
Tonight - Where nobody sees
Tonight - I'm under the trees
It's all right
Tonight - I've waited so long
Tonight - If nothing goes wrong
It's all right
Tonight
When you're older looking around
You will hear a familiar sound
I'll be gone but I'll still be around, tonight
When you turn the key to your door
Someone's been inside there before
It was me but you don't know what for, tonight
Tonight
In the back of a broken down car
On the rim of a vacuum jar
I'll be with you wherever you are, tonight
Tonight
I'll be with you wherever you are, tonight
Tonight
Tonight - I'll be with you
I'll be with you
Tonight - I'll be with you
I'll be with you
Tonight - I'll be with you
I'll be with you
Tonight - I'll be with you
I'll be with you
Tonight - I'll be with you
I'll be with you
Tonight - I'll be with you
I'll be with youEmbed
