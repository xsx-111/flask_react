Underwater Moonlight LyricsHe was white and she was white as only statues are
Fifty years they stood there looking stupid by a jar
One night in mid-august when the moonlight got too strong
They climbed off their pedestal and then they sang this song
Past the gun emplacement and the bones as white as bleach
Through the rats and ivy till they came out on a beach
Out into the ocean till they disappeared from view
Honey, when it gets you there's just nothing you can do
Underwater moonlight sets the body free
Underwater moonlight, baby, you and me
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
He was pink and she was pink and onward they did row
Didn't see the giant squid, though it was fairly slow
When they hit the bottom they were well and truly dead
The statues took their place and then they rowed back home instead
Underwater moonlight, take your baby down
Underwater moonlight, watch you baby drown with love
And in the moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Across the sea
Once again
Once again
I can take you down (Moonlight)
Below the sea (Moonlight)
Why don't you feed the fish? (Moonlight)
I'll make you feed the fish (Moonlight)
I'll watch you feed the fish (Moonlight)
I'll watch you feed the fish (Moonlight)
Underwater moonlight sets the body free
Underwater moonlight, baby, you and me
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
Underwater moonlight
