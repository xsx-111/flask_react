Positive Vibrations LyricsPositive vibrations
Shine through all creation
Positive vibrations
Unite all the nations
There you go killing for peace
Don't you know
You'll never get peace anymore?
Just get war
Positive vibrations
They call at all stations
Forget your paranoia
It'll only destroy ya
There you go killing the lamb
Don't you know
You're still in the plan?
What a waste
Positive vibrations
Baby, when you do it to me
I feel like oil that burns in the sea
From the top, never stops
Positive vibrations
Shine through all creation
Positive vibrations
Shine through all creation
Vibrations, vibrations
Vibrations, vibrations
Vibrations, vibrations
Vibrations, vibrations
Vibrations, vibrations
Vibrations, vibrationsEmbed
