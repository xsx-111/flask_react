I Got the Hots LyricsAh, Mmm, Mmm
Said the dentures to the peach
Said the tide of filth to the bleach
Said the spike to the tomato
Said the curry to the corpse
I got the hots for you
I got the hots for you
I got the hots for you
I got the hots for you
Here I am
Looking out on a crystal world
Floating currents of human eyes
Baking land under creamy skies
Yeah
Said the vicar to the waitress
"The best thing about you is your waist"
She laughed a laugh that echoed round a fortress
Said "Wait till you see the statues in my bathroom"
I got the hots for you
I got the hots for you
Huh, huh
I got the hots fro you
I got the hots for you
There she was
When you see her your eyes awake
Electric bulbs on a birthday cake
Would you care for a lump of steak?
Or a piece of hake?
Or another take?Embed
