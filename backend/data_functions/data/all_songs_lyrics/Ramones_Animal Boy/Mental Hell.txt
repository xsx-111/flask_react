Mental Hell Lyrics
Evil in my head, in my head, inside this private hell
I'm not feeling very well
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell
I'm not feeling very well

Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way
Day after day, day after day, day after

Evil in my head, in my head, inside this private hell
I'm not feeling very well
Frustration, disgust, aggravation, disgust, mental hell
I'm not feeling very well

Day, day after day, it never changes, always the same way
Day after day, day after day, day after

Do-do-do-do

Mental
Hell Mental
