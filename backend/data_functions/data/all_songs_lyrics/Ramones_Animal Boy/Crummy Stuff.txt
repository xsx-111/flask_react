Crummy Stuff Lyrics
I had enough, I had it tough
I had enough of that crummy stuff

Crummy
Crummy Stuff
Crummy
Crummy Stuff

I had enough, I had it tough
I had enough of that crummy stuff

Crummy
Crummy Stuff
Crummy
Crummy Stuff

Crummy music, crummy TV
Crummy people, crummy movies
Like a cat caught up a tree
This could only happen to me
I had enough, I had it tough
I had enough of that crummy stuff

Crummy
Crummy Stuff
Crummy
Crummy Stuff

I had enough, I had it tough
I had enough of that crummy stuff

Crummy
Crummy Stuff
Crummy
