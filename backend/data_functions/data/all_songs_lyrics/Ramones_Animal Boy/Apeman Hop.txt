Apeman Hop Lyrics
He's got so many problems, you can count them one by one
He's a filthy stupid ape man, he never has any fun
He lives in the jungle, in a cave by a hill, plays an old loud drum
He's primitive, barely human

Ape man hop
Ape man hop

Paint the face of a demon, glowing by the fire light
Hopping like an elephant, thunder and lightning tonight
He's the world's first witch doctor, the iceman comes to life
He's the devil's apprentice, he's a prehistoric man

Ape man hop
Ape man hop

At night he's going to sacrifice his beloved ape man girl
Tie her to the altar, pull out her heart and eat her flesh

Ape man hop
Ape man hopEmbed
