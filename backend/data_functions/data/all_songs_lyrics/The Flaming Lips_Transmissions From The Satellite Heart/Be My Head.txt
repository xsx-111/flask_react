Be My Head LyricsAhhhhhhh
You can be my head
Oh, I really need one
'Cause it's used all its better days
An' you can be my head
'Cause I've ruined this one
Blasting holes where it used to be
And if it's not a big thing
You could swap or lend me
You should stop and ask me
Be my head and I'll be yours
Be my head and I'll be yours
You can be my head
Oh, they've eaten this one
Putting swirls in this giant hole
An' you can be my head
'Cause I can't afford to buy one
Seeing stars in its other side
(Chorus)
Be my head, and I'll be yours (x2)
Won't you be my head, and I'll be yours
Be my head and I'll be yours (x3)Embed
