Pilot Can At the Queer of God Lyrics
Oh god
Has she always lived here?
(I think she has)
Oh god
Has she always looked like that?
(I think she has)

Oh god
God, has she forgot me?
(I think she has)
Oh god
Has she joined the army?
(I think she has)

Oh god
Has she left here?
(I think she has)
In her grown up years
(I think she has)
In her pilot years
(Yes she has)
Like she came from outer space
(Yes she has)

Oh god
Has she turned queer?
(Yes she has)
In her grown up years
(Yes she has)
In a pilot dream
(Yes she has)
Like she came from outer space
(I think she has)

And now she's got helicopters
(Yes she has)
And now she's got helicopters
(Yes she has)
And now she's got helicopters
(Yes she has)
And now she's got helicopters
(Yes she has)
And now she's got helicopters
(Yes she has)
And now she's got helicopters
(Yes she has)1Embed
