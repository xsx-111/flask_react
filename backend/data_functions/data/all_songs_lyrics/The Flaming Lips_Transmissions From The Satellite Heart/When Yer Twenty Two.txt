When Yer Twenty Two LyricsStuck in the perpetual motion of dyin' against the machine
The whole thing leaves
You a nothing instead of a these
The sun is black and the black halos fly
And your number is backwards again when ya' try
The sound is so cute when you're 22
When you're 22
Eggs break when you walk on the scramble
You're livin' against the machine
The whole thing leaves
You a nothing instead of a these
The bone is cracked and the cracked eggshells fly
And your number is backwards again when ya' drive
The whole thing's removed when you're 22
When you're 22
Stuck in the perpetual motion
Stuck in the perpetual motion
Stuck in the perpetual motion
Stuck in the perpetual motionEmbed
