Slow Nerve Action LyricsIt's all a waste of time again
She used to mow the lawn
She always wasted everyone
She always turned me on

Now she's turned a kind
That isn't so much in demand
And all us vegetables
Can waste our time on someone else
She had a cool invisible
Dog that she called Paul
We'd always sit around her house
Watchin' her feed the dog
Now she's got a man
Who don't like dogs, who just likes cars
She's just got a job
'Cause times got hard, so Paul is gone

Now she's turned a kind
That isn't so much in demand
And all us vegetables
Can waste our time on someone else
It's all a waste of time again
It's all a waste of time again
It's all a waste of time again
It's all a waste of time again1Embed
