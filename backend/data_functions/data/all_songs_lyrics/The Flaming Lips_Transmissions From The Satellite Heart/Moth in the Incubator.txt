Moth in the Incubator LyricsSomething in you, it jitters like a moth
And I see that your arms are out to God
And oh, they kill you when they talk
It makes a mountain peak seem little when it's not
Your incubator is so tight
Your incubator is so tight
I've been born before, I'm pretty used to it
Brain-dead is always all there is
So embryonic it's all right
So embryonic it's all right
I've been born before, I'm gettin' used to it
Brain-dead is how it always endsEmbed
