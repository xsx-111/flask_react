Chewin the Apple of Yer Eye LyricsHey what were ya thinkin'
When they were startin' the show?
Yeah, I was there
But I didn't care at all
Was tryin' to find you
When you got lost in the crowd
Cause I'm drunk all the time
I like your Helium voice
There was a guy in the seat next to mine
Watchin' the girls when the cops made us stand in line
Yeah, so if it's sad
Well you still gotta live 'til ya' die
Man, everyone's chewin' the apple you got in yer eye
It's like at the circus
When you get lost in the crowd
Your happy but nervous
Definite sign that you've lost it
(Chorus)Embed
