Plastic Jesus LyricsI don't care if it rains or freezes
Long as I got my Plastic Jesus
Sittin' on the dashboard of my car
Comes in colors, pink and pleasant
Glows in the dark, it's iridescent
Take it with ya' when you travel far
Get yourself a sweet Madonna
Dressed in rhinestone, settin' on a
Pedestal of Abalone Shells
Goin' 90, I ain't scared
Cause I got the Virgin Mary
Assurin' me that I won't go to hellEmbed
