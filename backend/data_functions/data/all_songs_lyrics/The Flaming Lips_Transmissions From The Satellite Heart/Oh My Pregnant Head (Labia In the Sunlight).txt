Oh My Pregnant Head (Labia In the Sunlight) LyricsWhen will you shut your mouth
Stop all your vibrating
Birds flying out of a mountain
Somewhere the snow cools my fever
I just have stumps left for fingers
Wondering can you still play guitar
Just like a baby
Just like the smoke rings
Baby in the sunlight
When will you stop all your buzzing
Skull crushing hummingbird
Somewhere a star burns the universe
Gold eagle paints at my fingers
Can of spaghetti diseases
Hoping that you can still play guitar
Just like a baby
Just like the smoke rings
Labia in the sunlight
Baby in the sunlight (x6)Embed
