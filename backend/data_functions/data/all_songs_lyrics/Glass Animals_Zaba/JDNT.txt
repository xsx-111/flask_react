JDNT Lyrics
I breathe air and sigh
Toucan sleeps and cries
I'm all armored up
I've got my old helmet on
Keeping out an eye
Puffing all my feathers up
One more little blow
One more tap and I collapse
Teetering on a toe
I feel that final poke

Please, it's not okay
Oh, can't you feel your dirty face?
Oh, don't it leave that filthy taste?
Oh, when you squeeze that life untamed?

I free-fall real slow
I'm all drying out
Where my funny friends gone?
You're in paradise
Who gon' plant the flowers, huh?
Weak and worried
I shut my wild eyes
And crumble to a pile
Of dust and fertilise
Please, it's not okay
Oh, can't you feel your dirty face?
Oh, don't it leave that filthy taste?
Oh, when you squeeze that life untamed?

Take my hand and let us fall
Play with me and pass the ball
Take my hand and let us fall
Play with me and pass the ball
Take my hand and let us fall

I breathe air and sigh
You can't breathe without me13Embed
