Black Mambo Lyrics
"What’ll it be now, Mr. Mole?"
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
"Take a back seat, or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones"

Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo

Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

"Wanna play cheat now?" says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold
Slow down, it’s a science
He’s been waiting to bring you down
Snake eyed with a sly smile
He can hold you and shake you child

We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you29Embed
