Walla Walla Lyrics
Hi, my little naked man
I saw you there looking sad
Face so lost, petrified
Timid twitch in your wide eyes
My oh my, such strange supplies
Many spoons all in a pile
Did you bend ‘em with your mind?
Precious, precious, right right right

Honey honey, don’t you cry
It’s a ruse, all these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny, it’s alright
I clap my hands, and they’re gone into the night

Wiggle toes on wicker braids
Hanging with their nails so frayed
Mini fruits, all bone dry
And a cape, black tie-dyed
I bet I can make you smile
In the pools of moonlight
Watch this little trick of mine
Say with me this tiny rhyme
Honey honey, don’t you cry
It’s a ruse, all these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny, it’s alright
I clap my hands, and they’re gone into the night

Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand
Take my hand, take my hand, take my hand, take my hand4Embed
