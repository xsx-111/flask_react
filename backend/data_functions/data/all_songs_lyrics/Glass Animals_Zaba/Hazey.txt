Hazey Lyrics
Your baby's falling
You know I'm talking now
You know I'm dancing
You know I'm racing round
No no you're so juiced
You said you'd kick the booze
You know I'll get bruised
You know I'm just a boy

Come back baby, don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby, don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you

You say I'm bawling
I say I'm begging while
You take my photo
I fake my breaking smile
I'm fucking loco
I can't get through to you
You turn your nose you
Spark up and I can go
Come back baby, don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby, don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you28Embed
