Toes Lyrics
Put your hand down, boy, welcome to my zoo
Put your head inside my big black wild, while
I can still help you
See the snake baboon, funky, chic and smooth
Honey, can you spy the divine ape-swine?
'Cause he can see you

I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man, don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright

And all I ever want is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I said to the thing that I once was

I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man, don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright
To the left now, boy, underneath the moon
By the thick tan sand and the tall thin grass
One more thing for you
See the distant flume in the sleepy dunes
Makes my nerves clench close and my bones go cold
When I see that room

And all I ever want is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart

I’m a man, I’m a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I’m a man don’t spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I’m crooked but upright32Embed
