Wyrd Lyrics
Twee vole, go dig your hole
Squish squirmies in your nose
Tree hairs in your eyes
You smile so super quiet
Free air you sip on
A cave edge a black bowl
Breathe in deep and slow
As your own splash echoes

Don't go, please, don't go, please
Don't go, please, don't go, please

You can’t run, so you must hide
You won’t make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So, my friend, our time is done
You and I could’ve had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets, yeah

Oh vole, where did you go?
Dim lanterns held by groans
Of beasties sad and tired
Lost in the muck and
It’s all dank and gross
Slugs on shrooms bubble smoke
Through pipes and mondo rolls
Their fuzzy warbles drone
Baby, baby, baby, please, don't go

You can’t run, so you must hide
You won’t make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So, my friend, our time is done
You and I could’ve had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets
You can’t run, so you must hide
You won’t make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel, now suck it
So, my friend, our time is done
You and I could’ve had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets, yeah
