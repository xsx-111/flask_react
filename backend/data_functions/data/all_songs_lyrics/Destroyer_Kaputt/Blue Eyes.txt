Blue Eyes LyricsYou terrify the land
You are pestle and mortar
Your first love’s new order:
Mother Nature’s Son
King Of The Everglades: Population 1
I write poetry for myself! I write poetry for myself…
Oh, baby
You’re a permanent figure of jacked-up sorrow
I want you to love me. You send me a coffin of roses
I guess that’s the way that things go
These days…
Take pills, for instance, I heard they’re no good for you
“I won’t and I never will,” she said…
“I won’t and I never will
I won’t and I never will
I won’t and I never will
I won’t and I never will…”
Blue Eyes…
Oh, baby can’t you see they had it in for me
They had it in for me, they had it in for me
Oh, baby can’t you see they had it in for me
They had it in for me…
Blue Eyes…
I sent a message in a bottle to the press
It said, “Don’t be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves
Don’t be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves
Don’t be ashamed or disgusted with yourselves
I’ve thumbed through the books on your shelves
I’ve thumbed through the books on your shelves
I’ve thumbed through the books on your shelves
I’ve thumbed through the books on your shelves…”
