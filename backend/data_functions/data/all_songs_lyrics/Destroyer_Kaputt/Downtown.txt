Downtown LyricsI was just getting used
To having you ’round
You went wandering
Around the world
I woke up
I went downtown
I woke up and everything was drowning…
Downtown…
Little Comet (that’s the name we gave him!)
’s been trying
But he doesn’t see why
MaryJane from down the lane went insane
Oh she’s still better off than I am…
Downtown!…
Held a candle to the window
Then the door
Saw the features of the world light up
Oh Eva, your face!
I was a four-leaf clover
I was Red Rover on his way over
To your place!…
I was just getting used
To having you ’round
You went wandering
Around the world
I woke up
I went downtown
I woke up
And everything was drowning2Embed
