Chinatown Lyrics
You can’t believe
The way the wind’s talking to the sea
I heard that someone said it before, I don’t care
I can’t walk away, I can’t walk away
In Chinatown

The wind and the rain
To your detriment, you try to explain
A government swallowed up in the squall
I can’t walk away, at all
In Chinatown

You can’t believe
Though I’m sure somebody’s said it before:
I know you and I know the score
I can’t walk away, you can’t walk away
I can’t walk away, you can’t walk away
I can’t walk away, you can’t walk away
I can’t walk away, you can’t walk away

I can’t walk away3Embed
