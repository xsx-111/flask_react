Kaputt LyricsWasting your days
Chasing some girls, alright
Chasing cocaine
Through the backrooms of the world
All night
Wasting your days
Chasing some girls alright
Chasing cocaine
Through the backrooms of the world
All night
Sounds
Smash hits
Melody maker
NME
All sound like a dream to me
All sound like a dream to me
All sounds like a dream
Sounds
Smash hits
Melody maker
NME
All sound like a dream to me
All sound like a dream to me
All sounds like a dream
Step out of your toga
And into the fog
You are a prince
On the ocean
In a pinch
In the sky
In your eye
Step out of your toga
And into the ocean
Look, they got your prints
On the fog
In a pinch
In the sky
In your eye
In the sky
In your eye
In a pinch
In the sky
In your eye
I wrote a song for America
Who knew?
I wrote a song for America
Who knew?
