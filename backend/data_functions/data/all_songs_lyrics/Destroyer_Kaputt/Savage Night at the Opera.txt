Savage Night at the Opera LyricsA savage night at the opera
Another savage night at the club
Let’s face it, old souls like us are being born to die!
It's not a war 'til someone loses an eye!
Yes, I’m familiar with your scene
Some would say, shockingly uptight
21-gun salute to the Fallen Birds Of The Sky
I heard their record, it’s alright…
Hey, Infinite Sense Of Value…
Hey, Infinite Sense Of Value…
Hey, Mystic Prince Of The Purlieu At Night!
I heard your record, it’s alright…
You’ll never guess just what I’ve seen…
A horse abandoned midstream…
Quatrain etched on a dirtpile…
Quatrain etched, hey that’s your style!
You’ll never guess just where I’ve been…
A life abandoned midstream…
Quatrain etched on a turnstile…
Just set the loop and then go wilder…1Embed
