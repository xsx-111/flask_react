Poor in Love LyricsI was poor in love. I was poor in wealth
I was okay in everything else there was
Oh, I was poor in love
I was poor in love…
I was poor in love. I was poor in wealth
I was okay in everything else there was
Oh, I was poor in love
I was poor in love…
She took me aside and said –
“Look I don’t do this every day
You got style!… All you’ve got is style!
I can see it from a mile away!”
Oh, I was poor in love
I was poor in love…
“You were born okay
Rich in name alone
Your Jesuit profile will suit
The coming apocalypse!”
Oh, I was poor in love
Poor in love…
Why does everybody sing along?
Why does everybody sing along
When we built this city on
Ruins?…
Why does everybody sing along?
Why does everybody sing along
When we built this city on
Ruins?…
On ruins…
On ruins…Embed
