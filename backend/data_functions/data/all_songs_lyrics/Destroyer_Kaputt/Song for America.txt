Song for America Lyrics
I wrote a song for America
They told me it was clever
Jessica’s gone on vacation
On the dark side of town forever
Who knew? Who knew?

Winter, spring, summer, and fall
Animals crawl towards death’s embrace
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Punks kick a ball
In a park on a Sunday
Strung out in the rain
Winter, spring, summer, and fall
Animals crawl towards death’s embrace
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Punks kick a ball
In a park on a Sunday
Just wasted in the rain
Winter, spring, summer, and fall
Animals crawl towards death’s embrace
Winter, spring, summer, fall
Punks kick a ball
In a park on a Sunday
Strung out in the rainEmbed
