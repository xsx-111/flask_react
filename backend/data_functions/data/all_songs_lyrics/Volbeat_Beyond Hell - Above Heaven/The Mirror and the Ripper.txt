The Mirror and the Ripper Lyrics
Found the morning liquor
Found the morning light
Look into the rearview mirror
The motherfuckers are all awaiting him down the line
Sick and tired of fighting
All the crap inside
Starting a new day, breathing in the morning
Got a feeling leaving something behind
He sees the lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely days

Left his car out in the desert forever more
He's got another life now to explore
And forever you will hear the people talk
How they can hear his boots out in the cold

And the fallen will get down on his knees, yeah-ah-ah-ah
And the fallen will get down on his knees, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Whoa-oh-oh

And forever the man in the coat
Will cast his shadows among those who knows
The tale of the gangster who shot all his demons for good
Whoa-oh-oh
Then along came the mirror and the ripper
What do you see in the night?
Passing shadow that can
Scar your soul and make you feel demonized
Hear a match and see the lightning from the ripper
What do you have on your mind?
We believe that he comes
For another wicked destiny night
Dazing in the dark
The life line going cold in fire

Have you asked yourself what it is that you see?
Well, is it Mr. Cadillac or you?
Walking among those who nearly found peace
Into the light and out of the blue

And the fallen will get down on his knees, yeah-ah-ah-ah
And the fallen will get down on his knees, yeah-ah-ah-ah
Whoa-oh-oh

And forever the man in the coat
Will cast his shadows among those who knows
The tale of the gangster who shot all his demons for good
Whoa-oh-oh
Then along came the mirror and the ripper
What do you see in the night?
Passing shadow that can
Scar your soul and make you feel demonized
Hear a match and see the lightning from the ripper
What do you have on your mind?
We believe that he comes
For another wicked destiny night
Dazing in the dark
The life line going cold in fire
Look into his eyes
You'll meet a hundred Angels' cries

Face the mirror
You gonna seek another day
You gonna face the mirror
You gonna seek another day
You gonna face the mirror
You gonna seek another day
You gonna face the mirror
You gonna seek another day
You gonna, going lonely homeEmbed
