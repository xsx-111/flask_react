Who They Are Lyrics
Unleash the breath that damned the wicked soul
Make the sacrifice for good
An omen passed the flame through the night
Benefit the figures face without thorns
Gaze upon thy gate, a spirit finds a light
Embrace it with its burning tears
Howling, crawling, falling inside

Beyond and bound the spirit rise
And disappeared into the light
Covered by a shadow face vengeances
For the traitors are thine
See a fallen angel raging fire glow
Take the tale, let wisdom fill the beginning of the end for us all

A higher form that makes us feel cold
They said dying alone is our fault
Forbidden and freeze the things that we need
They said judgment day is upon

Unleash the breath that damned the wicked soul
Make the sacrifice for good
An omen passed the flame through the night
Benefit the figures face without thorns
Gaze upon thy gate, a spirit finds a light
Embrace it with its burning tears
Howling, crawling, falling inside
A higher form that makes us feel cold
They said dying alone is our fault
Forbidden and freeze the things that we need
They said judgment day is uponEmbed
