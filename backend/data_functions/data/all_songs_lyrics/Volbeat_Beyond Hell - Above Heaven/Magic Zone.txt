Magic Zone Lyrics
Hide or alone, you make it feel at home
Silence is not even there no more
You make it feel at ease, something to embrace
A heart that's forever believing it

Life ain't that good that it's worth dying for
But baby, I'll always take a bullet for you
Hold on tight before tomorrow is gone
A wake-up call greeting me with a smile
A new day is born and the old is behind
Million crazy butterflies getting drunk, we are one

I'm down on my tail but I'm up and I can feel it again
Angel wings unfold and the devil sitting moaning alone
I've been down but I'm back in a magic zone

Walking through life never thought that I could
Finding a soulmate and married her too
We're distorted but we fit like a glove
Pleasure and pain will walk hand in hand
No place to run, take it all day by day
What it takes, what it makes, let it breathe, celebrate
I'm down on my tail but I'm up and I can feel it again
Angel wings unfold and the devil sitting moaning alone
I've been down but I'm back in a magic zone


I'm down on my tail but I'm up and I can feel it again
Angel wings unfold and the devil sitting moaning alone
I've been down but I'm back in a magic zone


Hide or alone, you make it feel at home
Silence is not even there no more
You make it feel at ease, something to embrace
A heart that's forever believing itEmbed
