A New Day Lyrics
Felt when I walked
When I walked out the door
A new day will give the peace I need
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry
But I leak all the blood
From the past and now it turned into mud
I still feel the devil breathes in me
But this time I will break him piece by piece

Hold back your fears you're more than home
Could it be that the tears no longer sad but true
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to hold

Sweet as it was
Not forever and never to close
I believe the pain was hunting me
For all the things that should not be
But I need a new love
And for once I believe that it's her
I still feel the devil breathes in me
But this time I will break him piece by piece
Hold back your fears you're more than home
Could it be that the angel of tomorrow knows
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to hold

You feel you die and then you get home
You pray just like I would slay
Time will heal all wounds
You feel you die and then you get home
You pray just like I would slay
Time will heal all wounds
You bleed you see and you see an angel fall
But still I can speak the angels down from heaven
Where I slay

Felt when I walked
When I walked out the door
A new day will give the peace I need
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry
But I leak all the blood
From the past and now it turned into mud
I still feel the devil breathes in me
But this time I will break him piece by piece
Hold back your fears you're more than home
Could it be that the tears no longer sad but true
Break the moment into something more than gold
And I realize it now, it was never meant to holdEmbed
