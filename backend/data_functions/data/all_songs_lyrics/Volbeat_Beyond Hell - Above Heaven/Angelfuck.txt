Angelfuck Lyrics
Little angel fuck
It's a shame your luck isn't better, babe
Did you like the fun?
Did you like the times I promised you?

Open wounds on your breast
Little angel is red
She says nothing new anymore

Little angel fuck
I see you going down on a fireplug
Little angel fuck
Sighs for everyone

Let those bastards believe
Dry your thighs in relief
She says nothing new anymore

Little angel fuck
I see you going down on a fireplug
Oh, little angel fuck
Sighs for everyone
Let those bastards believe
Dry your thighs in relief
She says nothing new anymoreEmbed
