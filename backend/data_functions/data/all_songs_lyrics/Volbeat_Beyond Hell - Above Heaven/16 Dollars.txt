16 Dollars Lyrics
16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day
I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with Dick Brave "Walk This Way"
I need a quick drink, more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing "Boogie Woogie Chili Honey"

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
(Whoa-oh-a-oh)
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home (x3)

16 songs in the back in a corner and an empty bottle of Jack and a bitch
Well I'm sorry to inform you that the poison in my body guiding you to walk away from this mess
I need a quick drink, more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice
It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing "Boogie Woogie Chili Honey"

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
(Whoa-oh-a-oh)
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again

I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home (x3)

16 dollars in a back street corner is enough for a beautiful day
I see a window open hearing Aerosmith rocking with Dick Brave "Walk This Way"
I need a quick drink, more volume for the beat
I see the cats are playing dice

It's 7 in the morning and you lost all your money
To a fat lady singing "Boogie Woogie Chili Honey"

I've been walking the streets again
But it's the same old thing I'll do it again
(Whoa-oh-a-oh)
Just to see what the day will bring
But it's the same old song I'll do it again
I'll bring you home my baby I will
I would love to bring you home (x3)2Embed
