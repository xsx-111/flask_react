Heaven Nor Hell Lyrics
Well, I've heard that the Devil's walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back and forever in debt

And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you

Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

Well, I've heard that the morning star of a prince
Was invoked on a Monday on Earth
I found his business card in the mud

And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you
Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell

Evil came down on Earth
And it beholds more than you love
More than you love
Heaven, don't fall on Earth
What you behold is no longer word
No longer words

Well, I've heard that the Devil's walking around
I sold my soul way down in the dirt
But stole it back and forever in debt

And for a moment I don't even care
Until I feel his breath at my neck
And maybe even you can feel it too
He's on a strike and looking at you
Holding onto his words, but baby
I saw an angel become the Devil
Still they walk pretty good hand in hand
Well, baby, I don't need any of them
Heaven nor hell3Embed
