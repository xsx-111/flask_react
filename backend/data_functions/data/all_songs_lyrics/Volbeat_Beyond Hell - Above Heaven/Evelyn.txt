Evelyn Lyrics
Get off my shoulders I told you to
Stay away
You're still a big part of me
Dance with delusional angels of sin
Kill false demons you might kill false
Angels too
That's not what we wanna do
Together as one
Do as we're told
Living together and fighting as one

Rejecting what's "good"
With so-called evil included
The dominant mind will prove you all blind
Finding the balance to leave you behind
I've learned so far
Controlling all the dark
Evelyn visions in the sky
All on my shoulder, all in my mind

I still hear you sing
My sweet love Evelyn
In fact, I'm so cold, but I...
I made up my mind to see where it will lead
In fact, I'm so lonely I...
Stay away
You're still a big part of me
Dance with delusional angels of sin
Kill false demons you might kill false
Angels too
That's not what we wanna do
Together as one
Do as we're told
Living together and fighting as one

I still hear you sing
My sweet love Evelyn
In fact, I'm so cold, but I...
I made up my mind to see where it will lead
In fact, I'm so lonely I...

Don't listen to all the bollocks
There's nothing on either shoulder
Spreading the fire fever into something more that needs ya
Maybe you fall forever
And maybe we die together
Angel Evelyn, I die
I still hear you sing
My sweet love Evelyn
In fact, I'm so cold, but I...
I made up my mind to see where it will lead
In fact, I'm so lonely I...1Embed
