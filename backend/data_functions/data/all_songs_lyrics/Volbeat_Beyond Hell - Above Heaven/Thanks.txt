Thanks Lyrics
We thank you people for being around
Supporting Volbeat with love and hell fire
Gu'fanden do we care
You're all our brothers, sisters, and our babies

Going out on the street again with open arms and fists
Sweating out all the whiskey tømmermænd
And the pain that comes with it
But we know who we are and more
Protectors of this band  oh oh-oh oh
And we know we're not alone anymore
We got supporters in this rock 'n' roll band

The song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Yeah! we make a lot of noise
Refuse to sit down and be tamed
We still think that we owe you some
So we're making a lot of noise
We sing it out loud we sing it out proud

Sacrificing all the things that we had
Just to do this thing
Not even money for some glue
So we hang all the posters up with jam
But we know who we are and more
Protectors of this band - oh-oh oh-oh
And we know we're not along anymore
We got supporters in this rock 'n' roll band
The song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Yeah! we make a lot of noise
Refuse to sit down and be tamed
We still think that we owe you some
So we're making a lot of noise
We sing it out loud we sing it out proud

We thank you people for being around
Supporting Volbeat with love and hell fire
Gu'fanden do we care
You're all our brothers and sisters and our babies
So when you sing this song out loud
Remember it's for you, for helvede we are proud
Let's all have a beer you're all our brothers sisters and our babies

The song is for all the ones who's singing out loud
Yeah! we make a lot of noise
Refuse to sit down and be tamed
We still think that we owe you some
So we're making a lot of noise
We sing it out loud we sing it out proud1Embed
