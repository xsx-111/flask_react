Running Up That Hill (A Deal with God) Lyrics
It doesn't hurt me (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to feel how it feels? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to know, know that it doesn't hurt me? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)

You
It's you and me

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building
Say, if I only could, oh

You don't want to hurt me (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
But see how deep the bullet lies (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Is there so much hate for the ones we love? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
Tell me, we both matter, don't we? (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
You
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy

And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
Be running up that road
Be running up that hill
Be running up that building (Iyoh)
Say, if I only could, oh

You (Iyeh-yeh-yo)
It's you and me
It's you and me, won't be unhappy (Iyeh-yeh-yo)

Oh come on, baby (Iyeh)
Oh come on, darling
Let me steal this moment from you now
Oh come on, angel
Come on, come on, darling
Let's exchange the experience, oh, uh-oh
And if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
I'd make a deal with God
And I'd get him to swap our places
I'd be running up that road
Be running up that hill
With no problems

Say, if I only could
Be running up that hill
With no problems
If I only could, be running up that hill
If I only could, be running up that hill28Embed
