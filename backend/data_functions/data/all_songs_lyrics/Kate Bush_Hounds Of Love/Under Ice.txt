Under Ice Lyrics
It's wonderful
Everywhere, so white

The river has frozen over
Not a soul on the ice
Only me
Skating fast

I'm speeding past trees
Leaving little lines in the ice
Cutting out
Little lines
In the ice
Splitting, splitting sound
Silver heels
Spitting, spitting snow

There's something moving under
Under the ice
Moving under ice
Through water
Trying to
It's me
Get out of the cold water
It's me
Something
It's me
Someone - help them!4Embed
