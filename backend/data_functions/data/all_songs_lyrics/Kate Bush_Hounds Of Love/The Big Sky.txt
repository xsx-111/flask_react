The Big Sky Lyrics
They look down
At the ground
Missing
But I never go in now

I'm looking at the big sky
I'm looking at the big sky now
I'm looking at the big sky
You never understood me
You never really tried

That cloud, that cloud
It looks like Ireland
C'mon and blow it a kiss now
But quick!

'Cause it's changing in the big sky
It's changing in the big sky now
We're looking at the big sky
You never understood me
You never really tried
This cloud, this cloud
Says "Noah
Come on, build me an Ark
And if you're coming, jump

'Cause we're leaving with the big sky
We're leaving with the big sky, yeah honey
We're leaving with the big sky
We're looking at the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
We're looking at the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And we pause for the jets
Hup! Hup!

Hup! In the big sky!
We're looking at the big sky, honey
You want my reply?
What was the question?
I was looking at the big sky
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hup! Hup! Big sky, yeah
Looking at the big sky
We're looking at the, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tell me, sisters!
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky
Rolling over like a great big cloud
Walking out in the big sky5Embed
