Silent Key LyricsOn the 28th of January 1986
Christa McAuliffe gazed in horror as the O-rings failed
And she died, and she died, and she died
For the next agonising two minutes and forty-five long seconds
She called out the truth on a broken radio:
"I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive"
It came as some surprise to realise that as she lost everything
The world was revealed in a transmission so real that she understood everything:
You're still alive, you're still alive
Four thousand nautical miles as the crow flies away
A home-made ham radio in the loft of a Hampshire family home
Came alive, came alive, came alive
And so the four-year-old amateur operator thus became the only person to hear
Christa's last desperate communiqu√©
"We're alive, we're alive, we're alive"
It came as some surprise to realise, while he didn't catch everything
The world was revealed in a transmission so real that he understood everything
You're still alive

And Christa said
"The darkness up above led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need were down here in the deep blue sea
The darkness up above led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need were down here in the deep blue sea
The darkness up above led me on like unrequited love
While all the things I need were down here in the deep blue sea"
At four years old, I heard the truth on my radio
So now I keep a moment's silence for my silent key
My silent key
My silent key
