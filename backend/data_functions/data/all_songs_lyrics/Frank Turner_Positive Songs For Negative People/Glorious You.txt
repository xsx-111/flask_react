Glorious You Lyrics
I can see you hurting beneath your new red dress
Beneath your new tattoos and your sharp new shoes you are directionless
And I know you've been working as hard as you can
To preempt the question, the expectation, and I understand

So come on now, if we all pulled together
We could lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Just for a moment or two

From the moment the phone alarm breaks the morning in two
To the moment you close your bedroom door and all that's left is you
There were a thousand auditions you didn't quite get through
So many masks to wear, so much weight to bear, but you were only ever you
You were glorious you, you were glorious

So come on now, if we all pulled together
We could lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Just for a moment or two
Come on now, if we all pulled together
We could lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Just for a moment or two
Be glorious you, glorious you, glorious you
With your mixed-up metaphors, your messed-up makeup
You're glorious you
With your tongue-tied tragedy, and too-small t-shirt
Glorious you
So don't you worry, all things must end
There are sunlit uplands around the river bend

Come on now, if we all pulled together
We could lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Just for a moment or two
Come on now, if we all pulled together
We could lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders
Just for a moment or two and be glorious you
Glorious you, glorious you

You were glorious you
You were glorious you
You were glorious you1Embed
