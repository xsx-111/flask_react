Josephine Lyrics
I heard the name Josephine
It came to me in a dream
And I don't usually set too much store by the things these things might mean
But it was spoken with seriousness
More of a whisper than a scream
So now I'm waiting on some Josephine
To show herself to me

I could have been anyone I imagined I could be
I just needed somebody to wake me from my sleep
I could have been Napoleon
Could have been Beethoven
Could have been anyone, but uncomfortable me
So come now, Josephine, show yourself to me

So come on now, Josephine, give me what I need
I don't like to be needy but needs must
I can't stand being the person that I've been
I'm an impending car crash
And you're the first one on the scene
I'm a defeated commander
I'm a half-deaf composer
I'm a strange name whispered in a dream
I could have been anyone I imagined I could be
I just needed somebody to wake me from my sleep
I could have been Napoleon
Could have been Beethoven
Could have been anyone, but uncomfortable me
So come now, Josephine, show yourself to me

So come on now, Josephine
Let's pretend it's Halloween
You come as a car crash
I'll go as James Dean
I'm Napoloeon on Elba
And you're a hundred days in 1815
I wrote all of these letters to my immortal beloved
And you're the only one who's ever going to know what they mean

Come on now, Josephine
Wake me from my sleep
I could have been anyone
But I ended up being me
I could have been wide awake
Could have been what you need
I wish that I was anyone except for just me
So come on now, Josephine
Show yourself to me
Come on now, Josephine
Show yourself to me
Come on now, Josephine
Show yourself to me
Come on now, Josephine
Show yourself to me1Embed
