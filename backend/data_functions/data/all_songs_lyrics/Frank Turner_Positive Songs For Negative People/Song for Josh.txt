Song for Josh Lyrics
So this song's for Josh

Why didn't you call
My phone's always on
Why didn't you call
Before you got gone
And I can't say for certain what I would have said
But now I am helplessly silent instead
There's a hole in my heart and in my head
Why didn't you call
Why didn't you say something on the last time we met
Why didn't you say something? There's always hope left
And I can't say for certain what I would have done
But I can't do anything now that you're gone
And it kills me to think that for a second you felt alone
Now you can measure the mark of a man on the day that he dies
In the mixture of memory and wreckage that he leaves behind
And I know you were carrying too much weight
On the evening when you slipped away
But I loved you like a brother, man, and I never really had a chance to say
So at half past nine each evening, I'll think of my friend
And at half past nine, I'll remember, you were better than your end
Cause I too have stood up on that ledge
But I know you'd have pulled me back down from the edge
And I let you down in your darkness, I wasn't there
So I'll remember you making a hole through the kids in the crowd
And I'll remember you lifting me up each time I fell down
And I'll glance at the barrier when I'm watching the band
And I'll expect to see you there stood on the foot stand
But I guess I will see someone else
And that's when I'll whisper to myself
"Brother, I miss you like hell"

Thanks very much
That's for Josh Burdette
Let's hear it for Josh, come on!1Embed
