Demons LyricsYeah!

If life gives you demons, make a deal
Meet them at the crossroads, cross your fingers, and then sign and seal
Hey, philosophers, make way
Pascal never had too much stomach for gambling anyway

At this truth we have arrived:
God damn, it's great to be alive

If life gives you demons, make demands
Take them to the mountain top, show them the valley, then take a chance
Hey, physicians, heal thyself
I'll make my own way down to hell without your help

At this truth we have arrived:
God damn, it's great to be alive
Doesn't it just break your heart to know
That none of this will last
You're not delivering a perfect body to the grave
Time is not there to be saved
Life is a holiday, a moment stolen from the black
Before the demons drag you back
You won't get everything you wanted

Dry mouth, taste of blood
The iron on the tongue brings up something ancient, something before the flood
Dust down, stand tall
Life gave me demons, but I made friends with the devil, so I'm invincible

At this truth we have arrived:
God damn, it's great to be alive
You're not delivering a perfect body to the grave
Time is not there to be saved
Life is a holiday, a moment stolen from the black
Before the demons drag you back
You won't get everything you wanted
But you will never be defeated
You won't get everything you wanted
But you will never be defeated
You won't get everything you wanted
But you will never be defeatedEmbed
