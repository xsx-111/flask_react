Love Forty Down Lyrics
I'm love-forty down
As the match slips away from me, I need the crowd to pray for me
To turn this one around
I've worked far too hard to be this far from victory

I'm battered and I'm bruised
And I can't afford to lose

I'm love-forty down
As the day slips away from me, I have to say that honestly
I still haven't found
The person who can take the strain of deuce, advantage, back again
So I'll do this on my own
There's no one waiting when I'm done

In the time it takes for the serve to rise and fall
We'll find out if I am man or mouse, if I am set to stand or fall

I'm love-forty down
And I can well recall the day my father reached the ancient age
That's now bearing down
The barrel of my fourth decade and honestly I am afraid
I'm long in the tooth
But I'm ready for the truth
In the time it takes for the serve to rise and fall
We'll find out if I am man or mouse, if I am set to stand or fall

In the time it takes for the umpire to flip his coin
We'll find out if I can take the strain if I can make it through break point

I'm love-forty down
I'm going to turn this one around
I'm love-forty down
I'm going to turn this one around
Break point (I'm love-forty down)
Break point (I'm love-forty down)
I'm going turn this one around1Embed
