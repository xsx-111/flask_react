The Angel Islington Lyrics
By the waters of the Thames
I resolved to start again:
To wash my feet and cleanse my sins
To lose my cobwebs on the wind
To fix the parts of me I broke
To speak out loud the things I know:
I haven't been myself

Wandering Rosebery Avenue
I could only think of you
Facing Samuel Johnson down
A soul to wear down London Town
A glance to take the breath away
And drag me south from Holloway
You and no one else

I'm the king of a kingdom of mistakes
I've broken all the things that I could break
Fuck the fishing, I will abdicate
And meet you on the corner of Upper Street and the City Road
And you, of course, the Angel Islington...
Ah, come on, a boy could hope
By the waters of the Thames
I resolved to start again3Embed
