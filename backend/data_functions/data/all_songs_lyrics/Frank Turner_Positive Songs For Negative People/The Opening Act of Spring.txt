The Opening Act of Spring Lyrics
Oh, the birds are ringing in the opening act of spring
And I have fallen down and I'm so much worse than I have ever been
Oh, the season's acting strange and I know that something has to change
But there is no path I can choose that will not bring somebody pain

And oh, please, forgive me for the things that I must do
But oh, though I have hurt so many people, it was never my intention to hurt you

Oh, the clouds are gathered thick
And in my stomach I feel sick
And I have all this drive and no idea what I should do with it
But they say there is a calm after the passing of the storm
So I can dream of going back outside when the rain and thunder's done

And oh, please, forgive me for the things that I must do
But oh, though I have hurt so many people, it was never my intention to hurt you

And all the old folk say they can tell which way the river's flowing
Tell which way the wind is blowing
By watching careful for the signs among the little things
The barking dogs, the birds on wing
And I am deaf and blind
And I can't say if I can change the patterns that have caused you pain
For I was raised in suburbs, sheltered from the sun and rain
Far away from subtle season's change
Oh, baby, I will read about the buzzing of the bees
About the grass and snakes and spawning lakes and the different types of trees
And I will find a way that leads from cruel April into May
And someday soon it will be June and you'll decide to stay

And oh, please, forgive me for the things that I have done
Oh, I will carry your umbrella in the summer
And I'll shade you from the sunEmbed
