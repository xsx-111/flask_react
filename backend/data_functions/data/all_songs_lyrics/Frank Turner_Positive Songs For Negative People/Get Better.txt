Get Better Lyrics
I got me a shovel and I'm digging a ditch
And I'm gonna fight for this four square feet of land
Like a mean old son of a bitch
I got me a future, I'm not stuck on the past
I got no new tricks, yeah, I'm up on bricks
But me, I'm a machine and I was built to last

I'm trying to get better 'cause I haven't been my best
She took a plain black marker, started writing on my chest
She drew a line across the middle of my broken heart
And said "Come on now, let's fix this mess"
We could get better because we're not dead yet

They threw me a whirlwind and I spat back the sea
I took a battering but I've got thicker skin
And the best people I know are looking out for me
So I'm taking the high road, my engine's running high and fine
May I always see the road rising up to meet me
And my enemies defeated in the mirror behind

I'm trying to get better 'cause I haven’t been my best
She took a plain black marker, started writing on my chest
She drew a line across the middle of my broken heart
And said "Come on now, let's fix this mess"
We could get better because we’re not dead yet
It's just a knot in the small of your back
You could work it out with your fingers
It's just a tune that got stuck in your head
You could work it out with your fingers
It's just some numbers tangled up in your sums
You could work it out with your fingers
It's just a simple Braille missive from the person you miss
A reminder you could always be a little bit better than this

So try and get better and don't ever accept less
Take a plain black marker and write this on your chest
Draw a line underneath all of this unhappiness
Come on now, let's fix this mess
We could get better because we're not dead yet2Embed
