Mittens Lyrics
Wandering lonely through the snow streets of New York
I stumbled on a thrift store that sold postcards by the yard
I bought a mile and shipped them home so I could read
Ten thousand ten-word tragedies, the lives these strangers lead
To remind myself the things I need

I once wrote you love songs
You never fell in love
We used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves

You left me feeling like we'd never really been in love

Huddled homebound in my place in Holloway
I wondered if you even heard those songs I used to play
I wrote them as a gift for you and in return
You gave a pair of hand-knit mittens to keep my fingers warm
So I could play more ignored love songs

I once wrote you love songs
You never fell in love
We used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves
I once wrote you postcards
But you never wrote back
You promised me you would and I'm still waiting for that
You left me feeling like we'd never really been in love
Don't want to fit like mittens
I want to fit like gloves
I want to fit like gloves
I want to fit like gloves

I once wrote you love songs
You never fell in love
We used to fit like mittens, but never like gloves
But never like glovesEmbed
