Inbetween the Liners LyricsMGMT, 4 letters, 5 minds, 6th sense
Second Sight? Rock and Roll is 50 years old, but we are still speaking in tongues
What would Aristotle make of Wop Bop A Loo Bop?
A Zen mantra for our Bam Boo times?
"Expect the unexpected" I heard, as any fools knows, usually impossible
9 months, the pregnant portion of a year
Spent in their company, hasn't led me to deceive I know MGMT any better than anyone else
No tomes from me or type-tapping critics will reveal that
A 5 part puzzle beyond Rubik proportions for you to Twist & Shout to
Never mix stripes and spots we're told, ha
It's actually a beautiful clash
Hell, here comes the Paisley & Polka-dot too
What are you going to do about it?
Love it, of course!
CONGRATULATIONS, their second long player is something precious
A Gift. To Lovers. To Others. For Sisters. For Brothers. To live to. To love to. To look at. To listen through
Nine songs. Some Short, some long
A shy-eyed journey through the dichotomy of their lives through their souls
Sunday Bacon for the Monday Generation
IT'S WORKING
Love? Or Confusion? Reality? Contusion? Subterranea or Sub-fusion. The Quest begins
SONG FOR DAN TREACY
A Man. A Mystery? A Saint? A Sod? Were we all made for this life? Some give, some receive. But Dan Treacy smiles
FLASH DELIRIUM
The Natives go all Dance-hall Stomp as something strange in the water forces a Flash time Strobo-cop emanation of the will Delusion Extrusion
SIBERIAN BREAKS
A Pop Surf Opera, after the storm the loss of Ego
Breakers on the Beach. Hanging Ten with the Hodads. Distraction
Then Sandy Smiles as the Sun Squints its way. A new day. Cleansed. Ready. Surf's up! Piss or pass the Pot
SOMEONE'S MISSING
But Who? And Why? Just a thought? A feeling? Or a moment of doubt lying in wait?
To refilling the gateway. The door. Consciousness. A lines
I FOUND A WHISTLE
Hope. Reassurance. The bogey-man Triumph of the Plastic surf totem. The motion of Notions. Spells & potions
BRIAN ENO
A smile sent out. A wink and & chuckle. The Mystery of time
The Air Traffic controller of sound and space and subterfuge
LADY DADA'S NIGHTMARE
The Mind falters. Questioning. Looking for answers
Lock-loop images stray into fluorescing cotton candy crimes. Impervious
Then, the Release. A Primal Scream for the How Generation
More DaDa than GaGa. More Drinking than Thinking. Less Arty than Party. Time takes a rain-check
CONGRATULATIONS
The Half-arsed Hugs of routine celebrations. Realisations. Random Aging
A World in tatters? Glitter that matters? The hollow victory. And then SleepEmbed
