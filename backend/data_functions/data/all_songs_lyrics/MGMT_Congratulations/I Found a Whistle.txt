I Found a Whistle LyricsHey, I found a whistle that hangs like a charm
And when my noose is tied I could blow it
And fall down into your arms
15 centuries of dissolution and grief
To return a yellow trickster and a thief
Hey, I found a whistle that works every time
That's when the trail escapes to nowhere
And the flood erases the crime
Such conviction, to paint all the walls with the blood
Of the young and the faithful and the good
Yeah, I found a whistle as thin as a sheet
To split the dumbness of a vision
Between a sleep and asleep
Tiny axes repeatedly raising the flag
All ignored, real emotion's such a drag
Hey, I've got a pistol that's aimed at your heart
And on dark nights when the moon is right, I could show you
The head attached with a scarf
Aerophane sorceress, at home obeying the fates
When it's gone, has it gone all the way?
This time, found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle that works
Hangs like a charm on my neck
Found a whistle that works every time
Yeah, I found a whistle that works
Closes my mind every time
A whistle, I've got it
I've got it this time5Embed
