Headlow Lyrics
This lady is giving head
On I-95, at the toll

I ever tell you 'bout the time I, drivin' down the I-9?
Lady in the passenger, smokin' on la-la
Put your blunt up in the ash tray
And get your hair up out the way
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low
Me and little Joonie sittin' in a movie
Soon as the lights out, she gon' pull the pipe out
She don't want no popcorn, she just want her mouth on me
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low

Ooh, she pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home, better keep your head low
Better keep your head low

I ever tell you 'bout the time when I, runnin' down the 9 mile?
Lady with the Puma sneaks
Sit up on me, head towel
Grippin' locks with the right palm
Hey, don't stop, baby, keep goin'
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low
Tears fallin' down my left cheek
Baby hit the nerve like a Pepsi
You can't breathe when I'm neck deep
I take it out but you just wanna finish me
Everywhere we go, we make a scene
We hit it long as long as you can keep
Just keep your head low
Just keep your head low
Ooh, she pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home, better keep your head low
Better keep your head low

She pulls my coat and so I have to slow it down, do it simple
She says pull over, uh oh, I slow it down, do it simple
My windows foggin' up, I see them watchin' us
We're almost home

Oh fuck
Oh, oh, keep goin', keep goin', keep goin', keep goin'
Keep doin' that, keep doing that
Who the fuck taught you how to do that shit? Aw, fuck
Oh shit
(Oh my god, holy shit)
Just keep goin', I'm almost there
I'm almost there, I'm almost there, I'm almost there
Just go around me, go around me, I'm almost there
Move, nigga3Embed
