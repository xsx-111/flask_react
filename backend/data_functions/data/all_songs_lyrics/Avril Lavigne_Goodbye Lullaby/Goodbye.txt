Goodbye Lyrics
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye my love
I can't hide, can't hide
Can't hide what has come

I have to go, I have to go
I have to go and leave you alone
But always know, always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so
I love you so, oh

Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye for now
Goodbye sunshine
Take care of yourself

I have to go, I have to go
I have to go and leave you alone
But always know, always know
Always know that I love you so
I love you so, oh
I love you so, oh
La-lullaby, distract me with your rhymes
La-lullaby
La-lullaby, help me sleep tonight
La-lullaby (La-lullaby, la-lullaby)

I have to go (Goodbye), I have to go (Lullaby)
I have to go (Goodbye) and leave you alone
But always know (Goodbye), always know (Brown eyes)
Always know (Goodbye) that I love you so
I love you so (Goodbye lullaby)
I love you so, oh (Goodbye)
I love you so (Goodbye brown eyes)
I love you so (Goodbye)
I love you so
I love you so

Goodbye brown eyes
Goodbye my love6Embed
