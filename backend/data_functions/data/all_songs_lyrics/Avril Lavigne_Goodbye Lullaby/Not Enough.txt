Not Enough Lyrics
I'm sorry if this hurts you
But I tried to keep what we had once, I was wrong
It wasn't keeping me awake
You didn't listen (You didn't listen)
You didn't hear me (You didn't hear me)
When I said I want more, I got no more
You weren't stealing me away, oh

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh

All the memories that we're losing
All the time that I spent with you every day
I think it's running down the drain
I'm feeling (Feeling) that we're fading
Don't make this as hard as you'd think it would be
It's a lot easier than it seems, yeah
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up

And I can feel it falling down slowly, slowly
I can see us starting to drown, can't stop it now
I can see it burning out, so show me, show me
How you gonna turn it around, because

It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time to give this up
It's not enough, it's not enough (To give me)
It's not enough, it's not enough  (What it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough (To get me)
For me (Everything I need)
It's not enough, it's not enough (To give me)
It's not enough, it's not enough  (What it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough (To get me)
For me

Hey
Oh, mmm
Mmm
Oh, hmm2Embed
