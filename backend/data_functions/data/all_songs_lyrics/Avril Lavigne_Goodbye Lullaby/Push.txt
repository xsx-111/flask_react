Push Lyrics
Been seeing too much of you lately
And you're starting to get on my nerves
This is exactly what happened last time
And it's not what we deserve
It's a, a waste of my time lately
And I'm runnin' outta words
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see

That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love (Oh-oh-oh)
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

Love, love, love

It's really great to be with you
This is how I could spend my life
But I'm capable of takin' care of myself
So if you fuck this up, then go take a hike
It's a waste of my time shakin'
I'm not going out to search
If it's really meant to be
Then you can find a way to see
That maybe you should just shut up
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love (Oh-oh-oh)
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

You and me, we can both start over
Just the two of us, we can get a little closer
So follow me, honestly
And you will see, yeah

That maybe you should just shut up (Shut up)
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love (Oh-oh-oh)
And you know when push comes to shove
It's gonna take the both of us
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love

Maybe you should just shut up (Shut up)
Even when it gets tough
Baby, 'cause this is love (This is love)
And you know when push comes to shove (Oh)
It's gonna take the both of us (Oh)
Baby, this is love
Baby, this is love
Love, love, love5Embed
