Loser LyricsIf I had a gun for every ace I have drawn
I could arm a town the size of Abilene
Don't you push me baby
Cause I'm all alone and you know I'm only in it for the gold
All that I am asking is for ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold dollars where your love is baby
Before I let my deal go down
Last fair deal in the country
Last fair deal in the town
Put your gold dollars where your love is baby
Before I let my deal go down
Don't you push me baby, cause I'm all alone
And I know a little something you might never know
Don't you touch our liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
I'm gonna wake up in the morning and go
Everybody prayin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the queen of diamonds by the way she shines
Come to papa on an inside straight
Causel I got no chance of losing this time
No I got no chance of losing this time
No I got no chance of losing this timeEmbed
