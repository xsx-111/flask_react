Sick of Goodbyes LyricsIf I could just keep
My stupid mind together
Then my thoughts would cross
The land for you to see
The sun drags locomotives
To the ocean
No one knows this like I do
Seconds click in which I'm
Changed to dust
Withered roots of hair
And knots of rust
I'm wading in the currents
Of the ocean
I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so tired of goodbyes, goodbyes
Goodbyes, goodbyes
Goodbyes
The night comes crawling in
On all fours
Soaking up my dreams
Through the floor
I'm so sick
I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
Goodbyes
Goodbyes
I'm so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so tired of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so sick, so sick of goodbyes, goodbyes
I'm so, I'm so
Goodbyes
Goodbyes
GoodbyesEmbed
