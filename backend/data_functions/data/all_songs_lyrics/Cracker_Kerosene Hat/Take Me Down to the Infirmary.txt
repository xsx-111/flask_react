Take Me Down to the Infirmary LyricsTake me down
To the infirmary
Lay me down
On cotton sheets
Put a damp cloth
On my forehead
Lay me down
And let me sleep
I know the whiskey, it won't soothe my soul
And the morphine won't heal my heart
But if you take me down to the infirmary
I won't have to sleep or drink alone
So, take me down
To the infirmary
Walk a sound that's as blue as her eyes
Oh, sister Magdalene won't you fetch the doctor's flask
He is going to need a steady
A steady hand
I know the whiskey, it won't soothe my soul
And the morphine won't heal my heart
But if you take me down to the infirmary
I won't have to sleep or drink alone
So, take me down
To the infirmary
Lay me down on cotton sheets
Put a damp cloth on my forehead
Lay me down let me sleep
Lay me down let me sleepEmbed
