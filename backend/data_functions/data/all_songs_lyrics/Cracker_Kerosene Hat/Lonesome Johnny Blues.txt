Well, lucky number seven passed me by
Lucky number seven called my name and passed on by
Well he came back don't you know
With his brother six in tow
And that is how number thirteen wound up by my side
And that is how I got these lonesome johnny blues
How I got these lonesome johnny blues
Got the lonesome johnny blues
And there's nothing I can do
'cept sing these sad old weary lonesome johnny blues
Here we go
Grim reaper he pulled up into my drive
Grim reaper pulled his little old chevrolet right up onto the goddamn drive
"johnny, I haven't come for you
But I want someone who's dear to you
And the price you pay is to remain alive"
And I'll stay here with these lonesome johnny blues
Stay here with these lonesome johnny blues
With the lonesome johnny blues
And there's nothing I can do
'cept sing these sad old weary lonesome johnny blues
Woah, no more trouble send him down the road, won't you please
No more trouble won't you beat him up, won't you send him down the road
Trouble dumped out the trash
Ransacked the place for cash
And he wound up taking much more than I own
And he left me with these lonesome johnny blues
Left me with these lonesome johnny blues
With the lonesome johnny blues
And there's nothing I can do
'cept sing these sad old weary lonesome johnny blues
Johnny blues
The sad old weary lonesome johnny blues
Johnny blues
The sad old weary lonesome johnny bluesEmbed
