I Want Everything LyricsI'm standing in your corridor
I wonder what I'm waiting for
The Leaves are drifting out to sea
I'm waiting for you desperately
All things beautiful
All things beautiful
I want everything
I want everything
You call us with your silent seas
You call us in our tiny boats
Gather us up with the storm
And cast us out upon the shore
All things beautiful
All things beautiful
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
You're deep inside this fecund swamp
Or let it be your beating heart
You're deep inside this fecund swamp
You call us in our tiny boats
All things beautiful
All things beautiful
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything
I want everything1Embed
