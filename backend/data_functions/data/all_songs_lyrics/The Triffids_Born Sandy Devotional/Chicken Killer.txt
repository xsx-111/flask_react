Chicken Killer LyricsI knelt I aimed I missed I ran
Across the fIeld where our love began
The ears of the corn began to melt and swim
My 20/20 vision 95% dim
I bowed my head to the weight of the sun
I saw ribs sticking out through my yellow skin
I felt so tail I felt so thin
And the children were singing, "Here he comes the killer again
Here he comes the chickenkiller again"
I was shooting at the birds on the telephone lines
Putting little black holes on the speed limit signs
And tell me where she is I screamed
And tell me where it Is she's been
Well smiling people gathered round
Wearing coloured silk under coloured lights
And paper streamers floated down
Like a skating rink or a boxing tight
And grace descended without a sound
And the children kept singing, "Here he comes the killer again
Here he comes the chickenkiller again"
I ran through that crowd calling out your dear name
To the blind the deaf the dumb the lame
But they shook their heads and pointed to the sky
Saying she's in His hands now my boy
She caught death as only lovers can ever catch can
And the children kept singIng, "Here he comes the killer again
Here he comes the chickenkiller again"
Now the grass is brown and dry beside the track
Broken beer bottle shines like our engagement ring
And as sure as theres a man on the cross on a hill
I'll pay dearly for everthing
Now they stoop and they poke and they prod and they peer
At our prone bodies lying there
Like roosters picking at the body of a hen
And the children were singing, "Here he comes the killer again
Here he comes the chickenkiller again"
My ears were filled with that joyful ringing
My ears were filled with that happy singing
Laughing and pointing and pointing and singing
And the children sang, etc etcEmbed
