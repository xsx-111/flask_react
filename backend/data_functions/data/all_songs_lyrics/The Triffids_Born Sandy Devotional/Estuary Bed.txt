Estuary Bed LyricsThe children are walking back from the beach
Sun on the sidewalk is burning their feet
Washing the salt off under the shower
And just wasting away, wasting away
The hours and hours and hours
Come on, climb over your father's back fence
For the very last time we'll take the shortcut
Across his lawn
Then lie together on the estuary bed
Perfectly still, perfectly warm
Sleep no more
Sleep is dead
Sleep no more on the estuary bed
Ache no more
Old skin is shed
Sleep no more on the estuary bed
I see you still
I know not rest
Silt returns along the passage of flesh
I hear your voice
I taste the salt
I bear the stain, it won't wash off
I hold you not
But I see you still
What use eyesight if it should melt?
What use memory covered in estuary silt?
I know your shape
Our limbs entwined
I know your name, remember mine
Sleep no more
Sleep is dead
Sleep no more on the estuary bed
Ache no more
Old skin is shed
Sleep no more on the estuary bedEmbed
