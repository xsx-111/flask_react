Tender Is the Night (The Long Fidelity) LyricsI knew him as a gentle young man
I cannot say for sure the reasons for his decline
We watched him fade before our very eyes
And years before his time
Surrounded himself with shiny things
First night tickets, ermine, pearls upon a string
And disappeared in all the pestilence
That sudden pleasure brings
He never asks after her anymore
He made a point of losing her address
And every trinket that she ever touched
He keeps locked away
And just burns up in the furnace of his chest
Well I spoke to a man who says he's done it all
And the only thing that pleases or excites him now
Is hurting, hurting then hurting some more
There’s someone I want to forget tonight
Don't you want to forget someone too?
I left him, and I can leave you too
Baby let's go out tonight
It will all turn out all right I’m sure
Don't want to drink at home again tonight
So let's go out
Baby, let's go out tonight
It's getting dark earlier now
But where you are, it's just getting light
Where you are, it will just be getting lightEmbed
