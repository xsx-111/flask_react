Tarrilup Bridge LyricsI packed my bag
Left a note on the fridge
And I drove off the end of the Tarrilup Bridge
Now you read about me in the papers
They say I'm going to be a big star
They're making a movie about my life
And you're going to play the starring part
Now my drinking days are over
Get this through your head:
I was the best friend you ever had
Yes I was your best friend
You were my blinding sun
Now the only thing bright is my name in lights
And the night has only just begun
I packed my bag
Left a note on the fridge
And I drove off the end of the Tarrilup BridgeEmbed
