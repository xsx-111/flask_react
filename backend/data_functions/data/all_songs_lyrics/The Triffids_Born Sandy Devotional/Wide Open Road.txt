Wide Open Road LyricsTwo, three, four...
Well the drums rolled off in my forehead
And the guns went off in my chest
Remember carrying the baby for you
Crying in the wilderness
I lost track of my friends, I lost my kin
I cut them off as limbs
I drove out over the flatland
Hunting down you and him
The sky was big and empty
My chest filled to explode
I yelled my insides out at the sun
At the wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
So how do you think it feels
Sleeping by yourself
When the one you love, the one you love
Is with someone else
Then it's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
And now you can go any place
That you want to go
I wake up in the morning
Thinking I'm still by your side
I reach out just to touch you
Then I realise
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
So how do you think it feels
Sleeping by yourself
When the one you love, the one you love
Is with someone else
I wake up in the morning (It's a wide open road)
Thinking I'm still by your side (It's a wide open road)
I reach out just to touch you (It's a wide open road)
Then I realise
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
It's a wide open road
And now you can go any place
That you want to goEmbed
