Stolen Property LyricsThere's someone standing in the rain
Like they have no place to go
Maybe that someone is you
Maybe someone you don't want to know
There's someone standing in the rain
Like they have no place to go
Maybe that someone is you
Maybe someone you don't aim to know
Maybe lost possessions
Maybe stolen property
You just lie around waiting on a signal from heaven
You never had to heal any deep incisions
Darling
You are not moving any mountains
You are not seeing any visions
You are not freeing any people from prison
Just an aphorism for every occasion
Oh darling, you are not moving any mountains
You are not seeing any visions
You are not freeing any people from prison
Just an aphorism for every occasion
As if the only thing that ever matters
Is your place at the table
You never read the writing on the label
When you drank from the bottle
It said "Keep away from children"
This is stolen property
This is stolen property
Let her run away
Let her run, let her run away
Let her run away
Let her run away
Let her run, let her run away
Let her run away
Let her run away
Let her run, let her run away
Let her run away
Let her run away
Let her run, let her run away
Let her run away
She can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
She can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
She can't hurt you now
Can't hurt you now
She don't belong anymore
Learn the hard way
She don't belong here anymore
She don't belong anymore
Learn this hard way
She don't belong here anymore
Finders keepers, losers weepers
Finders keepers, losers weepers
Finders keepers
This is stolen property
This is stolen property
Reach out in the darkness now she's not there
Reach out it's getting darker now she's not there
Reach out in the darkness now she's not there
Reach out it's getting darker now
She don't belong here anymore, learn the hard way
She don't belong here any more
She don't belong here anymore, learn this the hard way
She don't belong here any more
(Finders keepers) You stumble, sometimes fall
(Losers weepers) Pick yourself up
(Finders keepers) Hold yourself up to the light
(Losers weepers) Pick yourself up
(Finders keepers) Hold yourself up to the light
Duck your head
Watch for the blade
(Finders keepers) Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now
(Losers weepers) This is stolen property
This is stolen property
This is stolen property
This is stolen propertyEmbed
