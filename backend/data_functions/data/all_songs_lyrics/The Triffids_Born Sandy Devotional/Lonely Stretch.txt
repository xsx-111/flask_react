Lonely Stretch LyricsI took a wrong turn off of an unmarked track
I did seven miles I couldn't find my way back
Hit a lonely stretch, must be losing my touch
I was out of my depth
Land was so flat, could well have been ocean
No distinguishing feature in any direction
I took her down inch-by-inch to the floor
And I pointed her nose through a crack in the door
Fingering my sliver St Cristopher
And saving my empty shells for her
When night closed in up around my neck
My high beam dug deep into the black
And a shiver broke out up and down my back
Yes a shiver broke out up and down my back
Well I could have been mistaken
But I swear that I caught something in my headlights
On that cold night, without another living thing in sight
Without another living soul in sight
I sing Sha Ia, sha Ia Ia
I hit a lonely stretch
Oh baby I was wrong I was wrong from the start
You could die out here from a broken heart
We were two wrongs we were married at birth
And together make up one ugly flaming bird
Heck I pumped it and then I moved up into third
Could have sworn you were shining right there on the verge
I never should have let you out of my sight
I never should have let that precious spirit escape
And I sing, to myself, I sing, to myself
I was wrong, wrong from the start
You could die out here from a broken heart
We were two wrongs, we were married at birth
And together make up an ugly flaming bird
Now my memorys shot I've got a bad technique
Could be driving in circles till the end of the week
But my vision is strong, and my vision is true
Look out now! I'll be so good for you!
Well .....
Theres a spot on a map, its just a tiny dot
That's where my sweetie lives, you know that means a lot
I think of her sitting in the afternoon sun
Sitting and drinking and having fun
I took a wrong turn, I took a wrong turn
I hit a lonely stretch
Rock my soul in the bosom of Abraham
Guide me back to the bosom of Abraham
So high can't get over it, so low can't get under it
So wide can't get around it, I took a wrong turn, etcEmbed
