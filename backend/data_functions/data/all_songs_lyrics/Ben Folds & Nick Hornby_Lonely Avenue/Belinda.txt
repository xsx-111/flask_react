Belinda LyricsEvery night around this time
He has to sing 'Belinda'
Belinda, I love you
Don't leave me, I need you
He tried to stop a while back
But what is he without her?
A one hit wonder
With no hits is what he is
And anyway he always hears
How much it means to people
There's a lot of forty somethings
Who wouldn't be in the world without it
So now he does it with this lyric in his head
Belinda, I loved you, I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane
She had big breasts and a nice smile
No kids either
She gave me complimentary champagne
No one ever wants to hear
The song he wrote for Cindy
Cindy, I love you
I need you, don't leave me
And he can't blame them, they can tell
His heart was never in it
And Cindy never liked it
But she never much liked him
Belinda, I loved you, I'm sorry that I left you
I met somebody younger on a plane
She had big breasts and a nice smile
No kids either
She gave me complimentary champagne
So every night about this time
He feels the old self loathing
While the old folks
In the audience sing along
And he smiles and waves the mike at them
So they can do the chorus
But he's not there, he's somewhere else
He's with Belinda
In the days before
He made it all go wrong
Belinda, I love you
She gave me complimentary champagne
She gave me complimentary champagne

Belinda
Belinda, I love you, sorry that I left you
But I met somebody younger on a plane
Belinda, I love you, sorry that I left you
But I met some bitch, younger on a planeEmbed
