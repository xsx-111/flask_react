Password LyricsI know you
You think I don't but I do
I've been listening and I don't forget
So I can do this, I can pass the test
You went to school in Chicago
Your mom's maiden name is Dupree
Your favorite actor is DeNiro
Your birthday's 03/08/83
C-H-I-C-A-G-O
D-U-P-R-E-E
D-E-N-I-R-O
I know you
You think it's weird but it's not
You're all looking at it all upside down
It actually means I really love you
You used have a dog called Montey
You only drink chardonnay
Your sister's pet name is CeeCee
You have a thing for David Blaine
M-O-N-T-E-Y
C-H-A-R-D-O-N-N-A-Y
C-E-E-C-E-E
And I know you
I know you
You think I'm blind but I'm not
I've been watching and what I've noticed
Is distraction and boredom and vacancy
I know your favorite dish
(P-R-I-M-A-V-E-R-A)
I know your favorite band
(Polyphonic S-P-R-E-E)
You spent a year in Barcelona
(B-A-R-C-E-L-O-N-A)
That asshole's name is Anthony
Turns out you never went to T-U-L-S-A
To see your old roommate J-A-N-E
I think my middle name is S-U-C-K-E-R
And I was born yesterday
I don't know you
I thought I did but I don't
I wasn't listening to the right things
One day I won't even remember your faceEmbed
