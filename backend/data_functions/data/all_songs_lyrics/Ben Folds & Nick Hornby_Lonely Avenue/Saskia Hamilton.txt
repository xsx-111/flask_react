Saskia Hamilton LyricsI've only ever seen her
Name on the spine
But that's enough
I wanna make her mine
Never heard her voice
Never seen her smile
But I'm in love with Saskia Hamilton
Well, she's a poet just like I wanna be
But her passport alone is great poetry
And I'm in love with Saskia Hamilton
She's got more assonance
She knows what to do
I'm in love with Saskia Hamilton
She's got two sibilant bilabial plosives
Saskia Hamilton, Saskia Hamilton
Yeah, why
Saskia Hamilton, Saskia Hamilton
Saskia, Saskia, Saskia, Saskia
Already got a girl
But she sounds real bad
I am in love with Saskia Hamilton
She's got alliteration
And her surname is Dagg
Oh, Saskia Hamilton
No heart consonant in my girl Saskia
Every single syllable
Sounds like Shakespeare
I'm in love with Saskia
Gonna live with her
And it will be harmonious
How could it not be
When she's that euphonious
I'm gonna marry her
And it will be idyllic
And my teacher just told me
She's dactylic
Saskia Hamilton, Saskia Hamilton
Yeah, right
Saskia Hamilton, Saskia Hamilton
Saskia, Saskia, Saskia, Saskia
Saskia, Saskia, Saskia
Saskia, Saskia, Saskia Hamilton
