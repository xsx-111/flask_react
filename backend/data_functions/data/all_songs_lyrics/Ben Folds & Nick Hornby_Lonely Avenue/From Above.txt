From Above Lyrics
They even looked at each other once
Across a crowded bar
He was with Martha
She was with Tom
Neither of them really knew what was going on
A strange feeling of never
Heartbeats becoming synchronised
And staying that way forever
Most of the time
It was just near misses
Air kisses, once in a bookstore, once at a party
She came in as he was leaving
And years ago, at the movies she sat behind him
A 6:30 showing of 'While You Were Sleeping'
He never once looked around

It's so easy from above
You can really see it all
People who belong together
Lost, and sad, and small
But there's nothing to be done for them
It doesn't work that way
Sure we all have soulmates
But we walk past them every day
Oh, no
And it's not like they were ever actually unhappy
In the lives they lived
He married Martha
She married Tom
Just this vague notion that something was wrong
An ache, an absence, a phantom limb
An itch that could never be scratched

It's so easy from above
You can really see it all
People who belong together
Lost, and sad, and small
But there's nothing to be done for them
It doesn't work that way
Sure we all have soulmates
But we walk past them every day
Oh, no

Neither of them knew what was going on
A strange feeling of never
Heartbeats becoming synchronised
And staying that way forever
Who knows whether that's how it should be
Maybe our ghosts live in that vacancy
Maybe that's how books get written
Maybe that's why songs get sung
Maybe we are the unlucky ones

It's so easy from above
You can really see it all
People who belong together
Lost, and sad, and small
But there's nothing to be done for them
It doesn't work that way
Sure we all have soulmates
But we walk past them every day
Oh, no

Maybe that's how books get written
Maybe that's why songs get sung
Maybe we are the unlucky ones
Maybe that's how books get written
Maybe that's why songs get sung
Maybe we are the unlucky onesEmbed
