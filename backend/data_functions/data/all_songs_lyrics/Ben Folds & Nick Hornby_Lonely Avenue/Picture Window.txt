Picture Window LyricsWe checked into the hospital, New Year's Eve
Nothing to be done about that
Rainbows, daffodils, she's not naive
Symbolism's all crap
And here's a big picture window in the room on the ward
With a view over Parliament Hill
But the view offers more joy than they can afford
When there's this much pain to kill

You know what hope is, hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside
Got no place in days like these
The dust, the darkness surrenders the color
As the fireworks streak the sky
And their window gives them the prettiest picture
Their useless luck makes her wanna cry
Then it turns midnight, the shitty whole year's spent
Another mom deserves some sparkling wine
And she nearly gives into the moment
But he'll still be sick in two thousand and nine
You know what hope is, hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside
Got no place in days like these
And just as she's thinking of pulling the blind down
A rocket bursts in front of her eyes
The city lit up, London's given a bright crown
She tries and fails to stop spirits rise

You know what hope is, hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside
Got no place in days like these
You know what hope is, hope is a bastard
Hope is a liar, a cheat and a tease
Hope comes near you, kick its backside
Got no place in days like these
In days like theseEmbed
