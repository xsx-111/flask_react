A Working Day LyricsI can do this
Really, I'm good enough
I'm as good as them
But don't take it from me
Ask my friends, ask my sister
They all think my stuff is great
Up there with any of them
I just need a break
I'm a genius, really, I'm excellent
Better than them, I kick their asses
All of them, even that guy
Who thinks he's fuckin' cool
Gets all of the attention
He doesn't sell shit, does he?
Some guy on the net
Thinks I suck
And he should know
He's got his own blog
Some guy on the net
Thinks I suck
And he should know
He's got his own blog
I'm a loser, I'm a poser
Yeah, really, it's over
I mean it and I quit
Everything I write is shit
I'm a loser and a poser
It's over, it's over
I mean it and I quit
Everything I write is shit
Hey, hey
It's a working day
Hey, hey
It's a working day
Hey, hey
It's a working dayEmbed
