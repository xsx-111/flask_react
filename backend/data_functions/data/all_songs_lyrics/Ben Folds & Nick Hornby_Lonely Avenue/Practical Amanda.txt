Practical Amanda LyricsWho'd look at that dump and see a home?
Why not move in somewhere easy?
Urinal's where bedroom's ought to be
Who could be bothered, really?
You're really good at all that stuff
The nuts and bolts of living
Curtains, blinds and kitchen tables
I've got no time for dates and plans
No, I'm too busy dreaming
You're the one with the attention span
You're not the free wheeler
Practical, practical Amanda
Saved one life
And made two others
Practical Amanda
Who'd look at me and see someone
That might be worth redeeming
Head and heart and soul fucked up
Who could be bothered, really?
I've got no time for dates and plans
No, I'm too busy dreaming
You're the one with the attention span
Practical Amanda
Practical, practical Amanda
Saved one life
And made two others
