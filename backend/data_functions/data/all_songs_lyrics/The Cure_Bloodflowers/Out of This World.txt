Out of This World Lyrics
When we look back at it all as I know we will
You and me wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive?

And I know we have to go, I realize
We only get to stay so long
Always have to go back to real lives
Where we belong

Where we belong
Where we belong

When we think back to all this and I'm sure we will
Me and you here and now
Will we forget the way it really is?
Why it feels like this and how?

And we always have to go, I realize
We always have to say goodbye
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are the reason why
We want to live another life
We want to feel another time
Another time
Another time

To feel another time

When we look back at it all as I know we will
You and me wide-eyed
I wonder will we really remember
How it feels to be this alive?

I know we have to go, I realize
We always have to turn away
Always have to go back to real lives
But real lives are why we stay
For another dream, another day
For another world, for another way, for another way

One last time before it's over
One last time before the end
One last time before it's time to go againEmbed
