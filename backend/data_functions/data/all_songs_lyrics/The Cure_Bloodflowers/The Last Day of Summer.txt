The Last Day of Summer Lyrics

Nothing I am, nothing I dream
Nothing is new
Nothing I think or believe in or say
Nothing is true

It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah, it used to be so easy

But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold (So cold, so cold, so cold)
The last day of summer
Never felt so old (So old, so old, so old)


All that I have, all that I hold
All that is wrong
All that I feel for or trust in or love
All that is gone
It used to be so easy
I never even tried
Yeah, it used to be so easy

But the last day of summer
Never felt so cold (So cold, so cold, so cold)
The last day of summer
Never felt so old (So old, so old, so old)

The last day of summer
Never felt so cold (So cold, so cold, so cold)
Never felt so old (So old, so old)Embed
