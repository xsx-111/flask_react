So the fire is almost out
And there's nothing left to burn
I've run right out of thoughts
And I've run right out of words
As I used them up
I used them up
Yea, the fire is almost cold
And there's nothing left to burn
I've run right out of feeling
And I've run right out of world
And everything I promised
And everything I tried
Yea, everything I ever did

I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
But the fire is almost out
Is almost out
And there's nothing left to burn
No there's nothing left to burn
Not even this
And the fire is almost dead
And there's nothing left to burn
I've finished everything, yeah
And all the things I promised
And all the things I tried
Yea, all the things I ever dreamed

I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
But the fire is almost out

Half my life I've been here
Half my life in flames
Using all I ever had
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
But there's nothing left to burn

No, there's nothing left to burn
And the fire is almost out
And the fire is almost out
And the fire is almost out
Almost out, almost out
Almost out, almost out
And there's nothing left to burn2Embed
