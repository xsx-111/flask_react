The Loudest Sound Lyrics
Side by side in silence
They pass away the day
So comfortable, so habitual
And so nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
Nothing left to say
Side by side in silence
His thoughts echo round
He looks up at the sky
She looks down at the ground
She looks down at the ground
She looks down at the ground
Side by side in silence
They wish for different worlds
She dreams him as a boy
And he loves her as a girl
Loves her as a girl
And side by side in silence
Without a single word
It's the loudest sound
It's the loudest sound
It's the loudest sound I ever heardEmbed
