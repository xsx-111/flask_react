Watching Me Fall Lyrics
Yeah, I've been watching me fall for it seems like years
Watching me grow small, I watch me disappear
Slipping on out my ordinary world, out my ordinary eyes
Yeah, slipping out the ordinary me into someone else's life
Into someone else's life

There's a thin, white, cold new moon
And the snow is coming down
And the neon bright Tokyo lights
Flicker through the crowd
I've been drifting around for hours, I'm lost and I'm tired
When a whisper in my ear insatiable breathes
"Why don't you follow me inside?"

Yeah, the room is small, the room is bright
Her hair is black, the bed is white
And the night is always young
Is always young, always young
The night is always young

Yeah, I've been seeing them strip
To the bone in the mirror on the wall
Seeing her swallow him whole
Like it's not me at all
She holds out her hands
And I follow her down to my knees
And the sucking inside insatiable smiles
You will forget yourself in me
Yeah, the room is small, the room is bright
Her hair is black, the bed is white
And the night is always young
Is always young, always young
The night is always young

And the night is always young
And the night is never over and over
And over and over and over
And then it's gone
And then it's gone
And then it's gone

Yeah, it's a cruel, mean, cold new day
And outside the snow is still coming down
And in the blood red Tokyo bed
I watch me coming 'round
She pulled him down for hours
Deeper than I've ever been
And as I fall in the mirror on the wall

I'm watching me scream
I'm watching me scream
I'm watching me scream
I'm watching me scream
Yeah, I've been watching me go for it must be years
Watching me get slow, I watch me disappear
And one day, yeah, I know, I won't come back at all
And always over and over in his ordinary eyes

I'm watching me fall
I'm watching me fall
I'm watching me fall
I'm watching me fall2Embed
