Bloodflowers Lyrics
"This dream never ends", you said
"This feeling never goes
The time will never come to slip away
This wave never breaks", you said
"This sun never sets again
These flowers will never fade

"This world never stops", you said
"This wonder never leaves
The time will never come to say, "Goodbye"
This tide never turns", you said
"This night never falls again
These flowers will never die"

"Never die, never die
These flowers will never die, never die"

"This dream always ends", I said
"This feeling always goes
The time always comes to slip away
This wave always breaks", I said
"This sun always sets again
And these flowers will always fade
This world always stops", I said
"This wonder always leaves
The time always comes to say, "Goodbye"
This tide always turns", I said
"This night always falls again
And these flowers will always die"

"Always die, always die
These flowers will always die"

Between you and me it's hard to ever really know
Who to trust? How to think? What to believe?
Between me and you it's hard to ever really know
Who to choose? How to feel? What to do?
Never fade, never die
You give me flowers of love
Always fade, always die
I let fall flowers of blood2Embed
