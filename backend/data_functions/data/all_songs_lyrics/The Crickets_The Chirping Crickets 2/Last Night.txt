Last Night LyricsLast night as I watched the stars from my window
I pray Lord above to guide and protect you
Though I'm not wanted now - I still love you somehow
That is my only prayer - for you
Last night as I gazed through the mist in my eyes
I wanted you here to hold you so near
But silence tells me - you didn't hear my plea
I miss you so much since you left me
My heart ached apart since you left me
Though I'm not wanted now - I still love you somehow
That is my only prayer - for youEmbed
