Maybe Baby LyricsMaybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
It's funny, honey; you don't care
You never listen to my prayer
Maybe, baby, you will love me someday
Well, you are the one that makes me glad
And the other one that makes me sad
When someday you want me
I'll be there; wait and see
Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
Well, you are the one that makes me glad
And the other one that makes me sad
When someday you want me
I'll be there; wait and see
Maybe, baby, I'll have you
Maybe, baby, you'll be true
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for me
Maybe, baby, I'll have you for meEmbed
