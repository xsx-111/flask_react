Not Fade Away LyricsI'm a-gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You gonna give your love to me
I wanna love you night and day
You know my love will not fade away
Well, you know my love not fade away
My love is bigger than a Cadillac
I try to show it and you drive-a me back
Your love for me got to be real
For you to know-a just how I feel
A love for real not fade away
I'm a-gonna tell you how it's gonna be
You're gonna give your love to me
A love to last-a more than one day
A love is love and not fade away
A love is love and not fade awayEmbed
