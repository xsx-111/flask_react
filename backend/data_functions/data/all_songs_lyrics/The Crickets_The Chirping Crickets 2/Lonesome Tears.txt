Lonesome Tears Lyrics
Lonesome tears, sad and blue
I shed lonesome tears for you
Yes, you know I know I cried
When you said goodbye

When you left and said, "I'm gone"
Lonesome tears fell all night long
Yes, you know I know I cried
When you said goodbye

You left me here all alone
Hear me talkin', won"t you come back home?
Love me like you did before
Now, need I tell you more?

Lonesome tears, sad and blue
I've shed lonesome tears for you
Yes, you know I know I cried
When you said goodbye

You left me here all alone
Hear me talkin', won"t you come back home?
Love me like you did before
Now, need I tell you more?

Lonesome tears, sad and blue
I've shed lonesome tears for you
Yes, you know I know I cried
When you said goodbyeEmbed
