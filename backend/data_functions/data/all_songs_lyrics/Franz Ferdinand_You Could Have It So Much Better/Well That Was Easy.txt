Well That Was Easy Lyrics
Well, that was easy waiting, everything's easy now
Oh, and the days are oh so normal
But oh, Hannah, how I miss you
Oh, Hannah, how I miss you
Oh, Hannah, how I miss you now

Now-now-now-now, now
Now-now-now
Oh, now-now-now-now
Now-now-now, now-now-now-now
Now, now-now-now-now, now
Oh, now-now-now-now
Now-now-now, now-now-now-now

I used to lock myself in your bathroom
Swallowing the codeine kept for your back
Numb, so numb
I'd let your words come and come
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

So come, come on, come
Come on, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
'Cause I'm leaving you now
That was easy, how I miss you
Oh, that was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, how I miss you now

Now-now-now-now, now
Now-now-now-now
Now-now-now, now-now-now-now
Now, now-now-now-now, now
Now-now-now-now, now

I watched you clean the filth off your phone dial
Swallowing the things your finger picked up
Tongue, your tongue
I watched your tongue licking on
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

So come, come on, tongue
Come on, kill me now
Kill me now, kill me now
Because I'm leaving you now
That was easy, but how I miss you
Oh, that was easy, but how I miss you
Oh, that was easy, but how I miss you now
That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but how I miss you now
That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but I miss you
That was easy, but I miss you now2Embed
