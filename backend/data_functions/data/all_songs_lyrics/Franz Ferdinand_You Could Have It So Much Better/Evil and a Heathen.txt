Evil and a Heathen Lyrics
Words fall from our mouths
Like plates from shaking hands
Smash upon the silence
Of the smooth naked canal

Well, I'm evil and a heathen
I'm evil and a heathen
Well, I'm a heathen and evil like you
There's not a lot, not a lot I couldn't do, woo

Well, I like how you pretend
That the end will be the end
So fill up first, then drink a curse
To the death of death instead

Well, I'm evil and a heathen
I'm evil and a heathen
Well, I'm a heathen and evil like you
There's not a lot, not a lot I couldn't do

Utrecht led me to the Sacre Coeur
Where the smoke curled 'round
Now the ice blows off Lake Michigan
When the ice blows, the ice flow knocks you down
Oh, the ice flow knocks you down
Oh, the ice flow knocks you down
Mmm, the ice flow knocks you down
Yeah, the ice flow knocks you down
Your teeth are black with wine
As you place those lips on mine
The moon hangs heavy and forbidden high
On the night of our lives

Well, I'm evil and a heathen
I'm evil and a heathen
Well, I'm a heathen and evil like you
There's not a lot, not a lot I couldn't do, oh

I'm evil like you, oh
I'm evil like you, woo
I'm evil like you
Oh, I'm evil like you1Embed
