What You Meant Lyrics
As I took step number four
Into the close of your tenement
You cast your darkened eyes so low
Said we're cold as the step cement

But I just don't know
Oh, what you meant
What you meant

So Alec, you may want a pill
We are so cruel, and to communicate
Without the red stuff being spilled
We must MDMA our sentiment

Oh, but I just don't know
Oh, what you meant
What you meant
What you meant

If we were feckless, we'd be fine
Sucking hard on our innocence
But we've been bright in our decline
Been left as blackened filament
But I just don't know, oh
Oh, I don't know
No, I don't know
No, I don't know (What did you mean?)
No, I don't know (What did you mean?)
No, I don't know (What did you mean?)
No, I don't know

I've got to get away from
I've got to get away from you

But I feel blood inside the vein
I feel life inside the ligament
I feel alive, yeah, just the same
Same vigour and the same intent

Oh, but I just don't know
Oh, if that's what you meant1Embed
