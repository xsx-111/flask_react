You Could Have It So Much Better Lyrics
The last message you sent said I looked really down
That I ought to come over and talk about it
Well, I wasn't down
I just wasn't smiling at you, yeah
As I look at you now, it seems
That you're slapping my back as if it's alright
But it's not
I'm trying to get up
But you're pushing me down
Oh yeah, you're pushing me down

So I'll get up on my own
Oh, I'll get up on my own
Get up on my own
Oh, I'll get up on my own
Yeah, I'll get up on my own
Get up on my own
Oh, I'll get up on my own
Get up on my own, yeah

Now there's some grinning goon on my TV screen
Telling us all that it's alright because
She wears this and he said that
And if you get some of these, it'll all be alright
Yeah, if you get some of these, it'll all be alright, yeah
Well, I refuse to be a cynical goon
Passing the masses an easy answer
'Cause it won't be alright
Oh no, it won't be alright
Oh no, it won't be alright
It won't be alright
Unless you get up, get up
Come on and get up, get up
Why don't you get up, get up?
Come on, get up, get up
So come on, get up, get up
Come on, get up, get up
Why don't you get up, get up?
Jump, get up, get up, yeah

Uh-huh
Yeah
Alright

Well, I'm just a voice in your earpiece
Telling you no, it's not alright
You know you could have it so much better
Oh, you could have it so much better
If you tried, if you tried
If you tried, if you tried, woo

So get up on your own
If you got up on your own
Get up on your own
If you got up on your own
Get up on your own
So, come on, up on your own
Get up on your own
Said, get up on your own, yeah
Get up, get up, come on
Get up, get up, that's right
Get up, get up, come on and
Get up, get up, come on
Get up, get up, yeah
Get up, get up, come on and
Get up, get up, go on
Get up, get up, yeah3Embed
