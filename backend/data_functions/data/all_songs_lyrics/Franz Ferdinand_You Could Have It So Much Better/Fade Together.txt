Fade Together Lyrics
So far away
Come on, I'll take you far away
Let's get away
Come on, let's make a getaway
Once you have loved someone this much
You doubt it could fade
Despite how much you'd like it to
God, how you'd like it, you'd like it to fade

Let's fade together, let's fade forever
Let's fade together, let's fade forever
Let's fade together

If we get away
You know, we might just stay away
So stay awake
Oh, why the hell should I stay awake?
When you're far away
Oh God, you are so far away
I looked at your wall
Saw that old passport photograph
I look like I've just jumped the Berlin Wall
Berlin, I love you, I'm starting to fade
Let's fade together, let's fade forever
Let's fade together, let's fade forever
Let's fade together, let's fade forever
Let's fade together1Embed
