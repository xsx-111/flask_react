Do You Want To Lyrics
Oh, when I woke up tonight, I said I’m
Going to make somebody love me
I’m going to make somebody love me
And now I know, now I know, now I know
I know that it’s you
You’re lucky, lucky, you’re so lucky

Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do-do

Well, do you, do you, do you want to?
Well, do you, do you, do you want to, want to go
Where I’d never let you before?
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Well, do you, do you, do you want to?
Well, do you, do you, do you want to, want to go
Of what I’d never let you before?
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do

Well, he’s a friend and he’s so proud of you
He’s a friend and I knew him before you, oh yeah
(Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do)
Well, he’s a friend and we’re so proud of you
Your famous friend, well, I blew him before you, oh yeah
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do

Well, do you, do you, do you want to?
Well, do you, do you, do you want to, want to go
Where I’d never let you before?
(Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do)

Well, here we are at the Transmission party
I love your friends, they’re all so arty, oh yeah

Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do

Oh, when I woke up tonight, I said I’m
Gonna make somebody love me
I’m gonna make somebody love me
And now I know, now I know, now I know
I know that it’s you
You’re lucky, lucky, you’re so lucky
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do-do
Do-do, do, do-do-do-do

Well, do you, do you, do you want to?
Well, do you, do you, do you want to, want to go
Of what I’d never let you before?
