Walk Away Lyrics
I swapped my innocence for pride
Crushed the end within my stride
Said I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver
I love the sound of you walking away
You walking away
Mascara bleeds a blackened tear, oh

And I am cold, yes, I'm cold
But not as cold as you are
I love the sound of you walking away
You walking away
I love the sound of you walking away
Walking away, hey, hey

Why don’t you walk away?
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don't you walk away?

No buildings will fall down
Don't you walk away
No quake will split the ground
Won't you walk away?
The sun won't swallow the sky
Won't you walk away?
Statues will not cry
Don't you walk away
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don’t you walk away?
Why don’t you walk away? Hey
I cannot stand to see those eyes
As apologies may rise
I must be strong, stay an unbeliever
And love the sound of you walking away
You walking away
Mascara bleeds into my eye, oh

And I’m not cold, I am old
At least as old as you are
La, la, la, la, la, la-la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la, la-la, la

And as you walk away
Oh, as you walk away
And as you walk away

My headstone crumbles down
As you walk away
The Hollywood wind's a howl
As you walk away
The Kremlin's falling
As you walk away
Radio 4 is static
As you walk away
Oh, as you walk away
Oh, as you walk away
Oh, as you walk away, hey
The stab of stiletto
On a silent night
Stalin smiles and Hitler laughs
Churchill claps Mao Tse-Tung on the back3Embed
