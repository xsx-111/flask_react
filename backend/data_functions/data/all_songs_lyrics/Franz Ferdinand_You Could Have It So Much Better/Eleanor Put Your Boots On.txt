Eleanor Put Your Boots On Lyrics
Eleanor, put those boots back on
Kick the heels into the Brooklyn dirt
I know it isn't dignified to run
But if you run, you can run to the Coney Island roller coaster
Ride to the highest point and leap across the filthy water
Leap until the Gulf Stream's brought you down
Mm-hmm

I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land

So, Eleanor, take a Greenpoint three-point turn
Towards the hidden sun
You know you are so elegant when you run
Oh, if you run, you can run to that statue with the dictionary
Climb to her fingernail and leap, yeah, take an atmospheric leap
And let the jet stream set you down
Mm-hmm

I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
I could be there when you land
So, Eleanor, put those boots back on
Put the boots back on and run and run
Come on over here
Come on over here
Come on over here2Embed
