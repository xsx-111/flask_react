Outsiders LyricsThere's been some change, but we're still outsiders
If everybody's here, then hell knows we ride alone
Oh, oh
I've seen some years, but you're still my Caesar
With everything I feel, I feel you've already been here
Oh, oh
The only difference is all I see
Is now all that I've seen
It's bright on the outside
The bright love, the dark side, I know
It's obvious, but sometimes
You just have to say it so
You don't feel so weak
About being such a freak or alone
In seventeen years, will you still be my Camille
Lee Miller, Gala or whatever? You know what I mean, yeah
Oh, oh
Love'll die and lovers fade, but you still remain there
Squeezing in your fingers what it means for me to be, yeah
Oh, oh
The only difference is what might be
Is now what might have been
When you saw me sleeping
You thought I was dreaming of you
No, I didn't tell you
That the only dream is Valium for me
I've seen some years, but you're still my Caesar
With everything I feel, I feel you've already been here
Oh, oh
Love'll die and lovers fade, but you still remain here
Squeezing in your fingers what it means for me to be, yeah
Oh, oh
The only difference is what might be
Is now
Fall asleep, fall asleep1Embed
