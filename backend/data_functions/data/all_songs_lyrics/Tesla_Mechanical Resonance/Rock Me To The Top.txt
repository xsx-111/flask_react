Rock Me To The Top LyricsHere I stand, are you ready?
To take me in and rock me steady
Feel the power, feel the heat
Put yourself in the driver's seat
You're in the air
I feel you surround me
I'll do anything
That you want me to, come on
Rock me, rock me (rock)
Rock me to the top, to the top, baby
Rock me, rock me (rock)
Don't ever stop, no
I'll take command, take control
Now I see you comin' back for more
I see you like it, but you don't need it
Ooh you wanna feel it
I'm in the air
Feel me surround you
I'll do anything
That I want you to, come on
Rock me, rock me (rock)
Rock me to the top, to the top, baby
Rock me, rock me (rock)
Don't ever stop
Oh, rock me, rock me (rock)
Rock me to the top, straight to the top, to the top
Rock me, rock me (rock)
Oh baby don't ever stop, no
(rock) I wanna feel your love, yeah
Wanna feel your love (rock)
I wanna feel your love
Tonight, L-U-V love, owEmbed
