Cover Queen LyricsLooks so good from her head to feet
Body english talking to me so, so sweet
Got a perfect tan, there ain't no doubt
She's the kind of girl you dream about
You know she's got it, she's got everything
She knows you want it, oh but you'll never get a thing
Ooh what you're doin', baby what she's doin' to me
I'm head over heels for a cover queen
Dressed to kill, this ain't no game
Takin' care of business, leads a life of fame
And everywhere she goes, she's the talk, she's the talk of the town
She keeps it clean, but still gets around
You know she's got it, she's got everything
She knows you want it, oh but you'll never get a thing
Ooh what you're doin', ooh what she's doin' to me
I'm head over heels for a cover queen
Ooh, head over heels for the cover queen, oh
Hey there cover queen, you know the time will come
Where you're no longer be the one
'Cause a brand new smile, ooh and a brand new face
Will come along to take your place
You know she's got it, now she's got everything
You know you want it, oh but you'll never get a thing
Ooh what you're doin', baby what she's doin' to me
I'm head over heels, head over heels, for that cover queen
Oh every time I look at you
All I wanna do is get next to you
I see your face in every magazine
The best lookin' bitch that I've ever seen
I'm in loveEmbed
