Little Suzi LyricsOw
Little Suzi's on the up, looking for a getaway
Ruby tries to bring her down, still looking for another way
Little Suzi's on the up, heading for the spotlight
Ruby finally gets up, looking for some quiet nights
And the music makes her feel so hot
Ooh, and she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true
Little Suzi's on the up
Little Suzi's on the up, now suddenly it's not a game
Ruby's got to give up 'cause Suzi's plenty set on fame
Little Suzi's on the up, casting couch appointments made
Ruby's gonna hang around to make sure Suzi's okay
And the music makes her feel so hot
And she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true
Don't bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true
Little Suzi's on the up
Oh, and the music makes her feel so hot
Oh, and she'll smile for the camera with all she's got
Oh, don't you bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far if her dreams come true
Woah, don't you bring her down, she's a lot like you
She'll be richer by far when her dreams come true
Little Suzi's on the up
Oh, yes she is
Ow
Now she's on the up
Little Suzi's on the up
Heading for the spotlight
Oh, Little Suzi
Oh, and the music makes her feel so hot
Go, Little Suzi, yeah
Uh huh
Yeah yeah, oh yeahEmbed
