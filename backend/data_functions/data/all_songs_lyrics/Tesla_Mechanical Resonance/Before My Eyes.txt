Before My Eyes LyricsShe comes on softly
As she moves across the room before me
I can't resist, I'm hypnotized
I'm surrounded by her
I can't, I can't forget that face
And I will, I will go back to that place
She stands before my eyes
Right before my eyes
I can see the colors
Are coming one after another for me
I hear the words, feel the sound
Going 'round in my head
But I know there's something out there
Please tell me, this is reality
Right before my eyes
Right before my eyes
She comes on softly
As she moves across the room before me
I can't resist, I'm hypnotized
I can see the colors
Are coming one after another for me
I see an image of myself
Before my eyes
Right before my eyes
Before my eyes
Before my eyesEmbed
