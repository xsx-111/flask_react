2 Late 4 Love LyricsOne, two, three, four
I can't believe this fucked up world in which we're livin' in
Still I do the best that I can
Always got me on the lookout for a getaway
Runnin' hard, I'm a rock 'n' roll man
I know we can make it a go
Said that all you gotta do is try
Tellin' you all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll
2 late 4 love, baby it's too late
2 late 4 love, girl I gotta say
That it's you, I know, that makes me feel this way
Don't you know that it's 2 late 4 love
Foolish hearts getting caught up in a lover's game
That's the way some want it to be
Now all I need is someone, just to get me through the night
Any more is too much for me
I know we can make it a go
Said that all you gotta do is try
Tellin' you all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll
2 late 4 love, baby it's too late
2 late 4 love, girl I gotta say
That it's you, I know, that makes me feel this way
Don't you know that it's 2 late 4 love
Oh baby, it's 2 late
2 late 4 love
2 late
Oh yeah
2 late 4 love, oh baby, baby
2 late 4 love
2 late 4 love, oh
2 late 4 love
'Cause all I need is someone standing by my side
I don't care if I have to see you cry
You oughta know that it's
It's 2 late 4 loveEmbed
