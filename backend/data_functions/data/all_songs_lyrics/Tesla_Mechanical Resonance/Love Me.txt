Love Me LyricsOw
It's day, feelin' high
What's the chances for you and I
I got love on my mind
Lovin's on my mind
Now take me, lay me down
Show me what you're all about
If you got the time
I wanna make you mine
'Cause you've got everything I want
Baby, you're all I need
Won't you gimme your love
Give it all to me
You've got to love me, c'mon baby, love me
Or set me free, oh woman, set me free
You got to love me, c'mon baby, love me
Or let me be, oh woman, let me be
I got this feeling that I just can't help
Want you baby all to myself
Do you got the time?
I wanna make you mine
I'll be your only one, only love
Come on baby, give it to me, yeah
Oh, give it to me
'Cause you are everything I want
Baby, you're all I need
Won't you gimme your love
Give it all to me
You've got to love me, c'mon baby, love me
Or set me free, oh woman, set me free
You've got to love me, c'mon baby, love me
Or let me be, oh woman, let me be
Time was waitin' for me going out with you
'Cause I make her swear, she couldn't think I'd wanted to
You gotta give me some kind of a sign
Girl, let me know if you're gonna be all mine
Come on, come on, come on
Baby, give it to me
Oh, you are everything I want
Baby you're all I need
Won't you gimme your love
Give it all to me
Come on, give it all, give it all, give it all
You've got to love me, come on, love me
Or set me free, oh woman, set me free
You got to love me, c'mon baby, love me
Or set me free, oh woman, set me free
Love me, love me, oh baby, I need your lovin'
You got to love me, c'mon baby, love me
You gotta gimme, gotta gimme, gotta gimme everything I need
Love meEmbed
