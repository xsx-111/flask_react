EZ Come EZ Go LyricsYou had it right in the palm of your hand
Right before your eyes
Now it's gone and you don't understand
You've got to realize
There comes a time when you've got to let things
Go as fast as they come
Wait and see what tomorrow may bring you
Get it all while you can
Sometimes it just feels so right
And other times so wrong
Every new day it brings on the night
The change goes on and on and on and on
It never stops, no it keeps on rollin'
Wiped away like an (arch of) sand
Here it comes, there it goes
Always changin' hands
Ez come ez go, ez come ez go
That's what they call it
Ez come ez go, ez come ez go
Oh no
Ez come ez go, ez come ez go
Oh, you know that's what they call it
Ez come ez go, ez come ez go
Oh whoa
Hard to let go when it took so long to get
It's time to let it goEmbed
