Changes LyricsChanges
Time's making changes in my life
Rearranging
Can't seem to stop the hands of time
I remember, I was so young
I was much too young to see
Now I'm older, growing older
And I see things differently
Oh, can't you see
It's changing you and me
Time's makin' changes
Time's makin' changes in my life
Time's rearranging
Changing you and me
Faces
Strange faces cloud my mind
Empty traces
Make it hard for me to find
Somewhere in the distance
Is there someone who awaits?
For that moment I am taken
Over by the hands of fate
Can't you see?
The world is changing me
Time's makin' changes
Time's makin' changes in my life
Time's rearranging
Changing you and me, yeah yeah
Nothing ever stays the same
It's always gonna change
I'm on my way
Yeah yeah
Changes
Time's makin' changes in my life
Rearranging, always changing
Can't seem to stop the hands of time
Can't you see?
It's changing everything
Time's makin' changes
Time's makin' changes in my life
Time's rearranging
Changing you and me, yeah yeah
All these changesEmbed
