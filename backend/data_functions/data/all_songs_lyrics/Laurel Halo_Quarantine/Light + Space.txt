Light + Space Lyrics
Rules stagnate, mountains fall
The hive mind, major mine
Minor kind
Tight figures falling, stare at my bed
Feel nothing
Once you realize you're my dream
You go and scale walls, idly

Words are just words
Words are just words that you soon forget
Machine stains
Machine stains and empty silhouettes

Beautiful world only to the moon
Tight figures falling, stare at my bed
Feel nothing
Once you realize it's a dream
You go and scale walls, idly

Words are just words
Words are just words that you soon forget
Machine stains
Machine stains and empty silhouettes
Words are just words
Words are just words that you soon forget
Machine stains
Machine stains and empty silhouettes1Embed
