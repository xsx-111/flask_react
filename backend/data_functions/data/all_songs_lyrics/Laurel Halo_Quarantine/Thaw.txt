Thaw Lyrics
Is it raining, is it pouring?
Love is falling out of my eye
This road goes down to the water
This blackest night I saw you cry

Don't get addicted to anything
Just keep on walking
One foot in front of the other
Forward motion's the only answer

Did you go down into town?
Was it busy, was it crowded?
They will come and fuck alone
This blackest night I saw you cry

Don't get addicted to anything
Just keep on walking
One foot in front of the other
Forward motion's the only answerEmbed
