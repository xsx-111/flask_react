Tumor Lyrics
Caught behind a wall of tears
Distorted liquid image of you
The signal keeps cutting out but one thing is clear
Nothing grows in my heart, there is no one here

Caught behind a wall of tears
Distorted liquid image of you
The signal keeps cutting out but one thing is clear
Nothing grows in my heart, there is no one here

You are my target cause I aim for the one
So I have to forget about the clock hands you run

Caught behind a wall of tears
Distorted liquid image of you
The signal keeps cutting out but one thing is clear
(So I have to forget about the loneliness in my heart)
Nothing grows in my heart, there is no one here

You are my target cause I aim for the one
So I have to forget about the clock hands you run
(Caught behind a wall of tears, distorted liquid image of you)
You are my target cause I aim for the one
(The signal keeps cutting out but one thing is clear)
So I have to forget about the clock hands you run
(Nothing grows in my heart, there is no one here)Embed
