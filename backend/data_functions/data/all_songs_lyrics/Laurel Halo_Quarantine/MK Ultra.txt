MK Ultra Lyrics
Mean world syndrome
Of absolute zero
Idle, archaic, indifferent
Oh, what if you care?

Hurricane's always coming
So take cover or run

Spiraling into silence
You'll always belong
You'll make love to cold bodies
Fresh after they're gone

Hurricane's always coming
So take cover or run

Hanging on to obsession
I can never let go

Hurricane's always coming
So take cover or run
Hanging on to obsession
I can never let go2Embed
