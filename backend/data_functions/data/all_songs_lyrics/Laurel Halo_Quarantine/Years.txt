Years Lyrics
I will never see you again
You're mad cause I will not leave you alone
Making eye contact
You're mad cause I will not leave you alone
Many years before
(I will never see you again)
I know your skin like my own

Making eye contact
I will never see you again
I will never see again
You're mad cause I will not leave you alone
Many years before

Making eye contact
I will never see you again
Though I've lived here many years before
I know your skin like my own
Many years before
(I will not leave you alone)

Making eye contact
I will never see you againEmbed
