Used To Feel Before Lyrics
It seems that there is something
Something I should know
But I don't want to ask you
Ask you what I'm supposed to do
You say that I don't treat you
The way I used to do before
That I am only running away
Every time when you want me to stay

I wanna love you like the sailor loves the sea
I really want to, but please let me be
And I got so much things on my mind
And you know that I can't waste any time
Well, I wanna make you feel
Something that you used to feel before
Ah, before...

I know we've got our problems
But fighting don't make any sense
And I don't think that I'm so bad
That you should be so, so sad
I wanna love you like the sailor loves the sea
I really want to, but please let me be
And I got so much things on my mind
And you know that I can't waste any time
Well, I wanna make you feel
Something that you used to feel before
Ah, before...


I wanna love you like the sailor loves the sea
I really want to, but please let me be
And I got so much things on my mind
And you know that I can't waste any time
Well, I wanna make you feel
Something that you used to feel before
Ah, before...

Yeah, you used to feel before
Something that you used to feel beforeEmbed
