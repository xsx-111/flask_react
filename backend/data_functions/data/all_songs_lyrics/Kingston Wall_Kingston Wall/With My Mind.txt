With My Mind Lyrics
Where is the witch doctor who drags me from this fear
What will I tell him so I make myself clear, hey
I've got this bad taste in my mouth and in my soul
I try to taste it just to know what's going on, hey

Some kind of tribulation strangles my mind
It makes me wonder do I have much more time
Manic depressions or just having too much time
With my mind

I keep on scratching but the itching won't go
My legs turn red but I will have to go on, hey
And when I come home I find you shining like the sun
I rest my weary head but you wanna have fun, hey

Some kind of tribulation strangles my mind
It makes me wonder do I have much more time
Manic depressions or just having too much time
With my mind

Manic depressions or just having too much time
With my mindEmbed
