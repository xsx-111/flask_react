Nepal Lyrics
I don't know but I've been told
That you are the only soul
Don't you know it hurts me so
Hurts me so to see you go...

I don't want a second time
And I don't sing "I'm in mine"
All the time I was wrong
And all the time I was alone...


I don't want a second time
And I don't sing "I'm in mine"
All the time I was wrong
And all the time I was alone...Embed
