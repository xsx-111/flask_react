Fire Lyrics
You don't care for me, I don't care about that
Gotta new fool and I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

Let me stand next to your fire – You gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – You gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – Hey, you gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire

You say your mama ain't home, you can let me in
But I have to get going, don't need you again
I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

Let me stand next to your fire – You gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – You gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – Yeah, you gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – Next to your fire

Yeah, you try to gimme your money, better save it now
Save it for your rainy day
'Cause I have only one burning desire
Let me stand next to your fire

Let me stand next to your fire – You gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – You gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire – Yeah, you gotta let me stand
Let me stand next to your fire


Yeah, I have only one burning desire
Next to your fireEmbed
