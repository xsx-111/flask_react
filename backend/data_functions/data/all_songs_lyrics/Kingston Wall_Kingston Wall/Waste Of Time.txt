Waste Of Time Lyrics
You don't have to worry
About what you've done
And you don't have to be sorry
Just live for today
Your friends are disappearing
And you feel so disconnected
But there's no use for crying
Just live for today

And it's just a waste of time
If you don't know what's on your mind
And it won't be better
No matter how you try

There will be a morning
And your fears will be gone
When you wake up laughing
You'll have another day

And it's just a waste of time
If you don't know what's on your mind
And it won't be better
No matter how you try

It's just a waste of time, it's just a waste of time, it's just a waste of
Time, it's just a waste of time, it's just a waste of time...


And it's just a waste of time
If you don't know what's on your mind
And it won't be better
No matter how you tryEmbed
