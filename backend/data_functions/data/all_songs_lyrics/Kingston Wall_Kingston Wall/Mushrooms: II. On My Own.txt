Mushrooms: II. On My Own Lyrics
What's the difference
Between you and me
That makes it so hard
To live together in the same flat
And what's the use
For fighting
You've got nothing to fight for
And you're, oh you're only wasting your time
Wasting your time

I wanna be...
I wanna be on my own

Where have you been
And what were you doing
All these stupid questions
Before, oh before I go to bed alone
How 'bout tomorrow
Where you gonna be
All these stupid questions
Before, before I go to bed alone
To bed alone
I wanna be...
I wanna be on my own
I wanna be...
I wanna be on my own


I wanna be...
I wanna be on my own
I wanna be...
I wanna be on my ownEmbed
