Little Girl Blue LyricsWhen you were very young, the world was younger than you
As merry as a carousel
The circus tent was strung with ever star in the sky
Above the ring you loved so well
Now the young world has grown old
Gone are the silver and gold
Sit there and count your fingers
What can you do?
Old girl, you're through
Just sit there and count your little fingers
Unhappy little girl blue
Sit there and count the raindrops
Falling on you
It's time you knew
All you can count on are the raindrops
That fall on little girl blue
No use, old girl, you might as well surrender
Your hopes are getting slender
Why won't somebody send a tender
Blue boy to cheer up little girl blueEmbed
