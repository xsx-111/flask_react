Violets For Your Furs LyricsIt was winter in Manhattan, falling snow flakes filled the air
The streets were covered with a film of ice
But a little simple magic that I heard about somewhere
Changed the weather all around, just within a trice
I bought you violets for your furs
And it was spring for a while, remember?
I bought you violets for your furs
And there was April in that December
The snow drifted down on the flowers
And it melted where it lay
The snow looked like dew on the blossoms
As on a summer day
I bought you violets for your furs
And there was blue in the wintry sky
Then you pinned the violets to your furs
And gave a lift to the crowds passing by
You smiled at me so sweetly
Since then one thought occurs
That we fell in love completely
The day that I bought you violets for your fursEmbed
