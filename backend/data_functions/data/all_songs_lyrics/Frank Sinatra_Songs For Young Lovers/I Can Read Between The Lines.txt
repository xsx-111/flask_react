I Can Read Between The Lines LyricsYou don't laugh anymore, when we're alone
You don't talk quite as long, when we're on the phone
You say that you, still love me so
But I can read between the lines
You don't hear half the things, that I say to you
You don't hold me as close, as you used to do
You say that you, won't let me go
But I can read between the lines
Your love for me is over
It isn't hard to tell
In every single thing you do
You say it all too well
And the glow in your eyes, is there no more
When you speak of the plans, that you have in store
It's time my dear, that I let you know
That I can read between the linesEmbed
