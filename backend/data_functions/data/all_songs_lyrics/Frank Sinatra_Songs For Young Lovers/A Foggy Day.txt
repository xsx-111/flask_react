A Foggy Day LyricsI was a stranger in the city
Out of town, were the people I knew
I had that feeling of self-pity
What to do, what to do, what to do?
The outlook was decidedly blue
But as I walked through the dreary streets alone
It turned out to be the luckiest day I've known
A foggy day in London town
Had me low and it had me down
I viewed the morning with much alarm
The British museum had lost it's charm
How long I wondered, could this thing last
But the age of miracles, it hadn't passed
For suddenly, I saw you standing right there
And in foggy London town
The sun was shining, shining, shining, shining, shining everywhere
How long, I wondered, could this thing possibly last?
But the age of miracles, it hadn't passed
For suddenly, I saw you right there
And in foggy London Town
The sun was shining everywhereEmbed
