The Girl Next Door LyricsThe moment I saw her face
I knew she was just my style
My only regret is we've never met
For I dream of her all the while
But she doesn't know I exist
No matter how much I persist
So it's clear to see there's no hope for me
Though I live at 5135 Kensington Avenue
And she lives at 5133
How can I ignore the girl next door
I love her more than I can say
Doesn't try to please me, doesn't even tease me
And she never sees me glance her way
And I thought I'm heartsore, the girl next door
Affection for me won't display
I just adore her, so I can't ignore her
The girl next doorEmbed
