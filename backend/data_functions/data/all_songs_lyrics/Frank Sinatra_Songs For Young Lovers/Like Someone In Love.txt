Like Someone In Love LyricsLately, I find myself gazing at stars
Hearing guitars, like someone in love
Sometimes the things I do astound me
Mostly whenever you're around me
Lately, I seem to walk as though I had wings
Bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love
Lately, I seem to walk as though I had wings
I bump into things like someone in love
Each time I look at you, I'm limp as a glove
And feeling like someone in love1Embed
