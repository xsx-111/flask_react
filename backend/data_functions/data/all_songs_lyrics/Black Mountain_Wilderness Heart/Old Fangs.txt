Old Fangs LyricsIs it safe for the cowards to do what they've already done?
When the sun is electric and sparkles its way through your heart
Is it foolish to know what you want before you've begun?
When they're milking you dry and bemoaning the magical farce
You explain to the law that you're slaving over simple regard
A vow, I'm straight laced forever
A bow, I'm straight laced forever
When the glory arrives and takes shape over what've become
And your world closes in and the power is all that you love
Is it foolish to know what you want before you've begun?
Bloody visions of a world so torn
I'll play with what can burn
Slowly the empire smashed the din
We'll wait for the open tea
And hold it together man
Until it's time
Bloody visions of a world so torn
I'll play those death wish chords
Slowly the empire smashed the din
We'll wait for the circle storm
Treat this like forever
Is it safe for the cowards to do what they've already done?
When the sun is electric and sparkles its way through your heart
A vow, I'm straight laced forever
A bow, I'm straight laced foreverEmbed
