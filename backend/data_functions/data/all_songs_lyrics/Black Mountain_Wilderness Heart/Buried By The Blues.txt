Buried By The Blues Lyrics
Absorbed forever, into the darkest shades
Vanished from the light, to the still colonies
Enslaved forever, buried by the blues
Wear your wounds like a soldier and let your ghosts run loose

Against the night, you will rise and set your body free
Frontier of light, you desire to let your body sleep
Away from the static and noise

Exploding waves, you wish you could belong
The piper at the gates, to steal you from the dawn
No suicide could ever change your fate
Fold your hands in reprieve, beneath the trembling rain

Against the night, you will rise and set your body free
Frontier of light, you desire to let you body sleep
Away from the static and noise
Away from the bombs and the war
Away from the static and noise1Embed
