Radiant Hearts LyricsChildren play softly around the explosions
Tearing up shrapnel, wrapped up in clothing
And I am left waiting for the doctor to sell
Ten thousand one hundreds, it's all just a blur
Tear at the sheets but there's no one alive
The static rings true and your head can't survive
Alone in your castle on the 54th floor
Can't you hear me calling your name?
Yet, the hardest truth to believe
That all is worth, and all that is gained
Could never replace the most beautiful things
That brought you so close to my heart
Oh heaven's the place where you're no longer waiting
For someone to say that this day turned to poison
Roses won't make her feel better tonight
Now look what you've done to the sky
Brassy like queens, mad men in corsets
Paul is waiting for someone to get bent
Chasing the arrows, they swoon while they fly
Can't you hear me calling your name?
Yet, the hardest truth to believe
That all is worth, and all that is gained
Could never replace the most beautiful things
That brought you so close to my heart
People wandering the same damn old plains
Waiting for wisdom to shout out their names
But never exchanging a look or a thrill
Would shoot you straight dead in the heart
Of beautiful moments...
Lastly, we sing to the senses of order
A mother lay waiting for a children to comfort
That the sky belittered with radiant hearts
Waiting to guide you back home...Embed
