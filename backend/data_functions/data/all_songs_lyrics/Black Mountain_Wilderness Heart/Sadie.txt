Sadie LyricsDon't run alone on the stadium walls 'cross the river
Treacherous beasts walk in pairs hand in hand by the shore
Wisdom forgot them, so they became trouble
Hug your surroundings, there's life in dead seasons
Chemical planes in the sky let the babies run wild
Things became vulgar when we became silent
Please Sadie, oh won't you come down, it's time to come home
Marry me maiden and become my companion
Together we'll fry on the plains like nuclear suns
No faulty resemblance to devil-less dresses
Please Sadie, oh won't you come down, it's time to come home
Please Sadie, oh won't you come down, surrender your throneEmbed
