Let Spirits Ride LyricsReturn to the realm
Towards the flame the once burned through us all
The rudimentary force of life is shining in your eyes awaiting call
Carry onwards child and lead me to the womb
Reborn in nature's arms our freedom will exhume
Terminate me, melt me with the sky and earthly soil
A sacrifice into the light in unison resist forever more
Controlled anatomy has risen from the grave
Delivered ancient way's reborn in mother's flames
Let spirits ride
Descend to the waves, electric tides cast upon your shores
The rudimentary force of life is shining out the gates of heaven's door
Carry onwards child upon your stainless wings
Holy caravan we ride the spirit wind
Let spirits ride
Return to the realm
Towards the flame the once burned through us all
The rudimentary force of life is shining in your eyes awaiting call
Carry onwards child and lead me to the womb
Reborn in nature's arms our freedom will exhume
Let spirits rideEmbed
