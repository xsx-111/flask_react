The Space Of Your Mind LyricsThe cold chill hits the night
As we're dying for summer
Stare out your window
To the flickering light
Let the sun breathe us in
Our bodies are waiting
There's no one quite like you
Shelter me wholly tonight
Flesh covered stories shine in the gleam of your eyes
Riding the crazy blue waves
Through the space of your mind
Lets make our own scene
And reign over our heaven
In your arms there is peace
In your voice there is calm
Lets run for the hills
Then pour down like silver
It's a wondrous thing
When the heart has nothing to hide
Flesh stories covered stories shine in the gleam of your eyes
I'm riding the crazy blue waves
Through the space of your mind
I am riding the crazy blue waves
Through the space of your mind
Look for the one
With the dawn on her breath miles high
I am riding the crazy blue waves
Through the space of your mindEmbed
