The Way To Gone LyricsPrecious dear, you're on your way through the silver rain
40 moons and alcohol couldn't change a thing
Frozen ghosts ain't got no hope - can't learn to sing
Don't wait too long or you might get gone on a flowery spring
Sleeping like a rolled out score
On temper's blown a square eyed man looking over you
Televised you cracked a smile through your super suit
Mary haze please rescue me, it's boring here
On the way to gone, now always takes to long ain't it hard for you
Sleeping like a rolled out score
Super beam of light shone down to guide your path
Terrorized, you glamorized how long it could last ...
I understand there's no sticking to some lifeless thriil
On the way to gone, now always takes to long ain't it hard for you
Sleeping like a rolled out score
Sleeping at the devil's door
My love for her was hung at noon to no surprise
Yeah, no one blinked and no one cried so no one lied
A box of life in deadly ground no wedding ring
Don't wait too long or you might get gone on flowery spring
Sleeping like a rolled out score
Sleeping at the devil's doorEmbed
