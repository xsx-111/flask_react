Rollercoaster LyricsRoller roller coaster
Oh how we'd love to roll you in
Roller roller coaster
Oh how we'd love to roll you in
Buy a ticket for a fancy airplane
Won't get you nowhere won't catch you no fame
Mother I know it's hard to let go
My baby's broken and all out on his own
Colonel Captain has slipped on his shades
Our family values have ruined this space
Black Plague disaster gold medal heart
I wish I loved you when the going got rough
I will cradle you beneath my wings
As you tremble in my warmth
I will cradle you beneath my wings
And teach you of my scorn
You can't trade plastic for a nuclear bomb
Forever after didn't turn out that long
Ruby I know you want to get well
My baby's broken and all out of herself
Roller roller coaster
Oh how we'd love to roll you in
Roller roller coaster
Oh how we'd love to roll you inEmbed
