Incomplete and Insecure LyricsI haven’t finished a thing since I started my life
I don’t feel much like starting now
Walking now lonely has worked like a charm
I’m the only one I have to let down
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
I can go on with my insecure nature
I can keep living off sympathy
I can tell all the people that all of their success
Is a direct reflection on me
But watching you makes me think that that is wrong
What is important, what’s really important?
Am I not to know by my name?
Will I ever know silence, without mental violence
Will the ringing at night go away?
It’s up to you, my father, call on me
I haven’t finished a thing since I started my life
I don’t feel much like starting now
I haven’t finished a thing since I started my lifeEmbed
