Kick Drum Heart Lyrics
The footprints over the snow
The fabric over the lonely
C-Covering only
The fables and hands
The rest is out in the cold
Holding the last of the season
F-F-F-Freezin'
Ye-ah

My-my-my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice

We're walkin' into the fields
We're walkin' into the forest
The moon is before us
Up above
We're holdin' hands in the rain
S-Sayin' words like I love you
D-D-Do you love me?
Ye-ah
My-my-my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice

Mother Mary heard us approaching her door
Though we didn't make a sound
There's nothing like finding gold
Within the rocks hard and cold
I'm so surprised to find more
Always surprised to find more
I won't look back anymore
I left the people that do
It's not the chase that I love
It's me following you

My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my heart like a kick drum
My, my love like a voice
My, my heart like a kick drum1Embed
