Tin Man Lyrics
You can't be like me
But be happy that you can't
I see pain but I don't feel it
I am like the old tin man
I'm as worn as a stone
I keep it steady as I can
I see pain but I don't feel it
I am like the old tin man

I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling

I used to fill the sky around
With happiness and joy
I had news to give the wind
To keep myself and heart employed
I felt people move around me
I felt loneliness and shame
Back then every day was different
Now each moment is the same

I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
The feeling of feeling
The wind upon my face
And caring what it brings this way
The feeling of feeling
The minutes pass away
And caring what I do with them
Maybe bring me love or something else

And so it goes a man grows cold
Some would say a man grows strong
They say life only grows short
I say the road only grows long
But as long as there's a road
My feet will never touch the ground
And if you won't give my heart back
I've no need to stick around

I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feeling
I miss it
I miss it
Oh, I miss that feeling of feelingEmbed
