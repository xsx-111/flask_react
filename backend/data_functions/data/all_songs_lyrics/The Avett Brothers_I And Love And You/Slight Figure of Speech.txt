Slight Figure of Speech LyricsThey say you gotta lose a couple fights to win
It's hard to tell from where I'm sitting
They say that this is where the fun begins
Guess it's time that I was quitting
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it all like I was hoping now
They said "I hope that you will never change"
I went and cut my hair
They said "Don't take your business to the big town"
I bought us tickets there
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it all like I was hoping now
What did you expect
And what did you forget
That to live you let go of me with each step
It becomes a progression I won't let regret manifest
To aggression
Are you to assess what I've been? What I am? Or become?
Did you stop to accept how pathetically dumb
It can be to
Attack those around 'cause you're
True to color, a town, a time, or a place?
It's not you, it's not mine
And besides it is gone
And you never will find it again
But I don't want to fight
I just ask let me be
I won't give the chance to be my enemy
So go home
Think it through
A jet plane and a big idea
I jump over the seat
What Ifs hot on my trail
But they can't catch me, no
A slight figure of speech
I cut my chest wide open
They come and watch us bleed
Is it all like I was hoping nowEmbed
