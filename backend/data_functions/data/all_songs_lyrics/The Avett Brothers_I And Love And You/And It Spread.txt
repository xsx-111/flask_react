And It Spread LyricsThere was light in the room
Then you left and it was through
Then the frost started in
My toes and fingertips
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
And it spread
And it spread into my heart
Then for I don't know how long
I settled in to doing wrong
And as the wind fills the sail
Came the thought to hurt myself
And it spread
And it spread into my home
And it spread
And it spread into my soul
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie
Oh, oh, oh
Then you came back from space
With a brand new laugh and a different face
You took my hand and held it up
And shot my arm full of love
And it spread
And it spread into the world
And it spread
And it spread into the world
Well there are no lines
Separating the truth from the lie
Oh, oh, oh
