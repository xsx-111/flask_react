The Perfect Space LyricsI wanna have friends that I can trust
That love me for the man I've become
Not the man that I was
And I wanna have friends that will let me be
All alone when being alone is all that I need
I wanna fit in to the perfect space
Feel natural and safe in a volatile place
And I wanna grow old without the pain
Give my body back to the earth and not complain
Will you understand when I am too old of a man?
And will you forget when we have paid our debt?
Who did we borrow from?
Who did we borrow from?
Okay part two now clear the house
The party's over take the shouting and the people
Get out!
I have some business and a promise that I have to hold to
I do not care what you assume or what the people
Told you!
Will you understand, when I am too old of a man?
Will you forget when we have paid our debts?
Who did we borrow from?
Who did we borrow from?
I wanna have pride like my mother has
And not like the kind in the bible that turns you bad
I wanna have friends that I can trust
That love me for the man I've become
Not the man that I wasEmbed
