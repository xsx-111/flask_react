It Goes On and On LyricsI lost my fear in your arms
I lost my tears in your car
I lost my will in your candle-lit eyes
And all my love in your yard
Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up
No way am I
It goes on
Violent is the motion in my heart and in my body and mind
And silent is the feeling that I lost but I'm determined to find
And love is but an ocean, unrealistic notion
But I cling to her devotion and I let it pull me down to the floor
It goes on, on, on, on
It goes on, on, on, on
It goes on, on, on, on
It goes on, on, on
I found my will in your car
I caught my tears in your arms
I found my self on that poor county drive
And found my love in your yard
OH! Baby would you leave me if you knew that I was making it up?
And underneath the love you got to wonder am I giving you up
No way am I
It goes on, on, on, on
It goes on, on, on, on
It goes on, on, on, on
It goes on, on, on
It goes on, on, onEmbed
