Two Reelers LyricsA lot of people love that Jerome
Did you know he missed his comb?
All his life was in pain
Made us laugh, he never did complain
Brother Sam was more than OK
Returned once more to save the day
Slicked-back hair he did keep
Making a heap, heap, heap, heap, heap
If all you see is violence
Then I make a plea in their defense
Don't you know they speak vaudevillian?
And for what it is hear what my theory is
Some gibberish it is so serious
What we need is more silly men
Though underrated all the time
Louis was so very fine
Without him, imagine
Did you know he could play the violin?
Most important was brother Moe
He was the one who made it so
He got a Joe and another Joe
He would not quit, he would not quit
And Mr. White heard bad report
And so it ends the two reeler short
Cause you cannot do what you can't
And Mr. White heard bad report
And so it ends the two reeler short
Cause you cannot do what you can't
If all you see is violence
Then I make a plea in their defense
Don't you know they speak vaudevillian?1Embed
