Bad, Wicked World LyricsBad wicked world
Bad wicked world
They are about dressed to deceive
Conquistadores that have been sent
Bad wicked world
Bad wicked world
Some sell him out, some won't believe
An architect named David Vincent
A man too long without sleep
He took a wrong turn and people just laughed
A ship that is not there, but he knows that it was
A made a light and a buzz
He's really hurtin' because
People don't care
And people think he's a creep
He won't stop, just keeps on talkin'
Just a tie and a suit, he's a low-life persuader
Fist-throwin' crusader
Against invaders
Won't be mute
Bad wicked world
Bad wicked world
Some sell him out, some won't believe
An architect named David Vincent
Bad wicked world
Bad wicked world
They are about, dressed to deceive
Conquistadores that have been sent
About once a week
Another story is leaked and he's on it
Just a suit and a tie, will it ever end
He hasn't got a friend
Pinkies that won't bend
He really must try
Bad wicked world
Bad wicked world
Some sell him out, some won't believe
Architect David VincentEmbed
