Freedom Rock LyricsMy name is Chip
And I'm different
I don't conform
I wear a different uniform
I'm out of the blue and so you are, too
Let me sing about one thing that's clear
That nobody owns the pleasure of tones
That belongs to a guy with no ear
They tried to give me advice
Down at the record shop
I said sit down boys
This may come as a shock
What's all I listen to
It's all freedom rock
How can you free me
How can you free me
How can you free me
How can you free me
When I am free? Wooh, wooh
I am free, ooh
My name is Chip
And I'm different
I don't conform
I wear a different uniform
I'm out of the blue and so you are, too
Let me sing about one thing that's clear
That nobody owns the pleasure of tones
That belongs to a guy with no earEmbed
