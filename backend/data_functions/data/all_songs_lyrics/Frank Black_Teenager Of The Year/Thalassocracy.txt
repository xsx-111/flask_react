Thalassocracy LyricsWell, it isn't so great
Since you learned karate chop-chop-chop-chop-chop
You're walkin' machs and I'm just
Swimmin' in the slop-slop-slop-slop-slop
You wave your wand at me and
Make me dance flip-flop-flip-flop-flip
I want to sing for you and
Make your head go pop-pop-pop-pop-pop
The Inuit man
Had not so much a caesar
He had provision
Say, you're sprayin' in the windy
And I'm just pissin' off-off-off-off-off
I'm literally deaf down here from
Your canned philosoph-soph-soph-soph
Softly, can you hear me?
Through the suckin' of your quaff-quaff-quaff-quaff quaff
I'm thalassocracy and you're just Romanov-ov-ov-ov
The Inuit man
Had not so much a caesar
He had provisionEmbed
