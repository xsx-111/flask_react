Space Is Gonna Do Me Good LyricsThe islands of Phoenix
In 2016
Are making it up with hardihood
I'm done with adult matters
I'm doing the catapult
I've been meaning to get out of Hollywood
Space is gonna do me good, ooh
Space is gonna do me good
It's not you I don't like
No, the boy is the same
I'm taking the turnpike
There's no point in to blame, oh yeah
Space is gonna do me good, ooh
Space is gonna do me good
It's not you I don't like
No, the boy is the same
I'm taking the turnpike
There's no point in to blame, oh yeah
Words of the man Ray
If you want to stay tan
Better to do it with a toy or a game, oh yeahEmbed
