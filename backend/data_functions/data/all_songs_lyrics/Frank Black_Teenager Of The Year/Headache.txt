Headache LyricsThis wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
I got me so down, I got me a headache
My heart's crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound
I was counting the rings
And I fell me into a sleep
I peeked to see if you were way back when
I was counting the trees
Until a day when there was one
I'd hoped, beneath, asleep, is where that you had been
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit (Credit)
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
I got me so down, I got me a headache (Headache)
My heart's crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound
Well, I found you
Maybe you can help me
And I can help you
This wrinkle in time, can't give it no credit (Credit)
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)
I got me so down, I got me a headache (Headache)
My heart's crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound (How it pounds)
I got me so down, I got me a headache (Headache)
My heart is crammed in my cranium, and it still knows how to pound (How it pounds)
This wrinkle in time, I can't give it no credit (Credit)
I thought about my space, and I really got me down (Got me down)Embed
