Fazer Eyes LyricsOoh, ooh
Staring on into night
Complete synapse
I switched on something I did not see
May I leave? I believe I might
This sweet collapse
Baby, I cannot get me free
When you've got your fazer eyes on me
Driving on into
Where I do not know
Shores that once were by the sea
I'm seeing something that is not there
It's so fast it's slow
And it's playing with my memory
And you've got your fazer eyes on me
Accustomed to the frequency of glow, oh yeah
You won't be frightened of the real thing after the showEmbed
