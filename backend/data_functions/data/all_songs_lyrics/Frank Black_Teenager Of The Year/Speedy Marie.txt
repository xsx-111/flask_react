Speedy Marie LyricsHad a bit part, an endless reel
It always played in slo-mo
But now it's fast, a spinning wheel
I know the dynamo, my heart is cast
Speedy Marie, ahead of the now
She's better built that's how
She's built for speed
Speedy Marie, Speedy Marie
"Oh, yes indeed," I said to me
And so I sing this romaunt
It's not enough, my liberty
There is a thing I want
I need, I love
Speedy Marie, ahead of the now
She's better built that's how
She's built for speed
Speedy Marie, Speedy Marie
Juxtaposed in each moment's sight
Everything that I ever saw
And my one delight
Nothing can strike me in such awe
Mouth intricate shapes the voice that speaks
Always it will soothe
Rarer none are the precious cheeks
Is the size of each sculpted tooth
Each lip and each eye
Wise is the tongue, wet of perfect thought
And softest neck where always do I
Lay my clumsy thoughts
She is that most lovely art
Happy are my mind and my soul and my heart1Embed
