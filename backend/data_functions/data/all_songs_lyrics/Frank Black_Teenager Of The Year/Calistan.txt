Calistan LyricsI took three days to drive down one street
The radio on, tuned to the big fleet
Invisible planes are cracking the concrete
That's just what some people say, hey hey
I put down my blanket on Cigarette Butt Beach
I saw the old man, he was doing OK
He's making his last stand on old bottles and cans
Round there, Calistan way, hey hey
Used to be sixteen lanes
Used to be Nuevo Spain
Used to be Juan Wayne
Used to be Mexico
Used to be Navajo
Used to be yippy-ay-I-don't know
Went in from the weather when I got wheezy
I play some Pachinko, I play Pachisi
And St. Anne is still making it breezy
In the valley of tar that once was L.A., hey hey
And my best friend he's the king of karaoke
He struck up a chord and he took it away
Out of the pan and into Japan
Round there, Calistan way, hey hey
Used to be sixteen lanes
Used to be Juan Wayne
Used to be Mexican
Used to be Espa√±a Nuevo
Used to be Navajo
Used to be yippy-ay-I-don't know1Embed
