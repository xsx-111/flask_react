Pure Denizen of the Citizens Band LyricsI want to ask you fellows
Why do you shut me out?
When I've driven every place that they call land
I talk plain talk
I've seen the moon sitting on the road
And I don't eat no Chateaubriand
And I drive my car under same stars
Where the miles are, come back I demand
Dear gentlemen, please let me in
I don't know how I can make you understand
I'm a pure denizen of the citizens band
I'm a pure denizen of the citizens band
I'm a pure denizen of the citizens band
I'm a pure denizen of the citizens band
Hey friend, you know what I'd do
If I was making the bucks
Well, I'd move me to a place
Where all they had was trucks
'Cause there's one thing that I can't stand
There's one thing that I cannot stand
One thing I cannot stand, can't stand
Cannot stand, can't standEmbed
