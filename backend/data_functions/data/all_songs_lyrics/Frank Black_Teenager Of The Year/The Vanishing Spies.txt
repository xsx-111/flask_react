The Vanishing Spies LyricsThe vanishing spies, just something I read
A couple of eyes from out of the head
And all that was said
Well that's just how some things don't materialize
Could be they broke and swam like a bird
Fear of spooking the folk with talk of the third
Or maybe the third made a joke
Give me a blip, oh
And I'll totally flip, oh yeah, yeah
Say it's nothing but sky
And I'll be a lonely guy
The vanishing spies, just something I read
Now there were two eyes sent out from the head
But all that was said
Well that is just how some things do not materialize
Give me one little blip, oh
And I'll totally flip, oh oh, yeah, yeah
Say it's nothing but sky
And I will be one lonely guyEmbed
