The Hostess with the Mostest LyricsAs fluorescents do
They blink o'er the floor
Of her majestic halls
Yeah, they do
I hear surf on kazoo
And I march with the militia of the mime
Malicious are the times
Malicious
In the doors we all flew
To see the great indoors
Of her majestic stalls
Yeah, we flew
Waves break on the shore of the zoo
And I see how Laurasia sure has changed
Imaginary planes
Imagine
I hit the mall on every friday
When it was biggest in the world
The hostess with the mostestEmbed
