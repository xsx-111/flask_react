Sir Rockaby LyricsYou've got a sad face, you don't show it
And you're smiling it, too
Even in deep, deep outer space
There's something for you
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
The world is a rock that's spinning so fast
It'll give you jim-jams
I'm just a real love diplomat
I won't give you no flim-flams
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
How many stars girl, can you both count
And then classify?
I'm standing here in this big swirl
Singing this lullaby
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir Rockaby
And rockin' I am
I'm Sir RockabyEmbed
