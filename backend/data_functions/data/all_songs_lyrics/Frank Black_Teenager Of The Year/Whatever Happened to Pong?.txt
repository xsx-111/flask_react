Whatever Happened to Pong? LyricsMy brother and me used to play it down at a bar
Taking money from guys more used to the playing of cards
Paddle the paddle to side to the side
To the side to the paddle the paddle
Paddle the paddle to side to the side
Pong
Ball in the machine
Now virtually everyone's singing a popular song
Yeah, but still I believe in the excellent joy of the Pong
To the side to the side to the paddle the paddle
Paddle the paddle to side to the side
To the side to the side to the paddle the paddle
Pong
Ball in the machine
Now if they take it H. G. Wells
Well I'll be on the first flight
To a time before the Kong
Whatever happened to Pong?
To the side to the side to the paddle the paddle
Paddle the paddle to side to the side
To the side to the side to the paddle the paddle
Pong
Ball in the machineEmbed
