I Could Stay Here Forever LyricsSee the scheming behemoth
Lickin' salts in their cave
Being together's their zenith
It's how they behave
Now we're hangin' in tandem
Six trillion miles a year
How can direction be random
When you're so near?
I could stay here forever
I could stay here forever
Never bored with this
All aboard, and
I could stay here forever
We've got some bills to pay
And when we pay them off
Maybe we'll get away, but
If not, so what?
I could stay here forever
I could stay here forever
(Behold the scheming behemoth
It's how they behave)
I could stay here forever
I could stay here forever
Never bored with this
All aboard, and
I could stay here forever
I could stay here forever
Never bored with this
All aboard, and
I could stay here foreverEmbed
