(I Want to Live on an) Abstract Plain LyricsI've had it with this town
I never saw those shifting skies
I never saw the ground
Or the sunset rise
I want to live on an abstract plain
I'm building a frame
A place to put my ten-yard stare
Thinking of that paint
Painted in plain air
I want to live on an abstract plain
I need a new address
I want some new terrain
Is it North or South?
I want to live on an abstract plain
I could sit on the roof
On top of that abstract house
See my abstract view
An abstract mouse
I want to live on an abstract plain
I need a new address
Tell me I'm not insane
Is it up or down?
I want to live on an abstract plainEmbed
