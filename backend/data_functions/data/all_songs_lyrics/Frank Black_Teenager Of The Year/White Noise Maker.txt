White Noise Maker LyricsYou know, I hear a lot of talk
So I'm headin' for the stereo store
To get a white noise maker and turn it up to ten
Or maybe the interior
Of somewhere like Siberia
Yeah, the yak is back again
Like harvest moon over my head, yes it was
That billboard prose shinin' on me and it shines because
It's been so long since my Telstar
I hope it crashes in the sea
Or maybe the interior
Of somewhere like Siberia
Yakety-yak is back again
You know, I hear a lot of talk
So I'm headin' for the stereo store
To get a white noise maker and turn it up to ten
Like harvest moon over my head, yes it was
That billboard prose shinin' on me and it shines because
It's been so long since my Telstar
I hope it crashes in the seaEmbed
