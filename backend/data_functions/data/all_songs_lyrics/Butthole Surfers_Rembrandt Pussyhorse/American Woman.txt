American Woman LyricsDon't come knocking 'round my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes
Woman
"Alright you three, come on out of there!
We know your names!
We've got you right here in our files!
We've got automatic weapons, the building is surrounded, you're gonna fall! You're gonna fall!
Just remember this:
No matter what happens, no man is an island!
Remember that, no man is an island!
Come on outta there!
Come on outta there, we know you've killed thousands!
Here's to a thousand more!"
Don't come knocking 'round my door
I don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your war war war war
Woman, I said get away
American woman, listen what I say
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American woman
American woman, American womanEmbed
