Waiting for Jimmy to Kick Lyrics(And you know exactly when this thing--)
Are... are we recording this right now?
Stop this tape!
Stop it, because Jimmy is gonna kick
I want you to know
That Jimmy has control of the ball
He knows all of our needs
Jimmy lives in West Norwood in a van
And now
We are waiting
For jimmy
To kick
Kick it, Jimmy
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha haaa...
Jimmy kicks!
Kick it, Jimmy!
Look at us all!
Look us in the eye, Jimmy!
The kids are very sick of
Looking at you
And you know
That you can kick
Kick it!
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Guys! I can't believe this!
Ha ha ha ha ha...
It's silly!
Ha ha haaaa!
Woohoo! woohoo! woohoo!
Woohoo! woo! whoooaaahhh...
Jimmy...
Kicks
Guess not
We gotta go back and do that over again, guys...Embed
