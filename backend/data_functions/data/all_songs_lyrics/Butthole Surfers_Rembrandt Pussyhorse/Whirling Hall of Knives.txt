Whirling Hall of Knives LyricsThey she walked as she fall through the door, walk away
Ah looking as if she had seen him before, walk away
And she cried, just like me
Looking at pages and remembering lies, walk away
Apart from the graves and the place they made knives, walk away
And they cried, just like me
They he walks as she fell through the wall, walk away
Cut off my thighs and whirl through the hall, walk away
And they cried just like me
Walk away and they will cry
Walk away they may cryEmbed
