Sea Ferring LyricsHis life as strange as it seems
It lies on its side and screams
And nothing is quite what it
Dreams when it walks
Sprays when it talks
Dah da do
Da da de dum
Da da de dum
Da da de dum
Da da de dum
Doo aaaaaaaaahhhhhh!
All I want was a dream
You are lucky if you escape with a scream
Where nothing is quite what it
Seems when she walks
Plays when she talks
And the earth screamed like madmen
They laughed when she talks
Strange that you thought
That the earth fell like the pouring rain when it's hot
Like it or not
You'll scream again, again, again
Aaaaaaahhhhhhhh!
Brains when she talks
A cane when she walks
And the earth screams like a madman
In love when she talks
I know I have thoughts
And they all fall to pieces
When I speak I get cold
And I'm getting old
And we all scream again, again
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh
Like a tick farm, like a sea horse, like a graveyard, like a moron, like a girlfriend, like a tissue, like a cardboard, like a brick wall, like a dream waiting to be!
Like a ball park, like a hiccup, like a blood clot, like a brain stroke, like a long drip, like a skeleton, like a dream that I can see!
Like a housewife, like a rapist, like a teacup, like a bedpan, like a cold sore, like an old friend
Nothing seems so removed
But love is hard when you're true
And twice is far from the Earth when it walks
And I know I can talk
But the words hover like a thousand varicose flies that know me
And I know I can see
But my eyes fill with pride and stupidity, this I know
And I'm getting old
So I'll scream again, again, again
Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!Embed
