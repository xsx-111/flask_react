Creep in the Cellar LyricsWell there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let in
And he eats in the alley and keeps track of my sins
When he starts talking backwards your head starts to spin
And he really freaks me out when he peels off his skin, yeah!
Well there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let in
There's a hole in his brain where his mind should have been
When he starts rubbing wrinkles, he gets pretty thin
When he starts talking nickelback, diamondback, Muscleback yeah!
Well there's a creep in the cellar with his hands in the air
And he lies to his mother but she doesn't care
Well the fists are flying backwards and the ballroom is bare
Cause the turkeys talking backwards it'll raise up your hair
Well there's a creep in the cellar that I'm gonna let inEmbed
