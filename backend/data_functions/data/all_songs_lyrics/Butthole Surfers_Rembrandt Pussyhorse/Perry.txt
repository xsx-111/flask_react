Perry LyricsHello perry
You think you're so fucking scary
Well, i've got news for you
Hello perry
Hello perry
Hello 
This is the news for you, perry
And it's not so fucking scary
Here it is:
It's talking about you
It's talking about growing up in england
It's talking about being the slave boy
It's talking about giving head when you're 6 years old
It's talking about enjoying these things
Becoming a part of you
Becoming a part of your faith
Having a proper share of the bread
And the part of passing it around to the other boys
And then once you know itâ€¦
Hello perry
I think it's all too fucking scary
Well, i've got news for you, perry
Do you...hey!
I really care, perry
About your money
Your mother died of cancer
Cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer, cancer
See, perry
I can be there and protect her
It's about coming of age
It's about learning how to do it
It's about learning how to experience things the way they ought to be experienced
It's about growing up
It's about licking the shit off the floor
It's about doing the things that you ought to do
It's about being a butthole surfer
It's about doing promotional work
It's about
It's about PR
It's about all these things
It's about loving yourself
It's about loving your mom
It's about loving your dad
It's about doing the things
It's about going to the go-kart track
It's about loving everything
Your pop, your kitty
All the things
The catfood, the little bits of crayons
The melted pieces
The loving friends
All the things you wish you hadEmbed
