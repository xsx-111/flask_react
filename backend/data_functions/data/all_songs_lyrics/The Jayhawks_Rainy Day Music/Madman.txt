Madman Lyrics
Rage on, rage on my brother
Time to lay down my arms
You know that it's wrong for me to go on
There's a madman
Singing down in the alley

My love waits at the window
My love waits by the door
The curtains are drawn
Who'll sound the alarm?
It's the madman
Singing down in the alley


I'll abandon the train
From the crowd watch the parade
Of the madmen
Singing down in the alley

Darling, take off your makeup
Gently let down your hair
We'll stand by the grave
And sip our champagne
Toast the madman
Singing down in the alley
Toast the madman
Singing down in the alleyEmbed
