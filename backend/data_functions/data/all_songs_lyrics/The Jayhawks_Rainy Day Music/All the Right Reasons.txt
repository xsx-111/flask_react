All the Right Reasons Lyrics
As I lay upon my bed, I begin dreaming
Of how it's gonna be
The day that I am free
Once I settle like the dust upon the table
But then you came along
You helped me write this song

I don't know what day it is
I can't recall the seasons
And I don't remember how we got this far
All I know is I'm loving you for all the right reasons
In my sky, you'll always be my morning star

Like a tired bird flying high across the ocean
I was outside looking in
You made me live again
From the mountains to the prairies, little babies
Figures fill their heads
Visions bathed in red

I don't know what day it is
I can't recall the seasons
And I don't remember how we got this far
All I know is I'm loving you for all the right reasons
In my sky, you'll always be my morning star
From the train in
Manchester, England
Lightning fills the sky
As I watched you wave goodbye
From the mountains to the prairie, little babies
Figures fill their heads
Visions bathed in red

I don't know what day it is
I can't recall the seasons
And I don't remember how we got this far
All I know is I'm loving you for all the right reasons
In my sky, you'll always be my morning starEmbed
