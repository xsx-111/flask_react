Eyes of Sarahjane Lyrics
Warwick Hotel
I know it well
We lived a dream
So sweet, so sweet
I see Philly in the snowy gloom
We could have laid there 'til the afternoon
Our cut runs deep
So deep, so deep

And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again

We couldn't sleep
Laugh 'til we weep
Then time stood still
So still, so still
Talked for hours in our little bed
I fell in love with every word you said
It felt so great
So great, so great
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again


People love to fall in
Love, they love to fall in
People love to be amused
But you won't see me laughing
In the sadness of our ways

Those were the days
Those were the days

And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times again
And in the eyes of Sarahjane
I see the happy times againEmbed
