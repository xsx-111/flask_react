Save It for a Rainy Day Lyrics
Pretty little hairdo
Don't do what it used to
Can't disguise the living
All the miles that you've been through
Looking like a train wreck
Wearing too much makeup
The burden that you carry
More than one soul could ever bear

(So sad)
Don't look so sad, Marina
(There's another part)
There's another part to play
(So sad)
Don't look so sad, Marina
(Ooh)
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day

You never make your mind up
Like driving with your eyes shut
Rough around the edges
Won't someone come and take you home?
Waiting for a breakthrough
What will you set your mind to?
We stood outside the Chinese restaurant
In the rain
(So sad)
Don't look so sad, Marina
(There's another part)
There's another part to play
(So sad)
Don't look so sad, Marina
(Ooh)
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day


(So sad)
Don't look so sad, Marina
(There's another part)
There's another part to play
(So sad)
Don't look so sad, Marina
(Ooh)
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy day
Save it for a rainy dayEmbed
