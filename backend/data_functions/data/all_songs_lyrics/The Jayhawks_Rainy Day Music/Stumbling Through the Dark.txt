Stumbling Through the Dark Lyrics
You're so in love, little girl
So much in love, little girl
Running around in circles, why?
You know it's a crime

No less, no more than a rose
No less, no more than a rose
Try to attach a meaning
To words that you've heard

Stumbling through the dark
Seems I'm stumbling through the dark
Everybody's stumbling through the dark

The men who proceeded us here
Left only questions and fears
The vanity formed by beauty lies
You know it's a crime

Stumbling through the dark
Seems I'm stumbling through the dark
Everybody's stumbling through the dark
Stumbling through the dark
Seems I'm stumbling through the dark
Everybody's stumbling through the darkEmbed
