Tampa to Tulsa Lyrics
2, 3

Tampa to Tulsa
Just one layover
Thinking it over
There's a card game in the back seat
They're throwing dice in the aisle
And the driver just smiles
With every mile
He's closer to the arms
Of the woman who loves him
Tampa to Tulsa
One layover

Please don't ask
Take my love and make it last
Please don't ask
Ease my worried mind
And take my hand

Picking up nothing but stock quotes
On a GI's radio
It's giving me nothing but false hope
I'm putting it all on the line
Tampa to Tulsa
One layover
Please don't ask
Take my love and make it last
Please don't ask
Ease my worried mind
And take my hand

I know that you're running
But you don't know what from
Tampa to Tulsa, one layover

Please don't ask
Take my love and make it last
Please don't ask
Ease my worried mind
And take my handEmbed
