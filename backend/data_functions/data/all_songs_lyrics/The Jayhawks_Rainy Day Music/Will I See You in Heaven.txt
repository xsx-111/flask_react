Will I See You in Heaven Lyrics
1, 2, 3, 1, 2

We were so close together
Yeah, you felt like a brother to me
Searching for a little bit of truth
But I found that it was living inside of you
Thought we could live forever
But there's more to life than we'll ever know
Tell me, why'd you have to leave so soon
When I've got a thousand questions to ask of you?
(Ask of you)

Will I see you in heaven?
Shine your light from above
With your love I am never alone
Won't you carry me?
Won't you carry me home?

Well, if faith is the answer
Can you spare some to help guide me through?
Swim across the ocean for a sign
Though you're gone
You're always going to be a friend of mine
(Friend of mine)
Will I see you in heaven?
Shine your light from above
With your love I am never alone
Won't you carry me?
Won't you carry me?
Will I see you in heaven?
Will I see you in heaven?
With your love I am never alone
Won't you carry me?
Won't you carry me home?Embed
