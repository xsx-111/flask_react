You Look So Young Lyrics
You're lonesome in the morning
In the morning where you lay
Toss your head against the window
Beads form like crooked trains

You look so young
Have you ever been afraid?
You look so young
And I'm feeling so ashamed

Selfish thoughts and selfish reasons
Lead to my own demise
Once this world is taken from me
Stripped bare my soul will rise

You look so young
Have you ever been afraid?
You look so young
And I'm feeling so ashamed

When will you ever learn?
When will you ever learn?
I see familiar faces
Been down this road before
Like a steer, we're led to slaughter
Why fight what's carved in stone?

You look so young
Have you ever been afraid?
You look so young
And I'm feeling so ashamed
You look so young
Have you ever been afraid?
You look so young
And I'm feeling so ashamedEmbed
