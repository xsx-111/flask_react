Tailspin Lyrics
Well, they stood prepared as you took the chair
There was no need to satisfy you
I'll be damned, though I held your hand
They felt the need to crucify you

You're goin' down, baby, baby
You're goin' down, baby, baby

You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head
You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head

You're a fragile flower in its final hour
With no chance to taste the waters
Judge declared, "You'll get fifteen years
Join the lonely sons and daughters"

You're goin' down, baby, baby
You're goin' down, baby, baby
You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head
You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head


Smoke and mirrors couldn't hide your tears
Your eyes only betray you
Long trip, you lost your grip
We've all been praying for you

You're goin' down, baby, baby
You're goin' down, baby, baby

You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head
You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head
You're in a tailspin
Running out of your head
In a tailspin, baby
Running out of your headEmbed
