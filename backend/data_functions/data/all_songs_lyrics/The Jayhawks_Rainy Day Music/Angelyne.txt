Angelyne Lyrics
Here comes the weather
It's looking like another storm
If all desire
Would leave this tired boy alone
Hopes haunt me like ghosts, they point their fingers
Grass grows in the cracks, wind makes me shiver, mmhmm

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
You could never stand living with a man
Who could only lead you halfway to love

Yeah, I tried to fake it
But you wouldn't play along
I watched you naked
Innocent and holding on
Snowflakes make your bones ache in the winter
Your face will not fade, it will just linger

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
You could never stand living with a man
Who could only lead you halfway
Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
I could never fit into your plans
I'm nobody's man

Don't you tell me how to live my life
Don't you tell me how to live my life

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
You could never stand living with a man
Who could only lead you halfway

Angelyne, forgive me
We threw it all away
I could never fit into your plans
I'm nobody's manEmbed
