Hard to Handle Lyrics
Yeah, make some noise

Baby, here I am, a man on the scene
I give you what you want, got you comin' home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Get through throwin' it on you, you got to come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen, did you know?
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am

Action speaks louder than words, man of experience
Got you another man, I can love you better than him
Man, don't be afraid, prove every word I say
Advertising love for free, place your ad with me

Boys like dimes around by the dozen, ten cent lovin'
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am
Yeah, gotta get it hard
Baby, I am, on the scene
Give you, give you, give you what you want, baby
Come on home with me
Got all my love, little more in store
Throwin' shit on you, back for more

Boys like dimes around by the dozen, drugstore love
Pretty little thing, let me light your candle
'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now, yes, sir, I am
Yeah, got to get hard
Jeffrey Cease


Boys like dimes around by the dozen, ten cent love
(Pretty little thing, let me light your candle)
('Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to handle now)
You did good!
Nicely done, nicely done


One time
Alright
Thank you so much!
