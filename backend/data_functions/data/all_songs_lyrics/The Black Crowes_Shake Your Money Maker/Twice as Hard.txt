Twice as Hard Lyrics
Do you know what I'm singing?

Oh, yeah
Clean as a whistle
Smellin' like a rose
She got her dirty little finger
Bloodshot eyes are gone
You wanna tell me that I'm wrong

Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (One time, baby, two time)
First time, I said goodbye

Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye

Oh, yeah
Your sister always singing
She plays the step child
A broken little memory
I was never kind
Are you the one to tell me I'm blind?
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard (Two time)
As it was the first time
I said goodbye

Nobody ever wanna know
Love ain't funny
It's a crime in the wink of an eye

Yeah, bloodshot eyes are gone
And you think you're the one to tell me I'm wrong

Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
(Twice, baby) Twice as hard
As it was the first time
I said goodbye
Twice as hard
As it was the first time
Bye
So you did come to have a good time
This next selection is one off our album
And it is entitled could I, could I, could I, "Could I've Been So Blind"2Embed
