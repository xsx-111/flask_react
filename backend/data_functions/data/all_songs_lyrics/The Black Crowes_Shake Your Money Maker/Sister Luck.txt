Sister Luck Lyrics

Worried sick, my eyes are hurting
To rest, rest my head, I'll take a life
'Cause you know that outside, the girls are dancing
And when you're down, it don't ever, ever seem right

Feeling second fiddle to a dead man
I've had it up to my neck with some people's disregard
And like a beat dog, baby, that's walking right outside down Peachtree
No one ever wants to hear it, hear it when you're down

Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else's name
Sister luck, oh, got to scream out
Somebody else's name, oh, that's a shame


A flip of a coin
Might make a head turn
But there's no, there's no surprise, baby, who can sleep
But you held my hand right over a candle
Flame on it burnt me, I never did weep
Sister luck is screaming out
Somebody else, ooh, somebody else's name
Sister luck, yeah, got to scream out
Oh, somebody, somebody else's name, imagine


Sister luck, oh, got to scream out, baby
Somebody else, somebody, somebody else's name
Sister luck, oh, got to scream out
Oh, no, no, no
Somebody else's name and that's a shame

You wanna hear 'bout shame?
You wanna hear about shame, baby?
Babe, I wanna tell 'em, tell 'em 'bout
Thank you so much1Embed
