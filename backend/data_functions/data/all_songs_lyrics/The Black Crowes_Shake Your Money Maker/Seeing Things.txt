Seeing Things Lyrics

I find it hard to shed a tear
Oh, you brought it on yourself, my dear
And wrong, yes, I may be
Don't you dare, don't you dare leave no light on, no light on for me
'Cause, baby, I ain't comin' home
Oh, but you know it hurts me, it hurts me to be alone
Yeah, it hurts me, baby

A hundred years that ain't never gonna ease
Oh, I'm hearing all the things, all the things, all the things that I just can't believe
But I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes
All the pain that, baby, that this heart, this heart just cannot hide
But you know that this pain starts in my heart
And love tears us apart
You won't find me down on, on my knees, baby
You won't find me bendin' over backwards, baby
Just to please, show me, please

'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time
Seeing it, oh, for the first time
Seeing it for the first time
In my life
Hey, it's in my life
Chuck Leavell on the Hammond organ
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I used to dream
Of a better day that you know, that you know never, ever came
"Sorry," that don't mean nothin' to me
Oh, baby, I'm gone, I'm out the door
And you know that's the way that things gotta, gotta be
So, baby, you know I've done my time
I didn't know that lovin' you was such a crime
And you won't find me down on my knees
No, no, no, no, no, no
You won't find me bendin' over backwards, baby
Just to please, show me, baby, one thing

Seeing things for the first time
Seeing it, ow, for the very first time
Seeing it for the first time
Seeing it, baby
I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
'Cause I'm seeing things for the first time
In my life
Oh, baby, you know, you know, you know, you know it's my lifeEmbed
