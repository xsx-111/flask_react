Jealous Again LyricsCheat the odds that made you
Brave to try to gamble at times
Well, I feel like dirty laundry
Sending sickness on down the line
Tell you why, 'cause I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby
Always drunk on Sunday
Trying to feel like I'm at home
Smell the gasoline burning
Boys out feeling nervous and cold, oh yeah
I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Jealous, jealous again
Got no time, baby
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of losing face
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you
Never felt like smiling
Sugar wanna kill me yet, eh yeah
Find me loose lipped and laughing
Singing songs ain't got no regret, oh yeah
I'm jealous, jealous again
Thought it time I let you in
Jealous, yeah, I'm jealous again
Got no time, baby
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of losing face
Stop, understand me
I ain't afraid of ever losing faith in you
Don't you think I want to, don't you think I would
Don't you think I'd tell you baby, if I only could
Am I acting crazy? Am I just too proud?
Am I just plain lazy, am I, am I, am I, am I
Jealous, jealous again
Thought it time that I let you in
Jealous, jealous again
Got no time to let you in
Oh yeah, I'm jealous, jealous again
Got no time now to let you in
Jealous, yeah, jealous again
Got no time, baby, oh yeah1Embed
