The Memphis Blues (or Mister Crump) LyricsFolks I've just been down, down to Memphis town
That's where the people smile, smile on you all the while
Hospitality, they were good to me
I couldn't spend a dime and had the grandest time
I went out a dancing with a Tennessee dear
They had a fellow named Handy with a band you should hear
And while the folks gently swayed
All them boys began to play in real harmony
I never will forget that tune they call
Handy's Memphis Blues, oh yes, those blues
They've got a trumpet man leading the band
And folks, he sure blow some horn
And when the clarinet seconds to the trombones croon
It moans just like a sinner on Revival Day
That melancholy strain that ever haunting refrain
Is like a morning sorrow song
Here comes the very part that wraps a spell around my heart
It sets me wild to hear that loving tune again, those Memphis BluesEmbed
