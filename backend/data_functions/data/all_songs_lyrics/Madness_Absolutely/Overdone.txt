Overdone LyricsDoor Locked Open, Door Locked Shut
See you soon, hopefully not
I've been and gone so many times
Without a work I've dropped no lines
Just look Forward, Never Back
Selfish bastard, dicta-brat
Please forgive me
For the things that I've done
Don't feel ashamed
If you're asked hows your son
Living here and living there
Lived at home but very rare
To see your faces it would be
A treasure locked in memory
Do drop a line, say hello dad
I await your answer, for I also beg
Please accept me
From a baby I have come
Pain, distress and heartache
I have now overcome
Running here and running there
Often caught but never cared
Been a-courting every yearEmbed
