Shadow of Fear Lyrics
I walk through Candem Town in the evening
Strolling silently, hardly breathing
Footsteps behind me slightly quicker
The corner of my eye a shadowy flicker

I wonder if he's after my soul again tonight
Stops to whisper in the shadows but still keeps me in his sight
I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware
Don't want to get involved in my spiritual affair

Tonight my fears are growing worse and worse
I feel him brewing up an evil curse
I sense a chill creep up my spine
I want to scream but only whine
Because I know it can't be true
Mind's gone, now legs it's up to you

I wonder if he's after my soul again tonight
Stops to whisper in the shadows but still keeps me in his sight
I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware
Don't want to get involved in my spiritual affair
I try to accept him as my partner
He still makes cold his manic laughter
But every time I try to turn around he finds my ears
That hear no sound and make me stare into the ground

Aching muscles, puff and pant, I run
To stagger home and hide behind my mum
But even when I'm safely in my bed
I know that he is waiting in my head

I wonder if he's after my soul again tonight
Stops to whisper in the shadows but still keeps me in his sight
I shout at passing strangers but they don't seem aware
Don't want to get involved in my spiritual affairEmbed
