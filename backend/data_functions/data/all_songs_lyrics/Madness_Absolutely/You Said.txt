You Said LyricsYou said you're leaving well that's okay
You said you've had enough what can I say
I suppose I'll be sad for a week or two
But in the end it's the same for me and you
We'll both sorry through and through
You said you're leaving well that's okay
You said you've had enough what can I say
I suppose I'll be sad for a week or two
But in the end it's the same for me and you
We'll both sorry through and through
Me and you
You must stop doing this you've got to change
'Cause you hold all the cards you've got the range
Every time you go away I get to think
You said you're leaving
You said this you said
You said that you said
You don't want to see me no more
You said you don't want me
To come to your door
You said, you said
I suppose I'll be sad for a week or two
But in the end it's the same for me and you
We'll both sorry through and through
Yes we do
You must stop doing this you've got to change
'Cause you hold all the cards you've got the range
Every time you go away I get to think1Embed
