Take It or Leave It LyricsHow come he enjoys himself not me? (I don't know)
How can she smile a good morning to me?
How do they make a hard day's work easy?
Tell me something I'll put it to the test
Take hold of yourself and you will see
How lucky we are to be free
Now you take for granted
Life and country
How come he jokes with friends but not me?
How can she sing out of tune not me?
How do they find time for kids on Sunday?
I can't express uncalled for agress
You're in one-way traffic can't you see?
Before a head-on crash steer free
When if it's too late
Don't come and cry to me
How come they get on with but not me?
How can they walk arm-in-arm happily?
How does that old boy dance down the street?
Tell me something I'll put it to the test
Take hold of yourself and you will see
How lucky we are to be free
Now you take for granted
Life and country
How come we never get on you and me?
How can we find out the remedy?
How does that old lady's home look neat?
How does that old lady's home look neat?
How does that old lady's home look neat?Embed
