In the Rain LyricsThere is such confusion in my mind
To play your illusion is so unkind
I didn't know who you were this afternoon
You said that it didn't matter and I'll see you soon
Standing here in the rain
Maybe the weather will change again
Change again or stay the bleeding same
How I met you in the first place I'll never know
But now I think I know you you're telling me to go, ho, ho
You said you'd be back you told me to wait here just in case
But then you never arrive and I'm waiting outside your place
Standing here in the rain
Maybe the weather will change again
Change again or stay the bleeding same
Standing here in the rain
Maybe the weather will change again
Change again or stay the bleeding same
There is such confusion in my mind
To play your illusion is so unkind
I didn't know who you were this afternoon
You said you said that doesn't matter I'll see you soon
Standing here in the rain
Maybe the weather will change again
Change again or stay the bleeding sameEmbed
