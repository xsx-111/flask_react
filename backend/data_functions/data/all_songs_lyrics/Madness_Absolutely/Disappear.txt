Disappear LyricsWalls signed with autographs
Ceilings full of echoed laughs
Something's disappear
Gurus on roller skates
Capital for swinging fetes
The area is to be cleared
A stab in the back, the smoke and the black
As it smoulders to its grave
Disappear with the fun and the fear
Another chance to misbehave
Organ tinkling organ
Marriage planning children
Spinning, round and round
Rusty swings and roundabouts
Disco's full of layabouts
Nowhere to be found
A stab in the back, the smoke and the black
As it smoulders to its grave
Disappear with the fun and the fear
Another chance to misbehave
Come on then we'll go down there
Let's see the local ash tray
Let's see if we can be happy
We'll mess about just you and me
I must try to make it home before tea
Walls signed with autographs
Ceilings full of echoed laughs
Something's disappear
Gurus on roller skates
Capital for swinging fetes
The area is to be cleared
A stab in the back, the smoke and the black
As it smoulders to it's grave
Disappear with the fun and the fear
Another chance to misbehave
A stab in the back, the smoke and the black
As it smoulders to its grave
Disappear with the fun and the fear
Another chance to misbehaveEmbed
