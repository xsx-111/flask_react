Embarrassment LyricsReceived a letter just the other day
Don't seem they wanna know you no more
They've laid it down, given you their score
Within the first two lines it bluntly read
"You're not to come and see us no more
Keep away from our door
Don't come 'round here no more
What on earth did you do that for?"
Our aunt, she don't wanna know, she says
"What will the neighbours think, they'll think
We don't, that's what they'll think, we don't"
But I will, cause I know they think I don't
Our uncle, he don't wanna know, he says
"We are a disgrace to the human race", he says
"How can you show your face
When you're a disgrace to the human race?"
No commitment, you're an embarrassment
Yes, an embarrassment, a living endorsement
The intention that you have booked
Was an intention that was overlooked
They say, "Stay away
Don't want you home today
Keep away from our door
Don't come 'round here no more"
Our dad don't wanna know, he says
"This is a serious matter
Too late to reconsider
No one's gonna wanna know ya"
Our mum, she don't wanna know, she says
"I'm feelin' twice as old", she says
"Thought she had a head on her shoulder
Cause I'm feelin' twice as older
I'm feelin' twice as older"
You're an embarrassmentEmbed
