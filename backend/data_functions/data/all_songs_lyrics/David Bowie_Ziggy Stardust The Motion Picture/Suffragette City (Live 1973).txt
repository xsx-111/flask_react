Suffragette City (Live 1973) Lyrics
Hey man, oh leave me alone you know
Hey man, oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
Hey man, I gotta straighten my face
This mellow thighed chick just put my spine out of place
Hey man, my schooldays insane
Hey man, my work's down the drain
Hey man, well she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, then she

Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
She's outta sight
She's all right

Hey man, Henry, don't be unkind, go away
Hey man, I can't take you this time, no way
Hey man, droogie don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes
Oh don't lean on me man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
She's outta sight
She's all right, yeah!
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you can't afford the ticket
I'm back from Suffragette City
Oh don't lean on me man
Cause you ain't got time to check it
I'm back from Suffragette City
She's outta sight
She's all right
A Suffragette City, a Suffragette City
I'm back on Suffragette City, I'm back on Suffragette City
Ooo, Suffraggete city, ooo, Suffragette City
Oooh-hoo, Suffragette City, oooh-how, Suffragette City, oooh-hoo
Suffragette
Ohhh, wham bam, thank you Ma'am!
A Suffragette City (Whoo!)
A Suffragette City (Whoo!)
She's so fine
A Suffragette City
Too fine
A Suffragette City, ooh, a Suffragette City
Oh, my Suffragette City, oh my Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette
Suffragette!


Thank you, goodnight!
Thank you


He's coming back!

Thank you very much
I wanted to uh...
Another vy guy tonight is in London somewhere making an album
And I think he's a friend of mine
And any way, he's one of the best songwriters out today
His name is Lou Reed
And this is one of his early things
It's called "White Light/White Heat"
