Medley: Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud / All The Young Dudes / Oh! You Pretty Things (Live 1973) Lyrics


Solemn faced
The village settles down
Undetected by the stars
The hangman plays the mandolin before he goes to sleep
And the last thing on his mind
Is the Wild Eyed Boy imprisoned
Beneath the covered wooden shaft
Folds the rope
Into its bag
Blows his pipe of smolders
Blankets smoke into the room
And the day will end for some
As the night begins for one

Staring through the message in his eyes
Lies a solitary son
From the mountain called Freecloud
Where the eagle dare not fly
And the patience in his sigh
Gives no indication
For the townsmen to decide
So the village Dreadful yawns
Pronouncing gross diversion
As the label for the dog
Oh "It's the madness in his eyes"
As he breaks the night to cry
It's really me
Really you
And really me
It's so hard for us to really be
Really you
And really me
You'll lose me though I'm always
Really free


Billy rapped all night about his suicide
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25
Don't want to stay alive when you're 25

Wendy's stealing clothes from unlocked cars
Freddy's got spots from ripping off stars from his face honey
A funky little boat race

The television man is crazy
Saying we're juvenile delinquent wrecks
But, man, I need a TV when I've got T. Rex
Hey, brother, you guessed
I'm a dude man
All the young dudes
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, yeah
Carry the news
All the young dudes, yeah
Carry the news
Boogaloo dudes, yeah
Carry the news


Wake up you sleepy head
Put on some clothes, shake up your bed
Put another log on the fire for me
I've made some breakfast and coffee
Look out my window and what do I see
A crack in the sky and a hand reaching down to me
All the nightmares came today
And it looks as though they're here to stay

Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
1, 2...
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Oh you Pretty Things
Don't you know you're driving your
Mamas and Papas insane
Let me make it plain
You gotta make way for the Homo Superior
