White Light/White Heat (Live 1973) Lyrics
(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my brain
(White light) White light gonna make me feel so insane
(White light) White heat shapin' them down to my toes
(White light) White light's got it now, goodness knows

(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my mind
(White light) White light's surely gonna make me blind
(White light) White heat shaping way down to my toes
(White light) White light could kill me now, goodness knows

Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my brain
(White light) White light gonna make me feel so insane
(White light) White heat shapin' them down to my toes
(White light) White light's got it now, goodness knows

(White light) White light gonna drive me out of my mind
(White light) White light's surely gonna make me blind
(White light) White heat shaping way down to my toes
(White light) White light could kill me now, goodness knows
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat


Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white light
Oh, oh, white heat
Oh, oh, white heat

White light
Still feels right
What's that sound, what's that sound
Don't turn on, be dead or alive
No feeling
Here she comes
Ooh, yeah
(Oh, oh, oh, oh) Here she comes
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah)
