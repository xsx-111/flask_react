Hang On To Yourself (Live 1973) Lyrics
Well she's a tongue twisting storm
She'll come to the show tonight
Praying to the light machines
She wants my honey not my money
She's a funky-thigh collector
Laying on electric dreams

Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Come on, Come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Ooh, come on

We can't dance, we don't talk much
We just ball and play
But then we move like tigers on Vaseline
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar
You're the Blessed
We're The Spiders From Mars

Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Come on
Come on

Come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Come on, well come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself
Yeah, come on, come on
We've really got a good thing going
Well come on, come on
If you think we're going to make it
You better hang on to yourself

Come one baby

Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
Come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah, come on, ah
