Airplane Lyrics
Up on the airplane
Nearer my God to Thee
I start making a deal
Inspired by gravity (Inspired by gravity)

If I did wrong, I won't do it again
'Cause I can be sweet and good and nice
And if I had enemies, they're friends
I hold on to my life with the grip of a vice

And I'm up the airplane (Up on the airplane)
Nearer my God to Thee (Nearer my God thee) (Count on the plane)
I start making a deal (La la la)
Inspired by gravity (Inspired by gravity)

That little spot on the ground is my home town
Like to call it my home and it's sweet
I'd rather take a seat down there than a throne up here
Up above thirty thousand feet
And I'm up on the airplane

I never should've read my horoscope
Or the fortune on the bubblegum strip
Saying "What you think won't happen will"
Great thing to read before a trip
On an airplane
Thought says the big blue sky's like a swimming pool
Big fluffy cloud's like a feather bed
But I'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head
Lying in my bed, which is in my hometown
Which is on the ground

Far from an airplane (My bed, my hometown)
Far from an airplane (On the ground. My bed, my hometown)
Far from an airplane (On the ground. My bed, my hometown)
On the airplane (On the ground) (I'll be making a deal)
I'm up on the airplane (On the ground) (I'll be making a deal)
On the airplane (I'll be making a deal)
(I'll be making a deal)
(I'll be making a deal)Embed
