Ghost LyricsThere's a letter on the desktop
That I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to
From our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever
From the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons
Shadowing my dreams
And the Mississippi's mighty
But it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across
With five steps down
And I guess that's how you started
Like a pinprick to my heart
But at this point you rush right through me
And I start to drown
And there's not enough room
In this world for my pain
Signals cross, and love gets lost
And time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghost
Dark and dangerous like a secret (don't tell a soul)
That gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamt about you (don't tell a soul)
Last night make me blush
Then you kissed me like a lover
Then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river
Play your memory like the Piper
And I feel it like a sickness
How this love is killing me
But I'd walk into the fingers of your fire willingly
And dance the edge of sanity
I've never been this close
In love with your ghost
Unknowing captor
You'll never know much you
Pierce my spirit
But I can't touch you
Can you hear it, a cry to be free...
Oh, I'm forever under lock and key
As you pass through me
Now I see your face before me
That would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island
As the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence
And I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles
With you always at my heels
And my bitter pill to swallow
Is the silence that I keep
It poisons me, I can't swim free
The river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch
I am no worst at most
In love with your ghost
(In love) You are shadowing my dreams (with your ghost)
(In love with your ghost)
(In love with your ghost)2Embed
