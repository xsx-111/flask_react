Cedar Tree Lyrics
You dug a well
You dug it deep
For every wife you buried
You planted a cedar tree
The best
The best you ever had

I stand where you stood
I stand for bad or good
And I am green
And you are wood
The best
The best he ever had

I dig a well
I dig it deep
And for my only love
I plant a cedar tree
The best
The best we ever hadEmbed
