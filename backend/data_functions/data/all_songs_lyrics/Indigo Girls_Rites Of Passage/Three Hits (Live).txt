Three Hits (Live) LyricsThree hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motion
One could send you down the river
Three's a strange way to be delivered
Would you trade your words for freedom
That's a barter for a blind man
Three hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motion
Are you levee'd like a treasure
Only words can help me find you
And this world's a fickle measure
I would painfully remind you
From a wise man to your red hand
You lay covered ion our best sins
Three hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motion
Well i dream you constant stranger
With your best bloods and your anger
You say mother do you claim me
My beloved do you blame me
Well the first two might release you
But the last one sings in me son
Three hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motion
Three hits to the heart son
And the last one sings in meEmbed
