Nashville Lyrics
As I drive from your pearly gates
I realize that I just can't stay
All those mountains, they kept you locked inside
And hid the truth from my slighted eyes
I came to you with a half-open heart
Dreams upon my back, illusions of a brand new start
Nashville, can't I carry the load
Is it my fault I can't reap what I sow?
Nashville, did you give me half a chance
With your southern style and your hidden dance away?
You dance away
And you dance away

All these voices, they whisper through my walls
They talk of falling fast, they say I'm losing it all
They say I'm running blind to love of my own
But I'll be walking proud, I'm saving what I still own
I fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down and I can't even see to stand
In Nashville you forgot the human race
You see with half a mind what colors hide the face
Nashville, I'd like to know your fate
I'd like to stay a while
But I've seen your lowered states today
I've seen 'em today
Honey, I swear I've seen 'em today (Alright, alright)
Now I'm leaving
I got all these debts to pay
You know we all have our dues, I'll pay 'em some other place
Ah, I never ask that you pay me back
We all arrive with more, I left with less than I had
Your town is made for people passing through
A last chance for a cause I thought I knew
But Nashville, you tell me what you are gonna do
With all your southern style, it'll never pull you through
Nashville, I can't place no blame
But if you forget my face, I'll never call your name again
No never again, no, no never again

I fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down and I can't even see to stand
In Nashville you forgot the human race
You see with half a mind what colors hide the face
Nashville, I'd like to know your fate
I'd like to stay a while
But I've seen your lowered states today
I've seen 'em today
Honey, I swear I've seen 'em today

I'm running away, I'm running away
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running awayEmbed
