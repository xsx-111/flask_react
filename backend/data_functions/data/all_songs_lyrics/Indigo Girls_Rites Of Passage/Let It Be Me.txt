Let It Be Me Lyrics
Sticks and stones, battle zones
A single light bulb on a single thread for the black
Sirens wail, history fails
Rose-colored glass begins to age and crack
While the politicians shadowbox the power ring
In an endless split decision never solve anything
From a neighbor's distant land
I heard the strain of the common man

Let it be me
(This is not a fighting song)
Let it be me
(Not a wrong for a wrong)
Let it be me
If the world is night
Shine my life like a light

Well the world seems spent and the President
Has no good idea of who the masses are
Well I'm one of them and I'm among friends
We're trying to see beyond the fences in our own backyards
I've seen the kingdoms blow like ashes in the winds of change
Yeah, but the power of truth is the fuel for the flame
So the darker the ages get
There's a stronger beacon yet
Let it be me
(This is not a fighting song)
Let it be me
(Not a wrong for a wrong)
Let it be me
If the world is night
Shine my life like a light

In the kind word you speak
In the turn of the cheek
And when your vision stays clear
In the face of your fear

Then you see turning out a light switch is their only power
When we stand like spotlights in a mighty tower
All for one and one for all
Then we sing the common call

Let it be me
(This is not a fighting song)
Let it be me
(Not a wrong for a wrong)
Let it be me
If the world is night
Shine my life like a lightEmbed
