Romeo and Juliet Lyrics
A love-struck Romeo
Sings the streets a serenade
Now he's layin' everybody low
He's got a love song that he made
He finds a convenient street light
And he steps out of the shade, and he says something like
"You and me babe, how about it?"

Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo
He nearly gave me a heart attack" yeah well
He's underneath my window, now she's singing
"Hey-la my boyfriend's back"
Oh, you shouldn't come around here
Singing up to people like that
Oh anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?

Juliet, the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet, and you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
When you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong
Julie
Well we both come up on different streets
And they were both streets of shame
You know, they're both dirty, both mean
Yes and even the dreams were the same
But I dreamed your dream for you, and
And now your dream is real, so tell me honey
Now how can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?

Now you can fall for chains of silver
And you can fall for chains of gold
You know ya, you fall for pretty strangers
And the promises they hold
Well you promised me everything, and then ya
And then ya promised me thick and thin
And now you just turn away
And say Romeo? I think I used to have a scene with him

Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above
Gonna love ya 'til I die
There's a place for us
I know you know this song
Now when you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong?
Julie, I'm so in love
So in love, yeah
But I can't do the talk
Like they talk on my TV screen
And I, I can't do a love song
Not the way you sung them to me
I can't do anything but I would
Do anything for you, oh no
I can't do anything except
Be in love with you, yeah

Now all I do is miss you
And the way it used to be, you know
And all I do is keep the beat
I keep bad, bad company
And all I do is kiss you
Through the bars of this rhyme
When Julie, I'd do the stars with you, anytime

Ah Juliet, when we made love you used to cry
You said I love you like the stars above
I'm gonna love ya 'til I die
There's a place for us
I know you know the movie song
One day we're gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong
Julie, Julie, Julie
Now this love-struck Romeo
Sings the streets a serenade
He's layin' everybody low
He's got a love song that he made
He finds a convenient street light
And he'll, he'll step out of the shade and he'll say something like
"You and me babe, how about it?"Embed
