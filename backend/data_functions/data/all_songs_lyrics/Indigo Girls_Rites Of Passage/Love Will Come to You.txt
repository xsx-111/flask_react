Love Will Come to You Lyrics
Guess I wasn't the best one to ask
Me, myself, with my face pressed
Up against love's glass
To see the shiny toy I've been hoping for
The one I never can afford
The wide world spins and spits turmoil
And the nations toil for peace
The paws of fear upon your chest
Only love can soothe that beast
And my words are paper tigers
No match for the predator of pain inside her

I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I've offered up a crystal ball to look through
Where there's now one, there will be two

I was born under the sign of Cancer
(Love will come to you)
Like brushing cloth, I smooth the wrinkles for an answer
(Love will come)
And I'm always closing my eyes (Close my eyes, wish you fine)
And wishing I'm fine (Even though I)
Even though I'm not this time (Know you're not this time)
And I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I've offered up a crystal ball to look through
Where there's now one there will be two

Dodging your memories (Dodging your memories)
A field of knives
Always on the outside looking in
On other's lives

I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
(Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true)
As if I've offered up a crystal ball to look through
(I have offered up to you)
Where there's now one there will be two

And I wish her insight
To battle love's blindness
Strength from the milk of human kindness
A safe place for all
The pieces that scatter
Learn to pretend
There's more than love that mattersEmbed
