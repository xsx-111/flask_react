Chickenman Lyrics
I am an only child
Born of the wild
Riddled to spend my time
Defending my land
You are my only one
Born in the sun
Riddled to spend your time
Defending my plan

Dead dog on the highway
Median cats are growling at me
I turn my lights on brighter
I'm counting through the night ride

And it's one more life for the taker
Chickenman Chickenman
One more song for the maker
Chickenman chickenman

On the road to Athens
Saw a dead deer on the highway
I slipped into a desert
Five prairie dogs and a rabbit
I was running down on Queen Street
I saw a woman on the sidewalk (Danger danger)
She was beaten by a stranger
(Danger danger, danger danger)
Danger danger danger

And it's one more life for the taker
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my hand
One more life for the maker
Hold my hand
Chickenman

I was on the road to Austin
Met a man on the highway
He sold me junk and conversation
He was wise and dirty from the weather

I said darkness into darkness
All the carnage of my journeys
Makes it harder to be living
He said it's a long road to be forgiven
And one more life for the taker
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my hand
One more song for the maker
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my hand

I am an only child
Born of the wild
Riddled to spend my time
Defending my land
You are the only one
Born in the sun
Riddled to spend your time
Defending my plan

I went looking for a car
Found myself beneath the stars
I went looking for a girl
Found a man and his world
Chickenman chickenman
I went looking for a car
Chickenman hold my hand
Found myself beneath the stars
Chickenman chickenman
I went looking for a girl
Chickenman hold my hand
Found a man and his world
I am an only child
Chickenman chickenman chickenman hold my hand
Hold my hand
Chickenman chickenman chickenman hold my hand
I am an only child
Chickenman chickenman chickenman hold my hand
Hold my hand
Chickenman chickenman chickenman hold my hand
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my hand
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my hand
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my hand
Chickenman chickenman chickenman
Hold my handEmbed
