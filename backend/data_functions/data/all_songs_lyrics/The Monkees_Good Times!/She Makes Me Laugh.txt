She Makes Me Laugh Lyrics
I'm so glad that I got her to think of
She's fine as any Valentine
I think about her all the time
Cross my heart and hope to die
She sends me silly messages and pictures
Directing traffic in the mall
Or posing with some brand new shoes
She never fails to surprise

She makes me laugh, she makes me smile
And I could hang out with her all day and night
She makes me laugh, she makes me cry
And I would like to be with her for awhile

I'm so glad that I got her to think of
We'll have a dinner date tonight
And play some Scrabble with the guys
And wear our pink party hats
Maybe I should take her on safari?
You'll see us wave from our canoe
If that's what she wants to do
Tell me what's wrong with that?

No matter whatever else I do
She's still the girl I should hold on to
No matter whatever else I do
She's still the girl I should hold on to
No matter whatever else I do
She's still the girl (still the girl)...
