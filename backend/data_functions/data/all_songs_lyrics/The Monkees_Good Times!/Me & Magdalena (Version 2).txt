Me & Magdalena (Version 2) LyricsMe and Magdalena
We’re driving south through Monterey
As the sun is slowly sinking
Into a distant ocean wave
And I don’t know if I’ve ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she’s under
Tell me, Magdalena
What do you see in the depths of your night?
Do you see a long lost father?
Does he hold you with the hands you remember as a child?
But know everything lost will be recovered
When we drift into the arms of the undiscovered
And I don’t know if I’ve evеr loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she’s undеr
Me and Magdalena
Always leaving early and sleeping late
Secluded in the canyon
Lost within a turn of fate
And I don’t know if I’ve ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she’s under
And I don’t know if I’ve ever loved any other
Half as much as I do in this light she’s underEmbed
