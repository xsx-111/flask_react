You Bring the Summer Lyrics
I'll bring the chips
And the dips
And root beer
Even though dark purple rain clouds are near
When you come around
You bring the summer
I'll lay the basket and blanket out neat
Even though weathermen say there'll be sleet
When you come around
You bring the summer

Summer for a sad old snowman freezing in his room (freezing in his room)
Summer from your clear blue skies
Will melt away the winter's gloom

I'll bring the sun cream
And beach volleyball
Even though there is no sand here at all
When you come around
You bring the summer
When you come around
You bring the summer
Summer for a sad old Jack Frost trying to warm his toes (trying to warm his toes)
Summer from your golden smile will paint the snow drops pinky rose

The birds and the bees will fly around me
Even though we're deep in January
When you come around, you bring the summer
I know with one bound
You bring the summer
When you come around...
Summer, baby, you bring the summer
You bring the summer around
Summer, baby, you bring the summer
You bring the summer around
Summer, baby, you bring the summer
You bring the summer around (baby!)
Summer, baby, you bring the summer
You bring the summer around
Summer, baby, you bring the summer
You bring the summer aroundEmbed
