Our Own World Lyrics
One, two, three, four

You, you blew my mind
You turned back time
You changed my tune
I looked in your eyes
Saw starry skies
The sun and moon

And you're a dreamer just like me
We don't need reality
We're in our own world (Our own little world)
We're in our own world (Our own little world)
We're in our own world
That nobody else can see
Dee dee-dee dee, dee dee-dee, dee, dee dee-dee
Dee dee-dee dee, dee dee-dee, dee, dee dee-dee

We been writing rhymes
And trading lines
It sounds so good
We been making plans
To start some bands
Just like we should
And you're a schemer just like me
Got no fear of authority
We're in our own world (Our own little world)
We're in our own world (Our own little world)
We're in our own world
That nobody else can see

And no one knows where we go or what we do
And I don't mind wasting all my time with you

'Cause you're a dreamer just like me
Really don't need reality
We're in our own world (Our own little world)
We're in our own world (Our own little world)
We're in our own world
That nobody else can see (Dee dee-dee dee, dee dee-dee, dee, dee dee-dee)
Except you and me (Dee dee-dee dee, dee dee-dee, dee, dee dee-dee)
Except you and me (Dee dee-dee dee, dee dee-dee, dee, dee dee-dee)Embed
