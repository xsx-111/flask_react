A Better World LyricsA better world is needed
I believe anyone can see it
A better world is coming
If we live as we believe
A better world is started
No need to be broken-hearted
No need for longing
We can have all we need
There’s more than enough
To feed all the hungry
To mend every broken heart
We can bring this about
If we mean it
It’s not gonna be easy
So start, so start, so start
The way we live is funny
Anyone can see it’s gonna
Take more than money
It’s gonna take all we got
The way we live is tragic
Anyone can tell it’s gonna
Take more than magic
But believe it or not
There’s more than enough
To feed all the hungry
With enough heart and soul
And if we don’t tire
We can bring this about
It’s not just my imagination
It’s not just you and me
And it’s not just two or three
It’s the whole wide world
On fire
You’ll get your money back
Your heart’s desire
A better world is needed
I believe anyone can see it
A better world is coming
If we live as we believe
A better world is started
No need to be broken hearted
No need for longing
We can have all we need
There’s more than enough (There’s more than enough)
To feed all the hungry
To mend every broken heart
We can bring this about
If we mean it
It’s not gonna be easy
So start, so start
Whole wide world
On fire
Whole wide world
On fireEmbed
