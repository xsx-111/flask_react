Little Girl LyricsLittle girl is smart as she can be, woe
Little girl has made a fool of me, woe
I believed her when she said she really loved me
The love was shining in my eyes so couldn't see the lies
In her eyes
Little girl knows more than she pretends
She knew I wanted to be more than friends
Every time she hurt me, oh how sorry she was
Yesterday she went too far and now I’m through because I'm wise
To all those lies
Friends said, "Don't worry now, she’s sweet and she's kind
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel all the time"
The little things that bothered me, I let them go by
And now it's too late to cry
Little girl, it's time that we should part
'Cause little girl, now you've broke my heart
I couldn't help but hear what they had said about you
Now I’m ashamed to tell them that I fell in love with you
They’d laugh at me (laugh at me)
Please set me free
Friends said, "Don't worry now, she’s sweet and she's kind
Don't be afraid to tell her how you feel all the time"
The little things that bothered me, I let them go by
And now it's too late to cry
Little girl, now I’m through with you
'Cause you've got everything you wanted too
Despite all those things that they said you had done
You had me believin' now that I was the one in your dreams
(In your dreams) Instead of your schemes
Little girl, woe woe
Little girl, woe woe
Little girl, woe woeEmbed
