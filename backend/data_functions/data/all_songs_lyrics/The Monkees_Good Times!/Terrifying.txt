Terrifying Lyrics
Open my eyes
And see your look back at me
So much information
When no words are spoken
I get so high
Just thinking of you
Feel just like a schoolboy
Forgetting my own name

How much do you fake
The person that you are?
How much do you fake?
It’s terrifying
When you’re around me
And death-defying
I’m terrified

You think I live my life
Never looking back, but
They’re just myths they tell you
To take you to your ripe old age
But I’ve been alone
In a house so hollow
I never thought I’d meet you
Your perfect imperfections
How much do you fake
The person that you are?
How much do you fake?
It’s terrifying
Your arms around me
And death-defying
I’m terrified
How much do you fake?
Terrifying
When you’re around me
And death-defying
I’m terrified
Each day brings another new sunriseEmbed
