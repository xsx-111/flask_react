I Know What I Know Lyrics
I know what I know
And what I know
Is I know nothing
Without you
I know what I see
And what I see
Is I see nothing
Without you
Alone I am
With waiting heart
Alone I am
A world apart
I know what I have
And what I have
Is I have nothing
Without you
I know what I feel
And what I feel
Is I feel nothing
Without you
Alone I am
Unspoken words
Alone I am
Unseen, unheard
My heart is my heart
And it is my heart
That is hopeless
Without you
I love what I love
And what I love
Is I love all things
About you
Someone alone
Always dreams of
The perfect one
Someone in love
I know what I know
I see what I see
I love what I love
Itâ€™s you that I loveEmbed
