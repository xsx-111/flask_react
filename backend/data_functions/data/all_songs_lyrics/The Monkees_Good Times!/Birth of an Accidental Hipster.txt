Birth of an Accidental Hipster LyricsAnd if I can make it home by Tuesday
That’s if I can make it home at all
I’m headed out in the sunshine, babe
Feeling to your knees
Nobody else but my only self
Do you know
Where we go?
Do you know
When we go?
High in a rooftop, singing a song
Choirs of angels all sing along
It’s late and I’m scared, so please, don’t be long
I’m still not sure where I came from
Feeling low
Gone are the doubts of clouds I had before
Gone are the blinkers ’round my eyes
I’m heading out in the sunshine, babe
Feeling to your knees
Nobody else but my only self
Do you know
Where we go?
Do you know (Old friends say, oh, he’s lost his way)
When we go? (But they can’t see what I can see)
Do you know (Oh, I’ll never come back)
Where we go? (I’m headed out in the sunshine, baby)
Do you know
Where we go?
High in a rooftop, singing a song
Choirs of angels all sing along
It’s late and I’m scared, so please, don’t be long
I’m still not sure where I came from
Feeling lowEmbed
