Gotta Give It Time Lyrics
Baby, just stop your shoving, baby
Shoving won't get you loving, babe
You gotta play it a-right or lose what's on the line
Babe, you gotta give it time
(Give it time now, baby, gotta just give it time now, baby)
Budging ain't gonna do it, baby
Gotta be much more to it, baby
Love just like a fine old vintage wine
Babe, you gotta give it time
(Give it time now, baby, gotta just give it time now, baby)

Ah, you gotta take it slow, girl
Yeah, and just let it flow, girl
Ah, and when the time is right
Just close your eyes and hold on tight now

Just give it time now, baby
Gotta just give it time now, baby
Gotta just give it time now, baby
Ah, give it time, babe
Ah, your turn
Ah
Will come a minute that you learn
You had better just stop your shoving, baby
Shoving won't get you loving, baby
Just hold back and things'll work out fine
Babe, you gotta give it time
(Give it time now, baby, gotta just give it time now, baby)

Ah, you gotta take it slow, girl
Yeah, just let it grow now
Ah, and when the time is right
Just close your eyes and hold on tight now

Gotta just give it time now, baby
Gotta just give it time now, baby
Gotta just give it time now, baby
Gotta just give it time now, baby
Gotta just give it time now, babyEmbed
