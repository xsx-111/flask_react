Good Times LyricsThere’s a good time coming on
I can feel it in my bones
Said a good time coming on
I can tell it won’t be long
’Til there’s dancing in the streets again
And music everywhere
There’ll be people wanting people, yeah
Ah, laughter everywhere
There’ll be parties after sundown
Well, everywhere you go
There’ll be hand-squeezing, ear-pleasing
Music on the radio
And I know that you wanna be there
’Cause we’re gonna have a wonderful time
We’re gonna jump to the left, right, tear down, rip it up
Ah, starting at the county line
There’s a good time coming on
I can feel it in my bones
Said a good time coming on
I can tell it won’t be long
’Til there’s dancing in the streets again
And music everywhere
There’ll be people wanting people
Ah, laughter everywhere
Harry: Instrumental
Micky: Yeah, Harry!
There’s a good time coming on
I can feel it in my bones
I said a good time coming on
I can tell it won’t be long
’Til there’s dancing in the streets again
And music everywhere
There’ll be people wanting people
Ah, laughter everywhere
(Whoa-oh) Whoa-oh
(A good time coming on) Good time coming on
(Oh, a good time coming, baby) Good time coming, yeah
(Good time coming on) Hey, good time, bop
(A good da da-da da da) Mm, ba-da ba-da ba-da…
(Ba ba-ba bop, ba-ba bop bop)
Good time coming on
Well, a good time coming on
AhEmbed
