White Blank Page Lyrics
Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body?
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly?
And can you kneel before the king
And say, "I'm clean, I'm clean"?
But tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?

A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You desired my attention
But denied my affections, my affections
So tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Oh, tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart?
Lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Oh, lead me to the truth and I
Will follow you with my whole life
Har, har, har, har, har
Har, har, har...11Embed
