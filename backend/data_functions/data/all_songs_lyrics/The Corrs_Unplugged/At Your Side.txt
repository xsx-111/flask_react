At Your Side LyricsWhen the daylight's gone
And you're on your own
And you need a friend
Just to be around
I will comfort you
I will take your hand
And I'll pull you through
I will understand
And you know that?
I'll be at your side
There's no need to worry
Together we'll survive
Through the haste and hurry
I'll be at your side
When you feel like you're alone
And you've nowhere to turn
I'll be at your side
If life's standing still
And your soul's confused
And you cannot find
What road to choose
If you make mistakes (make mistakes)
You won't let me down (let me down)
I will still believe (still believe)
I won't turn around
And you know that?
I'll be at your side
There's no need to worry
Together we'll survive
Through the haste and hurry
I'll be at your side
If you feel like you're alone (feel like you...)
And you've nowhere to turn
(Side?
I'll be at your side
(I'll be, I'll be at your side)
I'll be at your side
(I'll be, I'll be at your side)
(I'll be at your side)
I'll be at your side
There's no need to worry
Together we'll survive
Through the haste and hurry
I'll be at your side
If you feel like you're alone (feel like you?
You've got someone to go (somewhere to go?
'Cos I'm at your sideEmbed
