Everybody Hurts (Unplugged Version) LyricsWhen your day is long and the night
When the night is yours alone
When you think you've had enough of this life
Well hang on
Don't let yourself go 'cause everybody cries
And everybody hurts sometimes
Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along
When your day is night hold on
(Hold on)
(Hold on)
If you feel like letting go
(Hold on)
(Hold on)
If you're sure you've had too much of this life hang on
'Cause everybody hurts sometimes
Take comfort in your friends
And everybody hurts
Don't blow your hands
Oh
No
Don't blow your hands if you feel like you're alone
No
No
No
You're not alone
If you're on your own in this life and the days and nights are long
If you're sure you've had too much of this life to hang on
Yeah, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on 'cause no
You're not aloneEmbed
