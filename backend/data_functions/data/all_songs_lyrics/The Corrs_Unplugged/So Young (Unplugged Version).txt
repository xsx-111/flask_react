So Young (Unplugged Version) LyricsYeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
We are taking it easy
Bright and breezy, yeah
We are living it up
Just fine and dandy, yeah
And it really doesn't matter that we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter
Really doesn't matter at all
'Coz we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes
We can do it all again
We are chasin' the moon
Just running wild and free
We are following through
Every dream and every need
And it really doesn't matter if we don't eat
And it really doesn't matter if we never sleep
No it really doesn't matter
Really doesn't matter at all
'Coz we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes
We can do it all again
Yeah, we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes
We'll just do it all again
All again, all again, yeah
All again, all again
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So young now
We are so, so young now
And when tommorow comes
We'll just do it all again
Yeah, we are so young now
We are so young, so young now
And when tommorow comes
We'll just do it all again
We are so young
Yeah yeah yeah yeahie yeah
We are so young
Yeah yeah yeah yeahie yeah
We are so young
Yeah yeah yeah yeahie yeah
We are so young
Yeah yeah yeah yeahie yeahEmbed
