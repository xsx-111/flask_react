Only When I Sleep (Unplugged Version) LyricsYou're only just a dreamboat
Sailing in my head
You swim my secret oceans
Of coral blue and red
Your smell is incense burning
Your touch is silken yet
It reaches through my skin
Moving from within
And clutches at my breast
But it's only when I sleep
See you in my dreams
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But I only hear you breathe
Somewhere in my sleep
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But it's only when I sleep
And when I wake up from slumber
Your shadow's disappeared
Your breath is just a sea mist
Surrounding my body
I'm working through the daytime
But when it's time to rest
I'm lying in my bed
Listening to my breath
Falling from the edge
But it's only when I sleep
See you in my dreams
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But I only hear you breathe
Somewhere in my sleep -in my sleep-
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But it's only when I sleep
It's only when I sleep
It's reaching through my skin
Moving from within
And clutches at my breast, yeah
But it's only when I sleep
See you in my dreams -dreams-
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
But I only hear you breathe
In bed I lie
No need to cry
My sleeping cry
Hawaiian high
But its only when I sleep
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside down
Up to the sky
Where angels fly
I'll never die
Hawaiian high
But its only when I sleep
Got me spinning round and round
Turning upside downEmbed
