Old Town LyricsThe girl's a fool, she broke the rule, she hurt him hard
This time he will break down
She's lost his trust and so she must know all is lost
The system has broke down
Romance has broke down
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broken down
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broke down
She plays it hard, she plays it tough
But that's enough, the love is over
She's broke his heart and that is rough
But in the end he'll soon recover
The romance is over
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broke down

This boy is cracking up
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah hey
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broke down
I've been spending my money in the old town
It's not the same honey, with you not around
I've been spending my time in the old town
I sure miss you honey, when you're not around
You're not around this old town

This boy is cracking up
This boy has broken down, hey yeah
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broke down
This boy is cracking up - (studio version only) cracking up-
This boy has broken down, yeah yeah
This boy is cracking up
This boy has broke down
(Studio version only)
