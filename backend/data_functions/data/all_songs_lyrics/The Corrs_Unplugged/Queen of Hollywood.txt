Queen of Hollywood LyricsShe drove a long way through the night
From an urban neighborhood
She left her mother in a fight
For a dream misunderstood
And her friends they talk on corners
They could never comprehend
But there was always something different
In the way she held a stare
And the pictures that she painted
Were of glamour and of flair
And her boyfriend though he loved her
Knew he couldn't quite for fill
He could never meet her there
She's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars that there's something more
No matter what it takes no matter how she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood
And the cynics they will wonder
What's the difference with this dream
And the dreams of countless others
All believing in TV
They see their handprints in a sidewalk
Flashing cameras on the scene
And a shining limousine
She's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars that there's something more
No matter what it takes no matter how she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood
She's believing in a dream
Queen of Hollywood It's a loaded fantasy
Now her mother collects cut-outs
And the pictures make her smile
But if she saw behind the curtains
It could only make her cry
She's got hand prints on her body
Sad moonbeams in her eyes
Not so innocent a child
She's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars that there's something more
No matter what it takes no matter how she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood
Queen of Hollywood No she's never gonna be like the one before
She read it in her stars that there's something more
No matter what it takes and even though she breaks
She'll be the Queen of Hollywood
She's the Queen of Hollywood and
Her friends still talk On Corners
She's the Queen of HollywoodEmbed
