Forgiven, Not Forgotten Lyrics
All alone, starin' on
Watching her life go by
When her days are grey and her nights are black
Different shades of mundane
And the one-eyed furry toy that lies upon the bed
Has often heard her cry
And heard her whisper out a name long forgiven
But not forgotten

You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're not forgotten

A bleeding heart, torn apart
Left on an icy grave
In their room where they once lay face to face
And nothin' could get in the way
But now the mem'ries of a man are haunting her days
And the craving never fades
She's still dreamin' of a man long forgiven
But not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're not forgotten


Still alone, starin' on
Wishin' her life goodbye
As she goes searching for the man long forgiven
But not forgotten

You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
You're forgiven, not forgotten
(Da da-da da-da da-da, da, da, da, da)
You're forgiven, not forgotten
(Da da-da da-da da-da, da, da, da, da)
You're not forgotten
You're not forgotten
No, you're not forgottenEmbed
