Anything LyricsFor you, my friend, I'd do anything
Shine your shoes, anything
Lose your blues, make love to you
Take you under my wing, anything
For you, my hero, I'd do anything
Paint your picture, anything
Kiss your photograph even though I know you'd laugh
Stand beneath your wings, Oh, anything
And for you, my love, I would do anything
Kiss your feet and everything
Suffer your pain but I'd ride your train
Spread our tiny wings, baby, anything
And for you, my son, I'd do everything
Protect your mind from everything
I could read your lies, dry tears from your eyes
Spread your tiny wings, anything
'Cause everything is anything
And everything is anythingEmbed
