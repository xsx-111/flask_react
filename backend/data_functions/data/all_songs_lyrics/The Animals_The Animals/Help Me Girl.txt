Help Me Girl LyricsGirl have you ever been hungry
So hungry that you had no pride?
Well I got that feeling
That biting, gnawing deep inside
It's a funny pain
One I can't explain
You gotta help me girl
Help me girl
'Cause I'm going insane
I know about all the good things
And what that long green stuff can buy
Right or wrong it's a groove girl
Yet somehow I'm not satisfied
You gotta show me the way
Turn my night into day
You gotta help me girl
Help me girl
'Cause I'm going insane
Oh, I need someone
Someone to comfort me
Be my someone
Be my reality girl
You gotta show me the way
And turn my night into day
Help me girl
Help me girl
'Cause I'm going insane
Oh, Help me girl
Help me
Baby
Help me girl
In need your love
I need your love so bad
Help me...Embed
