Monterey LyricsThe people came and listened
Some of them came and played
Others gave flowers away
Yes they did yeah!
Down in Monterey
Down in Monterey
Young gods smiled upon the crowd
Their music being born of love
Children danced night and day
Religion was being born
Down in Monterey
The Byrds and the Airplane
Did fly
Oh, Ravi Shankar's
Music made me cry
The Who exploded
Into fired light (yeah)
Hugh Masekelas music
Was black as night
The Grateful Dead
Blew everybody's mind
Jimi Hendrix, baby
Believe me
Set the world on fire, yeah!
His majesty
Prince Jones smiled as he
Moved among the crowd
Ten thousand electric guitars
Were groovin' real loud, yeah
If you wanna find the truth in life
Don't pass music by
And you know
I would not lie
No, I would not lie
No, I would not lie
Down in Monterey
Hu! huh-huh!
Alright!
Three days of understanding
Of moving with one another
Even the cops grooved with us
Do you believe me?
Yeah!
Down in Monterey
Down in Monterey, yeah
Down in Monterey
Down in Monterey, yeah
I think that maybe I'm dreamin'!
Monterey!
Monterey-yeah!
Down in Monterey
Did you hear what I said?
Down in Monterey
That some music
Monterey
I said
Monterey, Monterey, Monterey
Yeah-yeah, hey-hey-hey
A-ay, a-ay, a-ay-a-ayEmbed
