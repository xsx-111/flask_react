San Franciscan Nights LyricsSpoken (to the intro sounds of the Dragnet theme):
This following program is dedicated to the city and people of San Francisco, who may not know it, but they are beautiful. And so is their city. This is a very personal song, so if the viewer cannot understand it, particularly those of you who are European residents, save up all your bread, and fly Trans-Love Airways to San Francisco, USA. Then, maybe, youâ€™ll understand the song. It will be worth it, if not for the sake of this song, but for the sake of your own piece of mind
Strobe light beam, creates dreams
Walls move, minds do too
On a warm San Franciscan night
Old child , young child
Feel all right
On a warm San Franciscan night
Angels sing, leather wings
Jeans of blue, Harley Davidsons too
On a warm San Franciscan night
Old angel, young angel
Feel all right
On a warm San Franciscan night
I wasn't born there
Perhaps I'll die there
There's no place left to go
San Francisco
Cops face is filled with hate
Heavens above
He's on a street called "Love"
When will they ever learn?
Old cop, young cop
Feel all right
On a warm San Franciscan night
The children are cool
They don't raise fools
It's an American dream
Includes Indians tooEmbed
