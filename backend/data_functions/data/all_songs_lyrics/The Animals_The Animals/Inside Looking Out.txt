Inside Looking Out Lyrics
Sittin' here lonely like a broken man
Sell my time and doin' the best I can
Walls and bars, they're surroundin' me
But I don't want your sympathy, yeah
Oh baby, oh baby
I just need your tender lovin'
To keep me sane in this burnin' oven
When my time is up, be my rebirth

Like Adam's work on God's green earth
My rebirth, my rebirth
Baby, yeah, I mean it's my rebirth, yeah

Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Baby, baby (Yeah, yeah)
Come on, come on (Yeah, yeah)
Come on! Yeah! (Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)

Ice cold water's runnin' in my brain
And they drag me back to work again
Pains and blisters on my minds and my hands
From livin' daily with those canvas bags
Thoughts of freedom, they're drivin' me wild
And I'll be happy like a newborn child
We'll be together, girl, you wait and see
No more walls to keep your love from me
Yeah! Can't you feel my love?
Baby, baby (Baby, baby)
Need you, squeeze you (Baby, baby)
Nobody but (Baby, baby)
You, girl, I love you (Baby, baby)
I need you, alright

I said everything's gonna be alright
And if you don't believe what I say
Just listen, baby, let me tell you

Can't you feel my love?
And can't you see my spirit?
Can't you yell, my love?
It's getting louder
It's getting louder
A little closer, yeah

I said, baby, I need you (Baby, baby)
Come on, squeeze (Baby, baby)
Please, lord! (Baby, baby)
I love you, I need you (Baby, baby)
Yeah, yeah
Right by my side
I need you here by my side
But I can't help it, baby
But I'll be home soon
I'll be home soon
Yeah, alright
Whoa!1Embed
