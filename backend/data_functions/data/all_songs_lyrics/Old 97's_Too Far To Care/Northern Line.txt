Northern Line LyricsOpal, Salley Gardens Music (BMI)
I'm dreaming on a night train
It's only been a light rain, and a darkened sky and a starry night
I'm humming on a cold train
I'm singing about the wreck of the Old 97
CHORUS:
And I'm walking through this city
I'll tell my story to the rain
And I won't come back no matter what you say
I'm feeling no pain
I don't care if I ever see your face again
I'm riding on a Northern Line
I got my money - but I got a lot of time to spend
CHORUS:
And I'm walking through this city
I'll tell my secret to the sky
And I won't come back no matter what you say
And I'm walking through this city
Yeah I'll tell my story to the rain
And I won't come back no matter what you say
No I won't come back no matter what you sayEmbed
