Curtain Calls LyricsIn a western town, beneath the northern lights
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night
You believe in cards, and you believe in signs
And I'll be leavin' soon, but I'm here tonight
On a mountainside, well below the stars
Ya' keep your lover's eyes in mason jars
And I should be scared, but I feel no fear
'cause I'll be leavin' soon, but tonight I'm here

And even if you are the one, and even if the cards are all true
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?
Well the Southern P. moved her family down
Then along came me to her sleepy town
I don't believe in cards, I don't believe in signs
But I'll be leavin' soon, I'm here tonight

And even if you are the one, and even if I tried to be true
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?
In a western town, beneath the northern lights
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night
Don't believe in me, did I make that clear?
'cause I'll be long gone soon, but tonight I'm here
And even if you were the one, I didn't wanna walk out on you
But when the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?
And when the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?
And when the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?Embed
