Broadway LyricsIn a hotel room just off Times Square it's like a closet
I can watch the dancing class go round
In a hotel room that costs as much as my apartment
I can watch the working class go down
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight -
Broadway, Broadway
In a hotel room just off Times Square they made a monster
He was unaware of what went down
Fattening him up just like a calf before a slaughter
He'd had his fill of hollow town
And it's enough to make a stupid man think straight
Broadway, Broadway
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight
Broadway, Broadway, Broadway, BroadwayEmbed
