Beer Cans LyricsI got laid off my job a week ago today
Now I just can't bring myself to apply for welfare pay
Now I'm walking down that big ol' interstate
I never thought that this would ever be my fate

I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
It's the only thing I ever wanna do
I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
I gotta save my dough so I can marry you

Well, you can drop me off on Highway 34
Well I hear they got some beer cans there
And I gotta get some more
Drive me into town so we can cash 'em in
And we will never have to live in sin

Just picking up beer cans on the highway
Well, it's the only thing I ever wanna do
I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
I gotta save my dough so I can marry you

Well, in a ditch I see a flashy shining thing
Oh well, it's only a pop-top, but it reminds me of a ring
The wedding ring you wear the day you marry me
That's the day I'm gonna be in ecstasy
I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
Well, it's the only thing I ever wanna do
I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
I gotta save my dough so I can marry you
I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
It's the only thing I ever wanna do
I'm just picking up beer cans on the highway
I gotta save my dough so I can marry you
I gotta save my dough so I can marry youEmbed
