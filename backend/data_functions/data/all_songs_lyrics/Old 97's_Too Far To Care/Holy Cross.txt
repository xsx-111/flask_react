Holy Cross Lyrics
You work for 37 years
Driving trucks
Not shifting gears
He never got it in his head
To settle down
He'd never wed
He liked the river how it flowed
Unlike the breaker
Never to explode
It had no wires running in
It just went on and on and on
Until the ocean got to it
Holy Cross
Electric Association
Oh well it's more than a jobâ€¦
It's more like a damnation
Well it was my life
Now it's my loss
Holy Cross
It was a honey of a night
He met his maker
He saw the light
The car was passing on a curve
He never slowed down
He never swerved
And in the hot glare of the lamps
He had regrets
He'd never learned to dance
There was no angel at his side
There was a purpose
That became homeless when he died
Holy Cross
Electric Association
Oh well it's more than a job...
It's more like a damnation
Well it was my life
Now it's my loss
Holy Cross
Electric Association
Oh well it's more than a job...
It's more like a damnation
Well it was my life
Now it's my loss
Holy Cross
Well it was my life
Now it's my loss
Holy Cross
Well it was my life
Now it's my loss
Holy Cross
