No Doubt About It LyricsI think you’re the sweetest thing
And I like your talk
I like your curly hair, honey
And I like your walk
I like the way you hold me
I like your eyes of blue
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over with you
I like the way you smile
I like your dimpled chin
I like to see you laugh
And I like to see you grin
I like the way you hold me
I like everything you do
There’s no doubt about it
I’m in love with you

Oh, when you hold me my poor heart skips a beat
Ooh, when you kiss me you knock me off my feet
I like your little stories
I like everything you do
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over you
I like the way you smile
I like your dimpled chin
I like to see you laugh
And I like to see you grin
I like the way you hold me
I like everything you do
There’s no doubt about it
I’m in love with you

Oh, when you hold me my poor heart skips a beat
Ooh, when you kiss me you knock me off my feet
I like your little stories
I like everything you do
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over you
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over you
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over you
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over you
There’s no doubt about it
I’m crazy over youEmbed
