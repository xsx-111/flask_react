Niteclub LyricsEighteen-hundred miles from this old nightclub
A girl is turning 22 today
How am I supposed to entertain you?
My fingertips are worthless when my mind's so far away
Eighteen-hundred miles from Manhattan
The nightclub yawns and opens up it's doors
Thank god that I don't have to pay the cover
'Cause every night I'm broker than I was the night before
Yeah this old nightclub stole my youth
This old nightclub stole my true love
It follows me around from town to town
I just might get drunk tonight and burn the nightclub down
I just might get drunk tonight and burn the nightclub down
Telephones make strangers out of lovers
Whiskey makes the strangers all look good
Well my angel of the morning is in mourning
My life was misspent, don't let me be misunderstood
And this old nightclub stole my youth
This old nightclub stole my true love
It follows me around from town to town
I just might get drunk tonight and burn the nightclub down
I just might get drunk tonight and burn the nightclub downEmbed
