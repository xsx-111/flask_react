Melt Show LyricsIn the front row at the Melt show
I fell in love with you and that was three weeks ago
We fooled around, you let me have it for free
Yeah it worked out real nice
I showed you how to and you showed me paradise
Now you're killing time, and it's killing me
Is this more than some old summer fling?
And this thing we have, will it mean anything?
When October rolls around will you sober up and let me down?
Will you sober up and let me?
There's a schoolyard out the back door
I used to love it but I don't believe in school no more
You don't learn anything, you're just waitin' around
With your big brains and your know-how
If there's a reason you'd have figured it out by now
A little gettin' some's good, while you're waitin' around
Is this more than some old summer fling?
And this thing we have, will it mean anything?
When October rolls around will you sober up and let me down?
Will you sober up and let me?
Now my bad dream is my best friend
You were here last night but now you're gone again
I'm getting tired of you getting tired of me
Is this more than some old summer fling?
And this thing we have, will it mean anything?
When October rolls around will you sober up and let me down?
Will you sober up and let me down?
Will you sober up and let me?Embed
