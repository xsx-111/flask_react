Four Leaf Clover Lyrics

I got a four-leaf clover
It ain't done one single lick of good
I'm still a drunk
I'm still a loser
Living in a lousy neighborhood

I got a real live horseshoe
And I hung it upside-down above my door
But it don't do nothing to attract you
So I don't know what the hell it's for

Why don't you come over?
I'll show you my four-leaf clover
Who'm I trying to kid?
I'm not the kind of guy you'd go for…
I got a four-leaf clover
But I ain't got no hope of getting you


I got a…ou…
I got a lucky silver dollar
My granddad gave it to me, now he's dead
At times like this, I wish that I could join him
It might just stop this pounding in my head
Why don't you come over?
I'll show you my four-leaf clover
Who'm I trying to kid?
I'm not the kind of guy you'd go for…
I got a four-leaf clover
But I ain't got no hope of getting you
I ain't got no hope of getting you
I ain't got no hope of getting you…ou…
