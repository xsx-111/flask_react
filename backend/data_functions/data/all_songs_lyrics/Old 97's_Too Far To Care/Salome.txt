Salome LyricsSalome, uncross your heart
I know what goes on inside it's over before it starts
Well I'll stay all night, I'll wait right here
Full moon might work magic, girl but I won't disappear
And I'm tired of makin' friends
And I'm tired of makin' time
And I'm sick to death of love
And I'm sick to death of tryin'
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you
Salome, untie my hands
Well I'll find another lady
And you'll wreck another man
It's over now, and so are we
My blood's turned to dirt girl
You broke every part of me
And I'm tired of makin' friends
And I'm tired of makin' time
And I'm sick to death of love
And I'm sick to death of tryin'
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you
And I'm tired of makin' friends
And I'm tired of makin' time
And I'm sick to death of love
And I'm sick to death of tryin'
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for you
And it's easier for you
Yeah it's easier for youEmbed
