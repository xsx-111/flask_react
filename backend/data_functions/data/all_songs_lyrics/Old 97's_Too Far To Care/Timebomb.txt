Timebomb Lyrics
I got a timebomb, in my mind Mom
I hear it ticking but I don't know why
I call the police, but they don't like me
I hear 'em whispering when I walk by
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhh oohhhh

I got a landmine in my bloodline
I'm not immune to getting blown apart
She's like a claymore, that's what she's there for
She's waiting 'round here to get blown apart
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhh

Having her on my brain's like getting hit by a train
She's gonna kill me
Oh Celeste
Oh Celeste
Oh Celeste
Oh Celeste

I got a timebomb, in my mind Mom
It's gonna go off, but I don't know when
I need a doctor to extract her
I got a feeling she'd get right back in again
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhh oohhhh
I got a timebomb, in my mind Mom
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl
She's gonna kill me, and I don't mean softly
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl
Ohhhhhh ohhhhhh

Having her on my brain's like getting hit by a train
She's gonna kill me
Oh Celeste
Oh Celeste
Oh Celeste
Oh Celeste

Oh CelesteEmbed
