W. TX. Teardrops LyricsWell the roadmaps of West Texas
Never gave me good advice
The trains all roll where the roads don't go
Now I lay awake at night
Just wondering where the rest is
So I hit that iron gate
And I yelled good-bye to that wife of mine
I may be running late
I'm a-rolling on
I'm a-rolling on
Rolling out past El Paso, Texas
Where I might have had a home
I made my bed
So here I lie
I'm rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye
Though I felt a lonesome feeling
In Dulce, New Mexico
I was happier than I'd ever been
In my El Paso home
But I thought about the woman
Whom I left to roam the land
And I cried so much
It dug a rut they call the Rio Grande
I'm a-rolling on
I'm a-rolling on
Rolling out past El Paso, Texas
Where I might have had a home
I made my bed
So here I lie
I'm rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye

And my destination is written
Upon my feet
And the stars above
Are about the only company I keep
I raise my pass and
Take my seat
I'm rolling fast
With a teardrop on my cheek…
So I guess there'll be no family
So I guess there'll be no wife
Gonna roll away on an old steel dray
It's gonna be my life
And the roadmaps I been reading
I never came to figure out
All I know is I'd explode
By any other route
I'm a-rolling on
I'm a-rolling on
Rolling out past El Paso, Texas
Where I might have had a home
I made my bed
So here I lie
I'm rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye
I'm a-rolling on
I'm a-rolling on
Rolling out past El Paso, Texas
Where I might have had a home
I made my bed
So here I lie
I'm rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye
I'm rolling West Texas teardrops in my eye
Yeah, I'm rolling West Texas tear…drops in… my eye…Embed
