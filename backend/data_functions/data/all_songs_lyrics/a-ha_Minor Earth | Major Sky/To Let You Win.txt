To Let You Win LyricsYou know I always had the strength to fight
But I got tired of the wars at night
Thinking they would end if I gave in
But I wasn't strong enough to let you win
To let you win
To let you win
I knew the fight but I didn't know the cost
And how to stop the wheels when they're in spin
I thought you couldn't love a man who'd lost
But I wasn't strong enough to let you win
To let you win
To let you win
It used to scare me to wake up wondering
If I'd forgotten what I was fighting for
You said that you were weak and I was strong
But I wasn't strong enough to let you win
To let you win
To let you win
To let you win
You know I always had the strength to fight
But I got tired of the wars at night
Thinking they would end if I gave in
But I wasn't strong enough to let you win
To let you win
To let you winEmbed
