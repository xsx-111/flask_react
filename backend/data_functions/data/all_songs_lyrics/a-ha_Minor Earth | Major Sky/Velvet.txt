Velvet Lyrics(Aah-aah-aaah, aah-aah-aah)
Her skin is like velvet, her face cut from stone
Her eyes when she's smiling will never reach home
But hear how she sings (aah-aah-aaah, aah-aah-aah)
Her touch would be tender, her lips would be warm
But when we're together I'm always alone
But hear how she sings (aah-aah-aaah, aah-aah-aah)
But hear how she sings (aah-aah-aaah, aah-aah-aah)
But hear how she sings
Her skin is like velvet, so I went to her home
Her place like a palace with things you can't own
Her skin is like velvet
But hear how she sings (aah-aah-aaah, aah-aah-aah)
But hear how she sings (aah-aah-aaah, aah-aah-aah)
(Aah-aaah, aah-aah, aah-aah, aah-aah)2Embed
