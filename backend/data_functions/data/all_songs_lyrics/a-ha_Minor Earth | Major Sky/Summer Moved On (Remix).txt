Summer Moved On (Remix) LyricsSummer moved on
And the way it goes you can't tag along
Honey moved out
And the way it went leaves no doubt
Moments will pass
In the morning light I found out
Seasons can't last
And there's just one thing left to ask
Stay
Don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around
Friendships move on
And until the day you get along
Handshakes unfold
And the way it goes no one knows
Moments will pass
In the morning light I found out
Seasons can't last
So there's just one thing left to ask
Stay
Don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
With nobody else around
Don't just walk away
With nobody else around
Seasons can't last
And there's just one thing left to ask
Stay
Don't just walk away
And leave me another day
A day just like today
Stay
Don't just walk away
With nobody else around
Summer moved onEmbed
