If You Got It At Five, You Got It At Fifty LyricsRock N Roll
Has such a terrible name
Who is to blame?
Perching birds drug by a string in the air
Stitched together with careless intention
Cleaner than the dagger that hollowed it out
Masked and forgotten or no face at all
It’s got something or nothing to say
Yeah don’t we all?
A trance and a trust fund stitched at the same time and sold to the hogs
All eyes on you
Whatever it takes
The bottom line is
The only one that you’ll cross
Keep selling what they want to hear
Arrogant and insincere
You’ve got something to say, but what’s the pay?
A million before you and more in line
I’ve seen it a thousand times
Built to die and dying
Built to last and lasting
Go along to get along
I will not be defiled
By the kings’ meat
By the kings’ meat
By the kings’ meat
The noise ain’t noise anymore
Who’s to blame?
Who’s to blame?
You and I
The noise ain’t noise anymore
Who’s to blame?
Who’s to blame?
You and IEmbed
