Wrongdoers LyricsThis is just a tragedy. Just another tragedy
Feel the grave slide across my throat
I’ll live, or die and then forget the trip, forget the war, forget the struggle
Failure on repeat
Drive for miles just to turn around and play it back again
Failure on repeat
We came for killing. Hopeless yes we know but we don’t mind
Careful not to cut yourself
Unhand the knife drawer and please replace the moon with the sun
I know it’s hell to hope the feeling of knowing destruction isn’t forever, take it or leave it
We make love to the same mistakes and never get tired
Embrace the lover, make yourself comfortable
Whatever keeps me up. So fine, take this love and be gone I’m done
I always remind you. Forget the pain and take the initiative
I guess we just consume danger so keep your hands out of your pockets and know
I will never listen! I will never learn! Eat the ice and kiss this place goodnight
We came for killing. Hopeless yes we know but we don’t mind
Blood for the bridle. Flood of red as far as we can see
Careful not to cut yourself
Unhand the knife drawer and please replace the moon with the sun
We make love to the same mistakes and never get tired
Embrace the lover, make yourself comfortable
Whatever keeps me up. So fine, take this love and be gone I’m done
I always remind you. Forget the pain and take the initiative
We make love to the same mistakes
Whatever keeps me up. So fine, take this love and be gone I’m done
I always remind you. Forget the pain and take the initiative
I will never listen! I will never learn!2Embed
