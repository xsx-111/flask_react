The Potter Has No Hands LyricsSpeaking madness while I strive for a wordless language
You cry experience at the top of your lungs
Can you make it loud?
Just make it loud. Make it loud as hell
Molding the truths of unawareness
Search and destroy to fill the void at any result
So keep it down, just keep it down
I’m gonna ride this train till the end, the last stop is the cemetery
Cough up your last kill
You used to live now you just fertilize so breathe out all your last words
You used to live now you just fertilize
And waste your life trying to make memories
Wear it with pride because it’s all that you’ve got
You just don’t get it, yeah you just don’t get it
Make it loud, just make it loud. Make it loud, just make it loud as hell
Ill rest here every night and propel my evils to him who hears me
Even in the stillness of thought
Even in the noise of your anger
Even in the silence of prayer
Cough up your last kill
You used to live now you just fertilize so breathe out all your last words
You used to live now you just fertilize
Make it so loud that the words are lost
Make it so loud that their stomachs are filled with the gold that they endlessly seek
Make it so loud that they open their eyes
Make it so loud that the trees that they worship
Shake to their roots
Make it loud!
Don’t want to hear a word they have to sayEmbed
