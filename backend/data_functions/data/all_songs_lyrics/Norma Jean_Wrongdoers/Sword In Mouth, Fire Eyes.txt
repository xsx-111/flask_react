Sword In Mouth, Fire Eyes Lyrics
We calmly weigh our thoughts before we know them
Careful not to break our only scale
But there’s no lament in taking chances
Fall a little while before we soar

Sword in mouth and helpless in the bond we have between us
Fire eyes and desperate for the helplessness we love

Turn to walk the path in my reflection
But not before the sheep becomes the wolf
Loveless without shame. I was only waiting for the calm before the storm
The tongue was being sharpened by the lie

Sword in mouth and helpless in the bond we have between us
Fire eyes and desperate for the helplessness we love

Tell us all the things we need to know now
You’ll find us in the silence of our own guilt
Shout it from the hell below
Shake us but be gentle so
Take our hand walk us through
Take my hand walk me through the land I stole
Help us to lay down
Sword in mouth and helpless in the bond we have between us
Fire eyes and desperate for the helplessness we loveEmbed
