Hive Minds LyricsA vine in the cracks of a life’s work
Shifting and flowing up
To find purpose under the sun
A moment of reprieve for the art born from the dirt that’ll tear it all down
You can’t fault the natural order of things
Yeah, someday these bones will be dust beneath a sprawling city of human achievement
Flowing up for a place under the sun
Do you see it now?
The gold on your back weighing you down?
Come down
Do you see it now, do you see it?
Pride is a cancer born from the cracks and crawling skyward
I have been you, the shell on the street corner with change
A sunset car ride with a bottle of meds, or is it the canopy and rooftops?
A burst of soft color and a haze on your limbs
Do you see it now?
The gold on your back weighing you down
Come down
Do you see it now, do you see it? (x2)
Now, do you see it now, do you see it?
The vines will come for you
They always do, they came for me too
Gravity may not be a law but all things will find ground
Pride is a cancer born from the cracks and crawling skyward
I have been you, the shell on the street corner with change
Hungry hands
The vines will come for you
They always do, they came for me too
Gravity may not be a law but all things will find ground
We all know it exists (x3)
Do you see it now, do you see it?
Do you see it now, do you see it? (x2)
Laid out under the orange red
Sun showers in your head on the palms soaked rooftops you’ll never find
Begging for death from the cancer of pride
On that empty street corner I’ll keep walking
I will leave you behind1Embed
