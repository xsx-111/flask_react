Neck In The Hemp LyricsI’m only gonna tell you one time! I am absolutely over you
But the fact remains that I was never beneath you
So just give me one reason to fall in line
Cause at the end of the day I just forget to care
I just forget you exist and I move on
Oh yeah, one more thing, and you should write this down
My patience is thick but the fuse has been cut
And the vital flame has been replaced
And while you’re at it can you autograph this DNR?
Don’t you worry there’s a carbon print for my records
I’ll be sure to keep it safe and sound
For the love of God, do not resuscitate
You are the heir of a neck in the hemp
I am the son of a gun that has the rope
That’s not a wall I’d want to hide behind
It’s not getting any younger and it’s about to fall
I’ll be on the other side pushing as hard as I can
Let’s not have any doubts about this I will celebrate from your…
Death is not the rebellion of life!Embed
