Afterhour Animals LyricsRelax, you are loved
Breathe in and breath out
You are warm, loved, and comfortable
Focus on your breathing, breathe deeply and evenly
Lay back, close your eyes
Relax and listen, to my voice
You will sink deeper and deeper into total calm, comfortable, silence
Inside you will feel clean, clear, perfect, and stillEmbed
