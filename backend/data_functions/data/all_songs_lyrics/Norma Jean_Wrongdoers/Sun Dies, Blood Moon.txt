Sun Dies, Blood Moon LyricsHave no fear and open your eyes and observe the glowing room
Through the blood that runs through your eyelids, I guess it’s time to wake
Moving hours with vacant hands just for the chance just to sleep again
Drag my feet across the earth yeah I guess that nothings restored
Make my through my designer home
To the heart of my captivity
Where I am both prisoner and warden
All I need is the air inside my lungs, or a cigarette
Life is blank without the flame
It’s ok cause I am still within the womb
Watching from the inside, the inside
The great things wait just past the horizon
They lose their glow when the lights hit their skin
Outstretched hands I’ll flee and to nothing I will open the door
The sun is dead, or maybe just fading out
It hits my skin for the first time in days and days
As I slip into the air I feel the warmest winter
That I can remember
Breathless is the empty world
Aimlessly walking through a vacant city
The architecture is all alone
If this is the end I don’t feel a damn thing
My tired feet matter no more
It seems the things I tend to believe always fall to my feet
To dig my shallow graves
You must have felt this, before you even woke up
You should have known it years ago
You must have felt this, before you even woke up
You should have known it years ago
(You should have known
You should have known, Yeah!
You should have known
You should have known)
Do not be surprised my friend
You make your own decisions
You worked hard, you fought the good fight
The taste of copper in a failed mouth full of broken teeth
And the sounds, the sounds of excuses
I’ll count my blessings on the fingers of the unbit hand
Empty of reason, goodbyes on the tip of my tongue forever
And so it goes
I must have seen it, before I even woke up
I should have known it years ago
I will storm the gates of hell
I will kill the queen of death herself
Shadowless in the last direct light of the drowning sun
I will storm the gates of hell
I will kill the queen of death herself
Shadowless in the last direct light of the drowning sunEmbed
