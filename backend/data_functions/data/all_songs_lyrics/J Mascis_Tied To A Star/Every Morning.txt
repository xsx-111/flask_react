Every Morning Lyrics
Set up in the morning running in the afternoon
Stayed out past the morning someone peeled it off too soon

Every morning makes it hard on me
Every morning makes it hard on me
Then I wake to who I'll never be
Then it hits me it's the life I lead

Set up in the morning said I gave away too soon
Wish I had a morning didn't know what else to do

Every morning makes it hard on me piece together what could never be
In the wait I heard you'll never see give it up I can always be

Oh baby won't you see me
Oh baby won't you see me
See me

Every morning makes it hard on me
Every morning makes it hard on me
Then I wake to who I'll never be
And it hits me it's the life I lead
Oh baby won't you see me
Oh baby won't you see me
See me

Ain't nobody know it
Ain't nobody know it
Ain't nobody know it
Ain't nobody know it

Every morning makes it hard on me
Every morning makes it hard on me
Then I wake to who I'll never be
And it hits me it's the life I lead
Every morning makes it hard on me
Every morning makes it hard on me
Try to give you something I can't be
Tried, but you still made it hard on meEmbed
