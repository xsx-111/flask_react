Wide Awake LyricsI’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
Come on over baby
Time to figure out
Dreaming of the reason
What will bring you around
I’m wide awake, I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake, I’m wide awake
Waiting for an answer, waiting for the time
Thinking of a way out
Not sure where to hide
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
Come on over baby
Glancing me a chill
Walking in your footsteps
Walking by your will
Twisted in the ancient
Torn apart with lies
Scoured all the pages
Not enough to find
Here at last
Sneaking past
Came out stuck
Set me up
Set me up
I'm wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awake
I’m wide awakeEmbed
