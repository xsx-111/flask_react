Heal the Star LyricsEverybody's rolling downtown
Everybody's rolling out
I could use a little downtown
I could use a bit less down
Several pieces brewing downtown
Played it off like it was me
Tried to feed some order downtown
Hard to break it, hard to leave
Everybody listens
Everybody sees
Every seed's tomorrow
Overcoming me
Said my people running downtown
Tied my people to a star
Ran a ladder to through downtown
I still wonder where you are
Heal the star heal the star
Heal the star heal the star
Heal the star heal the star
Heal the star heal the starEmbed
