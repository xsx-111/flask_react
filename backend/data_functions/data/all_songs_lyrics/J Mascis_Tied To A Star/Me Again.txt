Me Again LyricsTell me everything you heard
Daunting and a bit unsure
Fields have gotten insecure
Gotta take it on your word
Said my mind is overrun
Said I'm free again
No, it cannot be undone
Not 'til I'm free again
Sent my mind some other place
Said my mind that no more space
And I begged you not to go
Look like you already know
Maybe section made of me
Guess I'm free again
Questioning my recipe
Unless it's free again
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Gettin' no more sleep
Traced the scourge right out of me
Am I free again
Heaved a load into the sea
Get me free again
Crying out for outer space
Said it's free again
Only seconds off the pace
Wish it was me again
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental me
Sentimental meEmbed
