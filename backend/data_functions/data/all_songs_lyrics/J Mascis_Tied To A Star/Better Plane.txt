Better Plane LyricsWhen I go on
When I got off you told me 'bout the Better Plane
You told me everything I need
When I go on
When I got lost you told me how it's gonna be
Could they save some space for me
There selling nothing really
Got what it takes to see me
I lost out
Walked right out
The pain is there to greet me
The pain is there to feed
Shaky grasp
It's coming fast
When I go off
When I get off she told me 'bout the Better Plane
I needed everything and more
When I get off
When I go off the point was never meant to be
Slices right through me to the core
Can I go out and see me
Can I go out and meet
To get me high
To get me wry
Will I be there to meet you
Will I be there to see
Now you're finally here
Then you disappear
When I go on...
When I go on...
When I go on...Embed
