Stumble LyricsI only left it where you know
I packaged everything to let you go again
This time we'll share a time 
If it becomes you well it's 
Don't expect me to go
Don't expect it to show, darling
Follow me cause I'm low, let me in
I know the future's lost 
I know it's gone and I can't make another man
I know the picture's not that strong
I go and leave it stuck outside your house for now
Don't expect me to know
Don't just put up up a show, darling
Follow me cause I'm slow, 
Can I leave?
Can I wonder?
Get me under
Over the pain
I'm in deep
There's a number
Just to read it out
Tear up the rain
Don't expect me to know
Don't expect it to show, darling
Follow me it's a no, let me in
Give me the pot I won't stir
Don't you attract me to her, darling
No I don't take your word
All your friends
Don't expect me to know
Don't just put up up a show
Follow me cause i'm slow, Embed
