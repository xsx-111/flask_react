And Then LyricsI gave more than I believe
Travel alone it's failing me
Trailin' me trailin' me
To the sea to the sea
And then
To the outer reef
Feel the way I never felt explain again
Just to know you
And then
Release another piece of everywhere and when
I'm below you
And then
And then
And then
My friend
Drifting cause the piece was there alone we were about to blaze
Picture of a mister in the book of your another place
Another waste
Nothing's real or ever was
Down to you is ground to us
Who to trust who to trust
All the dust all the dust
And then
To the outer reef
Wrapped inside the biggest time we're over run
Just to know you
And then
Explain to me another way to get it done
Who will I go to
This friend
This friend
This friend
And then
Drifting cause the piece was there alone we were about to blaze
Picture of a mister in the book of your another place
Another waste
And then
And then
And then
And thenEmbed
