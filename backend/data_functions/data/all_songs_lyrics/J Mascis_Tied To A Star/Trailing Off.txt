Trailing Off LyricsDark expanses prove enough
Hard to function in this town
I left tired and unsure
Fidgety and insecure
An illusion sets it off to close
Wishin me the moon
If I knew you needed me the most
I'm paradin on the side
I left everything behind
Twist a piece over my head
I've been laying here instead
I forgot to save a piece for me
Feeling empty as I'm left
If it matters not enough to see
How much can I take?
On me
Oh me
Jumbled up I made a move
I got less and less to prove
Got another off my mind
The pain can't be far behind
Drove another spark right out of me
Will I recognize the sound?
Trailing off still not enough to be
Not enough to me
How much can I take?Embed
