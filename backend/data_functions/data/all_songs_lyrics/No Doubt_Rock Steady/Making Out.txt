Making Out Lyrics
Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

I’m on the second floor with a lock on my door
I’m looking at a picture of your face
The last time I looked, you were looking really good
But somehow pictures fade

And we’re on the phone, we’re all alone
And that just ain’t good enough
I go around the world to see your face
'Cause this just ain’t good enough

So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out

(Here comes a little one)
Sip my morning tea but you’re not next to me
Here goes another day
And driving in my car, I wonder how you are
While our favorite music plays
The flowers arrive to my surprise
But that just ain’t good enough
And I got the note, it gave me hope
But that just ain’t good enough

So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out
So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out

Yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oo, oo!
Oo, oo!
Oo, oo!
Oo, oo!

Soon you’ll be here with me
(Making out)
Soon you’ll be right here with me
(Woo!)
(Making out)
I’m with my friends, 'till the night ends
But that just ain’t good enough
And honestly you can trust me
But that just ain’t good enough

So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out
So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out
So I’m just kickin' it, I’m counting the days
I hardly can wait, for us to hang out
I’m really missing it in so many ways
I anticipate us making out2Embed
