Hella Good Lyrics
The waves keep on crashin' on me for some reason
But your love keeps on comin' like a thunderbolt
Well come here, a little closer
'Cause I wanna see you, baby, real close up
(Get over here, get over here)

You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' (Keep on dancin')

A performance deserving of standing ovations
And who would've thought it'd be the two of us?
(I didn't really think it could ever happen, haha)
So don't wake me if I'm dreamin'
'Cause I'm in the mood, come on and give it up
(Oh, oh, oh)

You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' (Keep on dancin')
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' (Keep on dancin')
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
(I never thought that but I've been trapped by what happened)

You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' (Keep on dancin')
You got me feelin' hella good
So let's just keep on dancin'
You hold me like you should
So I'm gonna keep on dancin' (Keep on dancin')

(Uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh)
(Uh, uh, uh)
(Keep on dancin')
(Keep on dancin')4Embed
