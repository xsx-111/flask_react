Start the Fire Lyrics
Go on and baby get the lighter
We’re gonna start the fire

The army of words in me
Silent the soldier weeps
Lying here back to back
Waiting for you to react
And sometimes all I need is a good push
Roll over and whisper some goodness
Go on baby you be he hero
Now can we go back to zero?

Go on and get the lighter, we’re gonna need some fire
Let’s get a little higher, the battlefield is tired
Nevermind all that
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire

Just come here and cuddle up
I feel a little rough
I missed you in my sleep
Are you still mad at me?
The moon must have mended my bad mood
Come kiss me the way you meant to
Last night I was just playing
Lets put it all away and…
Go on and get the lighter, we’re gonna need some fire
Let’s get a little higher, the battlefield is tired
Nevermind all that
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire
Start the fire

Climb in and love me
Climb in and love me

Had quite a heavy night
So delicate our love and pride
The most stubborn girl around
You really know how to bring me down
One more famous night to remember
Let’s laugh at my silly temper
Now let’s burn the morning sweetly
Get over here now and complete me

Go on and get the lighter, we’re gonna need some fire
Let’s get a little higher, the battlefield is tired
Nevermind all that
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire
Go on and baby get the lighter, we’re gonna start the fire1Embed
