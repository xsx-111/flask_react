In My Head Lyrics
I try to think about rainbows
When it gets bad
You got to think about something
To keep from going mad
I try to think about big fat roses
When the ship starts going down
But my head is wicked jealous
Don’t want to talk about it right now

Long distance, don’t talk about
Ex-girlfriends, don’t talk about
You without me, don’t talk about
The past

In my head
It’s only in my head
In my head
It’s only in my head

There’s just something about you
That gets me in a twist
And sometimes I think that cupid
Is just taking the piss
It only takes one word or idea
To send me in real deep
So if you think you’re clever
Use the right words when you talk to me
Long distance, don’t talk about
Ex-girlfriends, don’t talk about
You without me, don’t talk about
The past

In my head
It’s only in my head
In my head
It’s only in my head

I really think I have a problem
I really can’t control myself
Why do I get so suspicious?
Do you want someone else?
Cause everybody wants everybody else…

In my head
It’s only in my head
In my head
It’s only in my head
In my head
It’s only in my head
In my head
It’s only in my head1Embed
