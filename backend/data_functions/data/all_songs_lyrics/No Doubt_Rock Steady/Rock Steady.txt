Rock Steady Lyrics
Our love is rock steady

Love is like a punishment
Homegirl here to represent
So innocently you seem to come my way
While Tinkerbell and Cupid play
They sit there and they laugh
I sit here and I can’t believe my eyes
You found me at last
But we’re too human to see the way we’ll agonize

A real love survives
A rock steady vibe
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

Steady now stop rocking it
It’s a delicate environment
Retired but sleeping is our shanty love
Be careful now, don’t wake it up

It’s never gonna last
It’s never gonna make it back alive
So now can we relax?
I really hope that we will actually survive
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

It’s never gonna last
It’s never gonna make it back alive
So now can we relax?
I really hope that we will actually survive

A real love survives
A rock steady vibe
A real love survives
A rock steady vibe

Our love is so rock steady2Embed
