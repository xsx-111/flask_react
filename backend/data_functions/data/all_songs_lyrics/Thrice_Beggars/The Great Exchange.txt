The Great Exchange Lyrics
I crewed on a fair golden ship that
Went down at the dawn of the world
We mutinied and sentenced our captain to die
'Fore our sails had barely unfurled

We sank shortly after our riot
Wanton flame and our powder kegs met
While I swam for my life there came voices aloft
Joyful, unearthly and dread

Singing of a violent
Tireless mystery
That one would give his life to
Save his enemy

Too bone-tired to keep my arms moving
To swim or even grasp after straws
The undertow drew me down into its cold
Its infinite indigo jaws

I heard singing of a violent
Tireless mystery
That one would give his life to
Save his enemy
I thought I must be dead or dreaming
When my captain, still battered, betrayed
Pulled me up, laid me over the beam he'd clung to
Breathed his last and sunk under the waves

Your body is a bridge
Across an endless sea
Your body is a bridge
Across an endless seaEmbed
