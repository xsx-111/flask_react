Wood and Wire Lyrics
Fourteen years behind these bars
In twelve-foot square of cold cement
I’ve lost nearly everything
For a crime of which I’m innocent

But all my suffering’s a light and momentary pain
While the weight of an endless glory still remains to me

A dead man walking down the hall
To meet a mess of wood and wire
They lead me where men fear to tread
But towards the thing I most desire

For all my suffering’s a light and momentary pain
While the weight of an endless glory still remains

So throw the switch, son, I know you ain’t got a choice
The dawn is coming, all is well, I will rejoiceEmbed
