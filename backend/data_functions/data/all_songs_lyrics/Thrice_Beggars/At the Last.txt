At the Last Lyrics
It's a shame that some must go without
But I was no fool to think it might be my problem
Needy hands were reaching out
I kept my spare change and my pride in a tight fist (in a tight fist)

And now at the last
Everything is changed in this pale light
That death has cast on all I've done
On all I've done, on all I've done

I'm a good man on the whole
Who can blame me for looking out for number one
I never killed, I never stole
A small indulgence now and then, So what of it?
I'm a good man, I'm a good man
Am I good man? I thought I was

But the rewards of this life now count for naught
My body soon buried and left to rot
The time's gone, how quickly it all has past
My God, now I see how I've squandered each and every breath
Now at the last
Everything is changed in this pale light
That death has cast on all I've done

Now at the last
Everything is changed in this pale light
And looking back I am undone
I am undoneEmbed
