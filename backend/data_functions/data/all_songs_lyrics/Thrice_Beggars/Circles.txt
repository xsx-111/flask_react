Circles Lyrics
We talk too much; We talk in circles
Till we’re all spinning round
Reaching for rings on this merry-go-round
The scenery spins; We call it progress
But I’ve seen this all before;
When all’s said and done, we’ll wake up on the floor

We set sail with no fixed star in sight
We drive by braille and candlelight

We’re building towers with no foundations
Just stacking stone on stone
Whatever it takes - mix our mortar with bones
But true progress means matching the world to
The vision in our heads
But we always change the vision instead

We set sail with no fixed star in sight
We drive by braille and candlelightEmbed
