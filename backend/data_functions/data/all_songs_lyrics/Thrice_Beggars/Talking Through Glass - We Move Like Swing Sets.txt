Talking Through Glass / We Move Like Swing Sets Lyrics
It never turns out right with me and you
No matter how I try to see it through
We gather ourselves up and start again
Feels like I'm trying to catch the wind

You are the door to which I've lost the keys
We are a puzzle with a missing piece
We gather ourselves up and start again
Feels like I'm trying to catch the wind

And I can't carry on living like this
Talking through glass
You know that I can't be the one to banish the mist
And ghosts in your past

So cold to touch you and your heart
And when I care too much, we fall apart
We gather ourselves up and start again
Feels like I'm trying to catch the wind

And I can't carry on living like this
Talking through glass
You know that I can't be the one to banish the mist
And ghosts in your past
So I'm left without a choice but walking out
Though I've no hope, I'll never find someone like you
My head is screaming "I have to leave you" but my heart is filled with doubt
Don't wanna leave but tell me - What else can I do?
-can I do? -can I do? -can I do? -can I do?

We move like swingsets
We move like swingsets
We move like swingsets
We move like swingsetsEmbed
