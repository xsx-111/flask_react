Doublespeak Lyrics

I drug my heart with doublespeak
All my misgivings disappear
It helps to keep my conscience clean
The ends will justify the means
But still I’m always careful what I hear

I don’t wanna know who really pulls the strings
Just as long as it’s not you or me

There’s a jackboot toe tap keeping time
While the children dance and play
Honey, if you think you’ve seen a crime
You just look the other way

I slowly carve my soul away
Piece by piece I sacrifice
To comfort and peace of mind
I keep my toes on the party line
There’s nothing wrong dear, don’t think twice
I don’t wanna know who really pulls the strings
Just as long as it’s not you or me

There’s a jackboot toe tap keeping time
While the children dance and play
Honey, if you think you’ve seen a crime
Won't you look the other way


There’s a jackboot toe tap keeping time
While the children dance and play
Honey, if you think you’ve seen a crime
Won't you look the other way

I drug my heart with doublespeak
All my misgivings disappear
It helps to keep my conscience clean
(The ends will justify the means,)
But still I’m always careful what I hear1Embed
