The Weight Lyrics
There’s many who’ll tell you they’ll give you their love
But when they say "give" they mean "take"
They hang ‘round just like vultures 'til push comes to shove
And take flight when the earth starts to shake
Someone may say that they’ll always be true
Then slip out the door ‘fore the dawn
But I won’t leave you hanging on
Another may stay 'til they find someone new
Then before you know they’ll be gone
But I won’t leave you hanging on
No, I won’t, won't be that someone

And come what may, I won’t abandon you or leave you behind
Because love is a loyalty sworn, not a burning for a moment
Come what may, I will be standing right here by your side
I won’t run away, though the storm’s getting worse and there’s no end in sight

Some talk of destiny, others of fate
But soon they’ll be saying goodbye
But I won’t leave you high and dry
'Cause a ring don’t mean nothing if you can’t haul the weight
And some of them won’t even try
But I won’t leave you high and dry
I won’t leave you wondering why


And storms will surely come
But true love is a choice you must make and you are the one
That I have set my heart to choose
As long as I live, I swear I’ll see this through

Come what may, I won’t abandon you or leave you behind
Because love is a loyalty sworn, not a burning for a moment
Come what may, I will be standing right here by your side
I won’t run away, though the storm’s getting worse and I see no end

Come what may, I won’t abandon you or leave you behind
Because love is a loyalty sworn, not a burning for a moment
Come what may, I will be standing right here by your side
I won’t run away, though the storm’s getting worse and there’s no end in sight1Embed
