Should Have Known Better LyricsSo many years I just suffered through the tears
Knowing one day I'd wake up wishing I had never met her
But as the time goes by my hope keeps playing every day
As I laugh to myself, 'I just should have known better'
There's no more laughter as I think about the other girl
It's a slap in my face as I'm opening her letter
She's doing fine now with two kids and another man
As i cry out loud, 'I just should have known better'
She was the reason I was living every day
I would ride upon a white horse in my quest to try and find her
But now it's too late, I don't care if I die tonight
Cos a voice keeps ringing in my heart, 'I should have known better'
I learned my lesson this time
Lonliness and a broken heart
Should've known right from the startEmbed
