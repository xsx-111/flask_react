Forest Fire Lyrics
No junk food, just earthly goods
I ate weird berries in the woods
Now I'm seeing colors, I'm getting higher
I think I'll start a forest fire!

There's a forest fire climbin' the hill
Burning wealthy California homes
Better run, run, run, run, run, run from the fire!
But some of us stay and watch
And we think of your insurance costs
And we laugh, laugh laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, at your lives

Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a fortress?
Against the rest of the world
Windows covered with bars
Security guards
Is that a house or a prison
How you gonna get out?

Electric bull and your tennis courts
Pink sports cars and your boats
Getting fried, fried, fried, fried, fried, fried, by the fire
Windows covered with bars
Floodlights for the yard
It's a pleasure to watch you watch it all melt
But hey!
What about the cocaine
Stockpiled in the basement
Be a hero and save it
You know you're gonna need it

Where's your brand new pretty wife?
She might still be inside
Either save her or your cocaine from the fire!
But the gates and doors are locked
Cause the burglar alarms went off
Ever wonder why we laugh, laugh at your lives

Windows covered with bars
Fences spiked with barbed wire
Never looked so helpless engulfed in flames
Cameras watchin' the walls
Don't forget the dogs
Now you're trapped in your prison, how you gonna get out?

Yeah!
See the gerbil
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run from the fire!Embed
