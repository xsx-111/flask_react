Moon Over Marin Lyrics
The crowded future stings my eyes
I still find time to exercise
In uniform with two white stripes
Unlock my section of the sand
It's fenced off to the water's edge
I clamp a gas mask on my head
Oh, my beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight

Another tanker's hit the rocks
Abandoned to spill out its guts
The sand is laced with sticky glops
Oh, shimmering moonlight sheen upon
The waves and water clogged with oil
White gases steam up from the soil

Oh, my beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight

I squash dead fish between my toes
Try not to step on any bones
I turn around and I go home
I slip back through my basement door
Switch off all that I own below
Dive in my scalding wooden tub
My own beach at night
Bathe in my moonlight-ight-ight
There will always be a moon over Marin

"There, wasn't that a nice visit? Don't forget, a psychiatrist is on duty twenty-four hours a day in the blue room just up from the parking garage. Drink plenty of water when you take these. Now you can relax and return to your job!"3Embed
