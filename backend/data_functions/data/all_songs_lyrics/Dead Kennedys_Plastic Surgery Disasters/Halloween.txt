Halloween LyricsSo it's Halloween
And you feel like dancing
And you feel like shining
And you feel like letting loose
What're you gonna be
Babe, you better know
And you better plan
Better plan all day
Better plan all week
Better plan all month
Better plan all year
You're dressed up like a clown
Putting on your act
It's the only time all year
You'll ever admit that
I can see your eyes
I can see your brain
Baby, nothing's changed

You're still hiding in a mask
You take your fun seriously
No, don't blow this year's chance
Tomorrow your mold goes back on
After Halloween
You go to work today
You'll go to work tomorrow
Shitfaced tonight
You'll brag about it for months
Remember what I did
Remember what I was
Back on Halloween
But what's in between
Where are your ideas
You sit around and dream
For next Halloween
Why not everyday
Are you so afraid
What will people say

After Halloween
Because your role is planned for you
There's nothing you can do
But stop and think it through
But what will the boss say to you
And what will your girlfriend say to you
And the people out on the street they might glare at you
And what do you know you're pretty self-conscious too
So you run back and stuff yourselves in rigid business costumes
Only at night to score is your leather uniform exhumed
Why don't you take your social regulations
And shove 'em up your ass1Embed
