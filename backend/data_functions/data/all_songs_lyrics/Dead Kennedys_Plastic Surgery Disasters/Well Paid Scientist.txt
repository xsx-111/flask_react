Well Paid Scientist Lyrics
You're a well paid scientist, you only talk in facts
You know you're always right
'Cause you know how to prove it, step by step
A PhD to show you're smart
With textbook formulas
But you're used up, just like a factory hand

Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid, you're well trained
You're tied to a rack!

Company cocktails, gotta go
Say the right thing, don't fidget, jockey for position
Be polite in the pyramid you hate
Sip that scotch
Get that raise
This ain't no party at all

Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid, you're well trained
You're tied to a rack!
Cringe and tense up, grind your teeth
And wipe your sweaty palms
Close your windows driving past the low life company bar
They're making fun of you!
Ha!
Aw, even you
You've gotta punch the clock
Why don't you punch your boss?
Aw, even you
You just punch the clock
Too scared to punch your boss!
When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will youâ€”
Open your eyes! Open your eyes! Open your eyes!

Pull up to your sterile home
You're drained, bite the heads off of your kids
Chew them well, they taste like you, just slam the door
Assigned here cause your company owns the land
All your colleagues live there too
Private guards in golf carts keep you safe at home
Something is wrong here
You won't find it on a shelf
You're well paid, you're well trained
You're tied to a rack!

When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?
When will you crack?!
The dark shattered underbelly of the American dream
Avoid it like the plague, it stares you from your bathroom mirror
Drown!Embed
