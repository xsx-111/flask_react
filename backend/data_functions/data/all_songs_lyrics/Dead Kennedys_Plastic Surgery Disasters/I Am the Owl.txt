I Am the Owl LyricsI am your plumber
No I never went away
I still bug your bedrooms
And pick up everything you say
It can be a boring job
To monitor all day your excess talk
I hear when you're drinking
And cheating on your lonely wife
I play tape recordings
Of you to my friends at night
We've got our girl in bed with you
You're on candid camera
We just un-elected you

I am the owl
I seek out the foul
Wipe 'em away
Keep America free
For clean living folks like me
If you demonstrate
Against somebody we like
I'll slip on my wig
And see if I can start a riot
Transform you to an angry mob
All your leaders go to jail for my job
But we ain't the Russians
Political trials are taboo
We've got our secret
Ways of getting rid of you
Fill you full of LSD
Turn you loose on a freeway

I am the owl
I seek out the foul
Wipe 'em away
Keep America free
For clean living folks like me
Send you spinning
Send you spinning
Send you spinning all over the freeway
Spinning on the crowded freeway
Spinning on the freeway
Spinning on the freeway
Spin
Spin
Spin
Lookout
The press, they never even cared
Why a youth leader walked into a speeding car
In ten years or so we'll leak the truth
By then it's under so much paper
Watergate hurt
But nothing really ever changed
A teeny bit quiter
But we still play our little games
We still play our little games
We still play our little games
We still play our little games
We still play a lot of games
I am the owlEmbed
