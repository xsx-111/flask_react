Buzzbomb Lyrics
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

Buzzbomb, buzzbomb, macho-mobile
The road's my slave, that's how I feel
I cruise alone, I cruise real far
I don't love you, I love my car
Oh, oh
Oh, oh oh

'Cross Nevada At 110
Highway 50, and there's nobody there!
Sign says, "Next sign 30 miles!"
I work all week, each penny saved
Buys more escape from home
I'd rather cruise around all day than save up for a move

Plow thru rest area San-O-Lets
Splat! Goes the lonely salesman
Wanking in the men's room

Buzzbomb, buzzbomb, tape up loud!
Blue piss clinging to my windshield
Faster, faster, in my car!
Buzzbomb is my pride and joy
King of the trailer court
Waiting for the perfect chick who'll love me for my car
I tell her why I'm cool
She coos back just what I like
When I pretend she's near


Zip through Ely, where Pat Nixon was born
The cops 'round here sure looking bored
Flashing sirens-state patrol
They're scratching up my gorgeous paint job, shooting out my tires!
Ain't no way to go to heaven, Buzzbomb cornered at the 7-11

Aw, oohEmbed
