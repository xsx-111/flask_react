Dead End Lyrics
Once I had a close friend
I knew him for quite a while
He seemed alright to me
We had this deal together
Took all my money and time
And then he went away
Taking all that was mine

Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end
Die in the end

Once it was fun to worry
About who was in control
Could look into the future
But now it don't seem right
Passion is filling the air
Profits are better than life
And things are harder to bear

Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end
It's a dead end
Dead end
Dead end
Once I had a lover
I knew her for quite a while
She seemed alright to me
But then she was gone
She took my loving and time
Taking all that was mine
And leaving me far behind

Oh, well, things crumble to an end
Hell, we all die in the end
Die in the end
It's a dead end
Dead end
Dead endEmbed
