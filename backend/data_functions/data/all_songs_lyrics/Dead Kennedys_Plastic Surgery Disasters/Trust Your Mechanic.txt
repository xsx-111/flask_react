Trust Your Mechanic Lyrics
TV invents a disease you think you have
So you buy our drugs and soon you depend on them
Pain is in your mind, got you coming back for more again and again and again and again
Gonna rip you off, rip you off!

Doctor says you need surgery now
You're feeling good, 'til the side effects fuck up something else
You're ensnared by the medicine man paying up the ass again and again
Gonna rip you off!

Trust your mechanic to mend your car
Bring it in to his garage
He tightens and loosens a few spare parts
One thing's fixed, another falls apart
And the rich eat you!

A magazine says your face don't look quite right
Unless you wear our brand new wonder creme tonight
Never look right again, unless you grease your skin
Again and again and again and again, gonna rip you off!

Told you're depressed, so of course you see the psychiatrist
Right when you hit your neuroses' roots, he confuses you
He fucks your head up worse, gotcha feeling helpless
You're coming back for more again and again
Gonna rip you off, rip you off!
Trust your mechanic
To make you well
You're seeing an awful lot of him now
The quicker he makes your life fall apart
The more money you put in his pockets

Trust your mechanic to plug your holes
Trust him to make more, somewhere else
Trust your mechanic, he'll always come through and rip you off!2Embed
