Winnebago Warrior LyricsRoughing it in the great outdoors
Guidebooks tell us where to go
Winnebago Warrior
Slow down traffic climbing hills
30 gallons to the mile
Honey, quick, the polaroid

Winnebago Warrior
Brave as old John Wayne
Winnebago Warrior
A true yankee pioneer
Stop at Stuckey's for a meal
Blab all day on the CB
Winnebago Warrior
Littered campgrounds, folding chairs
Feed Doritos to the bears
Honey, quick, the polaroid

Winnebago Warrior
Brave as old John Wayne
Winnebago Warrior
A true yankee pioneer
Kill some fish down by the creek
Hang their picture by the sink
Show your grandson who's the boss
Tie your two toat-goats to the front
U-Haul trailer full of souvenirs
That you buy along the way

Winnebago Warrior
Brave as old John Wayne
Winnebago Warrior
A true yankee pioneerEmbed
