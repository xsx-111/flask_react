Cat Food Lyrics
Lady Supermarket with an apple in her basket
Knocks on the manager's door
Grooning to the muzak from a speaker in the shoe rack
Lays out her goods on the floor
Everything she's chosen is conveniently frozen
"Eat it and come back for more!"

Lady Window-Shopper with a new one in the hopper
Whips up a chemical brew
Croaking to a neighbour while she polishes a sabre
Knows how to flavour a stew
Never need to worry with a tin of 'Hurri Curri':
"Poisoned especially for you!"

No use to complain
If you're caught out in the rain
Your mother's quite insane
Cat food, cat food, cat food, again?


No use to complain
If you're caught out in the rain
Your mother's quite insane
Cat food, cat food, cat food, again?
Lady Yellow-Stamper with a fillet in the hamper
Dying to finish the course
Goodies for the table with a fable on the label
Drowning in miracle sauce
Don't think I am that rude if I tell you that it's cat food
"Not even fit for a horse!"2Embed
