In the Wake of Poseidon Lyrics
Plato's spawn cold ivied eyes
Snare truth in bone and globe
Harlequins coin pointless games
Sneer jokes in parrot's robe
Two women weep, Dame Scarlet Screen
Sheds sudden theatre rain
Whilst dark in dream the Midnight Queen
Knows every human pain

In air, fire, earth and water
World on the scales
Air, fire, earth and water
Balance of change
World on the scales, on the scales

Bishop's kings spin judgement's blade
Scratch "Faith" on nameless graves
Harvest hags hoard ash and sand
Rack rope and chain for slaves
Who fireside fear fermented words
Then rear to spoil the feast
Whilst in the aisle the mad man smiles
To him it matters least
Heroes' hands drain stones of blood
To whet the scaling knife
Magi blind with vision's light
Net death in dread of life
Their children kneel in Jesus till
They learn the price of nails
Whilst all around our Mother Earth
Waits balanced on the scales1Embed
