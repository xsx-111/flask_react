Eternal Rain LyricsSuddenly I realize
Every hero pays the price
And with no hesitation
I give her the kiss of life
Dry land
Don’t cry on me
How could I know?
The sky forgives no one
And the worst has yet to come
Soaking right down to the bone
In your eternal rain
I give in to temptation
She was never meant to be saved
Dry land
Don’t cry on me
How could I know?
The sky forgives no one
And the worst has yet to comeEmbed
