Streams LyricsI. Streams
Oooh, now that I am free
Swimming with the many fishes of the stream
Yeah, and I am welcome here
We all just connected, swimmingly
Streams of life digress like water running through my veins
I’m learning how to breathe
Living underwater I am deeper than the eye can see
Yeah, it was meant to be
Now I’m flowing with the current of the stream
Streams of life digress like water running through my veins
Running through my veins
Running through my veins
I start my life again
Just as well this ain’t the first stream I have swam
Cold water rushing to my brain
Is thicker than the blood that’s flowing through my veins
Streams of life digress like water running through my veins
Streams of blood like liquid love is rushing to my brain
II. Veins
It suddenly hits me
In the heat of the sun
A product of fear
Far from human
It suddenly hits me
And crushes my world
Like a tidal wave
Trapped in my shell
It suddenly hits me
What I have become?
Searching for answers
In my aquarium
It suddenly bites me
And poisons my veins
Lost and unable to find my way
III. Digression
My chosen path
The direction that I take
Is the consequence
Of your greatest mistake
When that day arrives
It’s decision time
Which way will I turn?
Will I ever really learn?
If I’m shown the way
I will never be alone
The choice is mine
In deciding where I’ll go
All our souls digressed
We started as one
All our journeys will end
At the same destination
Streams of life digress like water running through my veins
Streams of blood like liquid love is rushing to my brain1Embed
