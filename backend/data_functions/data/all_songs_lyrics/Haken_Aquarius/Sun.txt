Sun LyricsWithout a reason left to live
Lonely air I breathe
And as she takes her final breath
Yesterday becomes a memory
As I am learning to let go of the dead
Goodbye she cries
As she slowly disappears
Into light
She vaporized
Peacefully
The silence resonates beyond
Now that she is gone
Wish I could turn back hands of time
And die to save a thousand lives
With fear in your eyes
The time has come
Reveal the sun you hide
Tears melt the ice
The time has come
When death and love collide
My savior
I wait for her
To return
Forgive me
I killed you
To save us all
One final look into her eyes
I watched her vaporise
Merging with the light
Fear within your eyes
The time has come
Reveal the sun you hide
Dry tears of mine
The time has come
When death and love collideEmbed
