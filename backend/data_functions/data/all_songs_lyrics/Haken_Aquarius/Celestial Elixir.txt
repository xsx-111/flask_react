Celestial Elixir Lyrics
Oh, I still hear your angel song
Whispered by a child that once belonged
With tears of joy
So white
The colour of a restless night
More than a faint memory can provide
If years go by
Fear and pain will sustain in your eyes

She may never return
But I can wait forever
If we can’t make amends
I’ll chase your rainbow till the end

Find us a cure for your disease
Spare us your ancient remedy
If this is all I ever ask
Emptiness is all I ever had

Our lives are scarred from deep within
Scales grow all over our skin
A miracle is all I’ll ever need
To cure them all
Holding onto my amphibian dream
She may never return
But I can wait forever
If we can’t make amends
I’ll chase your rainbow till the end

Find us a cure for your disease
Spare us your ancient remedy
If this is all I ever ask
Emptiness is all I ever had

The calm that comes after the storm
The tide that never reaches the shore
So heavenly
Your remedy
When love prevails
Swallowing the blood of enemies

She may never return
But I will wait forever
If we can not make amends
I’ll chase your rainbow till the end
Streams of light unite with water
Running through our veins
Streams of blood like liquid
Love is running through our veinsEmbed
