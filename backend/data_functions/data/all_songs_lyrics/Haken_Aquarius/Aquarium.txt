Aquarium LyricsJust another day sitting by the river
As February fades
I was fishing for my dinner
When something caught my eye in my peripheral vision
Have I lost my mind if I believe in what I’m seeing?
Eyes from around the world
Stare through the glass
Of my aquarium
Line up to see the girl
Blessed by the curse
Of the aquarius
Freak of nature
Pay to see her
Eyes surround her
Like a fever
Free me master
See me shiver
Put me back into the river
I won’t tell a soul
But I could make a fortune
All those empty years of staring into my reflection
I could bide my time
But I can’t keep a secret
She’s the great discovery of the 22nd century
Eyes from around the world
Stare through the glass
Of my aquarium
Line up to see the girl
Blessed by the curse
Of the aquarius
Fortune and fame
She’s the freak of the day
Only you made a name for yourself
They fell in love
After all that he’s done
To her plan that is destined to fail
Oooh, they hit it right off (she freaked you out)
Eyes from around the world
Stare through the glass
Of my aquarium
I’ve seen the girl
Blessed by the curse
Of the aquarius
Freak of nature
Pay to see her
Eyes surround her
Like a fever
Free me master
See me shiver
Put me back into the river
Eyes surround me
Like a prison
Heart is beating
You have listened
Free me master
See me shiver
Put me back into the river2Embed
