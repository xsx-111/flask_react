The Point of No Return LyricsUntil the ice has melted
Into tears of pain or fear
Pure anticipation
In hope we are
Patient for a cry
A child is born tonight
And love has come to life
Listen to her heartbeat
The sound of life
An angel's song
Pure anticipation
In hope we are
Patient for a cry
A child is born tonight
And love has come to life
Living in this nightmare
Falling further to his knees
The purest disappointment
In hope we're not
Patient for a lie
A child was born tonight
At the point of no return
We can't raise this child
This precious circus freak
With fins for arms
And a tail where legs would be
There's no turning back
Our decision is made
If we don't let her go
We cannot love her as our own
"The water is thicker than blood
And we can't look her in the eyes
Release her to the stream"
At the point of no return
The point of no return
Let me go
I don't belong here
I'll be free
I won't return home
It's no wonder that she's out there all alone
It's no wonder that she is soaked to the bone
It's no wonder water is thicker than blood
I wonder if the storm will come for us?
She'll find a way to the point of no return
She's on her way past the point of no returnEmbed
