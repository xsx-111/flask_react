Up on the Ladder Lyrics
I'm stuck in the TARDIS
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute, snake charming
The next in a motorcade

All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings

Give me an answer
Give me a line
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time

Up on the ladder we're all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder we wait for your mistake
Up on the ladder, try to call out your name
Up on the ladder you're all the fucking same4Embed
