Down Is the New Up Lyrics
Get yourself together, let the light pour in
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without warning

Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup?
Down is the new up, is the new up

Won't you be my girl? Won't you be my girl?

Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort

Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up, down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up
You crawled off and left us, you crawled off and left us
You crawled off and left us
You bastard
You bastard

You're on candid camera
The chink in your armour
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town
Topsy turvy town3Embed
