Last Flowers Lyrics
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk

And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get
Relief, relief
Relief, relief

And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen

'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get
Relief, relief
Relief, relief
Relief, relief
It's too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful
Too much, too bright, too powerful13Embed
