4 Minute Warning Lyrics
This is just a nightmare
Soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground

This is your warning, four minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is our warning, four minute warning7Embed
