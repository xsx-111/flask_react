Introduction Of The Band LyricsI'd like to introduce you to a few people up here. Everyone here came at a very short notice, and some people even cancelled a few gigs to try and make it. And, nobody was getting paid for anything
We got on drums, Ringo Starr
Also on drums, Jim Keltner
There is somebody on bass, who many people have heard about, but they never actually seen him, Klaus Voormann
We got a whole lot of guitarists. Mr. Jesse Ed Davis. A very old friend of mine, Mr. Eric Clapton
Thank you, thank you
Somebody I'm sure you all know by now, on piano, Leon. Stand up Leon!
I don't know if they're coming through on the acoustic guitars, if you're hearing them, but it's an Apple band Badfinger
And we got a whole lot of singers out there. The singers are all from all different parts of the world and different bands so, just give them a big hand I don't know what really -
And the Hollywood Horn players over there, lead by Jim Horn
Have we forgotten anybody, I don't know?
We've got Billy Preston!Embed
