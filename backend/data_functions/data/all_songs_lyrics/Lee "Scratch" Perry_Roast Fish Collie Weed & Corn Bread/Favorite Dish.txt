Favorite Dish Lyrics
Rolling home from work, feeling kind of peckish
Dying to reach home, to have my favorite dish
Ackee and saltfish, dumpling and inana
Cow foot and split peas, tripe and broadbean

I'm a working man so I feed up strong
I hope you overstand
I'm a working man so I eat up strong
Nothing can go wrong

I don't need no Chiney Brush, eat a entire horse
And I always stand up strong, and I never use tea balm
Strictly collie weed, and a bunch of ital feed

I'm a well fed man, so I grow up strong
I hope you overstand
I'm a greedy man , so I speed along
Nothing can go wrong
I'm a well fed man, so I grow up strong
I hope you overstand
Hey
Music is the key, blend in harmony
Need no Chiney Brush, eat a entire horse
I'm a well fed man, so I grow up strong
I hope you overstand

I'm a well fed man, so I grow up strong
Hope you overstand
I'm a working so I feed up strong
Hope you understand
I'm a well fed man, so I grow up strong
I hope you overstand
Nothing can go wrong
HeyEmbed
