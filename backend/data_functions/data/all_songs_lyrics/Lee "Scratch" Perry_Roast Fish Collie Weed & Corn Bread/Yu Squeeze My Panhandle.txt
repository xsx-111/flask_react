Yu Squeeze My Panhandle Lyrics
This song is dedicated to all the DJâ€™s out there
Who fight their truths and right music
The truth, yeah, like the man said yo

This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you'll like this one
This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
Give it a helping hand

You fight the war and lose the battle
So throw away that old binocles
Clean up your heart and make a new start
For you are only playing your part

This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you  this one
This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you push this one
Give I a chance,  Mr DJ
Give I a chance, I say
The baby need you and I am hungry
This is my high ranking letter to you

This is my new song, Mr DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you like this one
This is my new song, to all the DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you (better trip?) this one
This is my new song, to all the DJ man
This is my new song
I hope you push this one

You load the gun and pull the trigger
You miss your target because of your ego
Give I a chance, Mr DJ
Give I a chance, I say

This is my new song, Mr DJ man3Embed
