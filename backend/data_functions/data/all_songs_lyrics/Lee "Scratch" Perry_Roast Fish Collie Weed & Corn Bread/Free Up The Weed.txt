Free Up The Weed Lyrics

This is the word of the meek
So listen clearly while I speak
Free up the weed let the children eat
Too much gon' suffer
Free up the weed let the children eat right now
They need bread and water
It was here from creation, it's for the healing of the nation
This is the time of starvation,  generation

Some plant coffee, some plant tea
So why can't I and I plant collie?
If you stray from the root
Then you'll never know the truth right now
Ca' the war can't solve no problem, love is the emblem
Instead of hate and malice, we should be sipping chalice
And giving praises to His Most High Jah Jah Rastafari 

Free up the weed, that the children need
We need bread and water
Free up the weed, that the children need
Too much gon' suffer
Some export coffee, some export tea
So why can't I and I export collie?
If you stray from the root
You'll never know the truth right now
Ca' the war can't solve no problem, love is the emblem
Instead of hate and malice, we should be sipping chalice
And singing praises to our guardian 'pon high Haile SelassieEmbed
