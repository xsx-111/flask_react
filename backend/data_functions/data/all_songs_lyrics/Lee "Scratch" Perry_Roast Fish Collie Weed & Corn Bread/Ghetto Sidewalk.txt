Ghetto Sidewalk Lyrics

The fascination of evil
Throw good things into the shade
On the whirlwind of desire
....Hold up the simple 

Don't think I'm vicious
Don't think I'm 
Don't think I'm malicious
I'm just a little suspicious



We need some light on the ghetto sidewalk
We're tired of stumbling in the dark
One thing I'd like to know:
Where does the taxpayer money go?
One thing I'd like to know:
Where does the taxpayer money goes?
Oooooh, ooooh
Children crying
Their mother sighing
The people dying
No one are trying
The fascination of evil
Throw good things into the 
And the whirlwind of desire
Throw up a simple 
Don't think I'm vicious
Don't think I'm 
Don't say I'm malicious
Just a little suspicious
Suspicious
Suspicious
Suspicious
Suspicious
We need some light on the ghetto sidewalk
We're tired of stumbling in the dark
Don't think I'm vicious
Don't think I'm 
Don't say I'm malicious
Just a little suspicious
Suspicious
Suspicious
Suspicious
Suspicious
We need some like on the ghetto sidewalk
We're tired of stumbling in the dark
We need some like on the ghetto sidewalkEmbed
