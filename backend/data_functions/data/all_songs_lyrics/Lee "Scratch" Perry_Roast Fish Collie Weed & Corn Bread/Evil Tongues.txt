Evil Tongues Lyrics
Who dat?
(I)
I don't like to see people keep peeking over my fence, you know?
Peeking over my window, you know?
I'm a bit curious, you know?
I don't care how you feel about it, man
It's just me you know, the truth, you know?
Yeah, you know


There are some hypocrites around me
Who pretended to be my friend
Little did they know that I saw them coming
Saw them coming around the bend

Evil eyes and wicked heart
I saw them coming from afar
Coming, coming to play their part
Evil eyes and wicked heart
I saw you coming to play your part

You want the lion's share
But Jah Jah know that no fear
You want the lion's share
But Jah Jah know that no fear
Wicked tongue and evil heart
By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread
Then how you want to live off the next man's head?
You're too lazy, you can't leave your bed
But ya want to live off the next man's head
Evil tongue and wicked heart
I saw you coming from the start
Evil tongue and wicked heart
You shall never have no life apart

There are some people around hereEmbed
