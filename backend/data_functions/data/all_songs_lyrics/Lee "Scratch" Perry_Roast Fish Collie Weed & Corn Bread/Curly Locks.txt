Curly Locks Lyrics
Natty congo, yes I, dread natty congo
Natty congo, yes I, natt up, natt up, natt up, yeah

Curly Locks, now that I'm a dreadlocks
Your daddy don't want you dealing with me
But it's alright
Curly Locks, now that I'm a dreadlocks
Your mammy don't want you dealing with me

The sun is shining, the breeze is a-blowing, too
But all I've got inside is lots of love for you, it's true

Curly Locks, two roads before ya
Which one will be your choice?
Would really like to know that
Curly Locks, your father is a poacher
And he don't want you dealing with me

He's a baldhead, I am a congo dread
A living Rastaman, who's got a lots of love for you
Curly Locks, two roads before ya
Which one will be your choice?
Would really like to know that
Curly Locks, your father is a poacher
And he don't want you dealing with me
But it's alright

Thank you, thank you for the letter
It's made me feel better
Tee-tah-toe, that's the way it's gonna go, now

Curly Locks, two roads before ya
You pick your choice
Curly Locks, two roads before ya
You pick, you pick, you pick your choice
Curly Locks, your father is a poacher
I'm a bongo natty, bongo natty, bongo dread
Dread up, dread up, dread up, yeah
Natty congo, bongo natty..Embed
