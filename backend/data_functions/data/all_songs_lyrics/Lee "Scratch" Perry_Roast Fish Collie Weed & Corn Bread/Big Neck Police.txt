Big Neck Police LyricsA time to sow and a time to reap, yes, my friend
The seed you sow, that’s what you shall reap
To full a belly
You light the fire, to burn this Nyah
But it no work out, you’re just a weakheart
You send your big neck police friends fe come cool I up
But it no work
For Jah Jah walk right in and cool up the scene
You get a jerk
Far better put they trust in Jah
Shall like be Mount Zion-I
That shall never removeth, iyah
But abideth for-iwa, Jah Jah
The knife that stick de sheep a go stick de goat, do you hear?
How you gonna feel when de knife is at your throat?
For sowing bring reaping, and reaping is harves'
The seed that you sow a yard that’s what you shall reap, yeah
Do you hear?
Jah is I light and salvation, whom shall I fear?
Jah de protector of I life, of whom shall I be afraid?
Hypocrite inna broad daylight, parasite inna dim light
Dreadlocks in moonlight, baldhead at sunrise, oh
Jah Jah is I shepherd, I shall not want
Do you hear? Do you see?
Jah Jah is I shepherd I shall not want
You send your big neck police friends fe come cool I up
But it no work
For Jah Jah walk right in and cool up the scene
You get a jerk, you get a jerk, it no work
You set your {struggle/scrotum] (?)
Little did you know
Jah put shackles on your trail
It didn’t work
It couldn’t work.....Embed
