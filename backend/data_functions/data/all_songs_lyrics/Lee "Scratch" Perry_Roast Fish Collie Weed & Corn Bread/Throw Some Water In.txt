Throw Some Water In LyricsOh ah! Oh babbadeeda (x2)
Service your engine if you want it to function
Check your oil and clean your radiator
Make sure you clean your carburator
Throw some water in the radiator
Throw some water in (x3)
Throw some water in your radiator
Service your body if you want it to function
Exercise and build up your structure
Go to sea and learn how to swim
If you can't afford off a gym
Buy a piece of rope (x3)
Exercise and tune up your system
Oh ah! Babbaree, babbadeja
Oh ah! Uh!
Throw some water in (x3)
Do more service, water your garden
Water your garden, your seed will grow, uh
Service your engine and it will go, uh
Throw some water in (x3)
Throw some water in the radiator
Service your body if you want it to function
Exercise and build up your structure
Go to sea and learn how to swim
If you can't afford off a gym
Buy a piece of rope (x2)
Buy a skipping rope
Exercise if you love your system
Water your garden and it will grow
Service your car and it will go
Service your body
Eat the right food
Get some tonic
Drink some fish tea
Oh-ho-ho ya, oh dabbadeejaEmbed
