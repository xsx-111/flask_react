Swerve City Lyrics
She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices

That travel through the air, oh
They travel through the air, oh

She tames me with her voices
As she plays around with the forces

That travel through the air, oh
They travel through the air, oh

Distant howling out
It keeps you floating around
Distant howling out
Forces floating around

She breaks her horses
With strange distant voices
That travel through the air, oh
They travel through the air, oh
Oh, oh7Embed
