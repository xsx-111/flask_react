Poltergeist Lyrics
What can I say?
I think I had enough
I think you keep playing to play
Knowing that I feel sick
Come on, just say it
Just say you like to play this game just to drive me wild

I let you pretend
But you know the truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
This time
There's a common thread

And so I sit
And watch you play dumb
I'd like to see you play with the odds on your plate instead
Come on, just say it
Just say you like to keep this pace just to drive me wild

I let you pretend
But you know the truth is that
I love you to death
Like you love this game
It keeps me hanging tight

What can I say?
I think your head's fucked
Go on, drive me wild

This time
There's a constant thing
This time
There's a common thread

That keeps me hanging tight
And it tells me something's right

What can I say?
I fuckin' had enough
I think you just play what you play
Knowing that I feel sick
Come on, just say it
Just say you like to play this game 'cause it drives me wild5Embed
