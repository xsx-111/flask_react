Entombed Lyrics
From the day you arrived
I've remained by your side
In chains, entombed

Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all I see

On the day you arrived
I became your device
To name and soothe

Placed inside, safe and sound
Shapes and colors are all I see
Shades of colors are all I feel

From the day you arrived
I have stayed by your side

Placed inside, safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Shapes of colors are all I feel
Placed inside, safe and sound
Shades of colors are all I see
Safe inside13Embed
