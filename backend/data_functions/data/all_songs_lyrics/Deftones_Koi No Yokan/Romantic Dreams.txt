Romantic Dreams Lyrics
Process your constant changing phases
I watch them
Releasing right on cue
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

So why wait to discover your dream?
Now is your chance

I promise
To watch and raise your babies
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours

I, I'm hypnotized by your name
I, I wish this night would never end

So why wait for the colors to bleed?
What do you expect?

So heartless
We march into the fumes
In time, in sync
Tonight the stage is yours
I, I'm hypnotized by your name
I, I wish this night would never end
I wish this night

I, I'm hypnotized by your name
I, I wish this night would never end
I wish this night
I wish this night wouldn't end
I wish this night4Embed
