Tempest Lyrics
Take out the stories
They've put into your mind
And brace for the glory
As you stare into the sky
The sky beneath
I know you can't be tired

Lay there, stare at the ceiling
And switch back to your time
Just go ahead now try and taste it
I know it should be ripe

Thrust ahead

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like to be taken apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

I wonder, just how you shaped it
To get back to your prize
Thrust ahead

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like to be taken apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end

Wake for the glory
I know you can't be
Tired!

Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
The ancient arrival cut to the end
I'd like you to take me apart from the inside
Then spit through the cycle right to the end
Inside, inside, inside
Turning in circles, been caught in a stasis
(Inside, inside, inside)
I want you to take me apart from the inside
Right to the end10Embed
