Gauze Lyrics
It's a mistake
But go ahead and take a side
But watch how you choose
Or be headed for a ride
'Cause I, I just don't know if I could

I can't stop what you began
I can't fight for what you began

You've opened the gates
Now face the other side
Just go on, it's cool
Now head into the fire
Well, I, I just don't know if I could

I can't stop what you began
Can't fight for what you began
I know what's in sight for you again

Switch on your game
Stop wasting all your time
'Cause surprise, it's you
Who will face what you decide
Well, I, I think I'd have known about you
I can't stop what you began
Can't fight for what you began
I know what's in sight
I know your fate
I know I couldnâ€™t stop once you beganEmbed
