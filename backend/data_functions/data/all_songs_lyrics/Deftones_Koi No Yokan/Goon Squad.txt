Goon Squad Lyrics
I carve my name across your towns when I'm set
I cut inside before the trends begin
I spend my time perfecting waves of contrast
Cutting out all the same shit I've outgrown

I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat

I see the crowns and I forget the couture
Two at a time I watch the kingdoms fold

I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in?
Designed for you
Designed by me

Before we get down you should prepare your heartstrings
To cut all the ties and watch the trends begin
I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in?
Designed special for you by me
Designed special for you by me
Designed special for you by me

One last thing, you should beware the content
I cut inside and let the trend begin

I'm bringing it in style myself
You know it is with ease, no sweat
I'm breaking in with all my friends
So are you in? Are you in?
Are you in? Are you in?
Are you in?
Designed special for you by me
Designed special for you by me
Designed special for you by me
Designed special for you by me2Embed
