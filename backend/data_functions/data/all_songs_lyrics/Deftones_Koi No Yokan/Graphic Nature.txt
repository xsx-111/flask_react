Graphic Nature Lyrics
Leave your drape open
Let me inside
Guess I'm confused more or less
Shed some light
And tell me your secret
How are you trained?
I promise you I can keep it
Go on, explain

Tell me how you do it now

Your poison is glowing
Against the night
How can you lose?
Just show them tricks we like
I'm aware of the demons
That you've tucked away
I like to watch you release them
Go on, say

Tell me how you do it
Every time it takes my knees out
Every time you do it
I'm surprised
Show your strings, your wires
Check the lights
Provide me clues, just go ahead
Break your silence
And tell me your secret
Can I watch you train?
You know I like to believe it
Go on, explain

Tell me how you do it
Every time you take my knees out
Every time you do it
I'm on fire, fire
I'm on fire, fire

Tell me how you do it
Every time it takes my knees out
Every time you do it
I'm surprised
How the fuck you do it
Every time you take my knees out
Yeah, every time you do it
I'm on fire, fire
I'm on fire, fire
I'm on fire1Embed
