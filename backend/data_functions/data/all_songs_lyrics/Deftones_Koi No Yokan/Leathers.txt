Leathers Lyrics
This is your chance
Revolt, resist
Open your chest
Look down, reach in

Shedding your skin, showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You're cutting your ties, now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

This is your test
Come forth, confess
Extend your tongue
Speak out, go on

Shedding your skin, showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You're cutting your ties, now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides on the outside
Show your enemy what you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside
From the inside
Cutting all ties now and forever, time to go

Shedding your skin, showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You're cutting your ties, now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides on the outside
Show your enemy what you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside
From the inside4Embed
