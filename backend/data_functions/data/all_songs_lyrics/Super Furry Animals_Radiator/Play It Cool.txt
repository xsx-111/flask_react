Play It Cool Lyrics
Dormant vices turned on their devices
Now she's raising money for the sex appeal
And when she grazed her knee upon the astroturf
All her blood turned green as the tv screamed:

"Whatever you want to do, do it now and pay later
Whatever you want to say, say it now and pay later
Whatever you want to clean, wash it now and go later
Whatever you want to do, do it now and pay later"

Cos it's no problem if you play it cool
Things are different if you act a fool

The electric mistress always sounds so bold
She says I'm free to do anything I'm told
I try the latest newsflash, it's sensational
I feel so seduced, tell me to reproduce

"Whatever you want to do, do it now and pay later
Whatever you want to say, say it now and pay later
Whatever you want to pray, pray it now and pay later
Whatever you want to do, do it now and pay later"
Cos it's no problem if you play it cool
Things are different if you act a fool...


"Whatever you want to do, do it now and pay later
Whatever you want to say, say it now and pay later
Whatever you want to clean, wash it now and go later
Whatever you want to do, do it now and pay later"

Cos it's no problem if you play it cool
Things are different if you act a foolEmbed
