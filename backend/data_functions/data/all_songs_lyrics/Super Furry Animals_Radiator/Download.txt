Download Lyrics
There are people who think, and people who don't
And the people who don't are the ones who have most
There are people who lie, and others who cry
And the people who lie are the ones that get by
In the corporate rush to devour the new
We'll be losing our friends who will number but few
Position yourself on another man's cruise
One to share, the other to chooseEmbed
