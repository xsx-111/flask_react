The Placid Casual LyricsPawprint marks leave a telltale sign
There's a furry friend loose and commiting a crime
Takes no precaution leaving the fold
For the placid casual have remote control
Fuzz clogs up my video
What do we do now
Now we are free again?
Freetown rocked in Sierra Leone
When Valentine Strasser danced his way to the throne
Gunpowder smoke took a heavy toll
But they weren't placid casual so they lost control
Fuzz clogs up my video
What do we do now
Now we are free again?Embed
