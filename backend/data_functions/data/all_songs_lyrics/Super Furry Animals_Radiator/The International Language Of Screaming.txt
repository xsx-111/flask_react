The International Language Of Screaming LyricsIt's not where you're from
It's not where you're at
It's not where you've been
It's where you're between
It's not what you've been
It's not what you've seen
It's where you're between
It's not what you've seen
It's where you're between...
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la...ooh-oh ooh
La la la la...ooh-oh ooh
From A to B
Then on to C
Don't stop the journey
Till you get to Z
Till you get to Z
There's nothing to see
Don't stop the journey
There's nothing to see
Don't stop the journey
Every time I look around me everything seems so stationary
It just sends me the impulse to become reactionary
Spell it out, rip it up, rearrange it on the contrary
If I scream it, I mean it, I hope you will understand me
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la...ooh-oh ooh
La la la la...ooh-oh oohEmbed
