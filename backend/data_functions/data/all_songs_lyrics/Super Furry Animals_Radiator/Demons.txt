Demons Lyrics
Clarity just confuses me
The lines drawn on a map, a strange assembly
When there's northeners in southeners
And westenders in eastenders
And sunny days in January
Left spaces in my diary

But the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
Cause the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while

Cos I know that apathy only ruined me
Hanging around waiting for calamity
And by the year four million
Our skins will be vermilion
I own a dartboard memory
So I'll forget any felony
But the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
Cause the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while

Cos I know that you know
That we know they don't know what's going on

But the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
But the demons never need to know
What the demons never got to see
As we fall in and out of line
Stay in touch now for a while
But the demons never need to read
What we never got around to write
A flirt with mediocrity comes with a heavy penalty
But the demons never need to read
What we never got around to write
A flirt with mediocrity comes with a heavy penalty

Cos I know that you know
That we know they don't know what's going on...Embed
