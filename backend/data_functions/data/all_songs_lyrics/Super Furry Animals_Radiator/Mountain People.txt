Mountain People Lyrics
They don't care about you and me, obviously
No not us, we're the mountain people
So far away from those tree-lined streets
Look so neat, not for us
No fat chance, we're the mountain people

They'll seek us in the valley
They'll seek us on the plain
They own the milk and runny honey
And they're not quite the same, and we

Live together under fantasy oak trees
In the dark, we make sparks
So unique, we're the mountain people
Curiosity comes to plead with me
Vanity strangles me, pulls me
Shakes me down, we're the mountain people

They'll seek us in the valley
They'll seek us on the plain
They own the milk and runny honey
And they're not quite the same, because
They don't care about you and me, obviously
Hand-me-down culture
Waiting for the vulture
Yes, yes, yes, we're the mountain people
Hibernation comes so early this year
Dig the peat, pile it high
Let it dry, one last chance at ignorance
No fat chance, we're the mountain people


One short blast was followed by two longer ones
Short blast, long blast
Coming from the outcast
Put me in a deep freeze
And I'll sneeze, with the mountain people
From a distance I can see them
Pacing (marching) upstream
Slowly, ruthlessly, and then steady
Nets and cages, open, ready
Long-term memory
Soothes me, worry me
Take me, break me
Any way you fancy
Deep freeze put me in it and I'll sneeze
A deep freeze put me in it and I'll sneeze
A deep freeze put me in it and I'll sneeze
A deep freeze put me in it

(So I'll make history)Embed
