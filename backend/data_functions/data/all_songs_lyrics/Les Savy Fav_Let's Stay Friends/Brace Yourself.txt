Brace Yourself LyricsBefore
I was a war
I was a sword
Before
I was a tree
I was a seed
Before I was a cliff, I was a canyon
Before I was a feast, I was a famine
Before I was a day, I was a dawn
Before I was a prince, I was a swan
Before I was a corpse, I was a kid
Before I was a cloud, I was a grid
Before I was a crush, I was a kiss
Before I was a got, I was a wish
Brace yourself!
Before
I was a word
I was a sound
Before
I was a sky
I was a ground
Before I was a stone, I was a hill
Before I was a wheel, I was a will
Before I was a birth, I was a kill
Before I was a wash, I was a filth
Brace yourselves!Embed
