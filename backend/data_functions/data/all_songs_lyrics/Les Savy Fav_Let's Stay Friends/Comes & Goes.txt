Comes & Goes LyricsJudging by your pauses on the phone
What's left unsaid is better left unknown
Maybe we'd be better off alone
The way we used to feel, it only comes & goes
It comes & goes
In the middle of the night I'm pleading
And I know that you're not really sleeping
By the half-light of the dawn I'm seething
Counting every minute until you're leaving
You come & go
At least we used to care enough to shout
Now we'd rather have our peace than have it out
Uncertainty's been swallowed up by doubt
I guess this is what my folks were always sighing aboutEmbed
