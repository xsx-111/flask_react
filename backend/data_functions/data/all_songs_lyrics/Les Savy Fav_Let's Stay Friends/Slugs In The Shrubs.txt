Slugs In The Shrubs LyricsWe're pulling off heists and putting on wigs
We're gathering ice off of flipped over Brinks trucks
And everybody suspects us
They rounded us up and rounded us down
They ground our bones up and founded a town
Where were the Prophets when I got my beat down?
CRACK! goes the crescent wrench
Back to the present tense
Tony's talking to me 'bout
"Get my money out!"
Legs shattered
Teeth chatter
Tony's crony's like
"What's the matter?"
Rack, pull the focus in
Trapped in the basement
Digging like a rabbit for a couple of karats
Squeezing out of dryer vents
On to my retirement
Hopping over hedges
And I'm back out on the street again
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!
Where's that coming at?
Slugs in the shrubs. Kid down the street
Pissing from his pistol about 300 feet
Didn't catch his cousin creeping up on me
There's no better time
To let the cannons fly
Because there are no whites
And there are no eyesEmbed
