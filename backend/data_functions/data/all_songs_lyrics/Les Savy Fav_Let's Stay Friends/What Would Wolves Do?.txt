What Would Wolves Do? LyricsWe huffed the sky into our mouths
We saw the ocean and drank it down
Because we were giants or maybe birds
We slept with lions, tucked into their fur
The world may seem cruel
The worldly may hate us
In time we will show the world why the world made us
(The good we must savor
The bad we must slough
Sooner or later the focus gets soft.)
Slip into epiphany
Oversee oversight
A good stumble's a symphony
A good drift takes drive
Quartz doesn't burn
Rust doesn't hum
Maybe we should blame it on the structures of the sun
Every machine
We've made must bow
To what the wolf and cub have foundEmbed
