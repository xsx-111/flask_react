Scotchgard The Credit Card LyricsDon't tell me about the preciousness of seconds
I've seen the pointlessness of plans
If I've got to go, then I've got to go
I don't expect you'd understand
You got your mommy's menopause
You got your daddy's saber saws
Scotchgard the credit card
The payments never pause
"You're goddamn right I resent the rent
Not just the leases or the money spent
It's the way that it keeps me from the present tense
Won't somebody meet me in the present tense?"
There's just a little stump where my tongue once was
But the place that tastes the bitter still remains
It gets inflamed
Each time it rainsEmbed
