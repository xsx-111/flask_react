Kiss Kiss Is Getting Old LyricsWe were young and we were wicked
We dove headfirst into the thicket
When we came out we bled like sieves
And we told tales no one believed
I want to know
How did it get so cold?
Heavens to Betsy
Won't Somebody get me out of this hole?
In the moonlight our nerves glowed
We traced mazes with our eyes closed
Corncobs like ricks of bones
Shoes shed, our clothes outgrown
You swore it would never get old
I swear I just want to go home
I want to go home
'Cause this is getting old
"Kiss this" is getting old
Kiss Kiss is getting oldEmbed
