Pots & Pans LyricsThere was a band
Called The Pots and Pans
They made this noise
That people couldn't stand
And when they toured
All across the land
The people said, "No, no, no!"
The people said, "No, no, no!"
But the drummer said, "Yes, yes, yes
This tour is a test."
Has your skin grown thick
From bands that make you sick?
Has your skin grown thick
From a thousand stinging pricks?
Have you been made dense
Standing upon the fence?
Have you been made dense
By polish and pretense?
This is where it stops
And this is where it ends
Let's tear this whole place down
And build it up again
This band's a beating heart
And it's nowhere near its endEmbed
