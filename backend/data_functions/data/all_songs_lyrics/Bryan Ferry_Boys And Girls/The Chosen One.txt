The Chosen One Lyrics
Gold and silver walk the main street
The chosen one
Sons and lovers learn to suffer
Born in shadow where we first meet
The chosen one
Dreams that money cannot offer

Swollen river I've been thinking
The chosen one
Words of passion and sorrow
Make believing is the real thing
The chosen one
Here today or gone tomorrow

Here today
Gone tomorrow

April fever is no stranger
The chosen one
Night and morning in my shadow
World of pleasure and danger
The chosen one
Take my spirit, I must follow
Take my spirit
Take my spiritEmbed
