Windswept LyricsOh, baby, do it again and again
I can hear nothing
Windswept is the sand
Oh, baby, oh show me more
I can see nothing
Windswept is the shore
Heatwave to nightshade
Oh I'm feeling swept away
Oh I'm
Oh I'm swept away
Oh I'm
Oh, baby, don't leave me there
With a low whisper
Windswept in the air
You say it's nothing
But a game to play
Oh I'm feeling swept away
Slow, baby, you can take your time
I can hear nothing
Windswept is the tide
A feeling only or a state of mind
Gonna take me high, mama
Mama, take me high
Oh I'm swept away
Oh, baby
Oh I'm swept away
Oh, baby
Oh I'm swept away
Oh, baby
Oh I'm swept away
Oh, baby
Oh I'm swept awayEmbed
