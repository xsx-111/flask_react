Sensation LyricsNever seem to touch
Temptation
I didn't feel enough
Motivation
Then I hear you call
Sensation
Then I need it all
All night long
All night long
Never been in love
Sensation
Never needed much
Complication
Then I hear you call
It's late now
And I need it all
All night long
All night long
Where the beat goes on
Sensation
There you've been and gone
When I hear your name
It's late now
Will I feel the same
Sensation
Sensation
Sensation
Sensation
