Valentine LyricsTell me something I must know
The burning question why
Half a man is twice as much
When he's on the line
Happiness - hard to get
Valentine in hand
None of them will ever guess
But you understand
How many men in a world of their own
There is no end to the great unknown
Tell me something I must know
I'm outside looking in
Train of mirrors none so fair
Let the show begin
How many men in a world of their own
There is no end to the great unknownEmbed
