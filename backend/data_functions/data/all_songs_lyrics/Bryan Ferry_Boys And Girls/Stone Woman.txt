Stone Woman LyricsWhat do you find on the street tonight?
Nothing
It's a river of no return
Diamonds - they're your only friend tonight
Break the mirror and bang the drum
Let's be cool about it
Oh, we're cool about it now
Stone woman
And the pain is gone 
And the pleasure is yet to come
What do you see on the street tonight?
Nothing but another heartbreak hotel
Stranger, you're the only friend tonight
Pick a number and ring the bell
Let's be cool about it
Oh, we're cool about it now
Stone woman
And the pain is gone 
And the pleasure has just begun
Honesty
Stone Woman
