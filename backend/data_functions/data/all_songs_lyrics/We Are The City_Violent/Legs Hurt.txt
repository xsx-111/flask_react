Legs Hurt LyricsI knew my legs had given out
I thought I'd found a new way to react
I'm miles away from influence
But I know that there's a new way for me to act
I knew my legs had given out
I thought I'd fall, but something held me up
Somewhere
Home
Set me apart, sets me apart
Somewhere
Home
(I knew my legs had given out)
Set me apart, sets me apart
(React)
Somewhere
Home
(I knew my legs had given out)
Set me apart, sets me apart
