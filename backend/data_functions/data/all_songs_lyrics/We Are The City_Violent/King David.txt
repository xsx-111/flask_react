King David LyricsDoes it surprise you to know that I'm full of feelings that change?
Does it surprise you to hear the truth from my mouth, "I've been lonely for weeks"?
If you're thinking of yourself, you should think of me instead
You're always thinking of yourself
I'm only thinking of myself
Now you're thinking about me but you should be thinking about God
I'm afraid I'll to go to hell
David, am I going to hell?
I've been thinking of myself when I should think of you instead
Or should i fill my mind with God?
Aren't there better things to put inside my head?
When you thought about yourself
You should have thought of me instead
You're always thinking of yourself
I'm only thinking of myselfEmbed
