Punch My Face LyricsPunch my face
And chase my friend down
The things that God provides are not what i want right now
Communal meals — it's a hard lesson learned
That I am the weakest animal on this earth
When you called the police, I sat there crying on the phone
I thought I had nothing to say, I'm not much for talks
Well, I guess I have more to say than I thought
When you called the police, I sat there crying on the phone
You're breaking my heart — there is no better friend than you
The things that God provides are not what I want this time
Open up my mouth, my ears, my eyes
The dead will bow to One Who Will Never Die
But when you called the police, I still sat there crying on the phone
Just the same
You could sink
To the bottom of a lakeEmbed
