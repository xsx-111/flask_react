Baptism LyricsLittle was said
Little was said between me and that punk kid
I don't want to talk
I'd rather walk as far away as I can from all the things unseen Disguised as things that I see
Is it true that God waits as all the things that I need ... but all the things that I need they are not what I want!
When I finally saw
Underneath the virgin lake
Forgive me all my twists and turns
It's here I realize my worst
All of my plans
All that I planned went wrong
All of my plans
Yeah, all my plans went wrong
And all the pretty girls, none were good enough
Is all of my waiting undone?
No, this is not what I want
When I finally saw
Underneath the virgin lake
Forgive me all my twists and turns
It's here I realize my worst
When i finally did
Underneath the virgin lake
Forgive me all my twists and turns
In you I realize my worstEmbed
