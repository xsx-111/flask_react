20 Ft. Up LyricsA shooting star
Just twenty feet up
I'm like a prisoner in my car
Willing to try things I'll never admit
I think i'm going to be sick
I'm bent out of shape
My bone head is full of it
She saw her car lift up off of the lawn
Is it a sign or is she a fraud?
I don't know
A shooting star
Just twenty feet up
I'm like a prisoner in my car
Willing to try things I'll never admitEmbed
