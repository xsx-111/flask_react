I Am, Are You? LyricsIf I had a son I'd teach him to hide
All of the evil from out of his mind
Invisible, clearly â€“ the being of pride
I call that evil, you call it nice
I know something you don't
And it's fair, my dear, see, you've got to know
I know something you don't
And it's fair, my dear, see, you've got to know
I've grown older and addicted to pride
So I'll pull the wool over your eyes
Humility is a turn-on, being humble a trick
I'll take the easy road and never commit
I know something you don't
And it's fair, my dear, see, you've got to know
I know something you don't
And it's fair, my dear, see, you've got to know
I know something you don't
And it's fair, my dear, see, you've got to know
I know something you don't
And it's fair, my dear, see, you've got to knowEmbed
