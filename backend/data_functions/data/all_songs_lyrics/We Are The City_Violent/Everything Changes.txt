Everything Changes LyricsEverything changed
Everything changed
I knew this day would come
What's worrying worth?
It's hard to give up anger
I wish I was in love
I couldn't speak to sadness before, I can now
Please no more â€” I think I've seen enough
I've never known you to be cruel / uncool
Something must be going wrong
I've never known you to act so cruel, it's uncool
Tell me what's been going on
What's been going on?
I know everybody changes in some way
Since I've been gone everything has changed
And I don't want to change
I know everybody changes in some way
Since I've been gone everything has changed
And I don't want to change
I know everybody changes in some way
Since I've been gone everything has changed
And I don't want to change
I know everybody changes in some way
Since I've been gone everything has changed
And I don't want to changeEmbed
