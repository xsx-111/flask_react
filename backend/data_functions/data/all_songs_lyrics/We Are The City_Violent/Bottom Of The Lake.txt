Bottom Of The Lake LyricsIf you feel sad, like all the people here I've hurt just because
I can
Below – a twisting reef, I'm in sifting sands
Level with the surface
Grasses never greener, never without tact
Just the same
You could sink to the bottom of a lake
Just the same
You could sink to the bottom of a lake
Just the same
You could sink to the bottom of a lake
Just the same
You could sink to the bottom of a lake
It doesn't have to be this way — I feel the same — Everything upset, stay above the waves — I feel the same — unsure I'll find relief
Deeper pools, darker caves reveal here all disdain
Just the same
I'd sink to the bottom of a lake
It's the same
I'd sink to the bottom of a lake
Just the same
You could sink to the bottom of a lake
Just the same
You could sink to the bottom of a lakeEmbed
