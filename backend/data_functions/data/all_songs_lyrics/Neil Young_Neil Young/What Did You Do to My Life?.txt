What Did You Do to My Life? Lyrics
When we were living together
I thought that I knew you would stay
Still when you left me
I tried to pretend we could make it some way

I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)

It's hard enough losing
Without the confusion of knowing I tried
But you've made your mind up
That I'll be alone now, there's nothing to hide

I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)
I don't care if all of the mountains
Turn to dust in the air
(What did you do to my life?)
It isn't fair that I should wake up at dawn
And not find you there
(What did you do to my life?)1Embed
