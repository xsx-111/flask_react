The Last Trip to Tulsa Lyrics
Well, I used to drive a cab you know
I heard a siren scream
Pulled over to the corner and I fell into a dream
There were two men eating pennies
And three young girls who cried
The West coast is falling, I see rocks in the sky
The preacher took his Bible and laid it on the stool
He said "With the congregation running
Why should I play the fool?"

Well, I used to be a woman you know
I took you for a ride
I let you fly my airplane
It looked good for your pride
'Cause you're the kind of man you know
Who likes what he says
I wonder what's it's like to be so far over my head
Well, the lady made the wedding
And she brought along the ring
She got down on her knees and said
"Let's get on with this thing"

Well, I used to be a folk singer
Keeping managers alive
When you saw me on a corner
And told me I was jive
So I unlocked your mind, you know
To see what I could see
If you guarantee the postage
I'll mail you back the key
Well I woke up in the morning
With an arrow through my nose
There was an Indian in the corner
Trying on my clothes
Well, I used to be asleep you know
With blankets on my bed
I stayed there for a while till they discovered I was dead
The coroner was friendly, I liked him quite a lot
If I hadn't have been a woman
I guess I'd never have been caught
They gave me back my house and car
And nothing more was said

Well, I was driving down the freeway
When my car ran out of gas
Pulled over to the station but I was afraid to ask
The servicemen were yellow and the gasoline was green
Although I knew I could not
I thought that I was gonna scream
That was on my last trip to Tulsa
Just before the snow
If you ever need a ride there
Be sure to let me know

I was chopping down a palm tree
When a friend dropped by to ask
If I would feel less lonely
If he helped me swing the axe
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
I said, "No, it's not a case of being lonely we have here
I've been working on this palm tree
For eighty seven years"
He said, "Go get lost!" and walked toward his Cadillac
I chopped down the palm tree
And it landed on his backEmbed
