One Horse Town LyricsYeah, you're burning
Oh, you're burning
My ears with your traveling tales
But my in-laws
Oh, baby, my in-laws
Well, they're trying to tie a young man down
Well, I never should have settled down
Hanging around in a one-horse town
And ever started sleeping around
Well, I never should have settled down
Hanging around in a one-horse town
And ever started sleeping around
But this feeling
Oh, that I'm feeling
Well, you're preying on a tender heart
So this evening
Oh, baby, I'm leaving
On a one-way ticket tonight
Well, I never should have settled down
Hanging around in a one-horse town
And ever started sleeping around
Well, I never should have settled down
Hanging around in a one-horse town
And ever started sleeping around
Well, oh, oh, oh
Well, my friends said don't go settle down
Hanging around in a one-horse town
And ever started sleeping around
Guess I never should have settled down
You see, hanging around in a one-horse town
Does nothing for your state of mindEmbed
