Hollywood Kids LyricsWell they're sure keen on dancin'
Those Hollywood kids, those Hollywood kids got it made
When they act, big doors open
Those Hollywood kids, those Hollywood kids got it made
So let's party, Dustin Hoffman
Those Hollywood kids, those Hollywood kids got it made
Oh how the sun sets on my Boulevard
But leaves quite a shadow to fill
Oh how the sun sets on my Boulevard
But leaves such a shadow to fill
Oh the death of a fast life
Those Hollywood stars, those Hollywood stars got to pay
That's some will you've been drinkin
Those Hollywood stars, those Hollywood stars got to pay
Oh how the sun sets on my Boulevard
But leaves quite a shadow to fill
Oh how the sun sets on my Boulevard
But leaves such a shadow to fill
So look closer, do you still think that
Those Hollywood kids, those Hollywood kids got it madeEmbed
