Just Travelling Through LyricsIf this sounds phoney
Don't say i didn't warn
This place suffocates
And my hearts yearns me on
But the one girl you want
Is waiting right here
But the one girl you want
Is waiting right here
You spent your life inspiring envy
But not yourself
That's the last thing you told me
I'm back to make amends
So go on tell all your friends
You're just travelling through
But the one girl you want
Is waiting right hereEmbed
