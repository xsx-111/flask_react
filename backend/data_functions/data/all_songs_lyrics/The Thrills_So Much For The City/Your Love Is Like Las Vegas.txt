Your Love Is Like Las Vegas LyricsDont you know
You can't rewrite
Your own history
Cigarette Barbie
Your love is like a city I visited
Your love is like a city that burnt me good
Oh Las Vegas
I could only afford one weekend
Don't you know
You're like Pete Best
Bitter after all these years
Just let it go
Your love is like a city I visited
Your love is like a city that burnt me good
Oh Las Vegas
I could only afford one weekendEmbed
