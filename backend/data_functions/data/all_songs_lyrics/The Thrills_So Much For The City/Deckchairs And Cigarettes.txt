Deckchairs And Cigarettes LyricsWell, what can you do
When all that surrounds you
Says slow down
Deckchairs and cigarettes
(Theyre sayin)
Lets go to San Diego
Hey thats where all the kids go
Just don't change a thing
Just don't change a thing
Just don't change a thing
Well the bottom fell out
On our summer
But we knew
What we got ourselves into
(Theyre sayin)
Lets go to San Diego
Hey thats where all the kids go
Just don't change a thing
Just don't change a thing
Just don't change a thing
Lets go to San Diego
Hey thats where all the kids go
You build me up so high
My darling
You brought me down so low
You know it
You build me up so high
My darling
You brought me down so low
You know it
Just don't change a thing
Just don't change a thing
Just don't change a thingEmbed
