Old Friends, New Lovers LyricsEverybody's talking crazy
This town you're hanging up on me
Baby blue
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Over new lovers. (Well my oh my oh my)
Broken friendships surely beckon
Why she asked me?
All because of you
Baby blue
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Over new lovers. (Well my oh my oh my)
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Its such a shame when old friends fall out
Over new lovers. (Well my oh my oh my)Embed
