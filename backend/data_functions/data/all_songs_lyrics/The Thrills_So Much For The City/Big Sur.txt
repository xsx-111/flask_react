Big Sur Lyrics
So much for the city
Tell me that you'll dance to the end
Just tell me that you'll dance to the end
Hey, hey, you're the Monkees
And people said you monkeyed around
But nobody's listening now

Just don't go back to Big Sur
Hangin' around
Lettin' your old man down
Just don't go back to Big Sur
Baby, baby, please don't go
Aw, baby, baby, please don't go

So much for the streetlights
They're never gonna guide you home
No, they're never gonna guide you home
Down at the steamboat show
Yeah, all the kids start spittin'
I guess it didn't live up to the billing

Just don't go back to Big Sur
Hangin' around
Lettin' your old man down
Just don't go back to Big Sur
Baby, baby, please don't go
Aw, baby, baby, please don't go
Just don't go back to Big Sur
Hangin' around
Lettin' your old man down
Just don't go back to Big Sur
Baby, baby, please don't go
Aw, baby, baby, please don't goEmbed
