Lauren Marie LyricsIt isn't right to sit around and think about the awful things that get you down
You've gotta try to wear a smile no matter how hard it can be to do
I could make myself go crazy crying over times I've chased my broken dreams
But what is life without a dream and even I know dreams can still come true
Oh, Lauren Marie
I might never get my arms around you but that doesn't mean that I won't try
Oh, Lauren Marie
You might never want me but that doesn't mean that you won't get me high
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
Oh, Lauren Marie
I don't know where I'm going but I'm headed somewhere
And it's not my time to die
Take a look up, Lauren
The clouds make way for the sunshine
No, I'm never gonna fix up and I might be crazy
But I really got it going on
Listen to me now
I'm singing you a new songEmbed
