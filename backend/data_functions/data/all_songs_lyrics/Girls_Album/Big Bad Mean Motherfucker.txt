Big Bad Mean Motherfucker LyricsI got a high school crush on a California girl, oh yeah
I got a cool guitar and a bag of marijuana, man
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer, I'm a big bad mean motherfucker
I got an ice cream come and I'm feeling fine tonight
And when I get you back home you know I'm gonna do you right, oh yeah
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer, I'm a big bad mean motherfucker
I wear my short jean shorts on a sunny San Francisco day
I like to hear the water in the sunny San Francisco Bay, oh yeah
I'm gonna rock like no one ever told me to stop
Make you a believer, I'm a big bad mean motherfuckerEmbed
