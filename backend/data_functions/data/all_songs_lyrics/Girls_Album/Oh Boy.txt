Oh Boy LyricsTears on my telephone
Salt in my mouth
Hate in my heart baby
Spinning me out
Drivin' me crazy
Oh boy
Dreamin' of you
Wish I was someone
Oh boy
That you can love too
Feet on the ground
Sun in the sky
Everything's cool
I just wish I knew why
I feel so lonesome
Oh boy
When I'm not with you
I love you so much
Oh boy
I wish I was youEmbed
