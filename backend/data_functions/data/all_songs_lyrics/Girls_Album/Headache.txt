Headache LyricsLet's go, let's just get away from here
Let's find a place under the stars
Let's be the people that we want to be
Let's live like we could never part
'Cause I only want to be with you
And I only want to be with you
Yeah, I only want to be with you
All of the time
'Cause I only want to be with you
Yeah, I only want to be with you
And I only want to be with you
All of the time
All of the time
All of the time
All of the time
Every time I hear you sing
I love, love, love you
Every time I hear you sing
I love, love, love you
Every time I hear you sing
I love, love, love you
Every time I hear you sing
I love, love, love youEmbed
