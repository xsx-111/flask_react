Solitude LyricsIt happened just like that
I've realized my place
I'm in a kind of slump
Or so I guess
It's written on my face
They say
These days
I'm listening to the song
They tear me all apart
I'm sleeping in my clothes next to the books
Take care of my heart
My aching heart
But if I settle down
No it won't be with the blues
So I'll keep on rolling, moving right along
Maybe I'll settle down with you
Someday
Some you
Yeah, if I settle down
No it won't be with the blues
So I'll keep on rolling, moving right along
Maybe I'll settle down with you
Someday
Some youEmbed
