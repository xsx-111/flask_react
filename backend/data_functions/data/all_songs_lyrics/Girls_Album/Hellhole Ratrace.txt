Hellhole Ratrace LyricsSee?
It's stupid
I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel
I'm always dreaming and it's never for real
I'm all alone with my deep thoughts
I'm all alone with my heart ache and my good intentions
I work to eat and drink, and sleep just to live
Feels like I'm never getting back what I give
I got a sad song in my sweet heart
And all I'll really ever need is some love and attention
And I don't want to cry my whole life through
I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I want to do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me
Sometimes you just gotta make it for yourself
And sometimes, sugar, it just takes someone else
Sometimes you just gotta make it for yourself
And sometimes, baby, you just need someone else
And I don't want to cry my whole life through
No, I wanna do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I wanna do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me
Sometimes you just gotta make it for yourself
And sometimes, honey, you just need someone else
And sometimes you just gotta make it for yourself
And sometimes, darling, you just need someone else
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah I wanna do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I wanna do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah I wanna do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I wanna do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah I wanna do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I wanna do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me
But I don't want to cry my whole life through
Yeah I wanna do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me
And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I wanna do some dancing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and dance with me2Embed
