Lust for Life Lyrics
Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend
I wish I had a loving man in my life
I wish I had a father
And maybe then I would've turned out right

But now I'm just crazy
I'm totally mad
Yeah, I'm just crazy
I'm fucked in the head

And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I can make a brand new start
In love with you

Oh, I wish I had a suntan
I wish I had a pizza and a bottle of wine
I wish I had a beach house
And we could make a big fire every night

Instead I'm just crazy
I'm totally mad
Yeah, I'm just crazy
I'm fucked in the head
And maybe if I really tried with all of my heart
Then I can make a brand new start
In love with you

Come on, come on, come on, Kayla4Embed
