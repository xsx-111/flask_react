Laura Lyrics
Where did it start?
We used to be friends
Now when I run into you I pretend I don't see you
I know that you hate me
I tried to be tough
I tried to be mean
I don't want to be like this
And I hope that you'll listen
All I'm trying to say is

Reach out and touch me I'm right here
And I don't want to fight anymore
I really want to be your friend forever
Your friend until the end of it all
I know I've made mistakes
But I'm asking you to give me a break
I really want to be your friend forever
Friends forever

You've been a bitch
I've been an ass
I don't want to point the finger
I just know I don't like it
I don't want to do this
What can I do? (What should I do?)
Is it too late?
I just want to say I'm sorry
And I hope that you listen
All I'm trying to say is

Laura, baby, I'm right here
And I don't want to fight anymore
I really want to be your friend forever
Your friend until the end of it all
I know I've made mistakes
But I'm asking you to give me a break
I really want to be your friend forever
Friends forever2Embed
