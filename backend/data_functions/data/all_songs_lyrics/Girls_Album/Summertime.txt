Summertime LyricsOut of my grave
Dust off my name
Get out a good pair of shoes
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Lay in the park
Smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Feeling the breeze
Take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Grow out my hair
Go anywhere
Sleep in until afternoon
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Feeling the breeze
Take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Lay in the park
Smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you1Embed
