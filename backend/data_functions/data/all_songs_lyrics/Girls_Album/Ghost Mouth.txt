Ghost Mouth LyricsI've got nothing to do
And nobody to see
Nowhere to go
And nobody to be
I'm on a ghost train
In a ghost cloud
And I don't know how to get out
And get into heaven
I had a beautiful girl
A musical dream
She wanted it all
But she didn't want me
Now I'm a ghost man
In a ghost town
And I just wish I could get out
And get into heaven
I like the bad boys
In the big towns
I like the bad bands
And their big sounds
I've got a ghost mouth
With a ghost frown
And I'm too scared to get out
And get into heaven
Gotta quit staying home
Gotta get outta here
It just hasn't been home
Since you haven't been here
I knew it when I heard it the first time
I knew it when I heard it the last time
Nothing compares to you
That's right
I've got nothing to do
And nobody to see
Nowhere to go
And nobody to be
I'm on a ghost train
In a ghost cloud
And I don't know how to get out
And get into heaven
Yeah, I just wish I could get out
And get into heaven
But I'm too scared to get out
And get into heavenEmbed
