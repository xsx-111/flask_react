God Damned LyricsObsession is my favorite drug
I know I just can't get enough
'Cause I want you
And I'll be goddamned if I give up at the start
I'll make you hot and making a scene
Just give all your attention to me
'Cause I want you
And I'll be goddamned if I give up at the start
Give me the chance and I'll blow your top
Just let me in and I'll never stop
'Cause I want you
And I'll be goddamned if I give up at the start
So go ahead and play hard to get
'Cause I just get a kick out of it
And I want you
And I'll be goddamned if I give up at the startEmbed
