Our Lady of Sorrows Lyrics
We could be perfect one last night
And die like star-crossed lovers when we fight
And we can settle this affair
If you would shed your yellow, take my hand
And then we'll solve the mystery of
Laceration gravity
This riddle of revenge
Please understand it has to be this way

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand and never be afraid again

We've only got oneâ€‹ chance to put this at an end
And cross the patron saint of switchblade fights
You said, "We're not celebrities, we spark and fade, they die by threes"
I'll make you understand, and you can trade me for an apparition

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand and never

Trust, you said
Who put the words in your head?
Oh, how wrong we were to think
That immortality meant never dying
Stand, take my fucking hand
Take my fucking

Stand up fucking tall, don't let them see your back
And take my fucking hand and never be afraid again

Just because my hand's around your throat...!16Embed
