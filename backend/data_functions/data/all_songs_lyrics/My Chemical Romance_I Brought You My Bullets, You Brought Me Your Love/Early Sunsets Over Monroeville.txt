Early Sunsets Over Monroeville Lyrics
Late dawns and early sunsets
Just like my favorite scenes
Then holding hands and life was perfect
Just like up on the screen

And the whole time while always giving
Counting your face among the living

Up and down escalators
Pennies and colder fountains
Elevators and half-price sales
Trapped in by all these mountains

Running away and hiding with you
I never thought they'd get me here
Not knowing you changed from just one bite
I fought them all off just to hold you close and tight

But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
But would anything matter if you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now, by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained
But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
And would anything matter if you're already dead?
And now should I be shocked by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained
And in saying you loved me made things harder, at best
And these words changing nothing as your body remains
And there's no room in this Hell, there's no room in the next
And our memories defeat us, and I'll end this duress
But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?
And if I had the guts to put this to your head
But does anything matter if you're already dead?
And should I be shocked now, by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained
And in saying you loved me made things harder, at best
And these words changing nothing as your body remains
And there's no room in this Hell, there's no room in the next
But does anyone notice there's a corpse in this bed?28Embed
