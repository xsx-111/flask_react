Skylines and Turnstiles Lyrics
You're not in this alone, let me break this awkward silence
Let me go, go on record, be the first to say I'm sorry, hear me out
Well, if you take me down or would you lay me out?
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason now, now, now!

We walk in single file, we light our rails, and punch our time
Ride escalators colder than a cell (C'mon!)

This broken city sky like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes, hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me where we go from here
This broken city sky like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes, hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me where we go from here,tell me, we go from

And in this moment, we can't close the lids, on burning eyes
Our memories blanket us, with friends we know, like fallout vapors
Steel corpses stretch out towards an ending sun
Scorched and black, it reaches in and tears your flesh apart
As ice cold hands rip into your heart
That's if you've still got one that's left
Inside that cave you call a chest
And after seeing what we saw
Can we still reclaim our innocence?
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason, now

This broken city sky like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes, hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me where we go from here
This broken city sky like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes, hello angel, tell me
Where are you?
Tell me where we go from here, tell me, we go from here24Embed
