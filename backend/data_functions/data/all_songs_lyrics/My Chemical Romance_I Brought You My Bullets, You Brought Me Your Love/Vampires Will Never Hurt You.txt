Vampires Will Never Hurt You Lyrics
And if they get me and the sun goes down into the ground
And if they get me, take this spike to my heart and
And if they get me and the sun goes down
And if they get me, take this spike and
You put the spike in my heart!

And if the sun comes up
Will it tear the skin right off our bones?
And then as razor sharp white teeth rip out our necks
I saw you there
Someone get me to the doctor, someone get me to a church
Where they can pump this venom gaping hole
And you must keep your soul like a secret in your throat
And if they come and get me
What if you put the spike in my heart?

And if they get me and the sun goes down
And if they get me, take this spike and
Come on!
Can you take this spike?
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless night time sky?
Can you take this spike?
Will it wash away this jet black feeling?

And now the nightclub sets the stage for this
They come in pairs
She said, "We'll shoot back holy water like cheap whiskey
They're always there"
Someone get me to the doctor and someone call the nurse
And someone buy me roses and someone burned the church
We're hanging out with corpses and driving in this hearse
And someone save my soul tonight, please save my soul

Can you take this spike?
Will it fill our hearts with thoughts of endless night time sky?
Can you take this spike?
Will it wash away this jet black now?
Let's go! Come on!

And as these days watch over time
And as these days watch over time
And as these days watch over us
Tonight
And as these days watch over time
And as these days watch over time
And as these days watch over us
Tonight
I'll never let them, I'll never let them
I'll never let them hurt you, not tonight
I'll never let them, I can't forget them
I'll never let them hurt you, I promise

Struck down before our prime
Before you got off the floor
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
And these thoughts of endless night
(Bring us back into the light)
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
And this venom from my heart
(Bring us back into the light)
(Bring us back into the light)
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
(Bring us back into the light)
Can you stake my heart? Can you stake my heart?
(Bring us back into the light)
Can you stake me before the sun goes down?
And as always, innocent like roller coasters
Fatality is like ghosts in snow
And you have no idea what you're up against
Because I've seen what they look like
Becoming perfect as if they were sterling silver chainsaws
