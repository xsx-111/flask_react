Headfirst for Halos Lyrics

Yeah!

Well, let's go back to the middle of the day that starts it all
I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling
And now, the red ones make me fly and the blue ones help me fall
And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling

And as the fragments of my skull begin to fall
Fall on your tongue like pixie dust, just think happy thoughts

And we'll fly home, we'll fly home
You and I, we'll fly home
Come on!

Well now, I'm back in the middle of the day that starts it all
I can't begin to let you know just what I'm feeling
And now, the red ones make me fly and the blue ones help me fall
And I think I'll blow my brains against the ceiling now
We'll fly home
You and I, we'll fly home

Now honestly, that's what I said to her
What I said to her, ahh!


Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think happy thoughts, think happy thoughts
Think ha... Whoo!24Embed
