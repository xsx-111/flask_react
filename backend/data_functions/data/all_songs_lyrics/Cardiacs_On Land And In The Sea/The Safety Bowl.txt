The Safety Bowl LyricsAt the plate staring
And he's left with so much on the side
If it comes alive shift with spoony fork and knife
Break it
Walk
Safety away from strife
Kind and cutlery finds a pea and punctures with a hole
All the dinners roll into the safety bowl for feasts of reason and the flow of soul
Bins the bowl as he says...
"Falsehoods and a man of straw is all my eye and Betty Martin saw"Embed
