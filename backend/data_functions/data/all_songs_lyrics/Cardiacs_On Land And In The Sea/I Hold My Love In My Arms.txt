I Hold My Love In My Arms Lyrics
I wash my love with dew's wet dream
I walk my love in morning's gleam
Our love, I know, will never go
I strive to keep her aglow
Out head heavy lovers charms
I hold my love in my arms
In my arms I hold her
She loves me

Her view must feed me when I wake
So, with her as a bride, I'll take
Our love, I know, will never go
I strive to keep her aglow
Out head heavy lover's charms
I hold my love in my armsEmbed
