The Stench Of Honey LyricsLove's smell for the stench of honey
Easy life and love for money
Violent shrieking sirens of warning
Aeroplanes up in the evening
We split a wing of that one tiny fly
In the world that he thrives
In the world that he dies on
Other world
Birds of ill omen forever
Airmen lay their heads together
In the once that he dies, getting heard
Get a word in as I know you deserved
As I saw you deserved
In as deserved
One single fly, flying and singing
Flying in a room, singing heard
In a room as deserved
We split a wing of that one tiny fly
In the world that he thrives
In the world that he dies on
Shot pilot blind and a sight for his eyes in the
Air where he flies
In the air where he dies
We split the wings, tiny blue Spitfire wings
Thousands shot, pilot blind, and a thousand tiny flies
And that thousand's to be won
To be won in their thousands
To be wonEmbed
