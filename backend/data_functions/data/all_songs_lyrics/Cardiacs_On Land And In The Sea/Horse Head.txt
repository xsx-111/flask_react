Horse Head LyricsIn the mirror and in the reflection
His horsey head made him sob for his mum
All he wants to do is quietly breathe
They spoilt him by breaking him
Snip off and snap arms, 
Things that make him and never grow back
In the mirror and in the reflection
His horsey head made him sob for his mumEmbed
