Buds And Spawn LyricsCaught in the field like a DIRTY GREAT POWER
Like THUNDER AND RAIN
Summonsed by NATURE when summonsed by name
Safe in a house, close to door, hide his brain
Life there's fear there's hope all for the best
Raw head and bloody rest might shake their bones to
Paste and glue
Starting the beginning of me/you
Please mum and I hope that my dad means mum and I
Hope that dad please mummy
Tell me to do all the things I do
All things I do
Screwing my courage to the sticking place
Never a good race, never a good race
I 'Hail All Hail' and give my life to live FOREVER
To walk some coal and take some strain ALIVE
All with lovely love on my side
Waiting to see which way he will jump to find which hole he's to creep into when he's old and tired
Not expecting to carry on and
When he's away day goes by day
And his old friends die
His hope and fear's a SECRET for his only child who's expecting and carrying on in a different style
Washed so bland via remedy man
Stand for all that he can stand, throws a canker to the can
Moults a hair putridity man, he's a very special man
He's a very special man
Lies to rest in difficult care for your pleasure
To be there, dissolves in a bed of chair
Reechy institutional man
Walking on fire bright
Something is stealing his feeling again
Lick wounds he HEALS and still feels there's some pain
Washing his DIRT in the MUD and the RAIN
Safe as house against a wall of air and noise
A bucket full of everything he needs... needs
Preserver in for her and him SURVIVE
All with lovely lovely love on their side
Moults a hair putridity man
Squeak hard if he can for his girl
Left his hand for sex with a man, with a different man
Squeak hard fatty man squeak thin fatty man
Shriek and dance to a different noise
Shriek thin fatty girls
Shriek thin fatty boys
Girl boy world puts heads in a whirl
Shriek thin fatty boys
Shriek thin fatty girls
Next. 
To take her back, the break that never works and find all dust
And the steel in my mind urges me to carry on and
Preserver in for her and him
Shake their bones to paste and glue
Starts the begininning of me and you
Woo!
Shriek and dance to a different noise
Shriek THIN FAT GIRL
Shriek THIN FAT BOY
Survive all with love on your lawn
Wishing for preserver in all of your buds and spawn
Washed so bland via liniment man
Stands for all that he can stand
He's a very special man
Moults a hair putridity man
He's a very special man
He's a very special man
Beauty Peacock
Butterfly's care for your pleasure
To be there dissolves in a bed of chair
Reechy institutional...
Beams all hero Apollo Man
Stands for all that he can stand
He's a very special man
Beauty Peacock Butterfly Man
He's a very special man
He's a very special man
Seemly Shining Fireproof Man
Stands for all that he can stand
Stands for all that he can stand
What's the point in giving us handsEmbed
