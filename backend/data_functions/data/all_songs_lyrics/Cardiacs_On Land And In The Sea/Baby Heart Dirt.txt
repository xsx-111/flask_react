Baby Heart Dirt LyricsSeeming to believe when seeing wakes me near morning
And gives me right of way
All all all my friends are leaving always are kept to the day
Or thrown away
I'm saving up for the lighter hours and the safety of war
Named you 'Fly' as a joke and it stuck fast like mud sticks fast
And hung up on the wall it's all and
Everything I need to do it's all and
Everything I do is showing through my aging lines and living on
Mr. Right says 'what is a sin in difficult times?'
Ah! As it's showing through my aging lines
It could mean something other
I'll beat you to the last one at any given time
It never leaves me high
I'm only seeding, only seeding
Brave sun shines on me on my own, it's only for me
Ah! As cold as can be, in an English sea which could mean something other
She knows birthright of her babies, has eyes for the future
We say what has to be said as we wait for the lighter hours
Mr. Right says 'what is a sin in difficult times?'
Ah! As it's showing through my aging lines
Brave sun shines on me on my own, it's only for me
Ah! As cold as can be, in an English sea which could mean something otherEmbed
