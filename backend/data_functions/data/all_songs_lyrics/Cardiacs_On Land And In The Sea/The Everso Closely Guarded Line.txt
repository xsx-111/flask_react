The Everso Closely Guarded Line LyricsOne day in a different way I will give myself a role in this petrifying life
Walking and breathing, 
Water a never be the same
Try a new scheme
A man's machine
And I try at my best
And I try giving all I can and hold it to the window of the world closing my eyes
One day in a definite way I will test the heat of the water with everything in sight
I mean until I am full as an egg ready to burst
Try a new scheme
With a man's machine with an insight to try
And I try at my best
And I try and I cry and I listen to the bustle of the day passing me by
There is life in me left to strike a blow for effect
Still born goes the everso closely guarded line
Oh
One day in a different way I will give myself a role in this petrifying life
Walking and breathing, 
Water a never be the same
Try a new scheme
With a man's machine with an insight to try
And I try at my best
And I try and I cry and I listen to the bustle of the day passing me by
There is life in me left to strike a blow for effect
Hahahahahahahahahahaha...
Still born goes the everso closely guarded line
