Mares Nest LyricsIn my home, my daddy TV brings in all mother world
And she sings so fine
Springs hope and fears all on the world
We must with a tombstone brave shut the shark out from his grave
Wash him bloodless smooth him fair
Stretch his limbs, sleek his hair
Home, this my own receptacle which has seen better days
And a cap full of wind for assistance moves my sea
When pace is easy under sail, though it's taking a while
Better watch better watch I don't blink and...
Blink!
Isolation goes on, happy as the day is long and it drag it's slow length along
Blink!
Isolation goes on, happy as the day is long and it drag it's slow length along
Blink!
Isolation goes on, happy as the day is long and it drag it's slow length along
Pain. Penalties his gain. He's dead. Laying stiff in the arms of assistance
Bringing in life from all around daddy TV brings in all mother world!
(blink)
Isolation comes again in the shape of a child made of plastic
Put tears on its stupid face
(blink)
Isolation comes again in the shape of a child made of plastic
Put tears on its stupid face
Blink and isolation goes on happy as the day is long
Bringing in life from all around
Daddy TV brings in all mother world
Home, this my own receptacle which has seen better days
And a cap full of wind for assistance moves my sea
When pace is easy under sail, though it's taking a while
Better watch better watch I don't blink and...
From my country spring hope and fears for all mother world saying
We must with a tombstone brave shut the shark out from this grave
Wash him bloodless smooth him fair
Stretch his limbs, sleek his hair
Blink! Isolation goes on happy as the day is long and it drag its slow length along
All over the world
And she sings so fine
Springs hope and fearsEmbed
