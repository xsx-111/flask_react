The Duck And Roger The Horse LyricsDuck tells me that I must look a treat
I look my best, so I tell him 'scrub my head and feet, make me nice and neat'
I'm a different man so they say, ha ha ha ha
Roger sees me and begins to cry without warning
'Why are you more than me?'
'I am right so make me wrong your horsey skin won't make The Somme
Your voice is left... disarm me!'
Duck say the horse is daft... (alright)
Sing with your heart and be satisfied with mourning
Duck says you've disowned me
We are full of horsey love but we won't pull if you don't shove
You're faceless in this army
(Horsey going 'round with his little wheel on the floor)
Sulking in the cupboard is a horsey going 'round with his little wheel on the floor
Sulking in the cupboard is a DUCK
Mr. Flower. He's bent on fucking power
He grazed his face to claim his place then claimed he did some more
'I am right so make me wrong your horsey skin won't make The Somme
Your voice is left... disarm me!'
HORSEY GOING 'ROUND WITH HIS LITTLE WHEEL ON THE FLOOR SULKING IN THE CUPBOARD IS A HORSEY GOING 'ROUND WITH HIS LITTLE WHEEL ON THE FLOOR SULKING IN THE CUPBOARD IS A...
Make me nice and neat make me look a treat oh FUCK OFF!
Be kind and put me to sleep please I won't be long
But don't be sad when there is nothing like a lullabyEmbed
