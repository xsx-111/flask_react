Two Bites Of Cherry LyricsAny real egg has a shell as the shell an egg
So break it killer fisty
Killer fisty beat his head
The watching every time beats playing of every kind
And as the way's subsiding every crack is yours for mine
Un-dreaded courage all the time
(Knees up pleading, picks up hope for the drunken line after mine, line after mine)
As if she like sugar as I said she did
She, like a snail, says she, like a gale, says...
'Ideal it's like coming down with a newly born energy
Only trouble is I am too afraid of what was said!'
Ah! Different arms and different eyes
Different colours, different size
Different smell and different cries
Different meaning different life
Only to have white hair caused by the trouble that never comes
And a gale more powerful than all of the guns
Crying need leading astray and steals her gentle smile away came
Made two bites of Cherry when the world's too big for DANGER
World's too big for DANGER
In demolitions all the time
Knees up pleading, picks up hope for the drunken line after mine After mine, after mine
Different arms and different eyes
Different colours, different size
Different smell and different cries
Different meaning
Different
Only to have white hair caused by the trouble that never comes
And a gale more powerful than all of the guns ever
Crying need leading astray and steals her gentle smile away came
Made two bites of Cherry when the world's too big for DANGER
And all for the sake of imitating mum and dad there's good and bad down cul-de-sac and sanctuary making two bites of Cherry when the world's too big for danger
Jeopardy and risk is ten miles highEmbed
