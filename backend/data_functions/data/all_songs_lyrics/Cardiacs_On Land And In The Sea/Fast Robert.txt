Fast Robert LyricsThe life and soul cries himself blind for shorter life
A sight for eyes
The life and soul
Dull as ditch water and swallow whole
The birthright of a baby soul
Covers her baby with mothers hole
One day he's born and he likes the world
And all she holds, she says she's round, and in the ground
Life all around, life all around and it takes him down
The dark's too brown to see what's here but it keeps him warm
And it knows no fear like day or year
Poison in my idle mind makes quick work for the
Mephistopheles
Who quickly makes his excuses
To heaven his own course he sets
With a mind to save his soul and mine what's falling to thinking
Pretty girl oblivion, hostility and suspicion
So what creates competition?
Pipe retracted
Stowed away
Cover the baby without thinking as if to shield him with the warden-ship of a jar
His mum will hide him away from all danger but not very far
Not very far
Sleeping quietly dreaming the last moments of some
Medicine and national song, all upside down
It came out wrong and turned me on
It turned me on
It turns me sleeping quietly dreaming the last moments of some
Drowning girls and drowning boys
Bob up and down like stupid toys
They bob like you who loved me too
Who loved me just in time to cover the baby without thinking
As if to shield him with the warden-ship of a jar
His mum will hide him away from all danger but not very far
Not very
Cover the baby without thinking as if to shield him with the warden-ship of a jar
His mum will hide him away from the danger but not very far
Not very farEmbed
