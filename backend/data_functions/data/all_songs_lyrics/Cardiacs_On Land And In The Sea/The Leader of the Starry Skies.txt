The Leader of the Starry Skies LyricsHe shone down the stairs
Careful Sun
Day when he can move anything with his eyes
He wants to be the leader of the skies
Aims to see the starry sky with his own eyes
Wants to be the leader of the starry skies
All the people make signs as sparse as nothing if at all
Commiseration in a generous new size appealing to us all
Wins some, craves fun, keeps the world as his disguise
Stays young, brave Sun, he aims his cannon to the skies
Ah, must have been zero fizz that caused our lantern to depart
And now best not be moved because it's sad to trust a broken heart
Crave fun, brave Sun, he aimed his cannon to the skies
Slave
Hung brave Sun
He moved the turret with his eyes
And he can't shut up light without thinking but what can I do?
Zealous antics puzzled lazy boy
Gazing at him in the zoo
Makes a vow to quench all fury and rid the air of me and rid of you
Brave Sun! Brave Sun!
(he points the barrel to the sky)
Climbs in, brave Sun
(and then out of the cannon he flies)
And he met another guy, (the leader of the starry sky)
He's here, but burning at such speed that no good dog can obey
Crave fun, brave Sun!
He keeps the world as his disguise
Slave. Hung brave Sun!
The leader of the starry skies
From the tops of the trees to the
Bowels of the Earth
Swings from pillar to post 'cos he's here... and now
And now he's hereEmbed
