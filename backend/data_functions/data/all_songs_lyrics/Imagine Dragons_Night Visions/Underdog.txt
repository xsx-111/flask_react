Underdog Lyrics
Early morning, take me over
Father, father, father, take me to the top
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Early morning, wake me up
Father, father, father, this is not enough
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh!

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be, I love to be the underdog, hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be, I love to be the underdog, hey!

The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!

Early evening, settle down
Father, father, father, who am I to blame?
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Early evening, hush me over
Father, father, father, are we just the same?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be, I love to be the underdog, hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be, I love to be the underdog, hey!

The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!

Living the low life
Low life
Low life
Living the low life
(La, la, la-la la) Low life
(La, la, la-la la) Low life
Living the low life...

Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be, I love to be the underdog, hey!
Hey, that sounds like my luck
I get the short end of it
Oh, I love to be, I love to be the underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!
The underdog, hey!13Embed
