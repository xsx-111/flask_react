Every Night Lyrics
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your hair
That ruffles you up

If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Searchin' to find myself
But all I find is you
I can hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?

If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go

I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

No matter, no matter, no matter what we're facing
It don't matter, it don't matter (It don't matter)
'Cause the reason I'm here
Is the same through all these years (Same through all these years)
I'm not changing, I'm not changing anything at all!

I'm coming home (I'm coming home) to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home (I'm coming home) to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home (I'm coming home) to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night13Embed
