Nothing Left to Say / Rocks Lyrics

Who knows how long I've been awake now?
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning (Beckoning)
Who knows what's right? The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing
On and on
And on and on

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

Below my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out
(Shut it out, shut it out, shut it out)
I've come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
And I keep pushing
On and on and on and on
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down (Hey)
I keep falling, I keep falling down
I keep falling, I keep falling down
If you could only save me
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul...

(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now (Nothing left to say)
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now, oh!
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh, oh oh) There's nothing left to say now (Nothing left to say)
(Oh, oh oh)  There's nothing left to say now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
(Oh) I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now


Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window


Timber, timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Why can't I see
What's right in front of me?

We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart27Embed
