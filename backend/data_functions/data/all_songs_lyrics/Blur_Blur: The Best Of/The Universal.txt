The Universal Lyrics
This is the next century where the universal's free
You can find it anywhere, yes, the future has been sold
Every night we're gone and to karaoke songs
How we like to sing along though the words are wrong

It really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
When the days, they seem to fall through you
Well, just let them go

No one here is alone, satellites in every home
Yes, the universal's here, here for everyone
Every paper that you read says tomorrow's your lucky day
Well, here's your lucky day

It really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
If the days, they seem to fall through you
Well, just let them go
Well, it really, really, really could happen
Yes, it really, really, really could happen
When the days they seem to fall through you
Well, just let them go
Just let them go
Just let them go22Embed
