No Distance Left to Run Lyrics
It's over
You don't need to tell me
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel safe
In your sleeping tonight
I won't kill myself trying to stay in your life
I got no distance left to run

When you see me
Please, turn your back and walk away
I don't want to see you 'cause I know the dreams that you keep
That's where we meet
And when you're coming down, think of me
I got no distance left to run

Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh
Oooh

It's over
I knew it would end this way
I hope you're with someone who makes you feel
That this life, it's alive
One who settles down, stays around, spends more time with you
I got no distance left to run
I'm coming home
So cold
No more
Home
No more, no more, no more7Embed
