Song 2 Lyrics
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!

I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

(Woohoo!) When I feel heavy metal
(Woohoo!) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woohoo!) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah28Embed
