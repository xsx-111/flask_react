Silver Rider LyricsAt times I see you, you silver rider
Sometimes your voice is not enough
Your face in windows outside forever
Nobody dreamed you'd save the world
Nobody dreamed you'd save the world
Your march is over
The great destroyer
She passes through you like a knife
Oh take me with you
You silver rider
Sometimes your voice is not enough
Sometimes your voice is not enoughEmbed
