Broadway (So Many People) LyricsLast night just north of Houston
Broadway so many people
Through your third story window
I see my favorite record store
Where is the laughter?
Where is the laughter?
Smiling, tasting the irony
Broadway so many people
Outside just round the corner
Leather and Bob Marley t-shirts
Where is the laughter?
Where is the laughter?
Baby, 10,000 years ago
Broadway so many people
Sleeping down at the factory
Waiting and singing so softly
Where is the laughter?
Where is the laughter?
The garden of Eden
The voices of children
Where is the laughter?Embed
