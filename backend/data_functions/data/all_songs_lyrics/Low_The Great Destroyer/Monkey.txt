Monkey LyricsOh my my
Little white lie
I swear I'm gonna make it right
This time
It's like a radio
Turning way down low
Telling me things I do not know
I know
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Now who's to blame
We used to be the same
Now you won't let me speak your name
What a shame
It's a suicide
Shut up and drive
We're never gonna make the light
But it's alright
'cause tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey dies
Oh, tonight you will be mine
Tonight the monkey diesEmbed
