Step LyricsThe levee's breaking
Feel it shakin' like the dirt
All the kids are sleeping
Silent dreams beneath their heads
Go to wake up screamin'
Little lights above your bed
Hey, keep an eye on what you say
You think the words just walk away
But they creep into my brain
Sinking deep into my step
My step
I am the walrus darlin'
No one ever knows my name
You are the chorus sweet thing
Never sing that song again
Hey, keep an eye on what you say
You think the words just walk away
But they're creepin' through my brain
Sinkin' deep into my step
My step
Hey, keep an eye on what you say
You think the words just walk away
But they're creepin' through my brain
Sinkin' deep into my step
My stepEmbed
