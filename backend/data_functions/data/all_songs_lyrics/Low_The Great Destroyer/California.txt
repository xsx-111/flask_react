California LyricsSee your reflection in your mind
You keep your revelations wide eyed
They knew just where to draw the line
You let them get you every time
Though it breaks your heart
We had to sell the farm
Back to California where it's warm
It fell around you like the stars
You picked up everything they dropped
And though it breaks you like a song
You had some secrets of your own
Though it breaks your heart
We had to sell the farm
Back to California where it's warm
It's warm
It's warm
Though it breaks your heart We had to sell the farm
Nights were just too long
With all your children gone
Would it keep you strong
If I said it with a song
Back to California where it's warmEmbed
