On the Edge Of LyricsSoft from your lips to the rise of your stomach
Your lungs filled with fingers keep jamming words down my throat
Nothing to steal we've got nothing to love
Nothing to spill because oh we're so innocent oh

So cut to you dead and now cut to the laughing
Cut through our bodies and lastly into our oh
Oh on the edge of
Oh
Oh on the edge ofEmbed
