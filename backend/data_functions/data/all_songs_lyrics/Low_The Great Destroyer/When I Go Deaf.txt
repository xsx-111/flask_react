When I Go Deaf LyricsWhen I go deaf
I won't even mind
I'll be all right
I'll be just fine
I'll stay out all night
Looking at the sky
I'll still have my sight
Yeah, I'll still have my eyes
And, we will make love
We won't have to fight
We won't have to speak
And we won't have to lie
And, Iâ€™ll stop writing songs
Stop scratching out lines
I won't have to think
And it won't have to rhyme
When I go deaf
When I go deaf
When I go deaf
When I go deaf
When I go deaf
When I go deaf
When I go deaf
When I go deafEmbed
