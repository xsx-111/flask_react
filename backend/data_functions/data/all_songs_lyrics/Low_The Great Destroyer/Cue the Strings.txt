Cue the Strings LyricsBefore you speak
The words are plain to see
Upon your skin
They sing, they dance and spin
So what, pray tell
Will save you now
Here comes that cold sunrise
And at the peak
We reach to cue the strings
They ring
So sweet
They lean and plead release
So what, pray tell
Will save you now
Here comes that cold sunrise
Here comes that cold sunriseEmbed
