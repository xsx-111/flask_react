Walk into the Sea LyricsI can walk into the sea
And I can choke away the memories
Do I have to stay alive
Just to keep our dresses white
You've come to me in dreams
With all the other pretty things
You tell me about a savior
And how his soul goes on forever
And time is just a hunger
It leads itself to nothing
When it finally takes us over
I hope we float away together
Yeah, time's the great destroyer
Leaves every child a bastard
But when it finally takes us over
I hope we float away togetherEmbed
