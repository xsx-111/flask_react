Rock Dust Light Star Lyrics
Rock dust light star
And it's coming at you, baby, yeah

I'm a man on the moon
I hope I don't come back too soon
Am I the only one to see the light?
No use in getting down upon your knees tonight
So I don't feel love
Cause I got no faith
I've seen those twisted lies thrown back into my face
I've seen the crazy doctrines of the human race
I must be alone
How could it be
Your gift to me (to me)
A salvo of heavy artillery
It's nothing but your war
You can call it what you like
I know where I'm from
And I'm cold and dark
And all the sinners are just saints without sparks
I'm having trouble telling them apart, oh yeah

Coming at you
Rock, dust, light, star
And it's coming at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you, baby, what you're made of, what you are
Now look and see
Those stars for you and me
Waiting like silent killers in the night
Atomic legions that you can never fight
I've never felt I've ever prayed
Don't have to join in with in the other slaves
I'm not the only one who feels betrayed, yeah
See the more I think about it
I'm born against the grain
Ooh, ooh, I won't be born again
Salvation's coming from on high
(Coming at you baby, through the sky, from on high, yeah)

Coming at you
Rock, dust, light, star
And it's coming at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you, baby, what you're made of, what you are
Coming at you
Rock, dust, light, star
And it's coming at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you, baby, what you're made of, what you are
Rock, dust, light, star
Rock, dust, light, star
I'm a square pig in a round hole
Maybe there's no place left for my wounded soul
Maybe the king of kings finally lost control of it
Coming at you, baby
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you, baby
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
(Salvation's coming)
Coming at you baby (from on high)
Thirty six thousand miles an hour
(Salvation's coming)
Coming at you baby
What you're made of, what you are
Look up and see those stars for you and me
Look up and see
Rock, dust, light, star
Coming at you baby
From on high, yeah
Rock, dust, light, starEmbed
