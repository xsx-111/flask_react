Lifeline LyricsRollin', down the sunny avenues
Well, all this running around
I'm back on the road with you again and baby
Free ride, I haven't got a care in the world
There's only me and you, girl
Back on the road with you again, baby
Sweet life, well, honey, you're my best life
And all because you saved me
Zero to hero, that's what you made me
Lady, you know that she excites me
But her momma never liked me
I'm back on the road with you again, baby
Don't beg no hole in my soul
Don't you spoil my sweet charade
I get high on the girl
For me she was clearly made
And don't get mixed up about it
Cause she won't leave me at sea
I get a groove with the girl
She got a lifeline out to me
Deadlines, we won't be needing any of those no more
Seems like the right time
To be back on the road with you again, baby
I feel like, I'll never feel the cold now
I'll never be alone now
'Cause I'm back on the road with you again
Don't beg no hole in my soul
Don't you spoil my sweet charade
I get high on the girl
For me she was clearly made
I don't need no destination
'Cause my baby saving me
She got lifeline of love
She got it all thrown out to me
Don't lose me now
'Cause I need you, baby, need you, baby
We gotta get up, run away, my baby
We gotta get on, run away, baby
You know your momma never liked me
'Cause she said we're gonna break up
Said it's gonna never work
But it's too bad, baby, I'm back on the road again
I'm gonna move ya
Run into the sunset
Just me and you together
I've gotta groove on girl
Your momma never liked me
Don't beg no hole in my soul
Don't you spoil my sweet charade
I get high on the girl, yeah
For me she was clearly made
I just got my feel good factor
And it's gone right through the roof
I get the blues with the news, girl
Let's get it on the hoof
Throw me a lifeline, throw me a lifeline
A lifeline of love, yeah
Throw me a lifeline, throw me a lifeline
A lifeline of love, yeah
Oh, I need your lifeline of love
Get it out to me
Well, I need her
Don't lose me now
Don't lose me now
I got your lifeline all thrown out to me
Oh, I've got your lifeline
Oh, got your lifeline of love, yeahEmbed
