Never Gonna Be Another LyricsDust off that dusty photograph
And think of how we laughed
Roll up those shutters to your shop
Cause now this circus got to stop
Flick through those dog eared magazines
When you were on the scene
But now that you're gone
There's never gonna be another
Never gonna be another like you
The people in the street are saying
There's never gonna be another
(Whoa, never gonna)
Never gonna be another like you
I watched a soul when it was young
You'd finished when you just begun
I'd like to take a feather from
The wings that used to carry you
So suddenly, you seem at peace
We know that you have been released
Don't think they'll cry for you tomorrow
They never cried for you that day
But the people in the street are saying to me, baby
There's never gonna be another
(Never gonna be)
Never gonna be another like you
When you were on the scene
There's never gonna be another
(And now that you're gone)
Never gonna be another like you
You stepped into the light
(There's never gonna be another)
And you are the sun now
(Never gonna be another)
Never gonna be another like you, another like you
When you were on the scene
There's never gonna be another
(You were on the scene)
Never gonna be another like you
And dust off that dusty photograph
And think of how we laughed, yeah
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
(I think of you, I think of you)
Now that you're gone
I think of youEmbed
