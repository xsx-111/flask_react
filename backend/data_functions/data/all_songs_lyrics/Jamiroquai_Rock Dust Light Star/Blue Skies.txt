Blue Skies LyricsSo these are the figurines
Acting out all the scenes before my eyes
I thought I knew them all by name
But they started looking much the same
And it's no surprise
That I don't wanna listen too much
How can I give up on all the days I know I've won?
There's nothing but rainbows
I believe in the shadows
Now honey, thought I might be dropping out
But now I am gonna work it out, I am gonna work with me
I am runnin' like another loser
Then I'm rolling like a rusty ship on a stormy sea
You know that people are saying
Strange things
Talk to the hand
'Cause I know you think the face is gone
I don't wanna listen too much
I'm not gonna give up on all the days I know I've won
There's nothing but blue sky
There's nothing but blue sky
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I am skimming like a skipping stone on a silver lake
I'll take it when the chips are down
But to play the perfect happy clown
You gotta make a mistake
And people are saying strange things
And I don't wanna listen too much, yeah
Nothing but blue sky, blue sky
How can I tell you I know this won't be the last song?
I don't wanna listen too much
Not gonna give up on all the days that I know I've won
That's where I'm going
'Cause there's nothing, nothing but blue sky
That's where I'm going
Nothing but rainbows falling down on me
'Cause there'll be nothing but blue sky
Can't you see that's where I'm going
Got to believe me, that's where I am going
Blue sky
That's where I'm going
Blue sky
That's where I'm goingEmbed
