Goodbye To My Dancer Lyrics
Goodbye, goodbye
Seems like I knew you since you were a little girl
Cried out to you, never thought that you'd ruin my world
Now we're all broke up, I glimpse you on the street
Just gotta put up, shut up because you spread the sheets
This world keeps spinning around but I just don't care
I had my name written up in lights, wanted you to share
I don't mind to do my thing, do yours yourself
I can't stick around here, no, it's bad for my health

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
Though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(And there's no one to hold me)

Got your letter just yesterday
So you might as well get out of here because you've been paid
It doesn't matter cause I've got my lover and she's into me
But I'm finding it hard inside to set you free

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
Though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(And there's no one to hold me)
Keeping all the hearts you get to break
Got another lover who loves mistakes
I never get close enough to touch
Cause you're cool when you're burning
Cool when you're burning

I said goodbye to my dancer
So long to my lover
And though we never made it
I've still got to say it
I can't stand any other
(And there's no one to hold me)

Now I pretend that I don't care
But I'm a lonely man and I'm running scared
It's over now so, baby, walk away
It's broken down, it won't work again
(And there's no one to hold me)

Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
(I got to walk away, baby)
Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
(I gotta set you free, baby)
Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
Goodbye to my dancer
(I gotta let you go)
Goodbye
(And there's no one to hold me)
Nobody to hold me, no, no
Goodbye to my dancerEmbed
