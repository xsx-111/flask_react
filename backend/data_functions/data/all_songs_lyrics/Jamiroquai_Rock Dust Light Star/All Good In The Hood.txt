All Good In The Hood LyricsDon't kick me when you know I'm down, baby
I've got my reasons but you're cherry picking love grenades
Throwing them at me again
Don't let me see you with a sad face
Don't wanna see ya smashing up all those dreams
That's the way it's always been
You know that it's
All good in the hood tonight
Did I forget to mention
A little bit of tension makes the world alright
And there's some pain you can't do without
That's the pain you're tasting
When you started walking out
Ooh, mercy, mercy, it's a hard game
When love is war and war will never be the answer
I feel that rage again
This is the storm you love to ride on
Your face is thunder
Tears are falling down like rain
On my window pane
Keep on sayin' it
All good in the hood tonight
Did I forget to mention
A little bit of tension makes the world alright
And there's some pain you can't do without
That's the pain you're tasting
When you started walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
All good in the hood tonight
Did I forget to mention
A little bit of tension makes the world alright
And there's some pain you can't do without
That's the pain you're tasting
When you started walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking out
Walking out on me, yeah, walking outEmbed
