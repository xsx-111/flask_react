White Knuckle Ride Lyrics
Yeah, gonna make it better
Ooh yeah
Yeah, gonna make it right

Here it is, there's no way to make it better
Gets ya down, it's pressure (pressure)
I'm serious, troubled genie's on the way
Got a little something for ya, it's pressure (pressure)
It gets ya

Now it ain't what ya know
But I knew that anyway
I can't let this pressure go
This pressure's here to stay, yeah

Yeah, white knuckle ride, gonna make it better
White knuckle ride, I'm on it baby
Yeah, white knuckle ride, gonna make it right
White knuckle ride, I'm on it baby
It's not so easy to control (pressure!)
It's not so easy to control (pressure!)
There's no easy way to make it better
There it is (there it is), couldn't change it if I wanted
Taste it all the time, it's pressure (pressure)
Yeah, hey, oh baby, step into the light
Don't know if I can recover (don't know if I can recover)
Got me round its little finger (got me round its little finger)
Pressure (pressure)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, there it is (there it is)
Couldn't change it if I wanted, taste it all the time
Step into the light
Don't know if I can recover, taste it all the time
I taste it all the time, yeah

Yeah, white knuckle ride, gonna make it better
White knuckle ride, I'm on it baby
Yeah, white knuckle ride, gonna make it right
White knuckle ride, I'm on it baby
It's not so easy to control (pressure!)
It's not so easy to control (it's not so easy to control it)
There's no easy way to make it better (I'm on it, baby)
Get a white nuckle ride
Yeah, white knuckle ride, I'm gonna make it better
White knuckle ride, I'm on it
Yeah, white knuckle ride, gonna make it right (I know I'm gonna make it)
White knuckle ride, I'm on it baby
It's not so easy to control (pressure!)
It's not so easy to control (pressure!)
That's not easy to control (pressure!)
Get a white nuckle ride
I'm on it, babyEmbed
