Hey Floyd LyricsThere's a man runnin' hot
And there's a night train
I know he's gonna stick it out
Ride that crazy white horse
He's a man
He's a big in paradise
But it might get blown into the winds tonight
Seems life's a record stuck
And that it couldn't make it off
He's a cool hand Luke
He's Jimmy cross slippery slope
He's just possessed and crazy
Thank you for nothing baby
All those dreams are going up in smoke
I say, hey Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you gotta learn how to break the chain
Oh, yeah
There's a night train to your heartbreak, get on
It's the big time, that's been driving you on
Note my blue sky, hanging over, your head
So what cha gonna do Floyd? I've got to know
Got to know what you're going to do, yeah
What cha gonna do? What cha gonna do?
What cha gonna do Floyd? Do Floyd
I got to know, I've got to know what you're going to do
There's a night train to your hearth break, get on
It's the big time that has been driving you on and on
Note my blue sky, hanging over your head
Know my blue skies hanging over you, you
Come on, Floyd
Shoot em up and shoot em down
Cut down that spot of freedom
Kick it, stick it, do it what you can
Got me the pissys fit
Get rid of all that shit
Floyd, can't forget, you're a man
I said, hey Floyd you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you got the time on your hands to mend
Come on, Floyd
Gotta learn to break that chain now, baby
Hey Floyd, gotta learn to break that chain now, baby
Get off that shotgun ride
I know how much you tried
To blow the high priest's ass off paid away
You're no extravaganza
Do the play in the dirty dancer
Hell man, they even know your name
Hey Floyd, you got your mind in a mess again
Hey Floyd, you gotta learn how to break the chain
Hey Floyd, that's all I ask of you
Hey Floyd, don't get yo mind in a mess againEmbed
