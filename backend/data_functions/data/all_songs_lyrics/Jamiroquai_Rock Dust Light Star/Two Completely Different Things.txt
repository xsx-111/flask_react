Two Completely Different Things LyricsOh hey, baby
What I want and what you give
Oh hey, baby
What I want and what you give
Pass each other by like ships in the night
And I still wonder why it's like it is
Memories of how we'd cross this bridge together
Super glued forever, it was all so fine
And what I want and what you give
Are two completely different things
And it just don't feel the same
Now you don't call my name
And when we had what we had
For me life didn't seem so bad
I keep staring every day
At this empty picture frame
Oh hey, baby
What I want and what you give, yeah
Trouble brewing, yes, I thought we'd ride the storm
Sail away together on an ocean blue
I don't remember when the mystery was gone
But now I'm only half as strong without you babe, oh, yeah
What I want and what you give
Are two completely different things
And it just don't feel the same
Now you don't call my name
I know I'm hard to understand
But you'll always be part of my plan
I keep staring every day
At this empty picture frame
What I want and what you give, yeah
They're just two completely different things, ah, baby, yeah
What I want and what you give to me
Ooh, I know I'm hard to understand, baby
But you'll always be part of my plan
Can't you see?
What I want and what you give
Are two completely different things
It just don't feel the same
When you don't call my name
And if I had, what we had
For me life wouldn't seem so bad
I keep staring every day
At this empty picture frame
And what I want and what you give, yeah, ooh
They're just two completely different things
Two completely different things again
I don't remember when the mystery was gone, oh
But I know now, now, now I'm only half as strong without you, baby
I think I still love you, baby
And I know that I'm hard to understand
But you'll always be part of my plan
I think I, I think I, I think, I think, I think
I still love you, babyEmbed
