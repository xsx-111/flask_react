Smoke and Mirrors Lyrics
Stop what you're doing, get into this groove
Can't you see the signs?
Carried away in a wave of devotion
With the music pumping
The stars are shining so bright
Stop what you're doing, get into this groove
Can't you see the signs?

Slip on out and slip on into his shoes
He dances like a plasticine machine
Some guys seize the day
Some guys got the way
Sweet old-school attraction
He wants your lovin' tonight

He tells you you're no cheapskate reproduction
You're sure that he must be the real thing
Well you're damned if you do
And you're damned if you don't
'Cos your friends don't like his haircut
But he wants your lovin' tonight

Oh, seven brides might meet the seven brothers
That doesn't mean that you are one of them
Seventeen other lovers left the scene
But you don't think that you're the go-between
Girl, think about it
He wants your lovin' tonight
Oh, those days turn into years and you did nothing
And now you wish you'd been left there on the shelf
Baby, you're an angel
Doing things for him and not yourself

Those flaming eyes that flicker in the fast lane
Don't tell of broken hearts he's left behind
It's hard not to succumb
But you were stuck under his thumb
You won't have a word of it
Your mama's going out of her mind

This is not the thing she wanted for ya
Chained up to the kitchen sink of life
Thirteen years of negligence
But you're too far in to jump the fence
I bet you rue the day
When you took his lovin' that night

So hard for you to see through smoke and mirrors
How come you never look before you leap
Well, baby, you're an angel
You didn't know he's playing this for keeps
Did you see the good, the bad, the ugly?
They told you it was far too far to drop
Oh, baby, you're an angel
Crying on a shoulder made of rock

Aaaaah, aaaaaah
He wants your lovin'
Tonight, my dear, tonight, your lovin'
Tonight, my dear, tonight, your lovin'
Tonight, my dear, tonight, your lovin'
Tonight, my dear, tonight, your lovin'
Tonight, my dear, tonight, your lovin'
Tonight, my dear
He wants your lovin' tonight
He wants your lovin' tonight
He wants your lovin' tonight
Tonight, my dear, tonight, your lovin'
Tonight, my dear
He wants your lovin' tonightEmbed
