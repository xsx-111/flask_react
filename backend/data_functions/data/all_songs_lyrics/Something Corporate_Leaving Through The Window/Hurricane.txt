Hurricane Lyrics
Shake down, you make me break
For goodness sake, I think I'm on the edge
Of something new with you
Shout out, don't drown the sound
I'll drown you out, you'll never scream so loud
As I want to scream with you

Standing there with your smile blinding
Your eyes from seeing my face as I'm dying
To figure out a girl
(But she drifts so far away) But she drifts so far away
I'm on her coast so maybe I should stay
And map around your world

So don't say
These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
But the wind went and pulled me
Into your hurricane
Into your hurricane

Stand up, don't make a sound
Your ears might bleed, there's sweet fluorescent enemies
That live inside of me
The world moves faster than I knew
Not fast enough to not creep up on you
And the space we put between
So pull me under your weather patterns
Your cold fronts and the rain don't matter
Because a sun burn's what I needed

So don't say
These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
But the wind went and pulled you
Into the hurricane
Into the hurricane

You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake
Now I count the hours til you wake
With your baby's breath,  breathe symphonies
Come on, sweet catastrophe
Well maybe this time I can follow through
I can feel complete, stop paying due
Stop the rain from falling, keep my ocean calm
This time I know nothing's wrong

So don't say
These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
But the wind went and pulled me in
And no you don't say
These currents are still killing me
And you can't explain
But the wind went and pulled me
Into the hurricane
Into the hurricane
Into the hurricane2Embed
