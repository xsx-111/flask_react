The Astronaut Lyrics
I've been sleeping with ghosts
I've been watching stars crawling out of the sky
And I've been hoping I'm close
To the spaceman movies I call my life, my life
And I've been climbing ladders through time
I've got tunnel vision but I'm doing fine
And I've been watching stars coming off of the wall
And maybe if I'm lucky
I could catch them before you fall
And you are not alone

Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Crawling out of the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high

And I've been holding this microphone
And I've been shouting out but I think we're alone
And I've got platinum vision and a tin foil touch
I've got you to propel me but I still need so much
Not to be alone
Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Crawling out of the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high

And you are not alone
You are not alone
You are not alone

Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Crawling out of the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high

Calling out to the astronaut
I need some of what you've got
I need to be high
Disappear in the world she brought
Calling out to the astronaut
I need to be high
And I've got you to propel me
But I still need so much1Embed
