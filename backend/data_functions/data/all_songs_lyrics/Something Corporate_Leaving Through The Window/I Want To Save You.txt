I Want To Save You Lyrics
Standing on the edge of morning
Scent of sex and New Found Glory
Playing as she's pulling back her hair
She drives away, she's feeling worthless
Used again but nothing's different
She'd stay the night but knows he doesn't care
Home by three to deafening quiet
The porch light's off, guess they forgot it
She'd cry herself to sleep but she don't dare

And she wants to be a model
She wants to hear she's beautiful
She's beautiful

I want to save you
I want to save you
I need you to save me too
I want to save you

Dressed by dawn and out the door
No lights, she memorized the floor
So she could leave without being detected
She works 'til three, it's uniform
She dreams that he'll come by the store
She prays for days when boys mean she's protected
And she wants someone to see her
She needs to hear she's beautiful
She's beautiful

I want to save you
I want to save you, yeah
I need you to save me too
I want to save you

And she won't sleep
(She won't sleep)
And she won't sleep
And she won't sleep
At all

I want to save you
I want to save you
I need you, save me too
I want to save you
Let me save you!

Let me save you
(I want to)
Let me save you
(Save you)
Let me save you
(I want to)
Let me save you
(Save you)
I want to save youEmbed
