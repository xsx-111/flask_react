Cavanaugh Park Lyrics
At Cavanaugh Park
Where I used to sit all alone in the dark
And dream about things that I cannot say
You always said destiny would blow me away
Nothing's gonna blow me away

At Cavanaugh Park
Where you used to take me to play in the sand
And said to me, "Son, one day you'll be a man
And men can do terrible things."
Yes they can

And there was never any place
For someone like me to be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
That ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change

At Cavanaugh Park
We used to get high watching teams as they fought
They loved my friend Adam but he always got caught
Man, that kid made fuckin' up look cool
Aren't we all so cool?
No, no
And there was never any place
For someone like me to be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
That ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change

Never do change
Never do change
Never do change

At Cavanaugh Park
Where I used to think that this life would be good
And I would do things that I thought that I should
No one's gonna tear me down

And there was never any place
For someone like me to be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
That ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change
And there was never any place
For someone like me to be totally happy
I'm running out of clock
That ain't a shock
Some things never do change
Never do change

Never do change
Never do change
Never do changeEmbed
