Fall Lyrics
I close my eyes, thought I was lost but I was stranded
I go outside, to my surprise the sky had landed

And wonder when I

Now old cassettes and cigarettes will be the ones to save you
How can you ask for me to stay
When all you ever do is go?
Just go
And so I

And so I fall
I let my heartbeat drop
I falter as the music stops and you watch me as I stall
And wonder when I

Go on
You’ve kept me waiting

And watch me as I

You know I just can’t handle this, handle this at all
And so I fall
I let my heartbeat drop
I falter as the music stops and you watch me as I stall
And wonder when IEmbed
