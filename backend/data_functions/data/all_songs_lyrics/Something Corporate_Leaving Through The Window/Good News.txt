Good News Lyrics
She's trapped inside her room with reruns on the screen
Old books and movies but she can't stop thinking
I'm torn between myself, my radio, my friends
I want to write this one off over and over and over again

And then she looked at me to scream
"My castles are falling and I can't look in the street
Without everything changing."

I want to read good news, good news
I want to be innocent again
I want to read good news, good news
But nothing good is happening

She waits all day, she stands a stranger in her skin
And she moves the science with her hands
She lines the walls with every paper she can see
These words consume her but they never set her free

And then she looked at me to scream
"My castles are falling and I can't look in the street
Without everything changing."
I want to read good news, good news
I want to be innocent again
I want to read good news, good news
But nothing good is happening

Nothing good is happening
But nothing good is happening

I want to read good news, good news
I want to be a little kid again
I want to read good news, good news
But nothing good is happening

I want to read good news, good news
I want to go to sleep at night again
I want to read good news, good news
But nothing good is happening
But nothing good is happening
But nothing good is happeningEmbed
