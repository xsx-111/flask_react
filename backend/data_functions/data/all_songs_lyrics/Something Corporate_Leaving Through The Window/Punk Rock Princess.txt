Punk Rock Princess Lyrics
Maybe when the room is empty
Maybe when the bottle's full
Maybe when the door gets broke down
Love can break in
And maybe when I'm done with thinking
Maybe you can think me whole
Maybe when I'm done with endings
This can begin

This can begin
This can begin

If you could be my punk rock princess
I would be your garage band king
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how you're gonna be something

Maybe when your hair gets darker
Maybe when your eyes get wide
Maybe when the walls are smaller
There will be more space
And maybe when I'm not so tired
Maybe you can step inside
Maybe when I look for things
That I can't replace
I can't replace
I can't replace

If you could be my punk rock princess
I would be your garage band king
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how you're gonna be something

If I could be your first real heartache
I would do it over again
If you could be my punk rock princess
I would be your heroin

Well I never thought you'd last
I never dreamed you would
You watch your life go past
You wonder if you should

You should be my punk rock princess
I would be your garage band king
You could tell me why you just don't fit in
And how you're gonna be something
If I could be your first real heartache
I would do it over again
If you could be my punk rock princess
I would be your heroin

Whoa oh, you know
You only burn my bridges
Whoa oh, you know
You just can't let it sink in
You could be my heroine
You could be my heroine1Embed
