I Woke Up in a Car Lyrics
I woke up in New York City
From my sleep behind the wheel
Caught a train to Poughkeepsie
And time stood still
She wrote me a letter from San Diego
To qualify her luck
These flights connect through Arizona
But I think I'll stay stuck

So here I am
Here I am, whoa

Well I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog so I could see
The Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys

I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
I met a girl who kept tattoos
For homes that she had loved
If I were her I'd paint my body
Until all my skin was gone
She wrote me a letter
As we passed through Rockford
She said she won't forget
And maybe I do, maybe I don't
But I know I haven't yet

So here I am
Here I am, whoa

Well I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog so I could see
The Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys

I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
And maybe I could live forever
If not ever I had known
That you'd be waiting there whenever
I am all alone

But here I am, whoa

Well I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog so I could see
The Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys

Well I woke up in a car
I traced away the fog so I could see
The Mississippi on her knees
I've never been so lost
I've never felt so much at home
Please write my folks and throw away my keys

I woke up in a car
I woke up in a car
I woke up in a carEmbed
