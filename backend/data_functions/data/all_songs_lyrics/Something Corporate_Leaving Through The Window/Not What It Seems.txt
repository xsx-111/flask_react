Not What It Seems Lyrics
A long day
If ever these questions were yours
What would you say?
You don't know
But I'm writing the answer on cheap
Paper napkins

And now he's turning off
And now she's shutting down

And it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is

And these fights
They climb through my veins like it's
Mercury rising
And these nights
I seem to remember a
Home that was better
And now he's turning off
And now she's shutting down

And it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is

And now he's turning off
His family's breaking down

And it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is
Just what you think it is
And it's not what it seems
Nothing's the same when you give it away
No, it's not what it seems
It's just what you think it is
Just what you think it is
It's just what you think it is
What you think it isEmbed
