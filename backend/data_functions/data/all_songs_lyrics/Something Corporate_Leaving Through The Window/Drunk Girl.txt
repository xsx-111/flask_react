Drunk Girl Lyrics
I kissed a drunk girl
I kissed a drunk girl, yes I did
Kissed a drunk girl on the lips
I let my guard down
How could I have been so dumb?
Her eyes were open

I know I am not the one
I know I am not the one
I know I am not the one

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself?
I kissed a drunk girl
And I'm sure I could have been anybody else

I went to her house
And everybody there was gone
Her little cousin
Just passed out on the lawn
We walked to my car
She mouthed, "Is everything okay?"
She leaned in slowly
So now I can say
I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself?
I kissed a drunk girl
And I'm sure I could have been anybody else
Anybody else

I pulled away
I didn't think it would be right
I said, "Let's save this for another night"
And she said, "No, no, no I know
That everything is gonna be just fine"
How could I do this when I want her to be all mine?

I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself?
I kissed a drunk girl
And I'm sure I could have been anybody else
Anybody else

I know you don't care about me
I'm sure when all is said and done
And I go home feeling lonely
You will have have had your fun
Do you even remember?
I kissed a drunk girl
Why do I do these things I do to myself?
I kissed a drunk girl
And I'm sure I could have been anybody else

Anybody else
Anybody else
I could have been
Anybody elseEmbed
