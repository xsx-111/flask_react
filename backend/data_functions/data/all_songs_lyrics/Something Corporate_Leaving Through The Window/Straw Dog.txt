Straw Dog Lyrics
Staring into the intersection
She thinks that she can fly, and she might
Holding on in a new direction
She's gonna try it tonight
The closer I get to feeling
The further that I'm feeling from alright
The more I step into the sun
The more I step out of the light

Jessica is covered in a blanket
On a sun-bathed porch
Thinking of weekends
She would party in the city
She doesn't have a flame
She'd prefer to burn out like a torch
If she gets nowhere in life
At least she knows she's pretty
She said

"Hey, now
The straw dog's out in the street
Hey now, there's chemicals in the clouds
Hey now, they're calling all the police
But they won't get to us anyhow"
The moon is shining now
And shadows are what's left of all the noise
Simple silhouettes and cutouts
As if we had the choice
He listens closely now
Swears that he can hear a voice
That's calling him
Saying

"Hey, now
The straw dog's out in the street
Hey now, there's chemicals in the clouds
Hey now, they're calling all the police
But they won't get to us anyhow"
No no no no no no

What does it take to be a superhero in my world?
Make no mistake that these villains always get the girl
We can escape and then we'd skate away from all of this
But no one ever does
And she's saying

Hey, now
The straw dog's out in the street
Hey now, there's chemicals in the clouds
Hey now, they're calling all the police
But they won't get to us
No, they'll never get to us
Hey now, the straw dog is out in the street
Hey now, there's chemicals in the clouds
And they're calling all the police
But they won't get to us
No I'll never let them get to you
No noEmbed
