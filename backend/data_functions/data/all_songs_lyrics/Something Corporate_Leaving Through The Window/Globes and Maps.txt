Globes and Maps Lyrics
Light breaks underneath a heavy door
And I try to keep myself awake
Fall all around us on our hotel floor
And you think that you've made a mistake
And there's a pain in my stomach
From another sleepless binge
And I struggle to get myself up again

I wanna hang on to something
That won't break away or fall apart
Like the pieces of my heart

And globes and maps are all around me now
I wanna feel you breathe me
Globes and maps I see surround you here
Why won't you believe me?
Globes and maps, they chart your way back home
Do you wanna leave or something?

And dreams came around you in a hazy rain
You open your mouth wide to feel them fall
And I write a letter from a one-way train
But I don't think you'll read it at all
And globes and maps are all around me now
I wanna feel you breathe me
Globes and maps I see surround you here
Why won't you believe me?
Globes and maps, they chart your way back home
Do you wanna leave or something?

And I can't take this anymore
Well I know that I can't take this anymore
I can't take this anymore
Cause I know someday I'll see you walk out that door

And globes and maps are all around me now
I wanna feel you breathe me
Globes and maps I see surround you here
Why won't you believe me?
Globes and maps, they chart your way back home
So do you wanna leave?
Do you wanna leave?
Globes and maps, they chart your way back home
Do you wanna leave or something?Embed
