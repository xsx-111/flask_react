If You C Jordan Lyrics
I have a story, a bitter anthem
For everyone to hear
About this kid who just don't like me
And that's a solid fact
They say he's hunting me, and as you see
I'm all swelled up with fear
'Cause I can't get him off my back

If you see Jordan (if you see Jordan)
He makes me sick (he makes me sick)
High school's over (high school's over)
And you still won't quit

You try to fight me down at Tyler's beach
And man I think that's great
You nearly cried and said to yell at you
Like I do at all the girls
And you drove home real quick
Did you make it in time to masturbate?
There's one too many of you in this world

If you see Jordan (if you see Jordan)
He makes me sick (he makes me sick)
High school's over (high school's over)
And you still won't quit
You say it's chivalry, but it's jealousy
That led us to this song
Won't play it often, just at least until you're gone
You'll stop at nothing but the real thing
And everything up to that's pretend
You tried to brainwash all my friends

If you see Jordan (if you see Jordan)
He makes me sick (he makes me sick)
High school's over (high school's over)
And you still won't quit

Fuck you, Jordan (fuck you, Jordan)
You make me sick (you make me sick)
High school's over (high school's over)
I don't care if you dye your hair
You'll always be a little, redhead bitchEmbed
