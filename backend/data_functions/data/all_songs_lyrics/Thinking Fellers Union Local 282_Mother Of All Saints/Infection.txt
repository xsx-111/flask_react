Infection LyricsSweat sweat sweat
Sweat sweat sweat
Sweat sweat sweat
Sweat
Infection sank the day
The time it finally called your name
Cold, tired and wet
Sometimes it pulled you from your bed
Sometimes it pulled you from your bed
And when its shadow crossed your head
That's when I saw you lose your grasp
And slip away from under my weight
I do know that I love you
Infection sank the day
The time it finally called your name
Cold, tired and wet
Sometimes it pulled you from your bed
And when its shadow crossed your head
That's when I saw you lose your grasp
And slip away from under my weight
I do know that I love you
I do know that I love you
I do know that I love you
I do know that I love you
I do know that I love you
I do know that I love youEmbed
