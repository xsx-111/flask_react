Pleasure Circle LyricsHa ha ha ha ha!!
We lied to you!
No one here likes you!
Ha ha ha!!
Now that we're acquainted with you, we're gonna-
I can't even name the things we're gonna do
Oohh! Come on in to the warmth
The warmth and glitter of our pleasure circle
Come on in to the warmth and glitter
The glamour of our pleasure circle
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Oohh! Come on in!Embed
