Catcher LyricsOn a wire that's easy and wide
The catcher enters, then the catcher leaves
To catch a catcher with half-closed eyes
Find something that fits, then pry
In my car at the shopping mall
There's some things I've got to see
I saw some aerobics and cancer
Tonight I will not dream
I saw a car so big and wide
It wouldn't fit down the street
The man who bought it couldn't fit inside
Tonight I will not dream
He's suspended in drinks tonight
He's suspended in dreams tonightEmbed
