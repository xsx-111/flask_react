Hive LyricsUnder cloudy skies
Hear some swarming, buzzing sound
Stumble up to hilltop shack
Through window stare at honey dripping down
Swirling gold and black
Million frenzied keepers of million cells of wax
Doorknob beckons
Feel pull of spiral spin
One bright glance through door
Passing out at chewing, sucking in
Sparkling blood and bone
Flesh and sinew vanishing and soul disowned
Spirit swirling now
See comrades all around
Black and gold above and below
Immersed in buzz and honey dripping down
Proudly armed with sting
One of million bearers of better way of livingEmbed
