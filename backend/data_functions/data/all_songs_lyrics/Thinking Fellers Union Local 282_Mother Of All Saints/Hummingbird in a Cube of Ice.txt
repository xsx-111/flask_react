Hummingbird in a Cube of Ice LyricsYou can fizz out the top
Or settle to the bottom
Or stand still
Inside a liquid life
You can float away
Or melt into the ground
But scientists can watch you
Through the glass
And measure forces pulling you
And measure forces pushing you
Until you stand still
And make the shadows stop
Vaporize, solidify
Hummingbird in a cube of iceEmbed
