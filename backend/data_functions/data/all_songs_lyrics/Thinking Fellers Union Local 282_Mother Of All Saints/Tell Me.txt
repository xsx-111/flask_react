Tell Me LyricsTell me a lie (I just want to be inside myself)
I won't mind (I don't want to talk to anybody else)
When the clouds cover the sky (I feel nothing; there's not a word to say)
I walk alone and remember why (leave me alone... go away)
The work it takes to uncover the truth
Is magnified by the need for the struggle
The work it takes to see things as they are is a lie
I see danger, trouble
Forget what we said before
The air is wet, hangs close to the street
Just walk – half awake
Just walk – half asleep
This is real
This is love, not lust
Picked it up burning hot, put it in my pocket
Started to rot, scrape off the mold
It shines in the light
Threw it away 'cause it didn't look right
Now I'm on all fours digging
Through the sand
Looking for the treasure
I once carried in my hand
Wait a minute
I forget what you said
Tell me, sing to me
About your holy fucking experience
Picked it up burning hot, put it in my pocket
Started to rot, scrape off the mold
It shines in the light
Threw it away 'cause it didn't look right
Now I'm on all fours digging
Through the sand
Looking for the treasure
I once carried in my handEmbed
