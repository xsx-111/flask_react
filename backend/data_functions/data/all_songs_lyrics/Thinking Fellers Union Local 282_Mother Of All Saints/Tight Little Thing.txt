Tight Little Thing LyricsI went shopping but I couldn't find a thing!
I was searching for a tight little thing to put on
I went shopping but I couldn't find a tight little thing to put on
Everything I found was way too loose
Everything I found was way too loose
All of it was very loose
Everything I found was very looseEmbed
