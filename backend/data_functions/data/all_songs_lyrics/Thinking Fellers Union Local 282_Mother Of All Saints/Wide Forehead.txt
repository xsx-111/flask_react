Wide Forehead LyricsWide forehead swells
At the gurgling of brains within
The curves and ridges tear
Flakes fill the air
And the bug-eyed embrace is ours
A nipple fills a stoma gill
Sandpaper face
Move your flappy limbs and flipper feet
Into a coarse caress
False corridor
2-D cloud tries to stop your heart
Your wide forehead blew it awayEmbed
