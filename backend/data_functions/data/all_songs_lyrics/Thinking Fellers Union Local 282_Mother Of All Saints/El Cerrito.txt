El Cerrito LyricsI found faith on the little hill
Please lead me over, over the little hill
Healthy and whole
Questions wait on the little hill
Please show me answers, over the little hill
Comfort my mind
Peace lies over the little hill
Peace in the valley, over the little hill
Peace in my heart
I found faith on the little hill
Please take us over, over the little hill
Mother and childEmbed
