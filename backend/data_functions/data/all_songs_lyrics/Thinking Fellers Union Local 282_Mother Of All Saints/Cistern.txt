Cistern LyricsWell-wishing ditch-digging hands
Dirt comes from staunch comedians
Spades, hoes turn over ground
Bedrock competes with thwarting clowns
"Well'll be dry"
Big mush muddy mess
Quicksand can beat you at your best
"Why so shy?"
Holding clowns
Fast underwater drowned
Still holding smiles
Inside the cistern, beaming
In sacrifice
Glub glub, ha ha
Laughing throats
Fail under surface, choke
Too deep to breatheEmbed
