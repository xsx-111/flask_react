Epilogue Lyrics
The son of the know thing flew into today
He left in a hurry -- had little to say;
But 'fore the barking subside in his wake
He helped out with vestiges sweeter than cake:

Opulent givings are seldom a dread
They help you relieve all the lies in your head
But, 'fore thy givings beget a sure vain
Leave open a window and let in some rainEmbed
