Never Known Questions Lyrics
The cloud continues
And the spot diminishes
Without even the hint
Of a glow is glowing
A continuous process
Or does the spot find its
Way out where it needs to be?
Way out where it needs to be?
Way out where it needs to be?
Way out where

Spot the rot, spot the rot, spot the rot we say
Spot the rot they tell the tot while feeding him some say
Spot the rot, oh spot the rot and then you'll be okay
Spot the rot, oh spot the rot but still you'd better pray
Spot the rot, oh spot the rot, spot the rot we say
Spot the rot they tell the tot while feeding him some say
Spot the rot, oh spot the rot and then you'll be okay
Spot the rot, oh spot the rot but still you'd better pray

W-when Edweena made me mushrooms
She ate the grate and ground the groom; no no no
My mother made me eat boysenberries
But my gracious sakes just ate me first
Calling cards and polling wards are just too many, see?
Oh, oh calling cards and winking bards are just a way to see
Calling cards and winking bards are just a way to be?
Falling guards and winking bards are just a need today
Falling guards and winking bards are just my needs, okay?
Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay?
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!

To be shown is
A question never
Even not known by many to exist
To show
Or to be shown
A question never
Never known about even by many to exist
To show
Or to be shown
A question never
Never known about even by many to exist
To show
Or to be shown
A question never
Never known about even by many to exist
Or to be shown
Is a question never
Never known not even by many to exist
To exist
To exist
Not even by many to existEmbed
