Edweena Lyrics

Coming onto column nation is a gracious thing
A stirring and a whirring and a broken widower's pain;
It's causing easy ought to just leave a lust alone
But when a friend has shrunken skin where do you throw the bone?
Do you throw the bone?
Do you throw the bone?
Do you throw the bone?
Do you throw the bone?

The matter that's been spoken to's a fragrant little thing
It's open and was known to need a token diamond ring
The matter that's been spoken to's a fragrant little thing
It's open and was known to need a token diamond ring
It's open and was known to need a token diamond ring
It's open and was known to need a token diamond ring

Investing space without a place;
Confusing grace with outer space
Alala la la la
Alala la la la
To please the breeze you freeze the seize
Combat disease and bend the knees;
And if explicit matters naught
Extend the grin -- but don't get caught
Now Uncle Remus, Uncle Remus
Where have you been we say
We saw the end of Uncle Mend
And turn into into today
But now they say there's room no more
For such a friendly friendly whore
But now they say there's room no more
For such a friendly whore

Yes, Easter Island isn't my land coming home once more

But a sentence existing inside of a rhyme
Is only just a token left spoken in time

Can tomorrow be more than the end of today?
Or do posies just bloom for the feel of a May?
Or do posies just bloom for the feel of a May?
Investing space without a place;
Confusing grace with outer space
Alala la la la
Alala la la la
The way is a never for severing two
Beginnings are endings for all but a few4Embed
