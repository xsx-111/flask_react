Mantaray LyricsYou're such a perfect swimmer
Like a mantaray
Flying over the rocks
And the spray
Strikes me how you still shimmer
In your own weary way
Sliding under the waves
Twisting on rays of the sun
It's your sun
It's your waves
It's your water
You're such a hazardous driver
Like a firefly
Getting lost in the woods
Rushing past me in a wild swirl
Like a tumbleweed
Oh and it makes me unsure
If ever you were in the room
Now it's my moon
It's my still
It's my paper stacks
Kick of your camouflage
Just one small glimpse of where you are
Show me you're not an apparition girl
Now I'm up on the hillside
In the shade of the vine
Where all the lost come to hide
With sore bended spines
Excavating for conclusions
In an arid ground
Under the stones and the roots
Nothing is there to be found
Now it's your sun
It's my moon
And it's our earthquake
Kick off your camouflage
Just one small glimpse of where you are
Show me I'm not an apparition girl2Embed
