Bewildered In The City LyricsAngelic friend, I watch you sparkle from afar
With spikes and dents
And a hundred thousand luminous arms
I wouldn't know how to find your exit doors
I wouldn't know how to stay and extract it all
You're the end of everything real
My longest lasting love
Meandering through your streets of maple shade oh
Caving in, deep beneath your ponderous blades
Your days are short
Your nights are smothered with exhaust
And framing lights
Burning up the homesick thoughts
In unison we vibrate and roar
Up somewhere on the forty third floor
An abundance of bewildering thoughts
It's you, it's you, it's you
You never listen or understand
Never to care if I'm here or there
I'm mole rushing blind through your nooks and veins
Curling up drunk in your vacant carpool lanes
It's you, it's you, it's you
You're the end of everything real
The silver cord to which I am reeled
In unison we vibrate and roar
My longest lasting loveEmbed
