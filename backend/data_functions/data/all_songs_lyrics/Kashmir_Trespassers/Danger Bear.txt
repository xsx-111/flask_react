Danger Bear LyricsTime is a fever
A crystal breeze
An iron flame
Time is a deceiver
You think you own
And it turns away
Fast oh so fast it burns
Like a comet that crashes our sphere
Last time we looked you were
Danger bear
Danger bear
Boy you're a freight train
That runs through the hordes
Of werewolfes and flakes
Your heart is for beating
Not the fiends
That stand in your way
Fast oh so they turn
Slipping like soap in your hand
Last time we looked you were
Spider-man
Spider-man
The vampire that hides
In the dim corner as you walk by
Will turn into cinder with one laser beam from your eye
So lean back tuck in and drift offEmbed
