Mouthful Of Wasps Lyrics
A list of things that should be said
Now weighs a forest on your tongue
And all your virtues safely kept
In vaseline have slipped bygone

Put it on the vast choir sings
Let the Broncos run wild again
Wipe it off that purgatory grin
Because it's all too convincing

Show me that it's easy
Say that you are in need of me
Don't talk of the costs
With a mouthful of wasps
Time is up so let them all fly
Up in the sky
Yes, I was taught among your kind
By drilling tunnels towards the core
In through the multi detailed mind
Where rich and simple is at war

Put it on the vast choir sings
Let the Broncos run wild again
Wipe it off that diabolic grin
'cause it's so contrived
And it frightens me
Show me that you're easy
Say that you believe in me
Don't act out your frost
With a mouthful of wasps
Time is up so them all fly
Up in the sky
Behind those weary eyes
Some broken story hides
I need to know
And you have to show
Before it strikes its roots and strangles everything1Embed
