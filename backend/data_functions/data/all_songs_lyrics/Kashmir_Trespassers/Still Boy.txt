Still Boy LyricsHiding out behind the birch
And frozen lakes
The view of things seems clearer here
And my mistakes
Don't fill out the capacious bags
That I dragged upstairs
Gives me time to grow a love
Where I had fear
How long will you wait
At the shady end of the slope?
Am I already late
With my pyramid-sized hopes?
Stillboy holds his breath
'til something appears
All dumb, all deaf, all turned over
To the wolves
Stepping out of everything
To nothingness
'cause at every tick of the clock
Our time weighs
A little less
How long will you wait
At the shady end of the slope?
Am I already late
With my pyramid-sized hopes?
Stillboy holds his breath
'til something appears
All dumb, all deaf, all turned over
Stillboy waves his hand
One time too many
All dumb, all deaf, all turned over
To the wolves
Like the chickens need the fox
And daylight longs for the dark
I excuse myself to go and make my
Mark
Stillboy holds his breath
'til something appears
All dumb, all deaf, all turned over
Stillboy waves his hand
One time too many
All dumb, all deaf, all turned over
To the wolvesEmbed
