Time Has Deserted Us LyricsThe coolest enemy
That I have ever seen
Is huming on impending war
He slouches on the couch
And tramples on the vow
Not to come here anymore
Some persistent nerve
That he has got preserved
When i am all dry ice to touch
An unaffected smile
To add up to his pile
Of insolence immaculate
Time has deserted us
So have our days
The author has written us
Out of his play
And without a sound
Ill gently vaporize
He is bringing drinks and talk
And chicken wings on fork
That dances in his master plan
And everything gets turned
Like nothings ever learned
The gates of hell unlock themselves
Now what else could it be
When you face your enemy
Still to soft shelled to withstand
This growing pressure balloon
Is meant to crack up soon
The silence to be infinite
Time has deserted us
So have our days
The author has written us
Out of his play
And without a sound
Ill slowly glide away
I am not saying where i am headed
Or where I will end
Surely would regret it
I am not precious but well spent
And without a sound
Ill quickly vaporize
Closed ends
Past tense
Dead friends
No offenseEmbed
