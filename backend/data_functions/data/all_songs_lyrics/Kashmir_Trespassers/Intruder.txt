Intruder LyricsTrees of autumn fire
Yellow, brown and red
Sinking in the mire
Bowing down their heads
Whispering that all things
Ceases to exist
Apple cores and smoke rings
Lovers in the mist
Remember what
You came in here for
That he had to go
Sooner than you'll know
You're an open door
To an empty store
Fill the shelves again
Fill them while you can
In comes the intruder
Our least expected guest
He tiptoes like a cougar
And finds us at our best
Struggling for protraction
Seasons in the sun
(one more season in the sun)
Begging for one last fraction
Of what we had begun
Remember what
You came in here for
That the bells will toll
Sooner than you know
You're an open door
To an empty store
Fill the shelves again
Fill them while you can
With a list in his mind
And a hole in his eye
And a hood on his head
And our time on his side
And a scythe in his hand
And a broad smiling face
And a hovering walk
And a bend on his back
He has come to collectEmbed
