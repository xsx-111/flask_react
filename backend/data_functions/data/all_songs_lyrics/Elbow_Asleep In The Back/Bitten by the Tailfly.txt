Bitten by the Tailfly LyricsYou're a girl in this vicinity
I'm a dog without a collar on
This cattle-market cabaret
Is the Sabbath every Saturday
I'm full of wit and chivalry
Until you've given in to me
I'm a dog without a collar on
You're a girl in this vicinity

Bitten by the tail-fly
Too many times to change
It's a silent taxi ride away
But it's everything to get you there
You'll know when you are bitten-shy
But still you will return my stare
From a crush of blushing brides-to-be
You barely have a blossom on
Your eyes betray your diaries
You're a girl in this vicinity

Bitten by the tail-fly
Too many times to change
I'll take you home
Get you on your ownEmbed
