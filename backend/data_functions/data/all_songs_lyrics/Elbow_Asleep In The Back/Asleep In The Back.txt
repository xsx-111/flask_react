Asleep In The Back LyricsWere you crushed?
Did I rush you?
All my time is yours
My twisted heart is yours
The faithless shit is yours
The shameless fits of love
That only smother you for moments
'Til I fold them up and leave
All yours

Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to know
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to know
Show your scars
Not to rush you
The hieroglyphic hints
In all the toilet scrawl
Guilty little pins
In all the things I never talk about
Are spilling with the gin
Taste how tough you are
All yours
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to know
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to ask, didn't you?
Oh you had to know
Not to rush youEmbed
