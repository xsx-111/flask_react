Presuming Ed (Rest Easy) LyricsMy brother, fear is only natural
You need to chill your fucking bones
Lay her down, drink this in
While you can
Whisper, rest easy
There's a belly full of life
Watch her, she's dreaming
Of a belly full of life
Right there on the pillow

This is why we are here
Rest easy
This is why we are here
Rest easy
You know that everything is finite
You know you too are not alone
Soothe her brow, drink her smile
Watch her dream
You'll feel Christ like
When it's breathing in and out
And you'll feel Christ like
When it's breathing in and out
Right there on the pillow
This is why we are here
Rest easyEmbed
