Powder Blue LyricsYour eyes are just like black spiders
Your hair and dress in ribbons
Babycakes
In despair or incoherent, nothing in between
China white, my bride tonight
Smiling on the tiles

Bring that minute back
We never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
I share it all with you
Powder blue, oh
Stumble through the crowds together
They're trying to ignore us
That's okay
I'm proud to be the one you hold when the shakes begin
Sallow-skinned, starry-eyed
Blessed in our sin

Bring that minute back
We never get so close to death, makes you so alive
I share it all with you
Powder blue, oh
Yeah, yeah
Hey, yeah
Hey, yeah

Bring that minute back
We'll never get so close as when the sunward flight begins
I share it all with you
Powder blue, ohEmbed
