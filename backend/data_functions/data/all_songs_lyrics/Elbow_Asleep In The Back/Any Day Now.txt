Any Day Now LyricsWhat's got into me?
Can't believe myself
Must be someone else
Must be someone else
Must be

Any day now
Hows about
Getting out of this place
Any ways
We got a lot of spare time
Some of my youth
And all of my senses on overdrive
What's got into me?
Can't believe myself
Must be

Don't play Coltrane
You will sleep at the wheel
Eyes on horizon
Don't sleep at the wheelEmbed
