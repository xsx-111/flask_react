Tomorrow One LyricsWouldn't you say it's over by now?
Wouldn't you say it's over?
Tomorrow makes tomorrow one
Today I learned to feed myself
To choose the words, to choose the wait
To break the hands of someone else
Wouldn't you say it's over by now?
Wouldn't you say it's over?
Wouldn't you say it's over by now?
Wouldn't you say it's over?Embed
