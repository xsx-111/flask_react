Standby LyricsYou'll take it back
Glory and failure
You'll take it back
Pure and unpunctured
Standby
Standby
Standby
You'll take it back
You'll bring home the frame
You'll take it back
And weed through the black
Standby
Standby
Standby
Take back
Take back
Take back
Take back
Take back
Take backEmbed
