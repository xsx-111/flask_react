Over the Ocean LyricsI'm over the ocean
I'm over the ocean
Over the hills, over the dell
Over the fireline
Over the sand, over the plan
Over the empire
And if I belong
Then Iâ€™ll be longer than expected
And if I'm wrong
The mighty and strong will be rejected
I'm over the ocean
I'm over the ocean
But I'm over the ocean
I'm over the oceanEmbed
