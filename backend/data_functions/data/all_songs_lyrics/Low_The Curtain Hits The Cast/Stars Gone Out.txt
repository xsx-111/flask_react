Stars Gone Out LyricsIt's for certain
I never thought I'd last
Never thought the sea would try
It's for certain
You can tie me to the mast
Goodbye to all the land and lies
And when all the stars have gone out
They won't fall, you can hear them crying
And when all the stars have gone out
They're not gone, you can hear them dying
And it say it's enoughEmbed
