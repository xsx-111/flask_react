Marlon J.D. Lyrics
He stood like a statue
As he was beaten across the face
With a horse whip
Where the wounds already exist
A well-oiled rifle
And never lonely, Marlon JD
If you want to come down, come down
Give him some dignity

So say, so say Marlon JD
So say, so say Marlon JD

Learn to live without clutter
To live without luxury
Sometimes I envy them
Goodnight yourself, Marlon JD
He did not defend himself
He didn't even raise his hand
I will not beg because
This is how I am

So say, so say Marlon JD
So say, so say Marlon JD
"Bare floors, plain white walls
No window curtains, nothing but essentials
With no luxuries, no ornamentation
Utter simplicity
But it's also clean
It's clean as a rifle."

So say, so say Marlon JD
So say, so say Marlon JD

"And, and they're never lonely
And sometimes I envy them"Embed
