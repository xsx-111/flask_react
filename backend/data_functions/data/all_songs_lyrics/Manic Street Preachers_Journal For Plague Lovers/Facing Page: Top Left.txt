Facing Page: Top Left Lyrics
Here I am, rise and shine
Weighed down, of course I smile
Here is hospitality skin care tones
Clean sharp fashion lines tinted UV protection

This beauty here dipping neophobia
This beauty here dipping neophobia
This beauty here dipping neophobia

Here I am rise and shine
Weighed down, of course I cry
Here is oblivion bathed acid red
Mute oily discolor, skin cancer, calories

Private care, sugar pills, the flak of healing
Fragrance my escort of no meaning
This beauty here dipping neophobia
Private care, sugar pills, the flak of healing
Fragrance my escort of no meaning
This beauty here dipping neophobiaEmbed
