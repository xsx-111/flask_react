She Bathed Herself  in a Bath of Bleach Lyrics
She'd walk on broken glass for love
She thought burnt skin would please her lover
To keep love alive and lust beside
Kind people should never be treated like (flies)

Empty arms and an aching heart
The love she sought through faltering thought
Table for two, such a sweet delight
Whispers "I love you my darling tonight"

Love bathed her in a bath of bleach
Brush her hair, no one else will
Don't hurt her anymore, stop now
But salmon pink skinned Mary still caring

Empty arms and an aching heart
The love she sought through faltering thought
Table for two, such a sweet delight
Whispers "I love you my darling tonight"
Empty arms and an aching heart
The love she sought through faltering thought
Table for two, such a sweet delight
Whispers "I love you my darling tonight"Embed
