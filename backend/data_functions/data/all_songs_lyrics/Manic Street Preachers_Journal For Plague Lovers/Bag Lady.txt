Bag Lady Lyrics
I am not dead
I demand
I know my rights
I know my rights
You cover illness with flowers
And flowers die
And flowers die

Walk in half view
Of all mirrors
It makes sense to me
Makes sense to me
Never let yourself out, I did
It ruined me
It ruined me

To be morally good
Only rather to love
A devil pretending to be a god
Laws written on paper, and paper burns
Eternity is not sunrise

Walk in half view
Of all mirrors
It makes sense to me
Makes sense to me
Never let yourself out, I did
It ruined me
It ruined me
To be morally good
Only rather to love
A devil pretending to be a god
Laws written on paper, and paper burns
Eternity is not sunrise


To be morally good
Only rather to love
A devil pretending to be a god
Laws written on paper, and paper burns
Eternity is not sunriseEmbed
