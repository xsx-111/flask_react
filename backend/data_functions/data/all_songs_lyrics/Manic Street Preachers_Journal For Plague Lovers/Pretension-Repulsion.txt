Pretension/Repulsion Lyrics
Sickened and howled, streaked and spurned
Plucked, lived, compelled and called
Closed and swallowed, formed and regained
Locked, cursed, glowed and discerned

Shards, oh shards, the androgyny fails
Odalisque by Ingres, extra bones for sale
Born.a.graphic versus porn.a.graphic
Born.a.graphic

Explored, enclosed, amazed and perturbed
Assumed, annoyed and ceased
Burdened and gathered, agonized and locked
Mixed, seared and received

Shards, oh shards, the androgyny fails
Odalisque by Ingres, extra bones for sale
Born.a.graphic versus porn.a.graphic
Born.a.graphic
Shards, oh shards, the androgyny fails
Odalisque by Ingres, extra bones for sale
Born.a.graphic versus porn.a.graphic
