Doors Closing Slowly Lyrics
Realize how lonely this is?
Self-defeating, oh, fuck, yeah
Drowned in love and false kisses
A gathering of no meaning

That shadow is a cross okay
Judgement must be willing today
Silence is not sacrifice
Crucifixion is the easy life

Who threw the first stone?
If the stone is you
Forgive them forsaken
Bleeding feet an angel's saviour

That shadow is a cross okay
Judgement must be willing today
Silence is not sacrifice
Crucifixion is the easy life

Embrace to betrayal
Unarmed army salvation
Listen to the selfish ones
They are the voice of accomplishmentEmbed
