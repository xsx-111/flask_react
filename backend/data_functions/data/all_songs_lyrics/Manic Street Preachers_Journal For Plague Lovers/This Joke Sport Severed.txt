This Joke Sport Severed Lyrics
Loose and guilty and whipped
Sterility persecutes and I have plenty
Bruised and nailed and quit
Merciful and mourned and meek
Jealousy sows rejection with a kiss
In silken palms that tear bone from skin

This joke sport severed
I endeavored
To find a place where
I became untethered

Jealousy sows rejection with a kiss
In silken palms that tear bone from skin
