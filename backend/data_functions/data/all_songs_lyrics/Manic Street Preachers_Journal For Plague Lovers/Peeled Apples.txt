Peeled Apples Lyrics
You know so little about me. What if I turn into a werewolf or something?
The more I see, the less I scream
The figure eight inside out is infinity
The naked light bulb is always wrong
They make your brain complete, then they blow it to kingdom come

Riderless horses, Noam Chomsky's Camelot
Bruises on my hands from digging my nails out
A series of images against you and me
Trespass your torments if you are what you want to be
I once impersonated a shopwork dummy
The Levi jean will always be stronger than the Uzi
A dwarf takes his cockerel out of the cockfight
Falcons attack the pigeons in the West Wing at night
