Jackie Collins Existential Question Time Lyrics
Tonight we beg, tonight we beg the question
If a married man, a married man fucks a Catholic
And his wife dies without knowing
Does that make him unfaithful, people?

Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?
Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?
Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?
Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?

Tonight we beg, tonight we beg the question
If a married man, a married man fucks a Catholic
Does that mean you have gone to seed?
Or does that mean you owe him nothing?

Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?
Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?
Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?
Oh mummy what's a Sex Pistol?

A situationist sisterhood of Jackie and Joan
Separates us the questions without a home
A situationist sisterhood of Jackie and Joan
Separates us the questions without a home2Embed
