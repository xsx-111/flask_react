Virginia State Epileptic Colony Lyrics
They sit around tables rendered dumb
Coloured sticks of chalk are passed around
Today the doctors allow the illusion of choice
Tomorrow the necks split, there is no voice

Piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking and flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation

Draw a perfect circle, sleep foetus-like
Six chalk colours, the very meaning of life
They wake to strobes and half circled light
Confusion lifts with potassium percolate

Piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation
Pig pig piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberation
Pig pig piggy
V.S.E.C
Cleaning cooking flower arranging
Dissolves a kind of liberationEmbed
