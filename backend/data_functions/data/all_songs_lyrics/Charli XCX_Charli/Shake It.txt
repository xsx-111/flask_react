Shake It Lyrics
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh

I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I sh-
Work it
Oh, it's a migraine, make them pupils dilate
Wanna watch it gyrate, ass is on a tirade
Make you pop a Tylenol, split your head and call it off
Got you drinking water when you should be drinking alcohol
Faster than an Adderall, make you shake your Audemars
Shake it, shake it, shake it, make you spray it like an aerosol
(Shake it like a dog)
I don't shake it like that, mm
(Shake it like a salt shaker)
I don't shake it like that, uh
(Shake it like a dog)
I don't shake it like that, mm
(Shake it like a salt shaker)
I don't shake it like that
I don't shake it like anything, I shake it like myself
All this pussy on a pedestal, I put it on a shelf
I-I-I don't shake it like anything, I shake it like myself
'Cause ain't no pussy shakin' like when Freedia lose her belt (Come on)

Ooh, ah, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
(I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh)
Ooh, ah, shake it, baby, baby, baby
(I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh)
Ooh, ah, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
(I shake it, I shake it all on you)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, baby, baby, baby
(I shake it, I sh-)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
(Miss CupcakKe on this track in three, two, one, do it)
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it

I shake it like Jamaican
No birthday, but I'm cakin'
I shake it like I'm tryna get the oil off of the bacon
If I need wakin', I'ma alarm that shakin'
This ass 'bout to move like I need the house vacant
It move, move, move, and you know it won't stop
It shakin' like I'm pulled over by a white cop
It shakin' like a virgin, 'bout to give up the box
Told 'em this ass a miracle, like my name Watts
I be purgin' shit, never nervous, bitch
I get on top of that dick, shake it like turbulence
You haven't heard from 'em since, I'm a different expense
And now this pussy need Staples like I'm fuckin' on Vince
Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle
I'ma fight my own battles, shake it harder than a rattle
He get in it, then he tackle, wanna bite it like a apple
And this pussy so juicy, when I cum it's made of Snapple, ayy
Brooke muthafuckin' Candy, Charli XCX
Miss CupcakKe is on this muthafuckin' track, oh

Tell me what you want, tell me what you want, daddy
Little bit of sugar, little bit of Brooke Candy
Cocaine-colored sheets where my ass bouncin' (Bounce)
'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City
Double Ds, all-natural big titties
Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator
Ass first-class, fast like Concorde
Damn, my ass so insane
Put me in a straightjacket, still you ain't safe
You can't handle all the jelly, put it on a plate
I'm 'bout to shake and leave you shook, like Beyoncé

(Shake it, I shake it, I sh- I shake it)
(I shake it, I sha- I shake it)
Oh darling, you say you don't know me?
(I sh- I shake it- I shake it)
Please, haha
(I sh- I shake it)
(Pabllo Vittar)

Pra começar direito eu soletro pra você
Rainha se escreve com dois L e dois T
Como estagiário no trabalho, eu tô sem tempo
Se tenho um problema eu resolvo com talento
Dedinho na boca, sou uma tentação
A pista pega fogo derretendo o paredão
Já mostrei que eu sou queen, falo sério pra vocês
A coroa é pesada, mas eu me acostumei
I shake it, I shake it, o meu popozão
I shake it, I shake it, aguentar essa pressão
Do MA, cheguei em LA
É a Pabllo e a Charli mais uma vez

I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it all on you (XCX)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (Mais uma vez, haha)
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh
I shake it, I shake it, I shake it, ooh (I love you, Charli, baby)
I shake it, I shake it all on you
I shake it, I shake21Embed
