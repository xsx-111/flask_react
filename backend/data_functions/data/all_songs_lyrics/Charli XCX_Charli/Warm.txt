Warm Lyrics
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason (No, no)
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

Tell me the reason (Yeah)
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

Tell me what you want
'Cause I know that you're lonely on your own
We're out in L.A. for a month
I don't think I can hide my emotions no, no more (Uh-huh)
A late night, say you want me, say you're selfish
Think about my body, then two-time
Say you want her? Do you want her?
Doesn't do it like me, no
So hot, burn the place down
Give you what you need
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
You gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
(Why we can't fall in love)

Why, why, why?
Don't you lie, what do you want?
Fall in love, ah, risk it all

Make me wanna fall in love
Baby, make mistakes
Hit me with a champagne kiss
And now I'm not thinkin' straight
Look at the skyline high
I look up, I wish I saw your face
I wanna fall in love
Jump in the deep end
'Cause deep down, you're d-dying
Tell me you're kinda nervous
Tell me you feel the same
I wish it was more than surface
I wish I could feel nothing
Come give me everything
Burn down and go again
So you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love
You gotta tell me the reason
Why you won't open up
Know I'ma send you to heaven
Tequila on your tongue
And you gotta tell me the reason
Why we can't fall in love

Ooh, baby
Why, why, why
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Know you lie, what do you want
Tell me, tell me, tell me the reason
Fall in love, ah, risk it all, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason, oh yeah
You gotta tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason
Tell me the reason11Embed
