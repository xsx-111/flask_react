Cross You Out Lyrics
Built a world all in my mind
All on my own, will I survive? Oh

Century of tears
Sadness was my only smile, yeah
So I fall apart
But you're gone and I'm doing fine
I'm screaming out

Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out

Melt me down one piece at a time
I seal these eyes wide shut
I wasn't mesmerized, no
Century of tears
Sadness was another denial, yeah
Thought I'd fall apart
But now you're gone, I'm doing fine
I'm screaming out

Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out

I've become someone better
I've become someone better
Yeah, yeah
Now I look in the mirror
And I love myself better
Yeah, yeah
I've become someone better
I've become someone better
Yeah, yeah
Now I look in the mirror
Feels so good to forget ya
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out
Ooh, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
When you're not around, when you're not around, ooh
When you're not around, when you're not around
I'll finally cross you out15Embed
