Gone Lyrics
I have to go, I'm so sorry, but it feels so cold in here
I am just now realizing they don't care
I try real hard, but I'm caught up by my insecurities
Pour me one more, watch the ice melt in my fist

I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, yeah

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love?

I would lay down (Lay down)
But they staring, their eyes like two shining stones
I see myself (Myself), and I look scared and confused
Wait, did they just talk? Why is it too loud? (Is it loud?)
Do they wish to run through me? (Me)
Am I a smoke? Am I the sun? And who decides? (Oh)
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me feel lately
They making me weird, baby, lately
I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people
How they making me loathe
They making me loathe, oh, mmm (Yeah)

Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby (Baby)
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby

(Cruels endroits)
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là, baby
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Ne me cherche pas, je ne suis plus là (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Why do we? Ah
Keep, keep, k-keep the water running
Keep, k-keep, k-keep, k-keep the water run
Keep, k-keep, k-keep the
Keep, keep the, keep
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Keep
Why do we keep when the water runs?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we love if we're so mistaken?
Keep, keep, keep
Why do we leave when the chase is done?
Don't search me in here, I'm already gone, baby34Embed
