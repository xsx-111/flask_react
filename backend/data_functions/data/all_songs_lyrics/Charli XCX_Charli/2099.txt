2099 Lyrics
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future

Woo, kill it, I'm so deadly, deadly
Ooh, I'm zooming like a jet ski, zoom zoom
Little dose of napalm, blow it up, yeah
Don't care what she talk about, nah
All she wanna do is my style, yeah
No one on my level
I play nice 'cause I'm too clever
I won't show it, never, never, but it's crystal (Woo)
I'm way up, way better
She might pop, but it's whatever
She might sell, but what's she selling?
Does she last long?
I know they write about me (Yeah)
I know that they all see me (Yeah)
Too scared so they don't play me
Some people tried to save me
Ooh, but I'm feeling so good
Better than I ever could
Had bad people in my business, gone now
Cage, prison, now it's gone away
They wanna listen what I say
Think I care about the fame?
Na-na-na-na

I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Fast like a Nascar, never touch us
Got visions, levels, they don't get me
Quiet, no discussions, please hush
I pull up, roll up, fuck up
Don't make decisions for me, you don't know nothin'
I'm Pluto, Neptune, pull up, roll up, future, future, ah38Embed
