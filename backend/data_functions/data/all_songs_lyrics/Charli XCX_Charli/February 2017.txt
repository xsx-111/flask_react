February 2017 Lyrics
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah

Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call
I only know what's good once I have lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Lost it all, lost it all, lost it all
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I’ve done
(Things I've done, things I’ve done)
Hope you can forgive the things I've done
(Things I've done, things I've done)
Reply, reply, give me a sign
Yeah

소-소-소심했던 나의
그 한 마디
미안하다고
사과하고 싶어도
너무 늦은 걸까?26Embed
