Click Lyrics
Get what I want like "click"
They want a pic like "click"
Cheers with the glass like "click"
Cash register goes "click"
You can't fuck with my clique (Clique)
Strut my stuff on the strip
Prospects all in the whip
Pull up and vroom, oh shit
Charli's up in this bitch
Charli's up in this sitch
Get what I want like "click"
They want a pic like "click"
Cheers with the glass like "click"
Cash register goes "click"
You can't fuck with my clique (Clique)
Strut my stuff on the strip
Prospects all in the whip
Pull up and vroom, oh shit
Charli's up in this bitch
Yeah, Charli's up in this

Pull up and we drippin' in gold
The king of my clique when I roll
Hit Kim 'cause she cute on my phone
Hit Tommy, he know how to ball
We fly off first class to Moscow
I'm zoomin' my way 'round the globe (Zoom)
Don't care 'bout the records you sold
Cosign if you did it alone (Yeah)
I'm so 20/20 with my vision
20/20 with precision, I'm so legit
I'm so 2020, when I wanna go pop
I'll pop, I got them hits
Pick the research, get the camera
Click it on, baby, come on, watch me dip
Watch me dip with my clique, ooh-ooh
Watch me dip with my, yeah
Get what I want like "click"
They want a pic like "click"
Cheers with the glass like "click"
Cash register goes "click"
You can't fuck with my clique
Strut my stuff on the strip
Prospects all in the whip
Pull up and vroom, oh shit
Charli's up in this bitch
Charli's up in this si—

Woo-ah
Bunch of bad bitches in my clique, we on a roll, yeah
Kim Possible up in this bitch, now watch me go off
Bust it down, down, down, look at my wrist, I'm such a show off
Designer everything, Versace, Louis, Goyard
First they want a check, first they send the Wraith
Lookin' like a safe, diamonds in your face
Skinny in the waist, make him eat the cake
Charli with me, babe, Charli with me, babe
Rock like full of bass, you get to LA
Cookie super sweet, put it on a tray
Got an appetite, come and clean the plate
You heard what I say, you heard what I say, yeah
I'm next level, so legit with all my clique, clique, clique, yeah
Yeah, all you bitches fuckin' wish you had this clique, yeah
I get what I want like "click"
They want a pic like "click"
Cheers with the glass like "click"
Cash register goes "click"
You can't fuck with my clique
Strut my stuff on the strip
Prospects all in the whip
Pull up and vroom, oh shit
Charli's up in this bitch (Oh)
Kim is up in this bitch

I'm hard like Sudoku (Sudoku), expensive like Coco (Oh)
If no pay, I won't go (Won't go), don't fuck with a broke ho (Oh)
Tommy goin' loco (Loco, yeah), look at the Chopard (Ching-ching)
Babushka do go-go (Yeah), solo, I GoPro (Du-du-du-du)
Macintosh and Big Mac, duck
No cockblock around this block
Please don't, doors unlocked like I don't really give a fuck
Flip the check, jump out dat-dat
For my clique, let me hashtag (Хэштег)
We get lit, but we never need a lot
Don't like fake class

Mmm (Charli)
Mmm, oh, mmm (It's Charli)
Get what I want like "click"
They want a pic like "click"
Cheers with the glass like "click"
Cash register goes "click"
You can't fuck with my clique
Strut my stuff on the strip
Prospects all in the whip
Pull up and vroom, oh shit
Charli's up in this bitch
Charli's up in this19Embed
