I Lost My Mind ( DJ ) LyricsI had lost my mind
I lost my head for a while
I was off my rocker outta line, outta whack
See I had this tiny crack in my head
That slowly split open and my brains oozed out
Lying on the sidewalk and I didn't even know it
I had lost my mind
I had lost my mind
I was sitting in the basement when I first realized it was gone
Hopped in my van, ran right over to the lost and found
Said "Pardon me but I seem to have lost my mind"
She said "Well, can you identify it please?"
I said "Why sure, it's a cute little bugger
About yea big, a little warped from the rain"
She said "Well then sir this must be your brain"
I said "Thank you ma'am I'm always losing that damn thing"
I had lost my mind
I had lost my mind
I had lost my mind
I had lost my mindEmbed
