(S)HE SAID / (S)HE SAID Lyrics“I need to eat something today"
He said, talking to himself again
"My body’s demands deserve respect"
He said, but not believing that was true
Only at peace putting something
Into the greedy little baby mouth
"Tonight I got to spit it out"
He said, starting to get sick again
“I need to buy something today"
He said, walking by a magazine
"She’s looking at me like she likes me"
He thought, knowing she was getting paid
"This ever gaping emptiness
I got to throw something into it now
And it could be almost anything"
He said, reaching in his pocket again
“Oh, man!
Ain’t it crazy how I depend on these presidents?
Well I must admit impediments
With everything they represent
And I would get a gun to greet the government
But then again
I’d need to buy something"
He said
I need to buy something
I need to eat something
I need to burn something
And I need to fuck someone
“I need to fuck someone tonight"
He said, from the corner of the room
"She’d possibly like what I can do"
He thought, tightening his underpants
"This nameless ache that never sleeps
I’ll put it somewhere it won’t bother me
Maybe inside somebody else"
He said, getting an erection
Hey, girl
Why don’t you show me how wise you are to the ways of the world?
Cause I never had what you call a heart
I only had a hell of a hole
But it sure beats serving a soul
Now, tell me -
Do you want to fuck someone?
He said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
You didn’t understand a single thing he said
“What am I thinking doing this?"
He said, her already fast asleep
"Wanting so much for her to understand"
He said, knowing she would be afraid
"What was it that hurt you?” he said
“What was it that hurt you?” he said
“What was it that hurt you?” he said
“What was it that hurt you?” he said
“Was it something?” he said
“Cause I got something inside me
I know I got something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
And I need to beat something"
He said, talking to himself again
“I’ve always had something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
And I need to beat something"
He said, talking to himself again
"I’ve always had something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
I’ve always had something inside me
And I need to beat something
And it could be anything
As long as I get to win
I don’t know what it is
But it’s something
And I need to beat something"
He said
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again
Talking to himself again1Embed
