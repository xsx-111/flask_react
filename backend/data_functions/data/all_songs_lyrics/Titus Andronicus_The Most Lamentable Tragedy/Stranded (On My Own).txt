Stranded (On My Own) Lyrics"Let's rock."
Crazy heart, where have you gone?
I thought that you and me were really getting along!
Left alone to dread the dawn
Like some kind of science experiment gone wrong
I could've made history, now I've been made history
And who knew that victory could be so slippery?
Cover the thick bloodstains
On your sick young brain
Just take your Ritalins
Then you can play the old hits again

You explained the Abyss away
And I can't listen when you say you're not missing me
You kissed me in the blistering heat, oh yeah, yeah!
Right there on the street with tears on my glistening cheek
Now no one listens to me, they tell me that I'm twisted and weak
I see that I was picked to be the picture in the dictionary

Look up "Addicted," that's me
Then look up "Wicked disease"
Then look up "Sick of police"
Then look up "Victim" closely, ooh yeah

I meet the mystery beast, the same one my sister receives
He comes to bludgeon and beat, demands me on both knees
He will not admit defeat and when he pricks, I'm going to bleed
And I can raise fists or flee, soon shouting, "No, mister, please!"

He destroys the diseases
As though Jesus could see us
High up in a cathedral
Where an evil heart freezes
And even the devil would start to believe it
When the man without equal, from the pulpit, preaches
You gotta believe he can show you the secrets
"That's what a priest is, Mama"

He comes to obliterate all of my mischievous ways
And leaves me a useless disgrace, silent through limitless rage
Violently neutered and caged, stuffed with subliminal hate
I'm nothing but a puppet at play, crying in a beautiful place

Another brutal display
On an invisible face
In a legal-ish space
It's the usual way within a week of Wednesday
Crazy heart, where have you gone?
I thought that you and me...
I thought that you and me...
I thought that you and me were really getting along"All right."5Embed
