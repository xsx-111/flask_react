No Future Part V: In Endless Dreaming Lyrics
Yes it was me that was beneath the sheet
That made your every dream a screaming scene
Now that which you can see
You best believe
And say conclusively
"Yeah, the beast was me."
And then our tragedy will be finally complete
But expect no apologies
I just been done down in this dungeon so long
Only remember I did something wrong
But the name of the crime
It's been long gone
I just lost track of time
And they were so strong
And yes, you got me wrong
If you thought I was down here alone

No, I got this family, they're bigger and meaner than me
And they got greener eyes
And larger needs
Yes, I protected you
But now you and me are through
You face them on your own
And then we'll see how good you do
When you're beaten black and blue
Covered all in massive bruises
Then you'll know the dude you knew
Wasn't Jesus
He was Judas
When it's you stretching the noose
When it's you up on the crucifix affixed for all to view
Then you'll know who's truly ruthless
Then you'll know the master rules
And a student's just a student
A stupid student
Do you remember that thing we talked about?
You said it haunts you nearly every hour
Yeah, well I heard about
A way out
And all you really do
Is open your mouth
That'll show that doctor crew
Just what that medicine do
And when they grieve for you
They gotta see the proof
That indeed you were me and I was you
Then we, you never can divide in two
And when they're killing me
They're killing you
Yeah, they're killing you, killing you, killing you...
You...
Yr at peace when you sleep
Why not an endless dream
Yr at peace when you sleep
Why not an endless dreaming
Yr at peace when you sleep
Enter the endless dream with me
Yr at peace when you sleep
Enter the endless dream
And it will be you and me
Beneath the leaves1Embed
