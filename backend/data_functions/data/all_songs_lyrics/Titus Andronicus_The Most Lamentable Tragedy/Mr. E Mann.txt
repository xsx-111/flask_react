Mr. E Mann LyricsI met a mystery man on a magic morning
Things were exciting that used to be boring
Things that were frightening now seemed inviting
And what used to be obscene now seemed the right thing
I had a crazy idea at just around 6:30
Things were so clear that had been murky
Things were so clean that had been dirty
And what used to be a dream now seemed a certainty
I was crying as I tried to get high
I've been dying all the time to get by
And along came a guy who said "Looking on the bright side's alright
It's alright
It's alright"
I got the strangest sensation when he looked in my direction
And my mind started racing when he offered me protection
And then I knew that my patience was rewarded
Hadn't known I had been waiting for it
And what used to be a waste became important
I was afraid of what the doctor might say
That I'd be made to learn to pray the right way
But then I saw a brave face say "Being afraid's okay
It's okay"
And it was so great to come under his glittering gaze
He wipes the winter away
See the brave face make all the races wanna say
"Looking on the bright side's alright
Looking on the bright side's alright
Looking on the bright side's alright
Looking on the bright side's alright
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
It's alright (It's alright)
Alright!"Embed
