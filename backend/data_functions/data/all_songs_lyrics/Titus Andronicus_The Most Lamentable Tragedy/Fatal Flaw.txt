Fatal Flaw LyricsEric!

She's looking after me
She doesn't know the kind of things I could do if I lose control
I'm letting out the beast
He's free, unleashed
Will she freak when she sees my capabilities?

Waiting at the drugstore, oh yeah
Waiting on the drug dealer all day
Waiting on some drug deal all the time
Waiting on a drugstore line
I got what I came to find

Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
It's the best thing you never saw
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

Hey! I've always been this way, and I ain't proud
But I might go insane if I can't say it out loud
Don't want her feeling sad from what she heard me say
Not even on my worst of my birthdays

Blame it on the drugs, yeah, oh yeah
I'm paying off the drug dealer always
Made it to the drug deal right on time
Now I'm waiting on one more line
I got what I came to find

Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
Let me show you my fatal flaw
It's the best thing you never saw
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Flaw
My fatal flaw
My fatal flaw
My fatal flaw
My fatal flaw
