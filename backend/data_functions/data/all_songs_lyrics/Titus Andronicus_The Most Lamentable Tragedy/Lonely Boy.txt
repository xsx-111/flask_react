Lonely Boy LyricsI ain’t gonna leave the building
Just lie here and stare at the ceiling
There’s nothing out there that can give me no healing
And right now I’m the only one that can hurt my feelings
I’m staying inside today
I’m hiding away
Oh yeah!
Let me tell you how it goes here in the big city
There ain’t no mercy and there ain’t no pity
And everywhere you turn there are hundreds of humans
All opening the door saying “Hello, Newman”
And hearing people hearing themselves talk
I tell you those are fingernails where there should've been chalk
I heard this one guy tell this other one to suck his cock
And he was the richest, smartest guy on the block
Oh, I, leave me alone
I, leave me alone
Oh no no no no no
‘Cause I just want to be alone
So don’t call me on the telephone
Why in the world would I pay T-Mobile
When every day’s the same, feeling antisocial
I’m minding my own business like I’m supposed to
So when I get home no one's coming over
Shot down dead red rover, red rover, yeah!
People try to confuse me
And people try to abuse me
And people try to frustrate me
And people try to castrate me
Uh-huh and people messing with my mental health
I tell you they just do it cause they hate themselves
And I've been walking around I'm try'na love myself
And I don't wanna talk to anyone else
You know, I, leave me alone
I, leave me alone
Leave me alone
I just want to be alone
I don't wanna drown amongst the droves of drones
I don't wanna hear that I'm what I own, oh no
I don't wanna feel my Y-chromosome
So don't look at me like I ain't full grown or
Welcome to the terror dome
Welcome to Hell
Welcome home
Lonely Boy coming down the street, better get out the way
The first person that he meets is probably going to pay
I'd say definitely
He woke up feeling like a loser, now he's itching to win
Yeah he did it yesterday, now he's gonna do it again
Hey - stay away
He hates to be awake
Stay away, he doesn't wanna hurt you
Stay away, he doesn't wanna hurt you
A lonely boy is an angry boy
A lonely boy is an angry boy2Embed
