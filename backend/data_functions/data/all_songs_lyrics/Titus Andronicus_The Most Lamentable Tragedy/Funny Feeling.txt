Funny Feeling LyricsI can control something inside of me
I can control something inside of me
I can control something inside of me
I can control something inside of me
I've always had something inside of me
And it's always been kind of a mystery
Like a child that screams for his wildest dream
It's the font of all madness and misery
But it's the thing that you like when yr kissing me
And it's the thing that you miss when yr missing me
It's the mist that exists when I'm glistening
I got the only thing that's ever made history
Inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
I've always had something inside of me
I've always had something inside of me
I've always had something inside of me
I've always had something inside of me
I've got something inside of me, inside of me
Something sweet inside of me, inside of me
Some disease inside of me, inside of me
Inside of me me me me me me me
There ain't nothing cheap inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of me
Something inside of meEmbed
