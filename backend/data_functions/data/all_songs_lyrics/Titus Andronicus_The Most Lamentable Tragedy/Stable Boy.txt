Stable Boy LyricsThe horses ain't heard of forever
They spend their lives running but not running to flee
So don't tell a crazy horse he can't run forever
He'll stay the course, whatever the weather
With amazing force through the green grass and heather
He'll be running free
The wonderful feeling of pleasure
Wheeeee!
Now I know why I was born to die
I've been informed of forever
Now I know why I was born to die
I've been informed of forever
The cats haven't heard of forever
So they've got no problem with sleeping all day
So don't tell a sleepy cat she can't sleep forever
Deny her a peaceful nap of free easy leisure
Or try to find a reason we need ever measure
Settling down on the ground
Oh sweet release from the pressure
Meow!
Now I know why I was born to die
I've been informed of forever
Now I know why I was born to die
I've been informed of forever
The birds haven't heard of forever
They'll sing as long as the song's sounding sweet
So don't tell your little bird it can't sing forever
And let it be not prisoner to kings and their treasure
How e'er many wicked words they may string together
Don't believe, just breathe
As long as the fowl's got the feathers
Tweet!
Now I know why I was born to die
I've been informed of forever
Now I know why I was born to die
I've been informed of forever
But you are your mother and your mother lives forever, ooh
And you know your mother, she won't want you sleeping forever, ooh
And I am your brother, you won't let me sleep forever, ooh
And you are my sister, I won't let you sleep forever, ooh
Never, no, never, no, never no sleeping forever
I said never, no, never, no, never no sleeping forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh
Forever, ooh4Embed
