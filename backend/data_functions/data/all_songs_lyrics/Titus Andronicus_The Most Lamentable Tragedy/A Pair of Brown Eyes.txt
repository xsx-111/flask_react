A Pair of Brown Eyes LyricsOne winter's evening stoned as hell
I sat there nearly lifeless
While an old man in the corner sang
"Where the Waterlilies Grow"
And on the jukebox Johnny sang
About a thing called love
And it's how are you kid and what's your name
And how would you bloody know?
In blood and death 'neath a screaming sky
I lay down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed then cursed
Then prayed and bled some more
But the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me
So a roving a roving a roving I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyes
I looked at him, he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While Ray and Philomena sang
Of my elusive dream
I heard the sounds that followed away
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me
I thought about a pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyes
So stoned as hell I left the place
Sometimes crawling sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing
So a roving a roving a roving I'll go
Roving a roving a roving I'll go
Roving a roving a roving I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyes
Roving a roving a roving I'll go
Roving a roving a roving I'll go
Roving a roving a roving I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyes
A pair of brown eyesEmbed
