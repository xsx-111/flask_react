Dimed Out Lyrics
I used to like walking with my eyes down
I'd sleep all day and fret away the night hours
But then I saw the sun and felt its light's power
And I found out the planet ain't no private house
Now I turn a brave bully to a shy coward
Make a loud lout silent as a quiet mouse
Then I make them hand over the white cloud
And then they're leaving me with a polite bow
And I've got plans I haven't time to write down
I'll incite a riot, fire flying all around
When I'm crying out, I'm howling with the wild hounds
Don't wanna buy an ounce
For me, the right amount is the entire pound

I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out

I don't chase after clocks or calendars
I bow down not to masters, gods, nor managers
Cause all the greatest artists, they were amateurs
Unembarrassed, dressed in only bandages
And I don't read rules or adhere to rituals
I'm an impatient underdog indivisible
And my challengers are talentless imbeciles
When my chalice is full, I am invincible
I don't listen to parents or priests or principals
Inconsiderate of little individuals
When they ration out their miniscule residuals
Shit by the fistful
As long as there's a law, I'll be a criminal
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out

I turned it up to four and couldn't feel it
I turned it up to five, it wasn't real yet
Turning it up to six wouldn't reveal it
Seven was a secret
Eight was reaching
Nine was decent, but

I really liked it when it dimed out
I only really like it when it's dimed out
I like, "like it" like it dimed out
I like it, like it, like it, like it dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
I only like it when it's dimed out
When it's dimed out, when it's dimed out, when it's dimed out
Whatever's inside, let it climb out
That was his plan and it's mine now5Embed
