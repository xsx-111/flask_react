Lookalike LyricsWho is this I see trying on my face?
I went to bed one night and he took my place
And now he's doing anything, trying to take me to outer space
But there's more on Earth than's dreamt of in your psychology
He don't act like me, but we lookalike
He don't act like me, but we lookalike
He don't act like me
He don't act like me
He don't act like me, but we look alike
We look alike
We look alike
We look alike
We look alike
We look alike
We look alike
We look alike1Embed
