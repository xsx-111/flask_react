Til I Say So
1] - I can tell that you're feelin' me
And from the corner of my eye
I see you checkin' me
But boy you better take it slow
Cuz you can't pass go, 'til I say so

When you made your move
I knew it was on
Tried to turn me out
With your looks and charm
Guess you thought that
You had this one won
You guessed it wrong
Cuz the game just begun
 - Do I look like I was born yesterday?
Better find another girl to play
I must admit your game was kinda slick
This time you met your match, I'm up on it

Wanna take some time
And feel things out
Stakes are high
And I got some doubts
Pressure's on
Things are touch and go
Should I raise it boy?
Or should I lay low?



Yo baby, you dangerous
You and your crew wanna hang with us?
Maybe, but you be actin' so shady
You done picked the wrong ladies
It's Keelay, T and AG
Baby, you feelin' that? (uh-huh)
You wanna bring it back? (uh-huh)
You ain't gettin' that
I'm sayin' though, no one goes 'til I say so
Take a step back and lay low
Little Women get them pesos, and stayed yo, whoa
You don't know? Now you do
I'm tellin' you stand off
I'm sorry, cut your plans off
Look all you want but hands off, uh
