Land of... LyricsMovement, outside, silence inside
Restless lover, spread your wings as the day begins
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
It's shining
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
Oh...
Learn to love your secret life, your still calm and gentle life
Your resolution comes too fast, now the night is past
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
It's shining
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
Ahhh...
Smiling, gliding, breathless, you're riding
Love is just a state of mind that we leave behind
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
It's shining
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
Chicka, chickaaahhh...
Let yourself go
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
It's shining
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
It's shining
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
It's shining
It's just the sun rising
It's just the sun rising
Life, life
Life, life
Life, life
Life, life
(Shining...)
Life, life
(Shining...)
It's just the sun rising
(Rising.)
It's rising...Embed
