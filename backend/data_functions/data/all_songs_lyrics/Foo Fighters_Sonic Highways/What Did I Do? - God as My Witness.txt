What Did I Do? / God as My Witness Lyrics"What Did I Do?"

There you go again, putting words into my mouth
This one's for you to know and for me to find out
All that troublin' you're on about
How you gonna know 'til you hear it out loud?

Stop, ask myself: "What did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?"
Go on, tell me now, what did I do?
What did I do to deserve you?

I heard every word
Coming from the thirteenth-floor
Your song came along
Heard the voices tell me
To "save yourself, oh, behave yourself"

I stop, ask myself: "What can I do?
What can I do to preserve you?"
Go on, tell me now, what can I do?
What can I do to conserve you?
Your name, urethane
I can see the writing on the wall
Come on, flip a coin
Bet it's gonna tell you
To "save yourself, oh, behave yourself"

Young man channelling
Know him by the "X" on his hand
You raised runaways
Singing at the gate
To "save yourself, oh, behave yourself"

So here I go again, putting words into your mouth
This one's for me to know and for you to find out
All that troublin' I'm on about
How you gonna know 'til you hear it out loud?
All your heroes, where are they now?
"God as My Witness"

I'm lost, deliver me
I crossed the river finally
God as my witness, yeah
It's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah
It's gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah
It's gonna heal my soul tonight

God as my witness, yeah
You're gonna heal my soul tonight
God as my witness, yeah
It's gonna heal my soul tonight5Embed
