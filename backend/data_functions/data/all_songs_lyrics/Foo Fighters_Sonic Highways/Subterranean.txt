Subterranean Lyrics
Nothing left within
I've been mined
To hell and back again
Subterranean
I've been digging in
Down inside
I will start again
Subterranean
But the truth is so unkind
What do you know
How low the sky?
Yeah the truth is so unkind
What do you know
How low the sky?

You might think you know me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

And you might think you own me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Bury my heart
Can I go this alone?
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Poison the sound, God in the stone
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Nothing left within
I've been mined
To hell and back again
Subterranean
I've been digging in
Down inside
I will start again
Subterranean
But the truth is so unkind
What do you know
How low the sky?

And you might think you own me
I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't
And I might think you love me
But I know damn well you don't
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Bring all your lies, leave them deep in the dirt
Oh no, oh no, you don't
Pull down my eyes, lay me deep in the earth
Oh no, oh no, you don't

Nothing left within
I've been mined
To hell and back again
Subterranean
I've been digging in
Down inside
I will start again
