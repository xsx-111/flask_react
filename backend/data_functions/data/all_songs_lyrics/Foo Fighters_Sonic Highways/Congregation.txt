Congregation Lyrics
And I met the seventh son
​He came for everyone
​The day he heard the lightning in the field
​I heard him clear his throat
​A fork within the road
​That night the Tallahatchie took the wheel

I’ve been throwin' knives
​To see just where they'll land
​Now, my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
​Open your eyes, step in the light
​A jukebox generation
​Just as you were

The voice upon the stage
​Is the heart inside a cage
​And it's singing like a bluebird in the round
​There’s mystery in this wood
​And ghosts within these roots
​That are tangled deep beneath this Southern Ground
I’ve been goin' through life
​Makin' foolish plans
​Now, my world is in your hands

Send in the congregation
​Open your eyes, step in the light
​A jukebox generation
​Just as you were, right?
Just as you were
Just as you were, alright!


And you need blind faith
​No false hope
No false hope
​Do you have blind faith?
​No false hope
No false hope
​Where is your blind faith?
​No false hope
No false hope
​Open your eyes
Open your eyes
​Step into the light
​
Open your eyes, step into the light
​The sound becomes congregation
A congregation
A congregation
Yeah
And they're singing like a bluebird in the round5Embed
