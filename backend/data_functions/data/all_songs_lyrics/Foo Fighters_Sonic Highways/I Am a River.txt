I Am a River Lyrics
There is a secret, I found a secret
Behind a SoHo door
There is a reason, I found a reason
Beneath the subway floor
I found the water, the devil's water
And walked along its shore
Is that what you want?

Your channel's changing, the heart is racing
From voices on the wire
The soul is yearning, the coal is burning
The ember starts a fire
Can we recover love for each other?
The measure of your life
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

A river, a river
A river running underground
A river, a river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
Is that what you want?
Is that what you really want?

I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river

I am a river
I, I, I am your river
I, I, I am a river
I, I, I am your river10Embed
