In the Clear Lyrics
There are days I might not make it
There are days I might start breaking
When the rain starts coming down as heavy as the air
You can find me dancing with the spirits in the square
Goddamn I swear

There are times I feel like giving in
There are times I begin to begin again
Look outside the world keeps spinning, like a paddle wheel
Rolling for the broken hearted waiting on the heal
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
There are places I don't remember
There are faces I don't remember
But how could I forget you, painting stars into the sky?
Coming like a rebirth, marching in a second line
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
And if I should drown
May this be the sound
To wash me out
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
You know I'm not
In the clear
You are not
In the clear
Don't you go count me out now dear
In the clear
