Country Figs Lyrics
A shadow is cast in my footsteps
I think about doing what's right
'Cause in my mind, I'm out of sight
But a man like me can't see you
Can't hold you for the night
'Cause I haven't been keeping my body tight
Still, I'll wager I'll come out swinging
Yeah, I'll wager I won't think twice
I'll roll the dice, honey
Ooh, ooh, ooh
That's right

The worst part about being homeless
Is waking up from a dirty wet dream
With a lap full of cum and a head full of steam
And I'm stuck here in the city
Where the people all speak like pigs
Don't need their pity, need my country figs
And I hear truck drivers singing
As they speed to a red light
No brake marks mean suicide, honey
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Got a cap full of temporary hair
I got a chest with a vacant heart
Got a skin full of piss and one last dart
And the memory of my woman
Passing by to call my name
Don't test me, girl, I've got torso pain
Ooh, I might just drive a car, best on the lot
I'll speed home, baby, show you what I got
And if you won't say yes, I'll full-tilt gain it
Right into the side of the Best and Less
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Said I'm stuck here in the city
Where the people all speak like pigs
Don't need their pity, need my country figs
And I'm stuck here in the city
Where the people all speak like pigs
Don't need their pity, need my country figs
And I'm stuck here in a city
Where the people all speak like pigs
Don't need their pity, need my country figs
And I'm stuck here in a city
Where the people all speak like pigs
Don't need their pity, need my country figsEmbed
