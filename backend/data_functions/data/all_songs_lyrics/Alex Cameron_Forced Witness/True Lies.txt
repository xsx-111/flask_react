True Lies Lyrics
Well, it's hard being a liar
I don't know who's supposed to be on my mind
'Cause I love my little darling
But I also love these women online

When I feel it really coming on strong
Yeah, I know I really shouldn't log on
Ooh, ooh, ooh

But there's this woman on the internet
She sends me pictures of her beautiful eyes
And I never get the sense to tell my girl the truth
I got the sense to tell some beautiful lies
Gonna love her with these beautiful lies

Well, what's the difference, darling
Between my eyelids and the glowing white screen
When either way, I'm thinking
Of the hottest barely legal age teens?

When I feel it really coming on strong
Yeah, I know I really shouldn't log on
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, there's this woman on the internet
She sends me pictures of her beautiful eyes
And I ain't telling no one 'bout the money I've sent
I don't care if they're just beautiful lies
Yeah, there's this woman on the Internet
Even if she's some Nigerian guy
Yeah, well, you should read the poetry he speaks to me
I don't care if they're just beautiful lies
Gonna love him with these beautiful lies

Beautiful, beautiful lies
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful Nigerian guy
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful lies
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful Nigerian guy
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful lies
Beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful Nigerian guy
