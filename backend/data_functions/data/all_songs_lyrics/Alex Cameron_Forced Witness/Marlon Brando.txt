Marlon Brando Lyrics
An angel, standing right there before my very eyes
A vision on the arm of another man
But baby, this should come as no surprise
And I wanna let him know what a pussy he is
And I wanna let her know that I bench what he is, but I won't
'Cause I heard him say something
And I can't seem to forget it and I want him to regret it

So I'll tell you something, sister, I'm feeling mighty fine
You tell that little faggot, "Call me 'faggot' one more time..."
Where I'm from, little darling, a king hit ain't a crime
When you see his face tomorrow, gonna wish that you were mine

Darling, I want you to know that I heard what he said
And that's okay, I'm pretty cooked, but my shit is far from dead
Well, I saw you last week and you looked real nice
Outside the super club, I was behind fluffy dice, and I know
That we only just met
But I think this is real and I want you to feel it

So tell me something, baby, tell me I ain't fine
I feel like Marlon Brando circa 1999
I'm on one, little darling, these pingers give me shine
You see me out here dancing, bet you wish that you were mine
And I know your friends are gonna talk about me
Saying I'm the one to blame
But that bloke should have kept quiet, baby
Why'd he go and speak my name?

Girl, I guess I just want you to be with me
I want you to say that my hair looks nice
And my face has a Beckham-like quality
And I know that I blew it and I know it ain't right
To be calling men faggots and to be starting fights
But I can't stop, I'm a dam overflowing
I'm a river run wild and I guess it's about that time

I feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel it, feel it
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel it, feel it
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel it, feel it
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel like Marlon Brando
Feel it, feel itEmbed
