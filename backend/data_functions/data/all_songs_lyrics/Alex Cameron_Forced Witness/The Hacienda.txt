The Hacienda Lyrics
A baby cries at the hacienda
A baby cries at the hacienda
You know they only stop when they want to, no surrender
Because they only stop when they want to at the hacienda

Countdown to diabetes at the hacienda
Countdown to diabetes at the hacienda
You know they don't even stop when they have to, no surrender
Because they only stop when they want to at the hacienda

I could write and tell you how I'm all blue
While I'm tangled up in sheets treatin' women to my pay-per-view
But then I wonder what good that'd do
These days, I do my cheating with this beautiful L.A. Jew

I needed some romancin'
So I went and had my ten-dollar crew
Now I'm lookin' at my baby
And she's lookin' like a ten-dollar view
And I ain't tasted pussy
Tasted half as sweet or sweeter than you
It's you
No moleste, por favor at the hacienda
"No moleste" on the door at the hacienda
And then he went till she was raw, baby, no surrender
Because they only stop when they want to at the hacienda

Maybe one day, you could send me some nudes
I could agitate myself to the memory of rolling with you
Still, I wonder what good that'd do
These days, I do my cheating with this beautiful L.A. Jew

I needed some romancin'
So I went and got my ten-dollar crew
Now I'm dancin' with my baby
And she's lookin' at the ten-dollar view
And I ain't missed a pussy
Like I missed the one that came out of you
It's you

No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloro
No mirame, cuando lloroEmbed
