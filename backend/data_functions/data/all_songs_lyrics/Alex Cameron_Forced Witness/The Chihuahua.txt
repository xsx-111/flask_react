The Chihuahua Lyrics
Our love was like a fire
Yeah, I pissed on it so I could sleep
Now I'm scrolling
Haven't counted casualties
With no sense of disillusion
No sense of profound tragedy
My rage is but a blinking satellite
Hurtling towards nothing

'Cause the pussy leaves town
When the boss ain't around for the feeding
Yeah, the pussy leaves town

Since you and me, baby
No place that I'm supposed to be
Yeah, the wind done changed and my face stuck still
Because heartache is for the ugly
And I get my satisfaction, baby
Got it streaming in 1080p
Across multi-tabs, I see sun-kissed flesh
I see no end to torture and misery

Chasing pussy online
'Cause the dog's feeling fine and he needs it
Chasin' 'ussy online
Love's a diabetic sweetness
Love's a fistful of bronze jewellery
Love's a dragon
Dressed all suede and leathery
Through the heartache comes a softness
But seen with such a true clarity
Yeah, the song is such a terrifying welcome
And I hope I don't get what's coming to me

Now the pussy leaves town
When she's not around, I don't need it
Now the pussy leaves town
Yeah, the pussy leaves town
When she's not around, God, I need it
Yeah, the pussy leaves town
Said the pussy leaves town
When she's not around, takes the pussy with her
Yeah, the pussy leaves town2Embed
