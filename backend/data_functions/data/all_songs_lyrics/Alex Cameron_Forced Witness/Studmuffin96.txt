Studmuffin96 Lyrics
With you, girl
Ain't no point looking at the liquor store
With you, girl
I find you looking for the cash in my top drawer
Yeah, but I keep my money in the bank, pussy in the bed
Liquor out of reach, put a bullet in my head
I'm no closer
And then I find myself thinking of you

And then you wanna talk dirty
In the middle of the night
While I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you

I'm waiting for my lover
She's almost seventeen
Surrounded by the visions
Of a thousand fantasies
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover
She's just gotta be eighteen
I'm waiting undercover
I'm kneeling at her feet
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover
With you, girl
Ain't no point queuing at the nightclub door
With you, girl
I sit here wondering what the hell I'm waiting for
Yeah, 'cause I keep my money in the bank, pussy in the bed
Liquor out of reach, put a bullet in my head
I'm no closer
Then I find myself thinking of you

And then you say you want to see me
But it just wouldn't be right
So I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you
I'm here waiting for you

I'm waiting for my lover
She's almost seventeen
Surrounded by the visions
Of a thousand fantasies
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover
She's just got to be eighteen
I'm waiting undercover
I'm kneeling at her feet
I'm waiting for my lover
I'm waiting for my lover2Embed
