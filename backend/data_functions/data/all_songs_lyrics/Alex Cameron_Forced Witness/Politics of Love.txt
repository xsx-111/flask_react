Politics of Love Lyrics
Here we are, hand in hand on the edge of the night
The thought of this being wrong never had crossed my mind
I've been doused, I've been drenched, I'm an earthly delight
I see a woman rollin' 'round in some scattered seed
And a man tryin' to fly two kites

Love taught me how to walk
It taught me how to talk
But it never taught me how to vote
The dream is gone and I can hardly stay afloat

You could ride in on a raven, baby
You could ride in on a dove
Makes no difference when you come 'round here
There ain't no politics in love
You could ride in on an eagle, baby
You could ride in on a rug
Makes no difference when you come 'round here
There ain't no politics in love

Who the hell put these locks on my garden gate?
I took a bite, but I swear, I did not consecrate
We got all that we need on this side anyway
On our muscle better cushions, drinking Cherry Breeze
We sleep naked and we sleep in late
'Cause the devil's in the deets
And the angel's in the sheets
While they're shredding the remaining votes
She said, "The dream is gone
And I can hardly stay afloat"

You could ride in on a raven, baby
You could ride in on a dove
Makes no difference when you come 'round here
There ain't no politics in love
You could ride in on an eagle, baby
You could ride in on a rug
Makes no difference when you come 'round here
There ain't no politics in love

Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do doo
Do do do do
Do do do do
Do do doo

You could ride in on a raven, baby
You could ride in on a dove
Makes no difference when you come 'round here
There ain't no politics in love
You could ride in on an eagle, baby
You could ride in on a rug
Makes no difference when you come around here
Makes no difference when you come around here
Makes no difference when you come around here
There ain't no politics
