Poison Godmachine Lyrics
The media machine knows what to do
It knows how to feed the poison to you
Useless information for your useless little lives
The TV lies and pacifies

Do you believe everything you see?
Children of the void, come follow me
Denounce your faith and penance
The savior is unseen
I am the new drug
Your poison godmachine... poison

Poison godmachine

"Poison" is a word
"God" is a word
Used for fear
For fear!


In subtlety, we obey
Through ink and broadcast wave
The doubts and fears
That shadow media decay
Deprogram this affliction
And the cathode ray unclean
I am the last nail
The empty, soulless screen... soulless

Poison godmachine

And we eat the poison
We created the poison godmachineEmbed
