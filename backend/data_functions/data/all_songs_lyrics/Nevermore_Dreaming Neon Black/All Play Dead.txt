All Play Dead Lyrics
You are the wine of intoxicating faith
You are the axis of time, I am so blind

Bear witness to freedom's fall
Tomorrow, kiss goodbye a little more
As they watch us all
All play dead

I'll sleep in this quiet room
Where no one sees
I'll play dead
All play dead

Play dead, never speak; just assign the blame
According to their game
And chase them down the drain
All play dead

I'll sleep in this quiet room
Where no one sees
I'll play dead
I'll just sit here quietly
And watch them feed
All play dead
All play dead

Bear witness to freedom's fall
Tomorrow, kiss goodbye a little more
As they watch us all
All play dead

I'll sleep in this quiet room
Where no one sees
I'll play dead
I'll just sit here quietly
And watch them feed
All play dead
All play dead

All play dead
All play dead
All play dead
All play deadEmbed
