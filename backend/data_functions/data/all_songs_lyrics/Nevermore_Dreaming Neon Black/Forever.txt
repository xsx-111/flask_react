Forever Lyrics
In this neon black gloom
I still see her face
She comes to me
Bringing darkest hour
I am forlorn
The pain is reborn

You are forever in my heart
You never died
You are forever
I still wonder where you are

I know you're dreaming
I know you're at peace
I'll meet you in the dreamtime
Whenever you call me
I'll go under
I'll swim through you

You are forever in my heart
You never died
You are forever
I still wonder where you are
I know you're dreaming neon blackEmbed
