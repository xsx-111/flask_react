No More Will Lyrics
No more will to live
I see the world fade
No more hope inside
My life means nothing anyway
Just shades of gray
I slip away again

Feed me from the heart of your denial
The velvet sleep is conviction only fools know

Dry your own eyes
I can't sympathize
Plague your own dreams
I won't be following

Free me from this sphere of confusion
These tears of dust
Are the tears from one who knows why

Dry your own eyes
I can't sympathize
Plague your own dreams
I won't be falling
Fly beyond the dreaming
Fly beyond our being
Turn and face the mirror
The answers come, clear as glass


Fly beyond the dreaming
Fly beyond our being
Turn and face the mirror
The answers come, clear as glass

I still feel you now
You are the falling rain
The voice that stills the pain
I am the lover gone insane
I must be strong
For love burns ever so longEmbed
