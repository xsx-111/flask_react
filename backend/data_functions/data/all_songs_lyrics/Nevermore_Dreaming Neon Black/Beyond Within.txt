Beyond Within Lyrics
Welcome millennium
The fall of planet hate
Welcome the end, my friend
All the world's the stage
Welcome to the future
The world is black, no turning
From the consequence of ignorance

Welcome to the fall

Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Welcome to the fall

Tension, delirium
Growing every day
Another suicide shocks the world again
I watch in apathy
Bleed until tomorrow
Whosoever does not believe in me

Welcome to the fall
Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Welcome to the fall

Can I bring you down again?
Can I make you feel? Again
Can I lift you up into the dreaming
Trip surreal? Again
Can I taste the future shock
Spit out all the games?
Do you know my name?
Do you know my number?
Cracking under strange constrictions
Mr. Ordinary Visionary


Welcome millennium
The fall of planet hate
Welcome the end, my friend
All the world's the stage
Welcome to the future
The world is black, no turning
From the consequence of ignorance
Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables
Beyond within, enact, enable
Create the past, nonexistent fables

Welcome to the fall of one man's sanityEmbed
