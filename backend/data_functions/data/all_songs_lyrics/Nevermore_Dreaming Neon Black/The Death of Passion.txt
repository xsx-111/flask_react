The Death of Passion Lyrics
I feel so hollow
I feel so hollow

You paint the sky in obsidian lies
And, come what may
Never will I know how you changed time
The riptide lies ahead
All my passions now are dead
I can see the path you never thought to follow

I feel so hollow
I feel so hollow

I stand before you, a shadow of a man
Behind these eyes
Self-destruction swims through my mind
I'm confusion and contempt
I am the void
You are the emptiness of black tomorrow

I feel so hollow

You paint the sky in obsidian lies
And, come what may
Never will I know how you changed time
The riptide lies ahead
All my passions now are dead
I can see the path you never thought to follow

I feel so hollow
I feel so hollow

You are diseased
I feel so hollow
You are deceiver
You are diseased
I feel so hollow
You are deceiverEmbed
