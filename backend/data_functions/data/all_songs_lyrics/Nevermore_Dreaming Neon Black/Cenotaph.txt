Cenotaph Lyrics
...She lies unknown
She lies unknown
She lies unknown...

Foreboding fear trickles down the spine
Into the pool, resonating
Behind the wall, the dreamer lies in velvet sleep
She must be still, never make a sound

Awake... awaken the dreamer
Awake... awaken
Awake... awaken the dreamer
Awake... where are you, my love?

We build our walls around our games
We decompose, dreamers never really die
She lies unknown, the cenotaph in her name

Awake... awaken the dreamer
Awake... awaken
Awake... awaken the dreamer
Awake... where are you, my love?
She lies unknown
(She must be still
The cenotaph is in her name
She must be still)
She lies unknown
(The cenotaph is in her name
She lies unknown
She must be still, never make a sound)
She lies unknown
(The cenotaph is in her name
The cenotaph in her name
The cenotaph in her name)
She lies unknown
(She must be still)
She hidesEmbed
