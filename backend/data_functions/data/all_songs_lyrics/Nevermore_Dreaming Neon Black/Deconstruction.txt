Deconstruction Lyrics
The fallen that dreams suicide
Takes the needle instead of the gun
The victim who self-crucifies can't realize
Christ is a weapon that chisels at our lives
Deconstruction
The martyr takes his aim
And wounds the holy man
And on the eighth day, God made the art of war
And, laughing, planned the end

Who will tend the garden
When the snake swallows the light?
Who will eat the decay
When the worms have lost their sight?
Who will rape the weak
When there's nothing left to gain?
Who will till the soil
Of these barren, black remains?

Deconstruction, deconstruction
Who will lick my wounds
When they take away my speech?
Will you stand in line
While the shepherd hunts his sheep?
Could you see tomorrow
If I took away your eyes?
Can you crawl from under
New-age prophecy's despise?

Deconstruction, deconstruction


Deconstruct my reality and let me slip away
I am the dog


Who will tend the garden
When the snake swallows the light?
Who will eat the decay
When the worms have lost their sight?
Who will rape the weak
When there's nothing left to gain?
Who will till the soil
Of these barren, black remains?
Deconstruction, deconstruction
Deconstruction, deconstruction

Our world is in deconstruction
Our world is in deconstruction
Our world is in deconstruction
Our world...Embed
