Dreaming Neon Black Lyrics
Sometimes when I'm alone, I still feel you
Your breath on my neck
You're still with me
And I'm still dreaming neon black

I wait for you
To taste your unknown world
The clock spins to new time
That must mean nothing

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown
(Swim through me)
Shifting, shaping currents flow in memory
(Swim through me)
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears
(Swim through me)
And wash away my innocence and fear

Sometimes, I wonder where you are
Can you feel my tears?
I never knew what changed you
Did they paint your dreams in pale shades?
I wait for you
You know you cannot hide
Division from within
Invalidates suffering

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown
(Swim through me)
Shifting, shaping currents flow in memory
(Swim through me)
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears
(Swim through me)
And wash away my innocence

I am a child of light living in your mind
The pain, the unknowing washes away in time
Until then, will you meet me
Whenever I call to you?

Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown
(Swim through me)
Shifting, shaping currents flow in memory
(Swim through me)
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears
(Swim through me)
And wash away my innocence
Meet me in the dreamtime water, drown
(Swim through me)
Shifting, shaping currents flow in memory
(Swim through me)
Meet me in the drowning pool of tears
(Swim through me)
And wash away my innocence
Meet me
(Swim through me)
My only cure, won't you meet me?
In the drowning pool of fate
The moon and the sun still wait
Yeah, won't you meet me?
I suffer silently for our love
The jester has lost his doveEmbed
