The Lotus Eaters Lyrics
A lie...
A lie...

We fall into the spaces blind
The puzzle so unkind
The lotus eaters fly
We watch the random pattern form
Insidious and cold
And bloom into the unknown

Please, God, why can't you hear us?
Please, God, why aren't you listening?

We take the hand of fate in vain
And wonder why your will
Seems cruel, controlled, and illogical
(Please, God, why?)
Do words fall on deaf ears?
Are we just too small?
Please make us understand

Please, God, why can't you hear us?
Please, God, why aren't you listening?
Please, God, why must we fear you?
Please, God, why did you take her away?

Please, God, why can't you hear us?
Please, God, why aren't you listening?
Please, God, why must we fear you?
Please, God, why did you take her away?

Are we your children?
Are we lost?Embed
