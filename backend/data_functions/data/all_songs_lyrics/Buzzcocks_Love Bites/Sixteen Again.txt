Sixteen Again Lyrics
Feeling like I'm almost 16 again
Layin' 'round, doing nothing like all my friends
Play it cool, don't get angry, count up to 10
Just like I was 16 again
No one gets the lowdown right from the start
Everybody gets the showdown, right from the heart
But that's all that's on the menu, and life's Ã  la carte
I don't know

Things in life are not played for keeps
If it makes you happy, it'll make you weep
And if you want some more practical advice
If you can't think once, then don't think twice
'cause things won't seem so nice
You'll wish you were 16 again, oh no

Feeling rather strange when you're 16 again
Things don't seem the same, the past is so plain
This future is our future, this time's not a game
The time you're 16 again
Always on your own when there's nobody else
Asking myself "Would I be someone else?"
But after all, life's only death's recompense
I don't know
Things in life are not played for keeps
If it makes you happy, it'll make you weep
And if you want some more practical advice
If you can't think once, then don't think twice
'cause things won't seem so nice
You'll wish you were 16 again, oh no


Look at me, here I am for your eyes
Mirrored proof of what you recognize
I know I never will feel quite like you
And I know you won't treat me right till I do
But at least we'll know it's true
That I'm 16 again, oh no

Feeling like I'm almost 16 again
Lazin' 'round, doing nothing like all my friends
Play it cool, don't get angry, count up to 10
Just like I was 16 again
Always on your own when there's nobody else
Asking myself "Would I be someone else?"
But after all, life's only death's recompense
I don't know
Look at me, here I am for your eyes (16 again)
Mirrored proof of love's suicide (16 again)
I know I never will feel quite like you (16 again)
And I know you won't treat me right till I do (16 again)
But at least we'll know it's true
That I'm 16 again, oh no (16 again)

16 again, 16 again1Embed
