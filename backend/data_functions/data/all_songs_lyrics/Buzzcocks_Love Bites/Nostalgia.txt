Nostalgia Lyrics
I bet that you love me like I love you
But I should know that gambling just don't pay
So I look up to the sky
And I wonder what it'll be like in days gone by
As I sit and bathe in the wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come
I always used to dream of the past
But like they say, yesterday never comes
Sometimes there's a song in my brain
And I feel that my heart knows the refrain
I guess it's just the music that brings on nostalgia for an age yet to come

Ah, nostalgia for an age yet to come
Nostalgia for an age yet to come

About the future, I only can reminisce
For what I've had is what I'll never get
And although this may sound strange
My future and my past are presently disarranged
And I'm surfing on a wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come
I look, I only see what I don't know
All that was strong, invincible, is slain
Takes more than sunshine to make everything fine
And I feel like I'm trapped in the middle of time
And this constant feeling of nostalgia for an age yet to come
Ah, nostalgia for an age yet to come

About the future, I only can reminisce
For what I've had is what I'll never get
And although this may sound strange
My future and my past are presently disarranged
And I'm surfing on a wave of nostalgia for an age yet to come
I look, I only see what I don't know
All that was strong, invincible, is slain
Takes more than sunshine to make everything fine
And I feel like I'm trapped in the middle of time
And this constant feeling of nostalgia for an age yet to come

Ah, nostalgia for an age yet to come

Nostalgia for an age yet to come
Nostalgia for an age yet to come1Embed
