Real World Lyrics
I'm in love with the real world
It's mutual, or so it seems
'cause only in the real world
Do things happen like they do in my dreams

Some of the rules may be different
But maybe they'll stay the same

In the real world, in the real world
In the real world, we both win when we play the same game

I'm in love with somebody
I wish somebody loved me too
You may wonder how this concerns you
Well, perhaps the somebody is you

I don't even know what your name is
But I just hope that you'll stay

In the real world, in the real world
In the real world, things happen this way

I'm in love with somebody
I wish somebody loved me too
You may wonder how this concerns you
Well, perhaps the somebody is you

I don't even know what your name is
But I just hope that you'll stay

In the real world, in the real world
In the real world, we both win when we play the same game
Hey, in the real world, in a real world
In the real world, by the way, what's your name?2Embed
