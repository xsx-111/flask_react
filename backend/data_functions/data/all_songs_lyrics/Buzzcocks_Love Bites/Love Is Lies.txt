Love Is Lies Lyrics
Well, I'm going out, I'm gonna find myself a lover
I'm gonna look until I drop, I'll never stop
I won't give up in any way, shape, or form
Well, I'm going out, I'm gonna find myself a girl
Take her out into the world, we'll learn to dance
We'll take a chance, we'll start romance all over again

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

Well, I'm going out, I'm gonna find myself someone
Going to see them just for fun, a love affair
But no one there, it's in my head, now it's all gone

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

A-wum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
A-wum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Well, I'm going out, I'm gonna find myself a girl
Take her out into the world, we'll learn to dance
We'll take a chance, we'll start romance all over again

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not cold as ice
But that's what that means to me

Wum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Wum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
A-wum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum
Bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum

Well, I'm going out, I'm gonna find myself someone
Going to see them just for fun, a love affair
But no one there, it's in my head, now it's all gone

Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not cold as ice
But that's what that means to me
Love is lies, love is eyes
Love is everything that's nice
Love is not cold as ice
But that's what that means to meEmbed
