Operators Manual Lyrics
Operators manual tells me what to do
When emotions blow a fuse, indicating blue
Operators manual tells me what to find
And how to make adjustments when you tamper with my mind

Oh, operators manual, I'd just fall apart without you
If only I had a mechanic, then somehow, I know I'd pull through

Operators manual, on page 63
Tells me what to do when you do these things to me

Oh, operators manual, I'd just fall apart without you
If only I had a mechanic, then somehow, I know I'd pull through

Operators manual tells me what to do
When emotions blow a fuse, and I'm feeling blue
Operators manual, on page sixty-three
Tells me what to do when you do these things to me

Oh, operators manual, I'd just fall apart without you
If only I had a mechanic, then somehow, I know I'd pull throughEmbed
