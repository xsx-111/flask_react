Nothing Left Lyrics
I'm on my own now, you've gone and left me
I bet you don't know how you've upset me

'cause I have nothing left at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, I have nothing left at all

Did you love me? I'd like to think so
But I was blameless, so why did you go?

'cause I have nothing left at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, I have nothing left at all

I've lost a lover, and I am certain
I'll get another, so why am I hurtin'?

'cause I have nothing left at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, I have nothing left at all

'cause I have nothing left at all, at all, at all, at all, at all, at all
At all, at all, I have nothing left at allEmbed
