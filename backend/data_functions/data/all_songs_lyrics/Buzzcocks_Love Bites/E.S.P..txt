E.S.P. Lyrics
Do you believe in E.S.P.?
I do, and I'm trying to get through to you
If you're picking up off me
Then you'll know just what to do, think

Brainwaves transmitted from my mind
Of a magnetic kind
I don't know what to do
If I can't get through to you, so think

Do you believe in E.S.P.?
I've been trying to get through to you
If you've been picking up off me
Then you'll know just what to do, don't you?Embed
