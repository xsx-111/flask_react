Seven Stars Lyrics(Peter Green)
Seven stars are in his hand
And he walks among seven lampstands
Holds a book with seven seals
At his throne where the angels kneal
Seven stars
Light seven lamps
Seven seals opened by the lamb
Seven horns
And seven eyes
Seven spirits from the skies
He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will surely see he
All the tribes of the earth will mourn
Even so the ones who pierced him
Seven horns the angels sound
Hail and fire at earth were thrown
Seven torches burning bright
Dry the rivers and darken the night
Thunder spoke in seven peals
There shall be delay no longer
Soon the mystery is revealed
By him who lives for ever
Solo
He is coming with the clouds
And every eye will surely see he
All the tribes of the earth will mourn
Even so the ones who pierced himEmbed
