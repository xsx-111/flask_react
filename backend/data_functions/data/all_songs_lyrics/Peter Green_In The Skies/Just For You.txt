Just For You LyricsIf you are the one to temp me
I am tempted
When it's my turn to speak out
I am empty
When love comes to me this way
I am blasted
Just to hear you say I love you
Is time passing
For you - just for you
For you - just for you
I could be awake all night
In confrontation
Just to hear you say
I'm your main station
There is no gift on earth
That I could give you
I find myself just longing
To be with you
For you - just for you
For you - just for you
I belong to no other
Just as long as you're around dear
No time can match the feeling
That I have found here
For you - just for youEmbed
