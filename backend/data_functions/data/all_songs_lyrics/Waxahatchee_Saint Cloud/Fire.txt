Fire Lyrics
That's what I wanted
It's not as if we cry a river, call it rain
West Memphis is on fire in the light of day
Give me something, it ain't enough
It ain't enough
I take it for granted
If I could love you unconditionally
I could iron out the edges of the darkest sky
For some of us, it ain't enough
It ain't enough

And I take off driving
Past places, been tainted
I put on a good show for you
And when I turn back around
Will you drain me back out?
Will you let me believe that I broke through?
Tomorrow could feel like a hundred years later
I'm wiser and slow and attuned
And I am down on my knees
I'm a bird in the trees
I can learn to see with a partial view
I can learn to be easy as I move in close to you
And that's what I wanted
It's not as if we cry a river, call it rain
West Memphis is on fire in the light of day
Give me something, it ain't enough
It ain't enough
I take it for granted
If I could love you unconditionally
I could iron out the edges of the darkest sky
For some of us, it ain't enough
It ain't enough (Oh)

(Oh)
(Oh)
(Oh)1Embed
