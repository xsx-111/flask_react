Oxbow LyricsBarna in white
Married the night
What dreams become concrete, they may feel trite
Makes a dull mind
Well, I'll give it all to you for a while, that's fine
A speck in the oxbow, depressing by design
If I go along with it, am I lying to you?
Watching from a distance, whispering close
About anything else
But it's not that far
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all, oh
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all, oh
I want it all
I want it all
I want it all, ohEmbed
