Hell Lyrics
Swallow my pride, it's mine to quell
I'll put you through hell, I'll put you through hell

I release a ramble of a sigh
You illuminate me as I galvanize
A flowery demise
I, well, I was never gonna survive
He's a fire burning fast and so, so bright
Taking back the night
It's a classic plight
Through vacillating eyes, he wants to have it all and who am I?

And I hover above like a deity
But you don't worship me, you don't worship me
Yeah, you strip the illusion, you did it well
I'll put you through hell, I'll put you through hell

I nurture the one track taking flight
Let it surround me like a starry night
Let it hypnotize
Puncturing the minds
Of those who canonize, a love that is so true, it never dies
And I hover above like a deity
But you don't worship me, you don't worship me
Yeah, you strip the illusion, you did it well
I'll put you through hell, I'll put you through hell

I'll put you through hell, I'll put you through hellEmbed
