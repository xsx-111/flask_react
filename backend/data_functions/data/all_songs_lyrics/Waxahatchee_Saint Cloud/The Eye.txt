The Eye Lyrics
I leave my home, desolate but not alone
I have a gift, I've been told, for seeing what’s there
And I will chase all the rain, put it down, call it paint
To possess something arcane, oh, it's a heavy weight

We leave love behind
Without a tear or a long goodbye
And as we wait for lightning to strike
We are enthralled by the calling of the eye

Oh, and one of these days you'll call up
You’ll give me something beautiful to think and sing and follow
Our feet don't ever touch the ground
Run ourselves ragged town to town
Chasing uncertainty around, a siren sound

Oh, and you watch me like I'm a jet stream
A scientific cryptogram lit up behind the sunbeam
You paint my body like a rose
A depth of beauty in repose
A complicated love you chose
Where love will land, nobody knows, nobody knows, nobody knows
And we both dig a grave
To immortalize all the shortest waves
We can try to let stillness be
But if I spin off, will you rescue me?
Or will I beg you to set me free?
I think what's wild might be meant to be
You and me


We leave love behind
Without a tear or a long goodbye
And as we wait for lightning to strike
We are enthralled by the calling of the eye
We come running, we always abide
Powerless against the calling of the eyeEmbed
