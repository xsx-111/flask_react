Right Thing / GDMFSOB (Clean Instrumental Version) Lyrics
This tape collection gets bigger every minute...
I find it very hard to fit the music to the mood. And there's nothing worse than to make the wrong choice. Except to sort right through and find nothing suitable

But then, I find
Just the right thing
But then, I find
Just the right thing
But then, I find
Just the right thing
But then, I find
Just the right thing
But then, I find
Just the right thing
But then, I find
Just the right thing
But then, I find
Just the right thing
Then, I find
Just the right thing
Then, I find
Just the right thing
The right thing
The right thing
The right thing
The right thing, thing, thing
The right thing
The right thing
The right thing
The-the-the right thing
The right thing
Just the right thing
The-the-the-the-the
Just the right thing
The right thing
The right thing
Right thing
Right
Right-right-right-right-right-right
(Pure energy!)

The purpose of this record...
Hold it!
Hold it!
Wawa-wah-wuh
Wawa-wah-wuh
Pure energy!
Pure energy!
Pu-pu-pure â€“ pure energy!Embed
