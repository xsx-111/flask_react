Sweetheart LyricsIf I was to stand in the General Election
Would you tell me about your close inspection
And how I never stood for detection
Or would you take another man?
If I told you I had the solution to starvation
All the nations would be their own salvation
And those that lead us lead us not into temptation
Or they pick another man?
Sweetheart, it's affecting me
Sweetheart, it's so effective
Sweetheart, do you detect in me
Sweetheart, a sacred sweetheart
If I told you about my plan would you believe me?
This is my body, my blood, would you receive me?
Or would you be the first to deceive me
And take another man?
If I told you that I'm not the man to worry
Would you believe me when I said I was really sorry?
Or would you rush off in a hurry
To take another man?
Sweetheart, disconnect from me
Sweetheart, you've got no respect for me
Sweetheart, it's affecting me
Sweetheart, my sacred sweetheart
And when you're troubled and when you're ill
You know I'll help, I always will
And when you're troubled and really down
You know I'll always be around
And when you're troubled and really broke
There is hope, there's hope, there's hope
Sweetheart, it's affecting me
Sweetheart, you've got no respect for me
Sweetheart, it's so effective
Sweetheart, my sacred sweetheart
Sweetheart, disconnect
Sweetheart, it's so effective
Sweetheart, it's affecting me
Sweetheart, my sacred sweetheart
Sweetheart
Sweetheart
