We Will Be Strong LyricsPity the fool
It's hard but he broke a rule
And that isn't done
Somehow, some day, brother will use a gun
Just walking the town
Just painting it sad
It's bringing me down
It's driving me mad
Woman is away from me
We will be strong
I know we have the strength to carry on
I know my rights from wrong
I know you've lost, I've won
We will be stronger
And getting stronger every day
Believe me when I say it
There is no other way to convey it
You clown
Your thoughtfulness has brought us down
And that isn't right
That we should walk alone on the streets at night
Just checking the time
Walking that very fine line
The humour is black
The plan is attack
Woman is away from me
We will be strong
I know we have the strength to carry on
I know my rights from wrong
I know you've lost, I've won
We will be stronger
And getting stronger every day
Believe me when I say it
There is no other way to convey it
No, no, no, no
Down on your luck
The shock it has struck
The weak ones will die
The questions are why, why?
Does anybody hear?
Does anybody understand?
Let me make it clear
Now's the time to take a stand
Now woman is away from me
We will be strong
I know we have the strength to carry on
I know my rights from wrong
I know you've lost, I've won
We will be stronger
And getting stronger every day
Believe me when I say it
There is no other way to convey it
We will be strong
I know we have the strength to carry on
I know my rights
I know you've lost, I've won
We will be strong
We will
We will be strong
We will be
We will be strong
We will
We will be strong
We will
We
We will
We
We will be
We
We will
We will be strong
We will be strongEmbed
