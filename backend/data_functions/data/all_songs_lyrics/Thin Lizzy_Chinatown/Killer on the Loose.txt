Killer on the Loose LyricsSome people they call me Jack
Some people they call me insane
I'm looking for somebody
And I don't even know her name
I might be looking for you
Wherever you may be
For there's something I've got to do to you, honey
And it's between you and me
Now you might think it's funny
Or maybe it's a joke
But you've got plenty of reason to worry, honey
'Cause you wouldn't stand a hope
There's a killer on the loose again
A killer on the loose
There's a killer on the loose again
A ladykiller on the loose
Now I'm not trying to be nasty
Or I'm not trying to make you scared
But there's a killer on the loose
Or haven't you heard
He'll be walking around this town
Just about midnight
Yes, that's Chinatown
That's right, that's right
Now you might think I'm messing
Or he don't exist
But, honey, I'm confessing
I'm a mad sexual rapist
There's a killer on the loose again
A killer on the loose
There's a killer on the loose again
A ladykiller on the loose
"I'll be standing in the shadows of love
Waiting for you
Don't unzip your zipper
'Cause you know I'm Jack the Ripper
Now don't wail, don't..."
There's a killer on the loose again
A killer on the loose
There's a killer on the loose again
A ladykiller on the loose
Standing in the shadows
Coming to get you
Standing in the shadows of love
Standing in the shadows of love
You better watch out
Play that back, check it backEmbed
