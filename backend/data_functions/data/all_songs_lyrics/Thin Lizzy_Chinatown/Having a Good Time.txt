Having a Good Time LyricsMe and my buddies, we're going to get drunk
We're going to go out on the town
We'll be checking it out, slipping it in
And stepping out of line
You know everybody likes to get a little crazy
In their own particular way
But my buddies and I, we go over the top
And we're going over again today
We'll be having a good time
Passing the byline
Having a good time
You know it's a rock and roll pastime
It might be typical, topical or maybe tropical
That doesn't mean anything
If you're political, practical
Then it's improbable that you'd do anything
But me and my buddies, we like to go crazy
We like to go over the hill
Hey, woman, will you be there
Because my buddies and I will
Having a good time
Passing the byline
We'll be having a good time
It's a rock and roll pastime
Hey, Snowy, play a bit for me
That was Snowy White
And he likes, er, it in the night
The next to play, I must say
Is Scott Gorham and away
We'll be having a good time
Passing the byline
Having a good time
It's a rock and roll pastime
Let's play that one more time
Hit me with that drum, Brian
Hit me as hard as you can
Oh yes, that's they way I like it
Do it again, do it again, let's do it again
Having a good time
Oh yes, I like this
Having a good time
Typical, topical, who cares?
Having a good time
Political, practical, impossible
Having a good time
Don't ask me why, Jack
Having a good time
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Having a good time
Having a wild time
Having a good time
I'm slipping on the inside
Having a good time
That's fine
Having a good time
Drinking Beaujolais
No, that doesn't rhyme
Having a good time
I'm just talking from the top of my head
Having a good time
To the bottom of your soulEmbed
