Dark of Night (Demo) LyricsIn the dark of night
Those small hours
Uncertain and anxious
I need to call you
Rooms full of strangers
Some call me friend
I wish you were by my side
In the dark of night
Those small hours
I drift away when I'm with you
Here comes the clown
His face is a wall
No window, no air at all
In the dark of night
Those faces they haunt me
I wish you were by my side
Well I wish you were by my sideEmbed
