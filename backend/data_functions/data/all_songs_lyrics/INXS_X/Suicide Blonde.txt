Suicide Blonde LyricsDon't you know what you're doing?
You've got a death wish

Suicide blonde, suicide blonde
Suicide blonde, suicide blonde
Suicide blonde was the colour of her hair
Like a cheap distraction
For a new affair
She knew it would finish
Before it began
Woah baby, you lost the plan
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
She stripped to the beat
But her clothes stay on
White light everywhere
But you can't see a thing
Such a squeeze
A mad, sad moment
Glory to you, glory to you, take me there
Oooo, take me there
Ow
Got some revelation put into your hands
Save you from your misery
Like rain across the land
Don't you see
The colour of deception
Turning your world around again
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
Say it:
You want to make
You want to make
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
You want to make
Ow
That's the story
Everything you wanna be
Everything you are, are
Mmmmm
Yeah
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
Yeah
Love
You want to make her
Suicide Blonde
Love devastation
Suicide Blonde
You want to make her2Embed
