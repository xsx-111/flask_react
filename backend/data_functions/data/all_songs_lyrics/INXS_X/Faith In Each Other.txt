Faith In Each Other LyricsAll the people
In this world
All the people
In this world
I gotta tell you it's alright
Look at the cover
Of a magazine
The pride of a nation
They're down on their knees
I gotta tell you
Let the people speak
I gotta tell you
Yeah, you got to have faith
In each other
All you ever, all you ever
Have for each other
They give us a reason
To go on living
It's all in the choices
That you have to make
I got to tell you
You better make them good
I got to tell you
All you got to have faith
In each other
All you ever
All you ever have for each other
All the people
In this world
All the people
In this whole wide world
I gotta tell you
Let the people speak
I got to tell you
All you got to have faith
In each other
All you ever
All you ever have for each other
Faith in each other
Faith in each otherEmbed
