Bitter Tears LyricsIn the mist
Of my endless search
The best in life
Becomes clear
The rest just begins
To fade by itself
That's a trick I learnt
Though it took so long
Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years
When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears
And I thought I was doing no wrong
No wrong
And I thought I was doing no wrong
No wrong
In the hour
Of your needs
Lips are trembling
'Cause your gonna be free
Realize what we're doing here
The time is right to kill your fears
Bitter tears taste so sweet
I'm seeing my way
For the first time in years
When the love around
Begins to suffer
And you can't find love
In one
In one another
Push away those bitter tears
Bitter tears
And I thought I was doing no wrong, wrong, yeah
Hey!
Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears
Push away those bitter tears, yeahow!
That's what they call doing no wrong
That's what they call doing no wrong
Push away those bitter tears, yeah
Push away those bitter tears
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)
Push away, push away those bitter tears
Uhhhh huh, yeah, hey
That's what they call doing no wrong2Embed
