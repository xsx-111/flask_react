Root Lyrics
To be forced under
I look unto your home because
We gave our eyes but no one will
Yes, I know, because

To heed the cause I will be barred
But you won't
We are here to love heart
He's up inside, we start to cry
Just because I will afford
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me there

To be judged by one or licked by three
And your holes enclose
We gave our eyes but no one will
Yes I know, because

To heed the cause I will be barred
But you won't
We are here to love heart
He's up inside, we start to cry
Just because I will afford
Living in me is so poor
Deliver me up
Cannot fuck to be me
And you won't find me
And you won't find me
And you will don't know me, psycho
I don't believe you will find me
And you won't find me
And you will so come from a psycho
I don't believe you will find me
And you won't find me
And you will don't quit, psycho
I don't believe you will find me
I'm in trouble because playing God

I and me, we go
With Jesus in a bowl of dirt

Yeah, yeah
So poor
I will fly1Embed
