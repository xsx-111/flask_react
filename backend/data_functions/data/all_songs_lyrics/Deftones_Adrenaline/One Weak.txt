One Weak Lyrics
Nerve, here I've born
Feeding on his lung
Verve is his curse
Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
Here, you're no good
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
We could be your god
There in my bones
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
But you will

But you will never find me, breach unborn
Never come here, watch me burn
Never, bitch, 'cause your scars show
Never will I burn

Under beneath the floor, before
His face, 'cause you're no good
We could have been like one
Bitch, you feel sore
We could be so flown
Misunderstood
Because he wanted to meet Christ alone
But you will
But you will never find me, breach unborn
Never, sit and watch me burn
Never, bitch, 'cause your scars show
Never will I burn
Will I burn
Will I burn
Will I burn

Beg, don't try and cross together
Beg, don't try and cross together
Beg, don't try and cross together
Beg, don't even waste your breath1Embed
