Lifter Lyrics
Watch me with your eyes
Been giving God a bit of fire
I want to be just like you
Then I'd be cool, maybe not, but
We left our eyes, big surprise
Kiss me goodbye, whore

Without you being here
I'll be giving fear a bit more
I wish I could feel like you
When I fuck like you, a bit sore, but
We left our eyes, big surprise
Kiss me goodbye

And make you more that you worked for
Every knuckle wiped into her
I know we're fucking monsters
I will never get what I want
(Inside of her)

And this gift of mine
Resing, restring, unwind
Eyes are closed
A part of me gets pissed
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets pissed
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets pissed
A part of me gets sore

And make you more that you worked for
Every knuckle wiped into her
I know we're fucking monsters
I will never get what I want
(Inside of her)

A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets inside of her
(Inside of her)
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets sore
A part of me gets sick
A part of me gets so fucking sick1Embed
