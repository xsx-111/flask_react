Nosebleed Lyrics
No mean no, lie now, then find what you get
You're no good
You sit around and throw a fucking fit
We are here, onto you
You're so far, you're fucking gone

You won't get to me
Until you cover me
I don't need this shit
'Til you cover me

No mean no, lie now, then find what you get
It's so good
You sit around and throw a fucking fit
We are here, onto you
Give me more, you fucking liar

You won't get to me
Until you cover me
I don't need this shit
Until you cover me
We are here, mother
In your fear with you
We could be perfect
In your world, I know
But I will come
I will come
And I will come
Go

I will come
I will come
And I will come
I will come
I will come
I will come
I will come

Disappear
Disappear
Disappear
Disappear

You won't get to me
Until you cover me
I don't need this shit
You fucking liar2Embed
