Fireal Lyrics
We are beggars for the lord
And I will meet you fourth floor
Then we'll make up, no

No fist to fucking save you from
No fist to fucking save you from
No fist to fucking save you from
You knock me out

I'll take the burden for the lord
And then when I'll be there, no
Do you think I care?

No fist to fucking save you from
No fist to fucking save you from
No fist to fucking save you from
You knock me out
No fist to fucking save you from
No fist to fucking save you from
No fist to fucking save you from

I'm going home
I'm going home
I'm going home
Everything felt good
Everything was right at first
When I was so curbed to know mad dog
Life before I would shine down un-shy
It comes from the first one I
While I watched you
Makes me sick, makes me die
I would shine
I want to be much, then more
While I watch you
Life before I would shine down un-shy
I want to be much, then more
While I watch you
Life before I would shine down un-shy
I want to be much, then more
While I watch you
I want to be much, then more
While I watch you
I want to be much more
While I watch you
I want to be much more
While I watch you
I much, much more while I watch you
I want to be much, then more
While I watch youEmbed
