Bored Lyrics
Hear me spit on you
Wither I remold into gold
And bury I from sun

Reborn, left to sigh
Recure, maybe I'll
Be born and simplify
The way I lie, before

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I'm bored

Revered by you
And trust to figure out
I burn that gift to you, doll
And let it shine before

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I wish for a real one
Fit and confide
Before me, or I
I will come clean, it gets worse
It's more

I get bored
I get bored
I get bored
I wish for a real one
I get bored!
I get bored!
I get bored!
I wish for a real one4Embed
