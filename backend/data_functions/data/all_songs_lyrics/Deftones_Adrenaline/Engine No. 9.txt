Engine No. 9 Lyrics
This ain't no motherfuckin' stick up
Just stick 'em, and watch 'em roll real close
Rollin' across my gat 'til it stacks, 'til they fuckin' done
Living off that curb, I think you fucked up
You have inbred, so why do you dig many in '93?
Been making them fools go down, bumping around me
You're right, you've seen 'em from underground
But you know that was the life that they've earned
On the beats, won't see, you fucking whore

Peer side whore, and mother she
Won't drain herself and won't become this kid
And live in a big world inside
Just because my time to (Wipe)
What the lyrical did (Did)
Because my time to (Wipe)
What the lyrical did (Did)
And cut the bullshit, bring it in
Because my time to (Wipe)
What the lyrical did (Did)
Because my time to (Wipe)
What the lyrical (Did)
Whatever, put that on
Get straight quickly
Making fools go down, bumping around me
You want to see from underground
'Cause no one else wants to watch when they burn
On the beats, come see, you fucking whore

Peer side whore, and mother she
Won't drain herself and won't become this kid
Just did what? Just did what? Just did what?
Just because my time to (Wipe)
Lyrical (Did)
Because my time's over (Wipe)
What the lyrical did (Did)
And cut the bullshit, bring it in
Because my time to (Wipe)
Lyrical (Did)
My time to (Wipe)
Lyrical (Did)
Big into the
(Wipe)
(Did)
(Wipe)
(Did)
I wanna
Cut it hard
My time (Wipe)
Lyrical (Did)
My time (Wipe)
Lyrical (Did)
Bring it in
Because my time to (Wipe)
What the lyrical (Did)
Damn it, fuck it (Wipe)
Because lyrical did
Big into the
