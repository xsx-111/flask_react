7 Words Lyrics
I'll never be the same, breaking decency
Don't be tree trunk, don't fall on my living roots
I've been humming too many words, got a weak self-esteem
That's been stomped away from every single dream
But it's something else that brought us peace
Keep it all inside 'til we feel we can't unleash
But I think that you made it up, I think that your mind is gone
I think you shouldn't have glorified, now you're wrong!

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck in my head!
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it, you bitch!

You and me are here alone
Face flat along the edge of the grass
But I'm not here to preach, I'm just sick of thugs
My parents made me strong to look up that glass
So why should I try? Act like I'm a little pissed off
With all that shit that needs to stay back in the shell
Your punk ass made it up, now your fuckin' mind is gone
Should've never glorified, now you're right!
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
They fuck in my head!
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it, you bitch!

Bitch, you don't know me
Shut up, you don't know me
Squeal like a pig when you
Pickpocket, big fuckin' head!

Well, I'll tell you about my blunt stack
What's coming back, Jack? We'll turn back
Curse, fighting their words, tell them that you fucking heard
I mean, they know that's what's coming, nigga, you quitter
I'm thinking about something naughty and won't tell anybody
So, thinking of me by now, but you go grab it
I'd like to think, for who I down this shit
I belong where they be
Because we cannot get back those lives
We exist to please, understand?
Love hates blacks, shades, and all the players
Mr. P.I.G., could I fuckin' see?
Shorty done crushed all of my brothers' dignity
And to the jury can't be no turn is all
My skin looks colored, does that mean I'm burnt?
'Cause your punk ass made it up, your fuckin' mind was gone
Should've never glorified, wrong!

Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck it!
They fuck in my head!
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, suck
Suck, suck, suck, you bad boy!7Embed
